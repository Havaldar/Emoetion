Going back to episode 11, I can only imagine how happy she was about [this moment](http://i.imgur.com/jfQrzRZ.png).
>> ARTICLE
Now every time I will hear [its song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg_rIdKoKbY) I'll feel equally sorrowful and happy. In a way that makes it especially beautiful.

Makes me wish I could have properly cried at the end. There's a certain catharsis in it, if that's the proper term.

Kaori's rueful smile. A life to the fullest should have been ahead of her. Damn it.

(They changed the colour of Kaori's clothes)

Definitely one of my favourite anime of all time. Beautiful story. Feelgatsu T_T
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the comparison! I can't believe I didn't notice that even after re-watching the episodes a week ago, to think that Kaori was right there the whole time.
>> ARTICLE
considering almost everything else are the same in the young emi crying scene except the color of kaori's clothes and emi's face, I wonder if the subtle changes are intended to show that in emi's mind that her bawling is more restrained and less embarrassing

and the color change from greyish in emi's to bright pink in kaori shows that from emi's point of view, kaori is just some random girl in the background and not important (dull coloring)

Guys.

GUYS.

I marathon'd this show up to the second last episode earlier this week.

I am now a trainwreck.

*But even if I die, I will never forget*
>> ARTICLE
I watched it the past 3 days and the final episode came out 12 hours after i caught up. I've been crying for 3 days straight!

>> ARTICLE
i'm going to start the marathon tomorrow .. i guess im gonna need a towel instead of some tissues.

>> ARTICLE
Once I've stopped crying (eventually) I think I am going to try the whole series as a marathon. Sometimes without the week gap between episodes its even better (or worse).
>> ARTICLE
I did tear up and almost cried.

Although, it was pretty clear that she's going to a better place, i supposed that takes the edge off things...

I feel proud for Kousei. I feel happy for all of them. Kousei, for getting back on his feet. Kaori, for persisting till the very end. Tsubaki, for finally telling him her true feelings.

I have no idea how Watari feels. Having to live with a lie. Having to deceive your friend.

Oh well. I think this show does better when marathoned.

It's been an honour watching Shigatsu with you all.

Idk whether I should watch Saekano. It feels rude to enjoy myself after watching the last episode of Shigatsu. Meh, it's 0420 anyway. I should cry myself to sleep.
>> ARTICLE
I just started this morning with episode 1 (rewatch 1-21) and ended up with 22 as it released now. Even though I knew the ending, it still hit me hard. It was a great Anime which made me happy but also sad at the same time. I don't know how you guys feel, but I had to cry a few times. I was an emotional wreck after few episodes in the past few weeks but I've no regrets. Imo it's one of the best Animes 2015 so far even though it has some shortcomings.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I could rewatch any episode of this without crying now. Holy shit.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah any re-watch is going to be undertaken alone, away from anyone who will hear the crying that will definitely happen.

The music really set the mood in the series. 

Especially with all the [beautiful visuals](http://i.imgur.com/1T9jHQ6.jpg) mixed in. They really did a fantastic job with the art for this show.

Beautiful, beautiful way to end the series.

That piano/violin duet was just magnificent, and I liked how she never said a word during it, nor when she disappeared. It was painful to watch, but really amazing.

I was able to hold it in them tears, but those last lines of the letter when she was saying "sorry" for all the stuff she did...I lost it right there. I thought I drained my tears during Shirobako, but I guess I still had tanks of 'em left.

Well, I have nothing special to say except this:

>Don't forget, guys. If you cried, if you were at all moved by this show, don't forget it. Take it with you. Please remember that you aren't alone, that you can be there for someone else when they're hurt. Remember the connections you make with the people around you can give color to your life and bring color into the lives of those around you.

>We're all going to be a Kousei sometimes. We're all going to be a Kaori others. Values those moments, those chances, those *people*.

>If you can do that, you'll have made this just another show you watched. You can make it a gift to the world, through yourself.

Dudes. I honestly thought I would keep it together. But that letter has absolutely obliterated my tear ducts. I've never cried this hard over anything on TV, Film, Video Games, etc. And I wasn't as in love with Kaori as Kousei. (S.S. Tsubaki here) But they did it. They flooded myself and /r/anime down the god damned river. 

That song was absolutely breathtaking. The visuals were stunning, the dialogue was on point and the score even moreso. I will miss this series with all my heart. This series reminded me of myself in so many ways whether it'd be the mother relationship, Friend A, being a musician. All of it was so warm and nurturing but at the same time callous and malicious while still having a heart. (I feel like there's something contradictory in that paragraph) Shigatsu wa Kimo no Uso/Your Lie in April will never leave my heart. I will never forget it, it reached me and I will never "hit reset." From my tear stained eyes, keyboard/mouse, and monitor to my broken/healing heart. To all of the people who have stuck with it I say thank you for the laughs, tears, and hugs. I will never forget it.

I already knew the ending because of the manga, thought I would be able to hold it in because of that

God, this show.

Like Kaori, the day I met Erin will forever be etched into my mind. I'll remember what she wore, where she sat, how she had her hair, how she smelled.

Like Kaori, she came into my life like a hurricane. Her humor and wit, her energy, her love pushed me to be all I could. She never accepted excuses and helped me to accomplish things I only dreamed of.

Like Kaori, she was artsy and cute. She would get stupidly excited when she heard the Tuba, her lifelong instrument, on the TV or in a movie. She also loved sweets, although Gummy Bears (ick!) were her sugar of choice. She ate so many sweets, but didn't gain weight. She loved crafts and made me hand written letters. 

Like Kaori, we had many sweet and bittersweet memories together. The night we ate caviar and danced to a violin quartet. Telling my religious father her tattoo was a prison tattoo the first time she met him. Crying together in the hospital about the bleak future. 

Like Kaori, we made plans we knew we would never do. Star-gazing. Learning to Salsa dance. Having house parties. Remodeling the bath. It helped us feel normal to make plans, knowing we would never see them happen.

Like Kaori, she was so, so brave when facing the future. She never gave up, she never complained, she never lamented her illness, she never became bitter. And she did the risky operation to see if we could buy some more precious time together.

And like Kaori, her illness claimed her all too early. Our friends and family held us up and supported us as her hosptial stay grew longer and longer. And after it was clear she was not making it, they helped us throw an impromptu wedding. 

And now, like Kousei, I face a spring without her.

I still love you, Erin. You remain in my heart. And you always will.



Thanks for hearing my story, /r/anime. It's been therapeutic. Love to you all.

Didn't really get bothered watching this episode, but reading this made my chest quiver. My condolences for your loss.

I've been looking for a place to share my story, and a reply to yours seems fitting.

In a previous life, I was a studied clarinet performance. I dropped out after a year of college, because I wasn't mature enough to handle the stress.  Five years later, end up working in a dining hall at the university in my hometown, haven't touched my clarinet since dropping out.

I met this girl.  She was a regular in my line.  I started talking to her after she wore a Sailor Venus costume for Halloween.  Eventually I find out she's a music major, studying horn performance.

I get an email from the clarinet professor; he's got a guest artist coming in who wants to have a clarinet choir play on his recital, and he wants to know if I'm interested.  My decision to accept, and to subsequently become more involved with the musicians, was almost purely motivated by a desire to have a reason to hang out with her.

Of course, music for horn and clarinet isn't exactly common.  There's a couple duets if you hunt for them, but it's not exactly Beethoven quality.  So, I get a bright idea.  Let's make a woodwind quintet! (For those who don't know, a woodwind quintet consists of flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon.  Don't ask why the horn is in the woodwind quintet; we don't know either) All we need are the other three instruments and we're good.

I have a friend from my short stint in university who's an oboist.  He knew a guy who plays bassoon.  My roommate's girlfriend was a flutist, and a music tech student with access to the recording studio.  Done.  Let's do this!

We're all massive nerds, so we're arranging video game music and recording it.  It's a blast.  Playing with my closest friends is probably the greatest feeling in the world.

Good Friday.  I remember the day because I had a church gig.  The student orchestra was playing Mahler 1.  I really wanted to go, but hey, the church literally wants to pay me to play, and I can't really turn that down.

On her way to the concert, another driver ran a four-way stop sign and hit her on the driver's side.  She survived, but she had a bad concussion.  That was almost a year ago, and the doctors say she still shouldn't play.  She's taken a whole year off school at this point. She'll be able to play again eventually, it's just a matter of time.  

Still, it's hard.  I had the opportunity to play with the orchestra this past semester, but without her, it wasn't the same.  We used to meet up and practice at the same time, but it's meaningless if she can't practice.  I can't even imagine what she must be going through.  When I stopped playing, it was out of choice.  She wants to play, but can't.  It must be awful for her.

When I watch Shigatsu, I can't help but put us in the story.  Suddenly it's not something that's I'm watching, it's describing our lives and our relationship.  It's an incredibly powerful thing to experience.  I was more or less fine when watching the ending last night, but right now I'm a wreck of emotions.

Goodnight Kaori, you can stop struggling now....


So that was the lie. The "I love you" in the letter were hard to hear, since he'll never get to reciprocate. Truly a lie that proved to have worked. I'm sad, but at the same time happy Kaori was able to live her life to the fullest. 


I just feel awful for Kousei. It's a spring that comes without her, and that cannot be stopped. The theme of time has been used throughout the series, but it's that line that stands out. Whereas Tsubaki wants her time to progress and Kaori wanted time to stop, Kousei doesn't get a say in the matter one way or another. And it is a good symbol of the series as a whole. Despite all the pain and hardship in Kousei, and by extension our own lives, everything keeps going forward and we have to as well.

He'll never get to reciprocate, but I take heart in the fact that Kaori had to know he loved her. If anything, this episode was her finally reciprocating the 'I love you' things he's been sending all series long.

This was the first time I've seen the railroad red-light, no cross symbol used in such a uplifting manner.

Like you said, right, forward we go.

[Being Kousei is suffering.](http://i.imgur.com/muJtivM.jpg) It's been an enjoyable watch and overall has satisfied my classical music fetish, I enjoyed watching Kousei grow as a musician too.

what's this about an alternate ending OVA? so the what if scenario of Kaori surviving the surgery? though such an ending wouldn't be as fitting, would still be happy to see that to mend my heart

Well we've known for a while now that an OVA would be coming out later this year but they recently had a campaign that promised a miracle after a certain number of tweets was reached. They made their goals and since there was nothing shown in this episode I can only assume it'll be present in the OVA. Whether that's an alternate ending or something else, who knows.

It got me right at the very end when Kaori's letter said I love you. That was it for me. Welled up pretty hard.

I've checked out the manga and it seems to be adapted perfectly. The piano sequence was beautiful in every way, especially as it was the only way for him to say goodbye to her - Kaori succeeded in getting him back to his piano better than ever, thankfully, and I'm sure Arima will dedicated pieces to her once he's worldwide famous; I'll be watching it again soon when I'm not as anxious to see what finally happens, so I can appreciate it better as I love the meaning behind it, and A-1 Pictures were on top form with the animation. I loved how they made her look so happy plucking the strings when Chopin's Ballade 1 picked up, and how Arima went from rejecting to accepting of Kaori's death as he played. The more I think about the last episode, the more I love it, it's perfectly bittersweet.

I'm upset that Arima and Kaori never properly got to say goodbye, be together or play a final song together, though I like that nothing was drawn out - the surgery failed, Kaori died. It's sad but that felt very human to me. Her final letter and the photo were fantastic though, overall a great, emotional episode and a fitting farewell.

Overall I'm happy to give the series a 10/10, and I look forward to the manga localisation starting next month! 
>> ARTICLE
*"You don't have to live forever, you just have to live."*

I write this as I wipe tears away from my face: **Thank you, Kaori Miyazono**. For showing us that a short life can also be a full life. Kaori took the little time she had left and did what she wanted to do, and accomplished the goals she set out for herself. She finally met the one person she wanted to meet her entire life, and fell in love. She broke down the walls and forced her way into his life. And in doing so, she pulled that particular pianist out from darkest depths and back into the light of center stage. Her character epitomizes the capabilities of human compassion and empathy. See? Stuff like this can happen. Yeah, she told a lie. Sometimes she was selfish. But doesn't everybody get to be once in a while?

The ending was done perfectly. It felt real, there was no deus ex machina pulled or miracle happening- this was it. The reality felt by the characters of this show is the same many have to face every day, and the creators did not shy away from that. What a ride. I'll be feeling this one for a while, the PADS here is real.

Kousei will live on and continue to play music. And every time he does he will remember Kaori and the love they shared for one another. And I'm happy for Tsubaki, she will continue to be together with the person that means the most to her. 

Like Kousei, the lessons of this show will stick with me forever. Thank you to all of those involved. It was a masterpiece.

10/10. Bravo. Well done.

Wow. What a ride.

An absolutely beautiful ending to an equally beautiful story. I honestly don't know how to feel right now. A medley of emotions: distraught, content, sorrowful, and happy, all at once.

To the episode itself: wow. Wow. The piano duet scene, and the utter silence between the two; they both knew that she wouldn't be coming out alive. The feelings pouring out of Kousei's playing... The mirage of Kaori moving him... I was in tears from beginning to end. Kaori's note was incredibly touching, and the final "I love you." was very moving. I haven't felt such a connection with two characters in a long time.

As much as I wanted a happily-ever-after ending, I'm very... content with how the story ended. Any other way would have been a cop-out, and I applaud the author for such a moving story.

I came in expecting a lot of tears and emotional trauma. I don't know that I escaped with something so negligible. When I wish to be reminded that I'm human, I know what show I will turn to.

This is a story that will live in my heart for a long time.

The art during the duet was amazing. The fact that they didn't have any speech during it made the scene all the more enticing to watch.

I think I can honestly say that piano performance was one of my favorite scenes from this whole season.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this show definitely benefits from marathoning, and it's a shame I didn't watch it that way.

That said, the way her death was handled was incredibly beautiful. The biggest problem I had with Your Lie was that sometimes the drama felt forced and over the top, but the violin performance to signify Kaori's death was VERY well done. Honestly, everything about this episode was stunningly beautiful, and this was one of the most poignant and successful uses of music to move a story I've seen in anime. I'm not lying when I say I teared up when she brought the violin out.

Nonetheless, I am conflicted as to where this show sits. On the one hand it was gorgeous, had a great soundtrack, and the ending was phenomenal, but I had a lot of qualms with some of the tactics used to move the story forward, and overall the pacing could use some work. That's largely why I feel this *needs* to be marathoned rather than watched weekly; I found that it took a third of the episode to just get myself back in the mood and remember where the story was at most of the time. Still, it is definitely the standout two cour anime ending this season.

I think my only issue is with Watari....So watari. Total bro. But the issue is everyone had development and moved forward with their life. Everyone had a "happy" ending but what about Watari? If anything, he's the tragedy of this series. Kousei moved on and matured, and realized his love was reciprocated. Kaori got to have the time of her life since she knew she had so little time left, Tsubaki finally got to say the words she wanted to and become even closer to Kousei, hell even Aiza and Emi moved forward facing themselves and the Kousei they deified. Seo fixed the mistake she made so long ago and avoided repeating it, Aiza's little sister? Little glasses dude with brown hair? They all moved up with purpose in life and new realizations. But Watari....he honestly loved Kaori, it was obvious in the last scene of him in the classroom, and this whole time that Kousei thought he was friend a? It was watari. Now he has to live with that lie for the rest of his life: that the girl he loved actual liked him back, that he stole the spotlight from his best friend who could have had something with her, that he got nothing from the girl he loved despite having to act the part, and now he's back where he started....a side character just hoping to win another football tournament in high school.
>> ARTICLE
You could tell that he knew what what up with some of the scenes with him and Kousei. Apparently in the manga it was a lot more obvious that he was part of the plan. And I think we all knew she liked Kousei too.  Watari was a player though so ultimately he cant feel too badly about it.  Who knows, maybe it'll inspire the change in him that you want to see.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly? I think that he realized what he was doing, by messing around with lots of girls, really hurts them when he lies. After all, that's exactly what Kaori did to him, and he genuinely liked her but couldn't stay serious at all. This, on top of the fact that he realized that Arima and Kaori loved each other, but he was quite literally standing in their way due to the lie. I think that he finally regrets his actions and will do something to change.

[Winter](http://i.imgur.com/E59tMAs.png) turns into [Spring](http://i.imgur.com/vxBH1Cq.png)

I liked him seeing [the cat](http://i.imgur.com/R8CbamN.png) as a sign of new beginnings
>> ARTICLE
I thought they showed the cat as her and it went along with the lines about how he met her in spring and will be without her the next spring, when the cat is no longer there after the train goes by.
>> ARTICLE
Here how I see this. The cat always represents the same thing: glimpses of relief, freedom, hope, happiness always in sight,but out of grab, vanishing. And thus we have three cats: 

1) Childhood: When Kousei sees the piano as a way to make her mother feel better; the cat is chased out or killed before the concert where his mother hits him.

2) That Spring and Winter: It's the focal point of the manga, the evolution of Kousei as a human with Kaori as a catalysis; the cat dies just when all hope for Kaori is ~~apparently~~ lost.

3) The renewal: Kousei is now able to walk by himself, he sees and ears the world in full bloom, life is only beginning with all the gang and music; the cat is clear in sight, but he is neither far nor near, and we move on, from sight to sight.
>> ARTICLE
Oh Kaori, you left the same way you came into the story: brashly and full of color, completely stealing the show.

I have to admit that I just smiled through the entire letter. When I read the manga I was definitely quite distraught, but I thought the studio did an awesome job rearranging things here and there that made a sad ending a truly sweet one. 

P.S. Kashiwagi MVP

side note: speaking of stories about young kids dealing with loss I just finished Dennou Coil. I thought it did an awesome job portraying realistic unforced feels.

"I love you." What an absolutely brilliant anime. The overlaying of Kaori's surgery with Kousei's playing was excellent and after making us all so emotional every time something went even slightly wrong they managed to handle Kaori's death with such elegance. Her letter to Kousei was perfect too. We finally got to see what the lie actually was. One of, if not my favorite anime of the season.

Alright guys. We're done. It's over. Grab your empty bowl of popcorn. Throw away those emptied boxes of tissues, clean those pools of tears. Everything. 

It's been an enjoyable ride. I don't know why but... I think I might be dead inside. Not because of this. I used to say it's because Clannad took everything away from me already but... There are quite a lot of things that happened today and... I'm still not rolling on the floor crying like a bitch. 

I might want to rewatch this shit one day. And fix myself before that. 

I enjoyed this episode and the ride as a whole though. To think I wanted to watch this just because I saw the teaser and how gorgeous everything was... I surely did not expect such a heavy amount of... well, feels. 

For the first time in a long time, the music in an anime actually got to me. The first half was breath taking. I was just so poetic and romantic. Right up my alley. I'm a sucker for that and as an inspiring and procrastinating composer, I was moved by Ksei's performance. 

It also ended the way I expected. I couldn't ask for better. 

It's been a fun ride guys. I hope we'll have a ride as good as this one next season. 

Until then, take care of yourself, and don't make sure not to regret anything in your life, you magnificent bastards!

I had to put it on the 50 inch in the living room so I can capture the beauty of the show.. AND OMFG IT DID! The part with Kaori and kousie playing just marvelous. I was so moved had the surround sound on full blast along with my tear ducts. Hold me
>> ARTICLE
As a pianist, myself,  *Your Life in April* has proved to me just how much the power of music is capable of uniting people together not just in the cliche cultural and global way, but in the microcosm.  I'm so happy Kaori brought color and care to Kousei's life through her music, and through her carefree way of life in every aspect, in her waning seasons alive.  Getting the opportunity to live through this anime has taught me to pursue my music not "just as the score states" but to play music frivolously in my own style.  Unlike other animes, I'm happy I got to watch this week-by-week, as it gave me a chance to reflect on the show's themes as they were being presented over the course of these months.  It gave me a chance to let these themes really sink in and apply to my own musical career.  There's so much i could talk about, but you guys are already doing such a good job.  Thanks *Your Life In April* for such an amazing life, and what love to hold to it.

There it is the ending to what is now one of my favorite anime series of all time. 

I will definitely be buying the manga as it gets released in English starting next month but I really want the anime to get licensed and get a Blu-ray release here. I really need to own the series so I hope to see some good news on that soon.

I remember when I first started watching this I was like

"Gross, why are they drawing the lips like that."

I literally turned off the series but came a back an hour later and fell in love with this series. Personally this is my new favorite Romantic Comedy/Coming of Age story. In my books it tops both "Toradora" and "Golden Time", two series that I enjoyed a lot, but "Your Lie in April" takes the cake.
>> ARTICLE
I don't usually write posts, but i had to do it once for this show.

This show was beautiful. One of these show you can't forget. I can't even describe how this ending gave me feels. Thursday will fell empty now without Shigatsu. And yeah i did cry when Arima read the letter, but i'm not the only one i guess.

But man, feels went all the way through my heart :'(
>> ARTICLE
First, I gotta say they adapted this pretty well, and I'm glad, for a moment I thought they were going to change the ending, it would be a real lame cop-out if they ended things on a boringly happy note.

I really like how the death was handled in this last episode. It focused exactly Arima's growth as a character in the end. The differences between his acceptance of his moms death and Kaori's death are amazing. 

Also "I love you. I love you. I love you" god that hit right in the feels.

Great way to end a great show.

That final performance was phenomenal. It was probably one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in an anime. 

Kaoris letter was also great though I did feel bad for Watari. He was in love with Kaori just as much as Kosei was but she completely blew him off. It was a sour spot in what was otherwise a very touching letter. 

Overall while the show had it's issues I feel like most of them were pretty minor and what it did well it did them really really well. 

**9/10** this show is gonna stick with me for a long time. 
>> ARTICLE
What a powerful end to a incredibly moving series. When the bow finally hit Kaori's violin my heart jumped. That final duet together was more touching than any real goodbye could ever have been. Expressed more than any letter ever could. It was unforgettable and made a point of letting us know that even though Kaori wasn't there physically, her music lives on in Kousei. 
Watari gonna Watari. I feel for him, he seemed to acknowledge he was just a means to an end but went along with it happily because it meant Kousei would have to stand up for what he wanted.
Tsubaki as the guardian angel is really the icing on the cake. Right when he needs it most, Tsubaki affirms that Kousei is not alone and never will be if she has anything to do with it. Who knows, maybe their love will blossom in the spring?
Standing ovation.

>> ARTICLE
Well I cried...a lot. 

We all knew she was probably going to die but that letter was what really made me tear up. The confession and the fact that she cared for Arima for so long has me still tearing up.

I think this show is in my top 5 now. Everything about it was so magical: The characters, the art, the music especially. I knew that Kaori wouldn't live but the way that presented her death was very well done. Kousei's final "performance" with her was absolutely the best part of the series. This performance was supposed to decide what high school he would go to right? The characters are definitely wise for their age. I wish we had a little more closure about Kousei's future but otherwise a fantastic ending to a fantastic show.

Such a beautiful ending. It really impressed me. The performance was so well directed. They managed to show all the progress Kousei has made in the series without losing focus of his distress over Kaori. I absolutely loved the way they handled her death. Kaori playing along with him and then slowly fading away was a perfect way interweave her death into his performance. We never even had to see her die or any one cry for her. No over-dramatization, no manipulative writing, not even much of a funeral scene. We can see Kousei's pain while he's playing and we can feel it throughout the whole episode. That's all we need. Great visual story-telling! While very impactful, her death was treated almost subtly. This is exactly how a drama series should aim to handle tragedy.

On a happier note, I love the way they draw the little kids in the show. They are so god damn cute.

hey mods can this go under the "[CRY EVRYTIM](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/recommendations#wiki_cry_evrytim)" section of recommendations?

SEND HELP! DROWNING IN TEARS.

I wish the show had chickened out. I wish Kaori had lived. But I guess it just wasn't meant to be.  For as long as the show hinted at her demise, I thought there would be a twist ending to save her, but I guess sometimes best girl just has to die.  

This episode's art was INCREDIBLE.  I'd say about 80% of the frames in this episode could make a fantastic wallpaper.  Standouts to me were the piano animation (dat budget) and basically any scene involving Kaori.  The one that literally ripped my heart out was when her face crumbles away after she finishes playing violin.  I had to look away from the screen I was so physically affected by it.

Man, I feel really bad for Watari. Kaori just completely dismissed him. I thought that was kind of harsh. She completely used him to get close to Kousei.  Also, just a note to hopeless romantics out there. Tell the person you love, that you love them BEFORE you die.  Don't write a letter just after they leave your hospital bed. Tell them.

All in all, this show was excellent.  An incredible ride. I thought it slowed down a bit in the second half, but it was still compelling.

I guess we can take away one thing from this misery.  BEST FRIEND TSUBAKI WON! FLAWLESS VICTORY!

My thoughts. 

The most tragic thing is not that Arima never told Kaori that he loved her; it was that Kaori never knew that Arima loved her (Arima = Charlie Brown; Kaori = Marcie). The entire time you want Arima to confess his feelings, but it was Kaori who should have confessed. 

The entire time Kaori felt what she was doing was selfish. She felt guilty the entire time for forcing her fantasy onto Arima and everyone with little regaurd to them. 

Everytime kaori got sad/angry was when either her fantasy of arima didn't match with reality or when it matched exactly with what she fantasized about. 


If she had told the truth; everything would have been better. Arima would still have gone back to the piano and Tsubaki would still have realized her feelings for Arima. The problem the entire series was more Kaori's fault then Arima; but because we saw the entire show from Arima's POV; it felt like it was armia who was being a coward. 

The echildhood picture. The fact that in the end that Kaori was as imprtant to Arima as Arima was to Kaori. 

This anime showed that when people are at their most selfish; they are also the most loved. 
>> ARTICLE
I love this show soo much but, i had the bad decision in watching it 5 mins before i go to work. I cant stop crying of how beautiful of an ending that was.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pleasantly surprised the feels train didn't hit me too hard. It's not as I don't find the ending fitting. I just like how everyone seems to live on without having forcefully surpressing their negative feelings and being able to live on in peace. Although I would have liked Kaori to gain a few months through her operation she died in peace and that's all that matters.

The ride is finally over. A-1 Pictures did a satisfying adaptation. Now I have to wonder that the content of the OVA bundled with the manga volume 11 will be.

Copying what I said on the manga finale that was translated earlier this week:

>This ~~manga~~ anime has been one hell of a ride for me. I'm pretty big into the emotional pull music can have on a person, and this ~~manga~~ anime just really struck a cord with me (I'm really glad the anime has kept up with the emotion for me, the music has been fantastic). It may be about people too young to be experiencing most of the things they felt, it may be a "cliche" topic, but god damn, was it done well. I actually really liked the comedy aspect as well, because I think it would've just been too much drama if it wasn't there. I really hope the mangaka continues to make wonderful stories like this.

>Also, I'll really be looking forward to the OVA that's bundled with the last volume of the manga, since they left a few things out and I'd like to see "what happens next" in Kousei's life.
>> ARTICLE
Damn. I cried like a little bitch; I managed to hold out until the Kousei started reading the letter.

This one is going down on my history book, for sure. Beautiful story with beautiful characters on a beautiful romance that begun thanks to beautiful music, ending in the most beautiful way; it can't really get any better than that. Kaori broke my heart.

Holy shit. This is my first anime that I watched while it was airing, and I can't even describe how I feel at the moment.

The duet scene, the letter, everything...

This is the most beautiful anime that I've ever watched.

I am speechless. That was beautiful. Thank you all for making this experience even better with all the discussion.

Rest In Peace, Kaori-chan.

Absolutely beautiful. One of the best stories and emotional rides I ever experienced, anime or otherwise. Cried like a man baby for this entire episode and most of the others in the series. I will not forget this amazing show for a very long time. Instantly jumps into my top 2 anime right behind Steins;Gate. A perfect ending to a perfect show.

Jesus Christ. My heart.

I loved how they used the first ending song when the letter is being read.

The words are extremely fitting, especially

> Even if I look back, I know youre not there
> 
> Nevertheless, I feel like I heard you call my name again, and I try looking around

And right when she confesses,

> It was your hands that I wanted to hold
>
> It was those hands that seemed to convey anything and everything from how they gripped mine
> 
> Its not anybody elseit has to be you

Without that song I don't think the scene would be as powerful as it did.

I love this show but gahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the experience Shigatsu :)

I was holding it in pretty well during the time when Kaori appeared and performed with Kosei, but when he started reading the letter, i couldn't hold it in anymore and i just bawled xD. What destroyed was that Kaori also idolized Kosei back when they were still kids and that her dream of Kosei playing for her was already granted back in the earlier episodes.

Although i know i don't post that much, let me just say that Shigatsu has become one of favorite anime's, (it also helps that i'm a music person as well :D) and no matter what happens, I will never forget.
>> ARTICLE
my heart stings a little bit. Definitely the saddest ending I've ever watched. The entire emotional ride was just so flawless. I really need to do this show justice and buy it the day it comes out.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't cried since watching anime Anohana but damn it  this was a perfect series. This ending really broke me.
>> ARTICLE
I was going to give the series a 7 before this last episode, and decided that, depending on the ending, it could either go up to an 8 or down to a 6. The ending tied the series together beautifully and I honestly think that, if Kaori lived, the series would have been much, much less enjoyable as a work of art. The ending leaves us with just enough mystery about the character's futures that I'm actually interested in reading the manga now, but still manages to tie together most of the main plot points pretty well. My favorite part of this episode was how, after Kousei's performance, the audience's reaction and the results of the competition are not revealed, and it just has a time skip to the aftermath of Kaori's death. I'm not sure if this was intended, but by not showing the aftermath of the competition, I felt like the show made me feel a bit of what Kousei was feeling: the emptiness he felt after losing Kaori. The romance between Kousei and Kaori hadn't interested me that much, but I actually was really looking forward to how the writers would handle his results in the competition, so I was anticipating the audience's reactions to his performance the entire episode. Although I was disappointed that the results weren't shown, it actually made me appreciate the show more by making me feel what Kousei felt. It didn't matter what the results of the competition were to Kousei because his performance wasn't about the competition, it was for Kaori. The revealing of Kaori's "lie" and what it was also pleasantly surprised me in the way they did it. Overall, I thought the show was decent (overly cheesy at times), though nowhere near as good as everyone hyped it up to be (I kept comparing it to Nodame Cantabile, which I enjoyed significantly more for its more mature outlook on life), and I thought this was a great last episode. 8/10

I was wondering how the ending letter would work in the anime... damn it worked much better then i expected. I knew the last piano scene was going to be amazing, but I wasnt sure about the letter, but they pretty much nailed it.

Wonderful ending to a wonderful series, it had a few faults but overall a great ride


>> ARTICLE
This series is easily one of my favrets. I started watching it when it had 12 episodes aired and marathoned it all in a night. I clearly knew that this was a anime that I was going to enjoy and started looking forward to the new episodes and I got to say it was worth it. The ending was majestic. The whole piano scene and the music was a really nice way to show what had just happened. Then the letter hit me right in the feels and left my thoughts just scattering everywhere. Even now, I'm so much in aw that I have probably rewrote this about 6 times because of the randomness I had written.

Here's the piece that Kousei plays in the last episode.

Seeing all these comments is just making me sad again. Kaori's death was so tastefully and beautifully done.

Kaori's death is infinitely more powerful, touching, and painful, than any death in anime like "Akame ga Kill" or "Blood Plus", or shows like "Game of Thrones". I felt so attached to her character, I can't even begin to explain why her single death is more impacting than the deaths of a hundred no names, or in the case of Akame, every main character in the show. I guess it starts at the fact that this anime is realistic, the way it handles the character's reactions to Kaori deteriorating throughout the course of the show, everyone knew something wasn't right with her the whole time, and it steadily got worse. The way everyone clung to her, hoping beyond what was reasonable that she would be able to fight her illness and survive against the odds. It was such a real story, it happens every day. And I know I balled my eyes out this whole episode, and would again if/when I watch it again.
>> ARTICLE
Hey guys I just started getting into anime and I always felt like I was missing something. People have recommended that I watch the big animes such as Ghost in the Shell, Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, etc, but they were always missing something. After watching Shigatsu, I realized what anime is really about. Watching Kaori and Kousei go through so much has given me a new perspective in life. To keep striving and no matter what and strive to be great. Growing up I was always a loser but one thing I loved was playing the piano. Although I was forced to take lessons from the age of 4, I secretly enjoyed every second of it because music is something that changes us. After 10 years of dedicated playing I decided to quit because I felt like I wasn't playing up to the level of my masters. One of the most important things this anime reminded me is why I started playing music. It is because I wanted to hear the crowd cheer and praise the music that I have played. Also I always wanted my music to reach other people. After finishing this anime it is time I make a change in my life. Starting tomorrow I am going to give my life to music again. I will start relearning everything and start to train for the Tokyo National Championships. Please everyone who reads this please support me and hopefully one day my music can reach you guys. And on a final note TSM!

I know this thread is a few days old now, but I've been going through this entire series recently and I wanted to share my thoughts.

At first I thought it was a bit melodramatic, and of course it's all based on students like so much other anime, which is a trope I've started to get bored of. I didn't honestly think I'd get that into it.

However, by about episode 10 I was surprised to find myself incredibly enthralled by it, watching with sincere bated breath during suspenseful moments.

And now, at the very end, I cried. As hard as it is for me to do so, I sobbed unabashedly.

This story was beautiful, sad, and now it's over. How bittersweet.
>> ARTICLE
Well I bawled for an hour or so ... and that .. that was the most beautiful anime's I've seen in a long time. Great in every way. I can't believe it's over, but WOW what a perfect ending.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso really is a masterpiece. Soul touching, heart wrenching, and beautifully crafted story.

When Kousei was constantly saying, "reach her!" all I could think was...*"but you already did reach Kaori, so many years ago."*

Anime of the year for me. It's going to have to be something special to displace this show. It may have felt dragged out at times, but some of those moments are just so pure. This anime really does touch the heart(manga was good as well).

Newest 10/10 in a long time. Everything with this anime was just amazing! I wish I could just erase it from my mind and marathon it in a day.

wow.. I was trying my best not to shed a tear as I was reading through her message to kousei.. I just couldn't.. more tears started to flow and I kept telling to myself "it's just an anime.. nothing more..." and then suddenly my conscious popped up and said "it's about the message" and I just started tearing up..
>> ARTICLE
This show has easily become one of my favorites. Its been a great journey.
>> ARTICLE
This was the first and only time I have shed an actual tear for a character, regardless whether it be a book, and movie, or an anime.

This series is truly a one of a kind.

goddamnit kaori..
>> ARTICLE
This show is easily in my top 5 favorite shows ever watched. I have no regrets about it even if I destroyed me at the end.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck. I wasn't ready for that.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I pretty much cried my eyes out the whole episode despite having read the manga already.

I was really hoping the Anime might change the ending--especially with that Twitter thing, but I should've known better.

When I feel slightly less destroyed, I'd like to go back over the Manga and compare at some point, but it'll probably be a while. 

I think the Anime did a better job with the duet, but I think some parts of the letter were better mentioned in the Manga (Such as "in love" over crazy when describing Tsubaki's feelings and the whole thing with Watari [which was ](/s "actually him trying to kiss her and not the... weird two-timing thing which makes it sound like they were dating where it was more that any real advances Watari actually tried, Kaori shook them off because she didn't like him in that way.") I felt a little bad for Watari (it still stinks to be told someone likes you when they don't), but I don't feel he was too hurt considering he pretty much loved any pretty girl he saw (and technically kind of had a girlfriend). I can't remember too many of the other details off the top of my head though.

Kaori getting so excited to run and tell her parents about wanting to play the violin and falling on her face was really cute though.

I'm sure that there may be some better animes out there but i just love this one. My favourite anime of all time

The tears wont stop coming. This was so fucking beautiful. I can't even express all the emotions this show has made me feel. Just beautiful.

Time for 2 weeks of drepression because it's over. 10/10 Anime. Even if I wanted badly to see a happy ending, this ending was as good as it could have been. I will miss this Anime. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
So this was probably the most memorable rollercoaster I've ridden. So many flowing emotions watching this show, and the 'miracle' of Kaori and Kousei playing again together was so beautiful as soon as it happened I broke down. This is definitely something I will binge watch all over again in the future... maybe even like a month from now because I wouldn't get bored watching it over again.

Goodbye friends, it's been a great ride.

[You guys, i never cry but ..](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbx90t0aG41qcma0g.gif)
But the scene at the grave yard where the Kaori's father thanks Arima for making her life such a full one broke my heart. I get that they are trying to cope with the loss but she was 14 years old she probably couldn't experience half of what life has to offer when you think about it, the first anime that got me so emotional. This god damn rain in my room.
>> ARTICLE
My heart, It hurts. I never knew I would get this reaction. I was so gung-ho about Tsubaki, but this hit me just as hard. I feel so empty now. Kaori was such a great character. In fact all the characters were great. Such a great series with amazing music and animation. This might have now become one of my favorites now. Next month will be a sad month. [Also](/s "was that basically Tsubaki's confession at the end? I kinda wish I could see something like all the characters in a few years as well as poor Watari's reaction and how he deals with it")
>> ARTICLE
holy shit.... open the flood gates. 
>> ARTICLE
Had the whole episode just been them playing music together, I wouldn't have minded it one bit. The music in this show truely was fantastic, easily one of the best music-themed anime out there.  
The ending was expected, but still hit very hard. The letter especially was heart-wrenching, as was the scene with Tsubaki kicking Kousei.

Overall a really great show, definitely one of the best of this/last season.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Haven't felt this empty since finishing Clannad AS. Still can't describe how beautiful and great this show truly was and what the lie really was. How they inserted wacci (ED1) in the last few scenes was just great as well. Kind of wished that the show was 24 episodes instead of 22. Now I'm wondering what they possibly could have changed through the twitter thing they did a while back. 

For the manga readers, was there anything different between the anime and and the manga in the chapters that the last episode adapted?

I knew it was coming. From so early on. That didn't mean that it hurt any less. That didn't I could keep myself from crying.

This was beautiful. The perfect ending. I'm just so sad that it's over. I want more. No, I need more. Why did it have to end? It wouldn't have been as perfect if it didn't end this way, yet I don't want it to end, at all. So conflicted. 

I know there's an OVA coming, but that's just not gonna be the same. Also, that's not nearly enough. I like these characters. I like the music. Where's my classical music education going to come from now? I want to know what happens afterwards! Please?

...

:( 10/10. Venting over. I guess I'll go to bed and be depressed for a little while. 
>> ARTICLE
A beautifully animated and sounding bitter-sweet ending, fitting for a beautifully written story that will forever have a spot in my heart. Fridays and Mondays (when the manga used to come out) are going to feel like they're missing something for a while for sure. Guess we are the same as Kosei. We won't forget as long as we live!

P.S. So glad the guy that posted the thread about the anime original ending was wrong. It just wouldn't feel right chickening out this hard, as much as I love Kaori it would just feel unsatisfying..
>> ARTICLE
Well, I only cried 3 times during that episode.

But seriously, what a perfect ending to an amazing show. I did not expect it to be this good when I first started watching.

Absolutely beautiful.

Does anyone have any advice on how to make these tears stop? 
This was such a beautiful story. All the emotions that it brings up inside you, it makes the story that much more magnificent.

I..I... T-T   

The entire first half was so perfect. 11/10 The music was perfect, and the animation was much less visually dynamic but all the more intense. It was cathartic after so much from the past episodes. I only broke down once we got to that excellently-edited flash-back sequence.

I made the mistake of watching this before my english class. I might consequently end up writing my in-class essay about this show because it's all i can think about now haha :'(

I have to go to my 3 hour ethics course soon and I just finished this episode. Might break down in tears mid class.
>> ARTICLE
It's strange, Clannad had me bawling like a baby, but I just thought the ending of this anime was beautiful. Not beautiful in that someone passed away, but how that passing was handled. Kousei will miss her, but now he has the strength to keep going and play his heart out on the piano.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that's a strange reaction at all. They basically made us mourn her while she was alive. They didn't show her death, or even the mourning of any of the characters. They just moved on to celebrating her life, which is what the show ultimately was about.
>> ARTICLE
Someone hit me in the head, I want to forget about episode 22.
>> ARTICLE
Not as much of an emotional wreck as I thought I would be. I suppose it's due to all the death flags being raised throughout the series. 

Still, fantastic, wonderful, beautiful experience. Only sad thing about this is that it ended. Wish we could have spent more time getting to know all the characters.

The way they played their final duet was fantastic. I cannot imagine a better last episode for this series to take. This is one of the best ending episodes I've ever seen. My tears wont stop!

currently can't see the keyboard what with all the tears
>> ARTICLE
THAT MUSIC! I can't stop appreciating the simplicity of the score used this time around. The mature and somber take on the ED sung by the male soloist at the end was especially heart-wrenching for me, as well as the female solist+guitar with the same ED song. Those were the highlights for me. The rest of the episode was handled with care and affection, which many anime in this genre tend to screw up, but not this show. Like [bamboebos](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2zm4zl/spoilers_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_episode_22_final/cpk9ka7) has mentiond, anticlimatic can be good at times, and this conclusion has certainly proved that rule true. 

Kayori won't be forgotten, at least, by me. 

Thanks for the ride /r/anime! Let's see what the OVA churns up. Until then, I will be thinking about this show as well as anticipating the release of FSN Part II.

Well, it happened. 

Actually glad she didn't magically survive, as weird and cruel as that sounds because sometimes stuff like this does happen.  The ending itself was fulfilling though.

I didn't know what happened one minute i was okay, and then the next the tears were flowing like waterfalls

What a great show.

I love the narrative style of this last episode. One song, one letter, end.

I feel like the anime is the true version of this story. I read the manga ending, but considering the prevalence of color and music throughout, the manga simply cannot compare. Especially the ending. Although they were essentially the same, a panel cannot convey the same feelings that a prolonged look at someone's face can. Also, it paces the ending really well, whereas I may have rushed through it and not done it justice. Absolutely beautiful. It's amazing how they managed to remain funny yet moving until the very ending. One of the best I've seen.

>> ARTICLE
I'm honestly surprised by how much I loved this show. I thought it'd be boring, but it quickly became my favorite show for the last 2 seasons and maybe even in my top 10 anime. I saw the ending coming from weeks ago, but it was still delivered in such an absolutely beautiful way that I don't even mind. Definitely on my rewatch list, and definitely an anime that I will never forget.
>> ARTICLE
That last performance visually felt like the musical equivalent to Neon Genesis Evangelion's final episode, but even more beautiful. 


Other than that, well all I have are tears now. So, so many tears. I cried for the second half of the episode, and now the last 5 or so minutes. I need to watch something happy NOW! I need another adult to hold all these tears.

That was perfect.  I couldn't have asked for more.

They really pulled out all the stops with the animation this episode.

The reading of Kaori's letter was masterfully done. Brilliant show, one the greatest in recent years IMO. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like if you have an appreciation for classical music and the power behind the stories the composers tried to tie into their pieces you develop a different type of love for this show. I found it so beautiful how they used the pieces to amplify the story and especially amazing with that last piece. The uniqueness behind Chopin's work (specifically the third stage in his op 25 no 5), how that connects with Kaori (Kaori = unique artist, Chopin = unique composer) then the way the pace quickens to a close as he comes to terms with life. Just beautiful

This final episode, and this anime overall, was beautiful. I'm actually really surprised and impressed that it did end as expected; without Kaori miraculously surviving in a cliche way. Strangely, I don't really feel that sad about the ending; I feel more content, or just somber/sober, since we all knew for most of this season and the previous season that this would happen and even though it is tragic that Kaori had to go, there's more of a sense of resolution and acceptance to it than a sense of tragedy - there was no other way it was going to end. The only really heart-breaking part about it that stings afterwards is the revelation behind Kaori being inspired to be a musician by Kousei and the 'lie' being arranged so that she would meet him in the beginning. 

What a masterful ending to a masterful anime; I don't even feel like I want any more of this anime because this ending is so conclusive in its simplicity, so I have no idea what the upcoming OVA will possibly be like.

I saw a gif on this subreddit of the show about a week or less ago.

I went from saying, "Oh, that art style looks cool. I'll give it a shot!" to crying at the Final Episode in just a few days.

This show was such a beautiful roller coaster.

Easily my favorite series this quarter. Previous quarter had good stuff as well, but this winter season nothing beats Uso. Going on my list of classics, once my eyes stop leaking.

Usually I'm not the one who writes much but this time i just can't let it end without a couple of words: Now what is there to say? Nothing much i guess, just that it was beautiful from the start to where we are now. This anime had everything and i don't think it should have ended in another way as it did. It was an amazing journey with u guys and i look foward to all there is to come:)

I would say I'm definitely gonna buy this anime in blue ray when it available in my country.

This anime had the one of the best art, awesome soundtrack and logical yet perfect story.

The theme of living through hardship and trying to find the joy in life is absolutely wonderful in Shigatsu.  Initially, I thought this was solely on Kousei. Piano had brought him much joy but also considerable hardship and strife. Tormented by his misery, when Kaori stepped into his life in spring, he was not only enchanted by her, but she also served as the catalyst to face his inner demons head on and to revive his love of piano. 

But it was even more beautiful knowing that it was not just one sided. In the end, it wasn't just about Kousei's personal struggles but also Kaori's - of whom faced the prospect of dying. And as much as Kaori had an effect on his life, he had a profound effect on hers - he just didn't know it. 

She was happy until the end by living life to the fullest. And though she didn't confess her feelings for him until she passed away (partly because of her caring of others), her love opened up a whole world for him; the sound of the piano; the presence of others in his life; and the possibility of joy and happiness. 

What a complex but also sweet portrayal of love. 
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful in every respect.
>> ARTICLE
One of the most moving anime I have watched in a very long time.  It was superb.
>> ARTICLE
The visuals during their duet was just so beautiful - paralleling when the OP switched from day to night was really a nice touch.  

Tears wouldn't stop flowing once that arrangement of the 1st ED started and then they had to use the acoustic version of the 2nd ED too.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely amazing, felt that they really nailed the ending. I felt that having the piano playing at the beginning and then transitioning into the duet was just amazing and the tone as kaori just disappears in front of him changing the sounds was perfectly in sync. 

The sequence of events after this perfectly tied the show together and really gave viewers a closure, knowing how badly kaori wanted to be with kousei. The letter being read by Kaori with the responses of kousei just flooded my eyes with tears.

Definitely one of the greatest animes I've seen in a long time!

Hands down my favorite anime of all time, a roller coaster of emotions and a true master piece, I'm thankful that I took the time to watch this and didn't speed through it. The progressive week-to-week build-up made it that much better. Thank you Aniplex, Dentsu, A-1 Pictures, Kodansha, Fuji TV, Aniplex of America.

My friend and I had to make egg salad sandwiches to eat as we watched it. *Had to*.

God I'm so happy I watched this series, it's really unlike anything I've personally seen (though obviously I know there's a lot of music-oriented anime out there but this is the first one I actually watched) and definitely one of the most emotional. Wish it wasn't owned by fucking Aniplex so I wouldn't have to pay my firstborn child to legally own it, but man I'm tempted to.

One of the hardest things about the surgery/solo scene was when they showed Kaori's heart rate the second time, and it had dropped 10 bpm :[
>> ARTICLE
I thought being in love meant never having to say you're sorry?

Not a bad finish. Some great visuals, music was good. Toning down the inner monologues a bit would have been more to my taste. The final revelation is satisfactory, but for me, doesn't really sum up anything more than as being an interesting conceit. 

I still have an issue with CR's audio, everything just sounds a bit too flat and suppressed compared to other websites. 

Still, my second favorite show of the season (behind Parasyte: the Maxim).

Top 5 anime for me. Oh my god. I'm so fucking depressed. Just got home from my birthday fun and watched this buzzed. 

This is the most beautiful anime ever. I was so hoping Kaori survived but I knew...

That feeling of love only to know it's physically gone forever and never hear those words from your loves mouth is the most painful thing ever. 
>> ARTICLE
Can I say what we're all thinking? Cancer sucks. Cancer utterly ruins lives, beautiful lives. It snuffs out the brightest lights.

This anime was beautiful, not just the animation which was beautiful in it's own right, but the story, the characters, the music, the reality of it all. I knew from the very beginning that Kaori wasn't likely to survive, there was a part of me that hoped beyond hope that I would be wrong, but I always knew. Once it became clear she had cancer, and kept getting compared to Kousei's mother it was obvious what was going to happen. Then there was the surgery scene, the moment I noticed that her heart rate dropped a few points before switching to Kousei's playing, I knew, and so did he, he knew she wasn't going to make it through the surgery, and his playing despite that knowledge was so elegant and breathtaking. The pianist and violinist they got to do the music are simply brilliant, Sakata Tomoki, Shinohara Yuuna, Kawachi Eriko, I salute you.

Definitely one of the top 5's in my book

Call the ambulance, because my chest won't stop hurting and call the police while you're at it because ninjas won't stop chopping onions.

I never cried this much over anime, the void left by this masterpiece can never be filled. 

So long Shigatsu Thursdays ....

I've never cried a river since I finished Heavenly Forest (Tada Kimi wo Aishiteru) back on November 2013. I watched the anime because I saw my friend's post about the, "But it doesn't matter, I was playing Friend A" and thought, "Hmm, this anime might be a good romance anime". And I wasn't disappointed, the Tsubaki and Kousei ship, the Kousei and Kaori ship, the Kousei and Nagi ship everything... I loved it, especially this last episode where the "I love you" from Kaori made my eyes sweat really really hard... It wasn't the romance that I was expecting but I got what I came for, the feels.

I read the manga first before watching the second half of the anime. I cried and cried by re-reading the last two chapters over and over again but I really cried by watching the last episode with music playing on the background. I love music, but I wasn't really interested on classical music, but this anime changed, not only mine but, our perspective of classical music. Where it can feature the feelings of the one playing it... Okay i'll stop here I can't type anything anymore... brb still crying

11/10 imo ;-;

I'm usually a lurker, but this was the first anime I ever watched. My friend told me to start watching anime, and she told me to watch this. I was a bit wary at first, but then I loved it. I love everything about this anime, will probably be my favorite anime of all time. The feels. I lost it when she said "I love you." I'm going to miss the fuck out of this shit :(
>> ARTICLE
All the blatant death flags throughout the show still didn't lessen the final blow :'(.  I give this show a standing ovation considering it was great enough and engrossing enough to give my emotions a good'ol slight drizzle.  9/10 for me, it was close to perfect buuut I gotta admit I found the inner monologues to be of such a high level of "deep" and artsy-fartsy that it felt unnatural coming from young teenagers.  It was almost like that one cultured art piece buyer that loves to hear themselves talk...but in a teenager's body.  Other than that, I couldn't find any glaring flaws.  Standing ovation!  Standing ovation!

I haven't felt the need to cry as much as I did watching this episode in a long time, I found myself wiping my tears away 4 or 5 times .

Kaori will surely stay forever alive not only in Kousei's heart but in mine and in a lot of other people as well.

I can't help but feel the influence of 5Cm's ending on KimiUso's and I really enjoy both the similarities and the contrast between the two. While both of them lost a lover and is moving forward from it, KimiUso at least gives.. well.. Tsubaki, which I think leaves it on a happier note :)

Finished Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso last night. Total wreck by the end of it. The last episode had me in tears. If I didn't hold back I would have probably balled like a fucking baby. There's something about this anime that I have a strong connection with. The characters, the artstyle, and oh god... the music. I just love this anime and now that it's over... it's a bittersweet feeling.This void will be filled with another anime soon, but Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso will always be one of my favorites.

I am going to need some emotional support after this...
I just binged the entire series in under 24 hours hours and I want to say a big round of applause to A-1 because they did a marvelous job.

I realise that I am late to watch this series a bit, but at the time I didn't think much of it until everyone started hyping it up near the ending and all my friends were telling me to watch it so I finally caved and did and by gods it was marvelous.

This has been this years train ride of emotion for me and I have really loved it. Hopefully the following seasons don't have anything like this because I need a few months to recover from this mess.

However if there is anything like this to come (such as this season) if anyone could divert my attention towards it that would be really nice. I enjoy the kind of psychological side that Shigatsu brought to the audience which deepened our understanding of the characters. So any recommendations (And nobody say Clannad)
>> ARTICLE
As a musician that has long been trying to achieve his dreams, this anime really exposed my heart, shredded it, and left it a bloody mess. I fell in love with the bright, beautiful violinist Kaori Miyazono and could completely relate to Arima Kosei and the period where he lacked motivation with music, associating it with pain. The challenges and hardships faced in the anime are so very real in the world of music, and in all of life. Each episode spoke to me in a masterfully crafted tone, the combination of music and dialogue presented in perfect harmony. Everything about it sounded as though it was my story, and I can't lie in saying it has had a major impact on my life.

"But we keep on going... because we're musicians."

This anime opened my eyes up to what I've been blind to for so long. When I'm not playing there is a direct correlation to depression. I'm a musician, I must play to live. I now go to the practice rooms every evening and play my instrument for hours. I truly thank the creators of the Manga and Anime from the bottom of my heart for so beautifully creating and portraying this story. I have been inspired, rejuvenated, and reborn as a new man.

Thank you.

I found out about this anime when it was at it's 18th episode, i saw the rating being super high, and i was out of any animes to watch, and was also hungry for a good anime, it was a really hard decision to wait for the final episode, but it was one of the best decisions I've ever made, started by watching till episode 7, and just marathoner it from episode 8 to 22. 

This anime is basically a feel train driving at incredibly high speed straight towards a wall, and you realize this half way through this anime, and you cling on to small hope that maybe the wall is removed and the train doesn't crash, but in the end it does, and it crashes harder then you even expected. So far a show has never made me cry, this one didn't either, but it's the first one to get me really close to it, to a point where I'm trying really hard to hold it back. 

It's one of those animes that makes you want to wipe your memory about it, and relive this journey in it's full glory.

I finished the series today in 8 hrs marathon. I must have watched close to 750 anime series in my lifetime. None have ever moved me so much as this one. 

This is a must watch series. The music and the setting will bring both joy and sadness at the same time.

Hmmm. This first half of this episode was damn near perfect. It absolutely delivered the kind of emotional performance that I was hoping for. The second half left a pretty bad taste in my mouth though. This show didn't give a single reason to care about Kaori for 21 and half episodes and then tried to cram it all into 10 minutes. It would have been a lot more natural if this information had been released gradually over the series instead of being saved for a big reveal at the end.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's not like we had entire episodes relegated to Tsubaki episodes or anything. Or Kousei teaching Aiza's sister.

I really think this could have had more focus if it just had Kousei's backstory and how Kaori's light was just fading away, everything else is just window dressing for the tragedy. And the tragedy would be Kaori pushing herself too far and she had Kousei's affection for for her would be a part of it as well, to the point it's the only thing she survived for in the last episodes. Yes, it's more or less what we got, but with less *goddamn monologues* and more actions and *actual communication* this could've been great. A lot more Kaori framing would've done her a favor as well.

Yes, it'd be even more intense and melodramatic as fuck, but at least those elements would justify it and make it more vivid for the viewer instead of trying to make us to feel what they feel constantly, I empathize by understanding circumstance, action and motive, not indulging in sadness.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that a lot of the monologues added little to the visuals bugged me, especially in the first part where it's just shots of them looking and thinking Kousei's name over and over again. Sometimes, you just let the visuals do the talking. I believe the manga had it too, but it's not as awkward in text form (still a bit much).

Not that I dislike monologues per se, just the way it was used in some segments.
>> ARTICLE
> indulging in sadness

That's a pretty succinct way of describing what about this show kind of put me off. A lot of good ideas were wasted in order to constantly "go for the feels".

>  I empathize by understanding circumstance, action and motive

And on that note I'm actually fairly satisfied with what we received regarding Kaori's motives, but it was rushed and left very little closure with the abrupt ending that followed. I was having a hard time buying into this romance for most of the series since it felt kind of forced(obviously since it was completely one-sided the entire time), but what we got would have been pretty serviceable if the timing was better. The way it was delivered without any hints beforehand made it feel like the romance/drama equivalent of an asspull.
>> ARTICLE
All I could hear going into the episode is ["Do you fear death?"](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/224/d/a/do_you_fear_death__by_changinghand-d4udjo0.jpg)

EDIT: Well, that's one way to go out with a bang. Freaking heck was this show not what I expected it when I watched the first episode. Also, I was right all along that she loved him (which became very obvious anyway)

PS: based on the explosion coming off her chest I will assume that she died from aortic dissection and run with it because the show gave us f*ck-all in terms of an explanation. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy feels trip man, this show was amazing , I will never forget.
>> ARTICLE
This was so... anticlimactic and SO fucking good.
I felt so much for these characters, I even was nervous and had a stomachache when the OP started playing. I still have one now.
The moment Kaori appeared on the stage, I knew she was dead. The promise was to play together once more.. and well, they did. From the "goodbye" till the "I love you", i could not close my mouth.

This was beautiful in a very different way other anime and stories are. Very anticlimactic, it just happens and thats it. I also did not cry (compared to the dozens who did on this topic as i've seen).

This is certainly one of my favourite romance/drama anime ever, if not my favourite.
PRESS 'F' TO PAY RESPECTS TO BEST GIRL KAORI.

May she rest in peace and may Kousei have a nice life together with Tsubaki.

It was nice watching this with you all, good evening.

I don't remember the last time I bawled my eyes out at an anime. Didn't shed a tear through this entire series until half way through this ep when little Kaori said she wanted Kousei to play the piano for her. I don't even know why that line struck so hard but I basically just cried through the rest of the episode barely paying attention to what was happening afterwards. This is also the first anime that had me just waiting for the exact moment for when Kaori would die, week after week, scene after scene. What an amazing series...I don't know if I can handle rewatching this cause I'd probably cry a lot more the second time through ;__;
>> ARTICLE
I cannot wait to have more shows like this. It's amazing anime like this that keeps me engaged in the medium; shows like these are what will truly "save anime".

The scene where Kousei is yelling out to Kaori not to leave him behind...holy crap. The animation for the piano was so sublime, hell not just the piano. The overall animation of that scene is sublime, pristine, melancholy all at once.

;-; What a beautiful ending.. if they decide to make changes to the BD version, I really hope they do rosy-glassed flashbacks for all of the scenes Kaori recounts in her letter, in her point of view.. you know, as if you couldn't squeeze more feels from the show. Perhaps they allocated too much of their budget on their duet, heh..

As he was reading the letter I said wasn't going to cry, I cried. I knew this show had a lot of praise when I started it when it was at like episode 19 but I still didn't expect it to be this good.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's just me, but I really find the deaths that are highly telegraphed in advance to be more emotional to me than sudden deaths. Even though deep down, I knew Kaori was going to die, I held out hope that someway, somehow she would survive. But slowly episode by episode, the show gave us more and more hints towards her death. All of the emotion that I built up inside me just burst out as Kosei read the letter as it hit me that that Kaori really was dead.
>> ARTICLE

That was a really good "I love you."

Ugh, time to go to class...

Waah. My tear ducts ;-(

I really don't think this ending is sad at all. The time they had together was beautiful and full of love. I'm sure that Kousei didn't have a shed of regret after he read that letter. People come and go in our lives. It's about the time we spend with them not how they came or how they left.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know if this version of the ED (from this episode) is available anywhere?
>> ARTICLE
  While her passing was very sad it didn't make me breakdown nearly as much as I expected,I think it was because it had been a pretty much foregone conclusion.

   I totally lost it throughout the whole confession letter though,it just crushed me.This has become one of my all-time favorite series,the music,the color,the style,the story and the characters were all so amazing.

## Episode 04 List of Classical Performances:

This week's performance is courtesy of Kaori's and Kousei's performance at the violin competition.

---

**Saint-Sans: Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso in A minor, Op. 28** - "Saint-Sans composed this work in 1863. The date of the first performance is not known. The score calls for solo violin and an orchestra consisting of pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, and trumpets, with timpani and strings. Performance time is approximately nine minutes.

Like many composers who write concertos for instruments they do not play, Saint-Sans welcomed the advice of the great Spanish violinist, Pablo de Sarasate, when he composed music for solo violin. They met when Sarasate was just fifteen and Saint-Sans twenty-four, and at the very beginning of a long and productive career. His exceptional gifts as an organist and composer were already winning him distinguished and influential friends, including Gounod, Rossini, and Berlioz.

Sarasate, equally talented and audacious, had approached Saint-Sans hoping that he would compose something for him to play. "Fresh and young as spring itself," Saint-Sans remembered the violinist, "the faint shadow of a moustache scarcely visible on his upper lip, he was already a famous virtuoso. As if it were the easiest thing in the world, he had come quite simply to ask me to write a concerto for him." Saint-Sans, like Bruch, Lalo, Joachim, Wieniawski, and Dvok in the coming years, was flattered and charmed by Sarasate's request, and agreed at once. The first work he composed for Sarasate, completed that same year (1859), was his A major violin concerto. Four years later, he wrote this Introduction and Rondo capriccioso, a brief work with a reflective opening, almost like an operatic recitative and a dazzling aria full of fireworks, tailor-made to show off Sarasate's famed technique. It immediately became standard virtuoso fare, and, after Georges Bizet arranged it for violin and piano, it became mandatory for any talented and daring violinist.

Sarasate went on to enjoy a long career as one of the greatest of romantic virtuososhe lived until 1908 and was the first important violinist to make commercial recordingsand among the most successful of musicians (he even had his portrait painted by James Abbott McNeill Whistler). He had tried his hand at composing; his fantasy on themes from Bizets Carmen is now a staple of the repertory." [(Source for block quote)](http://cso.org/uploadedFiles/1_Tickets_and_Events/Program_Notes/ProgramNotes_Saint-Saens_Intro_Rondo.pdf)

"The slow introduction, marked Andante malinconico ("melancholy"), becomes gradually more animated and ends in a mini-cadenza that opens the Rondo. The syncopated theme stated by the violin has a distinct Spanish flavor, and features huge leaps and brilliant arpeggios. The piano plays a jubilant fortissimo interlude before the violin jumps in to lead the music into a lyrical 2/4 section with a beautiful, singing melody.  The rondo resumes, and once again the piano plunges into the fortissimo interlude.  The violin then leads us into another even sweeter and more tender melodic section.  After the final statement of the rondo theme, the violin plays a suspenseful triple-stop passage, and then the brilliant and dazzling coda finishes the work, a fitting ode to Sarasate's virtuosity." [(Source)](http://www.classicalconnect.com/Violin_Music/Saint-Saens/Introduction_and_Rondo_Capriccioso/5050)

Here's the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso as interpreted by [David Oistrakh (violin/orchestra version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmOClcEk124) and [Ivry Gitlis (violin/piano version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN5eoZM-vE4)

---

This week, we get to see more of how Kousei's "curse" works.  They did a very good job adapting how Kousei's "curse" caused the music notes to disappear from the score and how he appeared to be at the bottom of a dark sea trying to overcome this major psychological handicap.

In addition to this, I thought that the adaptation this week was very faithful.  The part that kind of killed me inside was seeing how Kousei's mom was so loving and kind to Kousei when she first started teaching him piano, and then we see how she became quite the bitch when she got ill.  As I mentioned before, we'll see [during](/s "Kousei's piano competition") [the supposed reason for his curse (**Manga Spoiler -- Proceed with Caution!)**](/s "The gist of it being that he told his mom that "a person like her was better off dead" and then she died not too long after, leaving that as Kousei's final words to his mother.  Kousei feels that he's cursed as a result of that.").

Thank you for reading and I hope you're looking forward to next week's episode as much as I am! 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks beyond all for the Gitlis performance.  That was stunning.  Also thanks for the program notes.  def adds to the performance of the episode.  I will almost undoubtedly be re-watching this series...
>> ARTICLE
I want to let you know that I really appreciate this weekly contribution. I typically try to skip past the discussion to avoid spoilers, but I definitely read this. I think I'll begin reading this before the episodes to see how the anime plays it differently.

Thank you!
>> ARTICLE
You're welcome! :-)

Just so you know, I'm usually at work when this airs on Crunchyroll, but I do my best to get this out within a few hours of air time.  I usually read the manga chapters ahead of time to get an idea of what pieces are going to appear in the next episode (and I have my write-up usually prepared in advance), but sometimes there are scenes where the manga infers that music is playing, but the pieces' names aren't provided.  Hence, I need to watch the episode and then figure out their identities (which usually takes roughly an additional hour).

TL;DR version: If you want to wait for this post every week, expect it to be posted sometime between 5pm and 7pm CST (GMT -6).

I am now tagging you as The Music Man. These reviews are great. Keep it up!
>> ARTICLE
You honestly deserve way more upvotes for this - as someone with 15+ years worth of music background this anime speaks to me on a very deep level
>> ARTICLE
You have a +15 years music background as well? Or were you talking about me? XD
>> ARTICLE
as in I have 15+ years of music background yeah. Started when I was 10. Clarinet, saxophone, choral music, band ensembles, self-taught piano and flute. 
>> ARTICLE
I started around the same time too! I did saxophone (for ~5-6 years, starting in 4th grade), choir (since I've been about 10), and piano (self taught 17 years now).  I've had a desire to learn cello and oboe for a while now.  I just don't have the money to purchase the instruments or the time to learn how to play them....for now. XD
>> ARTICLE
pop quiz time, SATB? I doubt it was S since that's pretty much a solo only instrument, and I can rule out B since it that must have been the size of you at ten years old. I played AT, though S was super fun. I wish I had your dedication at piano though.. I just can't seem to coordinate my hands into two different rhythms 
>> ARTICLE
I started off with A, then went to S, then went back to A (and regretted it very much, because S was my favorite one to play).  If I ever play sax again, it will be a S.

Piano-wise, it certainly has been a tumultuous 17 years; I don't play as much classical as I did in the past.  I instead have focused on ragtime for the last 5 years...but I'm working my way back into classical little by little (by learning some Chopin, Beethoven, and Schubert).

I almost moved my mouse over it when scrolling in the thread. What is the point of posting this? Don't come to an anime discussion thread, episode 4/22, and post "Massive Manga Spoilers". I don't want to walk through a minefield here.

I think this isn't a place to come and share your manga experiences, personally. It really doesn't add to the discussion, that's why I downvoted him.

EDIT: To add to my point, in the body of this post:

> Try not to confirm or deny any theories, encourage people to read the source material instead. Minor spoilers are generally ok but should be tagged accordingly

Minor spoilers are okay if tagged, but confirming or denying theories isn't right.

There is something wrong with me, even if someone warns for a spoiler and the whole text is covered in black, i'll still read it whether i want it or not.
Well time to read the manga i guess.

I read it and now I'm curious if they're trolling or wrong. The problem with basing any theory on the manga (if you're an English reader) is that IIRC, only 1/2 is translated.

This fucking show, man. I've teared up 3 times in 4 episodes already. This is bad. This is real bad. There's 18 episodes left. If it continues this trend, I'm going to end it crying my eyes out.

Remember how spring season had Isshuukan Friends? I once compared that show to jumping into a pit of pillows on a warm spring day, with the knowledge that at some point, the pillows would be gone but you would jump anyway.

These two shows are a lot like each other, except this one just starts without the pillows. And it's the middle of winter. In Anchorage. And you don't jump, you just collapse out of fear and depression.
>> ARTICLE
>jumping into a pit of pillows

I remember that analogy, and it fit perfectly. And it fits perfectly now ;_;

Didn't realise this was 2 cour. Suddenly the pacing makes a lot more sense.

That episode was too sad. I couldn't go watch my Chaika from yesterday, or continue my Log Horizon. So I went to watch episode 2 of AnoHana, since I'd put it down a couple weeks ago.

Shit guys... pls stahp. I can't handle anymore of this :(
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, that was intense. I've never gotten such a claustrophobic feeling watching an anime. Simply breathtaking.

I also liked that the turning point came with the memories of the mother, who so far was only shown to be a one-dimensional bitch. Two simple and effective tricks used there was to show her first and foremost as out of the wheelchair (she used to be different) but also in color (his perception of her). Again, it's an incredibly simple way to show him overcoming his one-sided view of her, but I thought it was quite effective.

Not even gonna comment on the ending, I'm just dazzled by the rest of the scene.
>> ARTICLE
[Kaori](http://imgur.com/YDSwbPp) is just beautiful in that dress.

After the episode......

NO! NO! NOOOOO!!

Amazing episode as usual. Kaori proving to be best girl once again. The view of the city in the beginning took my breath away and the art still looks refreshing. The performance was great and looked insanely gorgeous. Still digging that soundtrack. Definitely my favorite anime of this season.

That performance was amazing. Hope Kaori is going to be alright and it's nothing too serious.

Kousei didn't compliment her dress.

I was wondering why Kaori got off the bus at a hospital, i hope she doesn't have a disease in an advanced stage.

I have a feeling that the music part of this show is going to take a backseat to the drama.

At first, I thought she was visiting someone, but now I'm wondering if it was for herself.

I'm guessing she has some sort of deteriorating disease by the constantly trembling hands(when not playing.)

I feel like this'll be better than WA2, but that's my opinion.

Four episodes in and I can't handle these feels. The background music complements the show so well that I'm getting chills hearing it.

But just like WA2, I don't think anyone is going to win by the end of the series.
>> ARTICLE
> The background music complements the show so well that I'm getting chills hearing it.

Agreed, I really like the background music to this and it caught my attention a couple of times (not a bad thing in this case).
>> ARTICLE
Oh God. I should go rewatch WA2 to prep myself for this. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, our hearts *will* be ripped apart, I'm sure. Maybe not WA2 levels of infinite pain and suffering, but tearjerking drama is certainly on the horizon. *I can feel it*.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, WA2 was a straight up tragedy where no one was at fault but everyone was fucked. Even if there's some heart wrenching stuff in our future, this show seems like it wants to have some serious growth in its characters. 

Even if I can rationally think about these things, [speculation that people aren't tagging in the rest of the thread, but just to be careful](/s "no matter how many times the manic pixie dream girl dies, it just doesn't get easier. Especially so when it's done so well in only *4 episodes.*")
>> ARTICLE
I've played piano for 9 years and I quit playing 2 years ago. This anime really struck home to me because like me, my entire family plays classical music so my mother is much like Kousei's mother. I actually started crying at the very beginning of the episode because I could relate to his situation so well. I'm probably the least-skilled player in my family so often times my family berates me and tells me that I'm a lost cause and I can't do anything right. It really screwed me up when I was a kid. Like Kousei, I've messed up performances, I can't live up to my family's expectations, etc. 

Ever since I quit 2 years ago, I haven't cried about piano until today's episode. My emotions just came back and punched me in the face but in a way I'm feeling inspired to play piano again. 

Also, the end of that episode. If (speculation) this anime ends up being one of those stories where the girl has cancer and passes away at the end (thus inspiring the main character to do something, i.e., play piano again in Kousei's case) then I'm going to throw my computer out the window I stg
>> ARTICLE
Least you can play an instrument at all! I've had this crazy bad block of musical instruments. I just have no talent for it at all! Also no one in my family plays anything. Or maybe I was just never motivated enough to. So I'm proud of you that you can play anything!
>> ARTICLE
I think your speculated ending would be emotional but would negate the possible message of the show. If the message is about playing for yourself and the love of music, playing for his mother or the memory of the girl are equivalent. They are playing for someone else's sake. Let's hope that doesn't transpire (assuming this is even the message of the show).
>> ARTICLE
Well said.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, that performance! I was really excited for the performance since the last episode. It totally blew me away. Kaori is an amazing violinist. It's been a while since I played the violin, but her movements for the most part were accurate. Definitely refreshing after many anime and live-action scenes with music where they're just wildly swinging the bow around.

I'm still rather worried Kaori will just be a manic pixie dream girl trope with very little character development. The show is still in its early stages, but so far her goal is rather abstract and grandiose. 

I'm fairly confident her stop at the hospital was for whatever illness she has that caused her to faint. It definitely makes sense with why she wants people to remember her and her music.
>> ARTICLE
The performances in this are so beautiful. 'Enthralled' is a perfect word to describe me during them. It sort of makes me wish I hadn't dropped the violin.

If they have the recordings they used for the performances on the OST, it'll be an instant buy for me. Hands down, no question whatsoever.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Kaori better not die, that'd be pretty shitty.
>> ARTICLE
> Just doesn't really make sense to have her get MC out of his funk just to have him relive the crap that got him into his funk in the first place

Makes sense to me, if they choose to go that route. The most obvious development in that case would be for him to realize that all change and strength comes from within himself, not from her. Getting past his mental block is a huge first step and her help was an integral part of it, but it's all for naught if she continues to be a crutch for him.

Man I really didnt like Kousei's mom and how he stuck up for her but [this](http://imgur.com/jnuDei6) made me empathize with their relationship, guess illnesses can have a real impact in their lives.  

[Kaori's quotes made this episode](http://i.imgur.com/g7BisgC.jpg)  

Guess Kaori has a problem instead of a relative at the hospital,
that [transition](http://i.imgur.com/4AlK8pj.jpg) into the episode title Departure was really clever too.  
Did it have a double meaning?  
With the beginning of Kousei's journey, and Kaori's [departure.](http://imgur.com/Jt9PNWo)  
The transition into the [ED](http://i.imgur.com/yqrwEZC.jpg) where it may look like a memorial and the next episode [preview](http://i.imgur.com/KZkNhvc.jpg) kind of hints to it too.  
This anime is certainly stepping up, showing solid potential development , Kaori and Kousei outperformed this episode, hopefully it wont be their last.
>> ARTICLE
It seems like his mom only got mean as the illness progressed. She seemed very sweet and loving when she was in good shape, but as the disease began to take her, she became obsessed with leaving a legacy behind and began to push Kousei harder and harder. 

If the worst does come to pass, I think Kaori will act as a foil to Kousei's mother. Somebody who faced death by making the most out of life rather than being obsessed with leaving something behind that people could remember -- and that will ultimately help Kousei move on.
>> ARTICLE
The word used in the Japanese title (-tabidachi) is not really ambiguous. It literally means 'setting off on a journey' (in a positive kind of way). It'd be out of place if used in a negative meaning. It's only the English title that gives off those double meaning vibes. 

And that actually gives me hope that nothing THAT bad will happen to Kaori.^^please ^^be ^^true
>> ARTICLE
It's 2-cour, she can't end up like his mom now, right? Right?

Hell of a cliffhanger end, though. I looked at how much time was left and went "This can't be the ending... Fuck, it is."
>> ARTICLE
It's only episode 4. Are they trying to crush me? 

There was so much that I like about this show, the music, the visuals. Everything. That headbutt, that look Tsubaki had when she saw the way he looked at her. Just so much done right. I just can't help but wait for this show every week. But goddamn, the experience is pretty stressful isn't it?

So what do you guys think about her:
[*"Elohim, Essaim... Elohim, Essaim I implore you"*](http://imgur.com/JrUkLh1), before she starts her performance?

**As far as my Research goes:**
[Elohim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim) means god in Hebrew and Essaim means Swarm in french, but that doesn't make much sense, so i guess it refers to St. Essaim a guardian angel.

But maybe I am completely off
>> ARTICLE
I'm also curious about about that, i hate it when i don't understand a part that could be crucial for the story.
>> ARTICLE
This interested me as well. I tried to dig a little deeper; and i kept getting led to either the Grand Grimoire or the Black Pullet as sources for the chant, but i can't find original texts of either of these grimoires. They both seem to be about magic, with descriptions of the grand grimoire describing the chant as a [multipurpose precursor to a number of spells](http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/grimoire/The%20Grand%20Grimoire%20-%20Dark%20Lodge%20version.pdf). 

Sadly, it seems that this form of magic is more popular in japan where it seems to be used in a number of anime and games. sadly no sources there though. i hope someone figures it out.
>> ARTICLE
That's a reference to the 90's classic [Akuma-kun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akuma-kun). The protagonist chants the phrase when he summons demons. Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQyfGIkFq48).

Edit: link, typo.
>> ARTICLE
5:47, for anyone wondering.
>> ARTICLE
A similar phrase occurs in the [Book of Black Magic](http://books.google.com/books?id=HMrV-BPe5h8C&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=Eloim,+Essaim,+frugativi+et+appellavi) and in the Italian [Il Grand Grimoire](http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/Il_Grand_Grimoire.pdf). A couple translations and transcriptions later, we end up with this.

"Eloim" is "Powers", "Essaim" might be "Locusts" or "Swarm". I'm thinking that she's offering her soul to the devil/the angels/god in exchange for being able to captivate her audience. This isn't Faust; it's not a serious treatment of pacts. The Japanese adore christian mythology, similar to how the west adores eastern mythology. In effect, she's doing the same thing as someone in a western work invoking his "chi" or whatever. (It's shnen; teenage boys love foreign mysticism.)

The feels at that ending, please be okay. Q_Q
>> ARTICLE
I know very little about piano, so I'm not sure about the accuracy of the animation, but I really appreciate how this show doesn't switch to an obvious CG closeup of his hands on the piano when he's playing. 
>> ARTICLE
The accuracy is spot on.  I'm a classical pianist and every note is accurate, even the way he spreads his hands is accurate.  It's incredible.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure that the closeup of his hands when he was playing with the kids in the cafe was CG though, but they did a good job of not making it obvious.

EDIT: I went back to check, and it looks like the close-ups in this episode are CG too.
>> ARTICLE
At least they do a good job on not making it all closeups and implied animation by hiding it. There were quite a few good shot of his hands playing in the background or in a wider shot. Same with the violin playing since that could easily have been like that too. 
>> ARTICLE
Idk, I thought all of those were really obvious CG, doesn't change the fact that it was really good though.
>> ARTICLE
I think the unique animation style in this series so far really makes it. The usage of lighting and colour is just out of this world. You can really feel the music.

I don't know about the rest of you but this show is blowing me away this season. Out of all the big names this season this show is definitely in my top three and I wasnt expecting it at all. 

The romance between the two characters is great, the chemistry is there, and the challenges are very real, the music is top notch and the best part, the part that really makes it for me is the very well concealed CG that is used for the music scenes. watching those hand movements on the piano, or the way Kaori moves on stage just feels so real to me. 

Overall a great show and one of the biggest surprises of the season (with biggest surprise going to Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis)

Any one know if there is a light novel or Manga for this? I'm absolutely loving it. 
>> ARTICLE
There is a manga, the anime and the manga are slated to end simultaneously this spring!  But the scanlations of the manga are really slow only up to the 21st chapter when there are 50+ out.

So is it going to end... In April?

It could be a lie and it ends in March or May

I'm guessing a March end since it's going to have 22episodes.

Small correction, there are only 41 chapters currently out.

Well shit that ending...was hoping for a happy time.

I love that everyone is enjoying the music of this show. I'm hoping people continue to appreciate it. Maybe, just maybe this show will encourage someone to pick up an instrument, or like me, begin playing again after they have put theirs down for a period of time.

Another beautiful episode in every way, I am so, incredibly impressed.

I'm always astounded by the lack of comments in this thread. How does everyone not love this show?!

They probably just don't watch it and therefore don't know that this show is FREAKIN AMAZING

Holy shit this show gets me mad.  
WHY IS EVERYONE EXPECTING POOR MC TO PERFORM?  
He is traumatized by his mother's death for fucking sake. HE IS LIKE 14 years old!, Holy shit Japan like, WHAT THE FUCK!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah his friends kinda suck. Some people can't get over traumas by being forced into doing it. Kaori believes otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
His friends don't know better, Kaori especially. Plus, he did fine in the end. I don't think Kaori even cared that much about how he'd do, she just wanted him to try. 
>> ARTICLE
Kaori might not know better, but his friends absolutely should. He "did fine in the end" primarily because the plot demands it.

I'm not opposed to the message that he should *try*, but the way she has gone about it is pretty inconsiderate.

How old are they? I think you're expecting too much from a bunch of kids

Man, I love classical music, I may not know much about it, but violins, trumpets and pianos are really awesome instruments, them sounds!

This show is nice. And I like how we will get an ending to a great show

Woo! More well animated music playing! 


Also plz no cheap drama disease.

It's seems a lil obvious but the girl must have some kind of serious disease. last episode showed a hospital and now she faints.
>> ARTICLE
My fears are coming true, Im pretty sure this will have a sad ending 
She has cancer or something and she is just enjoying her last moments in life... That's just my guessing but if it's true i will be very disappionted.... Too predictable 
>> ARTICLE
What is your favourite show of the season, and why is it Shigatsu? 

Honestly, this is shattering any expectations i had for it, the manga was great, and the anime is even greater. Being able to see the animations for the violin and piano playing is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I CANNOT wait for the full versions of the OP and ED for this anime.  Nov 19th needs to hurry and get here already!
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone tear up during the mother teaching "twinkle twinkle little star" part? That scene resounded too hard for me,and it hit some strings. T.T
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that was almost (but not quite) as good as the second episode. I'm going to hope Kaori doesn't suffer from Vague Anime Illness, but the fact that the narrative keeps painting her as a positive foil to Kousei's mom (who is dead) does not give me hope. I want a story of a bright, intense romance that ends in heartbreak, but not of the "whoops I'm dying" variety. Please. That would totally kill this for me. That trope is done and dead and needs to stop.
>> ARTICLE
I wish I was able to ignore all the clichs and just enjoy this show for what it is. I *do* enjoy it, but seeing nearly everything follow the usual tropes does take me out of the immersion a bit.

I liked the background track playing throughout most of the episode, even before Kousei and Kaori's actual performance. I am loving the soundtrack as a whole.

The highlight of this episode, in my opinion, is the moment it defied convention and added some depth to the character of Kousei's mom by revealing that she was actually kind and encouraging when Kousei started playing. It seems she became more harsh as her health deteriorated... It will be interesting to find out more about her; she's still impacting the show, despite having died before it ever even started.

On a different note, the art this episode was also very beautiful. I liked the way they visualized how Kousei's fear and anxiety manifested itself and kept him from being able to play, though some of his lines were a bit cheesy.

I am intrigued to see what exactly is going on with Kaori - I hope it's not that she has some terminal illness or something, because that would feel even more clichd.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in much the same boat.  It has a fair number of enjoyable qualities, but a handful of issues marring the whole.  I'm not really finding any ground to connect with the characters, for one.  Perhaps it's merely a personal issue, but I don't feel like I have any characters to root for.  The two supporting characters (whose names escape me right now) don't really get enough screen time to be of note, and the show makes it *very* clear it wants you to invest in the two leads and basically no one else.  Kousei seems like little more than a quivering ball of, "Woe is me, pity me," which is probably intended so we can see him come out of that shell later, but isn't doing him any favors *now*.  Kaori's behavior is erratic and a bit inconsistent.  "Free spirited," you might say, but the hard switch at the end of the first episode from calling Kousei a pervert and terrible person to brightly inviting him to join the group at her performance was jarring to say the least.  Not to mention her morally questionable method of gaining his agreement to play accompaniment for her.

The comic relief is also bothersome.  Artistically and tonally, it simply doesn't seem to belong in this show.  I almost get the feeling they couldn't commit to keeping a more somber, low-key tone the entire time and fell back on those sorts of silly antics as a compromise.  Rather than easing back on the tension like intended, it simply puts a stake through the heart of whatever emotional or dramatic tension they had just attempted to build.

Of course, since I'm not really clicking with the characters, much of it reeks of melodrama anyway.  Seriously, where did Kaori's breakdown in the previous episode even come from?  I'm willing to entertain that it may be foreshadowing for something to come, but in that moment it felt like a mere plot contrivance to give Kousei that last push to come to his decision to help her.  And if Kaori is terminally ill after all, we can definitely expect plenty more melodrama in the coming weeks.

I'm ragging on it pretty hard, but I don't hate the show.  I'm more disappointed, I suppose, which is in some ways worse.  This episode was much more enjoyable since it focused solely on the performance, but I dread the inevitable, moment-shattering gags in the next episode as they explain what's going on with Kaori.
>> ARTICLE
Oddly, I like the comedic moments more than the dramatic moments, primarily because the comedy feels more genuinely funny whereas the drama seems... melodramatic and overdone.

I'm mostly watching for the beautiful music. The characters are just okay.

Also the supporting characters are Watari (the guy) and Tsubaki (the girl).
>> ARTICLE
Can't fault you for that.  Those moments remind me a lot of Nisekoi, which isn't an insult by any means, but they stick out like a sore thumb in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.  I guess the problem is more its lack of commitment to either side.  It doesn't trust the drama to carry itself without a joke to ease things back some, and it seemingly wants to be more serious than comedic most of the time.  Pushing a little harder in one direction or the other might have quelled some of my worries.
>> ARTICLE

Fair enough. I can agree with you on that.

The number 4. This is episode 4. April is the 4th month. "4" in Japanese can be pronounced the same way as "death" (shi). Tell me I'm just reading too far into this, I don't need to feels.

hm, interesting. childhood friend looks jealous when kousei and kaori looked at each other.

I can't remember a show I've watched in the past with such a strong first 4 episodes. Not even any of my ~10 shows I rated 10/10.

If the show doesn't go downhill in the future, I might be forced to re-scale my MAL ratings, with this show as the 10/10 reference!
>> ARTICLE
I never thought I would be digging this show so much, what an amazing episode. It has got me really interested in the music as well.

Liked how they set up a love square? in this ep. Some serious complications incoming.

Also, can anyone recommend me some shows that use music like this? Don't mind what genre they are.

Oh man, it was absolutely beatifully done when the mc was playing the piano and stopped hearing the notes and it transitioned to as if he was playing under water. Actually the entire episode was done beatifully.

This was a fantastic episode. I love how well the erratic changing of the music during the performance fitted with the changing emotions of the characters (and viewers) as the episode went on, and the imagery was amazing. I'm fully expecting grim and somber things to come though.

This show is amazing; I have a huge hard-on for shows with music as a large focus (Beck was the first anime I seriously watched and fell in love with), and out of all of the strong shows that are airing this season, this one is the clear and only contender for my favourite so far.

I find myself so emotionally involved with this show already that it actually surprises me. I was literally kind of yelling at the screen saying "You need to forget all of that and just play!" which is not something I normally do when I watch shows.

Unfortunately I'm pretty sure this show is on track to devastate us all in some way.

Him not hearing the piano makes me want to show him that episode of Bleach when Ichigo first releases Zangetsu. Why? Because Zangetsu says this specific line: "what plugs your ears is worthless fear."

If someone says that to him I would pass out of happiness.

Did anyone else feel a huge surge of satisfaction when Tsubaki had the sudden realization at the end? Because honestly I find her insufferable, and watching her face turn into a huge frown as she, presumably, realized how much Kaori and Kousei may end up liking each other was a welcome sight.

All the feels I held back in the beginning, came flooding through in the end. WTF you can't just end an episode like that.

Im simply blown away by how good this anime is. Its like Im actually there at a live performance. Actually I havent been to any such serious live performances but now I definitely want to! 
>> ARTICLE
Wow.  This episode honestly left me speechless.  That was probably the one of the best overall episodes that I have seen in a long time.  

It was so full of feelings, intense, and beautiful.  Watching Kousei attempt to play only to fail. Seeing him struggle against his inner problems, only to try one more time and just play regardless of if he can hear or not.. was amazing.  I was rooting for him to somehow overcome it and I'm glad they were able to do this all in one episode.  

100% satisfied.  That was amazing.  The BGMs this episode were beautiful as always but that performance and this overall episode was stunning and a pleasure to watch.

No. Don't you do this to me. Don't you dare do it. I swear to all that exists, I will raise some serious hell (after a bit of crying) if she bites the dust next episode. I swear it.

Damn! I was surprised with how I ended up enjoying the first four episodes. I left it unwatched until tonight thinking it was just another school anime to only find out it's an overly beautiful classical music anime. It surprised me with how it ended up hooking me in both from the musical side and the unique character side.

I also felt like it was speaking to me in saying that I should do what I want music wise. To allow myself to express myself in general and music wise. That, and with how it kept trying to tug all my memories of how I used to play a Trumpet for three or so years. I stopped playing because I thought of myself as inferior because others were more skilled than me. I just couldn't keep up with other trumpet players, nor could I practice due to how loud the trumpet gets. Was fun playing around the city I'm in though. Neighbors would complain if I was to practice. I wonder if I'll end up playing the trumpet again or if this is just a little spark that will stay unlit.

How I yearn to play a piano, yet can't. How nice it would be to play a trumpet, yet can't. Forgot how to read notes while making up excuses like the main character. Everything musical is done through Fruityloops and with how I simply listen to all sorts of video game and anime related soundtracks. I consider myself inferior so I can't express myself. I can kind of see why musicians keep feeling depressed, if loosely or vaguely.

Anime wise again........I'm addicted to this show now, especially with the BGM tracks I heard and how deep the performances were. Free and proud to not stay chained up to the sheet of music. One chained, another free trying to have both compliment one another while helping regain confidence in playing the piano again. Seeing both being in the zone in a bit of a duel was awesome to see and hear. I love this show for that.

I'm glad I left it hanging till 4 episodes. If I was to marathon this I would have had a restless night. Now I can simply wait for ep 5.
(edit: Apologies for wall of text. Thought it was going to be tiny.)

I love this anime and i feel a lot of feels coming along in the future.

i feel like people are forgetting a part that happened during the play when he started to get in the zone and looks at Kaori with a smile. 

The look in Tsubaki eyes are just heartbreaking because it looks like shes starting to realize he starting to develop feelings.

Anyone else find that twinkle twinkle little star scene to be awesome? Man, I was so tense throughout this whole episode. It was such a rollercoaster. 

Haven't cheered for an MC to pull through his troubles in a long while. I finally took a breath after they finished their performance and then... THAT happened. 
>> ARTICLE
Both scenes of the Twinkle Twinkle Little Star were awesome. Both the Engrish and the Japanese one I found awesome with how nicely they put it. 

I thought the MC was going to immediately flop but I'm glad they gave him a fighting chance to at the very please play something then duel it out. Sad to see the collapse. Now I'm curious for the next ep to find that out.
>> ARTICLE
My god Araka Naoshi! *(Mangaka of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso)* Give Kousei a freaking break man! His mom died already and now you're trying to take the girl he's falling for? I'm telling you. This show is gonna freaking ruin not only him but us all.

Anyway, I read the manga up to the latest translated chapters and I'm very impressed by this episode. I was enjoying this episode more than reading the chapter of this arc because technically you can't hear the music they were actually playing in the manga. And all I can say is the music didn't disappoint. Keep up the good work Aniplex! 

One more thing. I'm just gonna leave [this](http://mangafox.me/manga/shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso/v05/c020/46.html) here so you guys know what you are walking into. [The link is just a tiny bit of the latest translated chapter](/s "Kaori's ULTIMATE DEATH FLAG.")

Word of advice: Get ready for a train wreck of feels.

One of the elite few animes this season that seem to fly by every episode, it really has me entrapped every Friday morning.  I really liked how they visualized his anxiety and fear at the piano.  It was interesting to watch and made sense to me at how it would visualize to his mind.  I don't watch much romance so I don't know if genre-wise this show is serious quality, but I've found it amazing so far....it's awesome enough to make a low-self-opinioned-non-romance-guy entranced every week....keep up the amazing-ness Shigatsu XD

Crazy to think how music can capture you without even realizing it. I was waiting for him to overcome the tribulations he faced, but was surprised that a genuine good memory of his mother was what spurred it. The ending was great, but I do gotta question if the audience's reaction would actually happen at a real recital competition or if this is an anime fairytail type thing.

What a beautiful conclusion of Kousei's inner struggle with his mother. :')
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
One of the things that has been bugging me throughout the series is the fact that no one ever reassured Kousei that it wasn't his fault. His mom PHYSICALLY BEAT him and caused extreme mental trauma. However, like many abuse victims, he assumed it was his fault and that his mom was in the right. And no one ever tells him that its not his fault.

One moment in particular that stuck out to me was one from the last episode at the festival. He asks Hiroko if his mom could forgive him and they talk about it. The only thing is, Kousei shouldn't have to ask for forgiveness because he did NOTHING WRONG. I understand that his mom and Hiroko were friends, but that doesn't mean that they can just brush everything aside, which is exactly what they do. All the shit and trauma that his mom caused was completely brushed off because she "did it for him."
>> ARTICLE
I don't believe that's the point though. Mom's still a bitch for doing the things she did to Kousei, but that doesn't mean she was doing it out of sadism. She was just trying to do what she can as a mother out of desperation.

It's to allow the audience to sympathize with her, and not just peg her as a complete and total bitch that should've died earlier like they have throughout the series until now.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's important that Seto Hiroko never actually explains Saki's reasoning. The viewers now know why Saki was so abusive; whatever you think of her, sh'es at least human now. But Hiroko never tells Kousei this, which makes his forgiveness entirely different from what the viewer experiences.

Forgiving people is very rarely about the person you forgive, especially if they're dead. Forgiving someone is about *you* dealing with the things they did to you and figuring out how you want to let them affect you as you move forward. 

Kousei realized that despite all her abuse he was happy with how his life, and his life is only the way it is because of her abuse. For years he has seen his mother as a demon, watching from the audience. Now he's finally accepted what happened, and she disappeared. But notice that the gloom and the darkness never disappeared from around her; he didn't suddenly decide that what she did was a good thing, he simply learned how to stop letting the terrible things bother him.
>> ARTICLE
Forgiving someone is different than understanding someone and feeling bad for them. I feel bad and sad for his Mom because her time running out forced her to be desperate and do the only thing she can think of to help her son's future. In her eyes it would be better for him to endure a year or so of physical abuse rather than being broke and poor for the rest of his life. She didn't enjoy hurting him. She didn't enjoy dying on him. It wasn't all for some bullshit reason like her legacy or some similar selfish crap. She hurt just as much if not more but she felt like they both had to endure it for his sake. Which is why I feel sorry and sad for her. No mother should ever be forced to become that desperate. People become desperate when they are losing what's most important to them, in this case, her son.
Just an example that might be relevant even if a lot more extreme would be when a parent kills their child just before they are captured to be raped and slaved in some movies. Not the right thing to do in any way, but understandable.

Jail time for beating your kid in Japan? lol 99% of the time when a teacher slaps you, your parents slap you for getting slapped by the teacher
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah. Child abuse should never be forgiven, even in a circumstance like this. But, seeing her desperately trying to make Kousei a star is pretty depressing. Even though she hit him, it's sad to see that she felt she had to resort to that. That her burning desire for her son to succeed drove her to that, makes it not redeemable or acceptable, but more like we know now why she was like that. 

It's kind of an internal struggle for me because she shouldn't be forgiven, but seeing his good memories with his mom reminded me of me and my mom. I want to forgive her, but there's no justification. This is the only moment in the whole show where I have started crying and even as I'm writing this, I'm tearing up. 

But anyway, I think this was the best episode of the whole series and I don't think any other episode will top it.
>> ARTICLE
i dont think it was so much about kousei forgiving his mother as it was moving beyond the final years of her life. he was stuck in the moment where he wished death on her followed by her passing shortly after. 

it was ultimately revealed that what really haunted him was his parting words to his mother rather than the abuse itself (as seen around ep10 at 6 minute mark). The flash backs to the abuse and his mother's fading health was a misdirection. this was what was truely eating away at him which was why it was revealed so late. it kills him that these were his final words to his mother.

by being locked in that time frame, he forgot what a loving mother she was at one point. it was by moving beyond that, was when he saw her intentions for what they were.

maybe it was just me, but i never picked up a feeling of forgiveness from his final performance. you may notice that when he breaks down into tears after the performance, his thoughts were if his feelings reached his mother by playing her favorite piece as lovingly as she did to him by reflecting that back to her. what i interpreted was not a "i forgive you" so much as it was a "i love you too"
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think of it that way. That seems more possible than "I forgive you" actually.
>> ARTICLE
i really think so. this type of closure was foreshadowed in a flashback in episode 4 (17 minutes). it was the only other memory before episode 13 that showed her as a kind teacher/mother. in the flash back, shes actually standing next to him in good health. this shows that she didnt really start pushing him until her health started declining. infact, episode 13 showed that the thought of teaching him to play never even occurred to her until hiroko suggested that kousei was a prodigy.
>> ARTICLE
Being a man who has had issues with his mother for a long period of time in my life. I couldn't help but just start fucking crying when he broke down. I hate a lot of things that my mother has done to me but I can never imagine going through what Kousei has. You said it man, such a beautiful conclusion to an inner struggle.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go call my mom and tell her I love her. 
>> ARTICLE
I might be wrong, but wasn't this episode the first one that actually showed Kousei's mother's eyes? ^God ^I ^hope ^I'm ^not ^wrong ^because ^I'm ^about ^to ^start ^ranting ^kind ^of ^deeply ^about ^it From the start of the show, his mother had mostly been painted as this terrible abuser, and her face would always not be depicted fully; she was just kind of this cruel monster. But as the show progressed, she was shown much more sympathy, especially through the eyes of Kousei (and in this episode, Hiroko) and made to seem more human and more misunderstood, thus the showing of her eyes at this peak episode where she was finally forgiven, completely showing her face and making her not a monster, but a human, flaws and all.

Even if I'm wrong, the bit about her being shown more sympathy over the course of the show still holds, peaking at this episode.

IKR! But apparently a lot of people in this thread don't understand what forgiving means. Forgiving doesn't mean what she did was right. You only get to forgive people if they were wrong. Forgiving her means when he thinks to himself, even though what you did hurt me a lot mother and it caused me pain, I understand that you felt it was for my future and it would lead to a better future for me even though you didn't want to hurt me, so I choose to overlook what you did wrong and forgive you.

This is why forgiveness is so beautiful, you CHOOSE to overlook someone's mistake due to your love for them and/or understanding their reasoning.
>> ARTICLE
It's great, isn't it? It was a nice touch that this was the first time that Kousei had cried since he had his breakdown two years ago (correct me if I'm wrong). 

Mah feels for him. ;_;

I was expecting the crowd to give a standing ovation because of the Feels train.

I thought their speechlessness was nice too. As in, they were touched by his playing and didn't know what to do with those feelings.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I missed it in the anime, but in the manga, Emi's teacher makes a note of how rude it was for Kousei to hold such a personal performance and not letting anyone in.  In a good way, of course.  It definitely puts a perspective on what the audience was feeling -- even if they didn't know it themselves -- and why they forgot to applause; it was a very introverted performance between him and his mother, the sheer weight of it left them breathless.

Closing one book of sadness, but immediately pushed into opening the next. This show is brutal ;_;.

As a sidenote, I do like the transitional symbolism portrayed in this episode. 

First, we got to see Kousei's mother's eyes prominently this episode, which is very much signalling both Kousei's willingness to look his past in the eyes directly, but also as a very humanizing factor in revealing her intentions. She's a very human character, with the faults that make us sad.

Second, I enjoy how the audience clapped gently this episode, which frankly, has been only for Kousei's performances thus far. However, unlike his previous performance where he royally screwed up, this was a much more consistent performance. It's significant that Kousei is the only person in the show thus far to receive such a gentle applause is that unlike the other performers who speak from their heart to generate a hot passion, Kousei instead creates a cooling one instead, reflective of his past experiences and unfortunately, his future.

Lastly, the final scene, though simple, was a nice artistic touch. In this  scene, reverse of what we've seen in the past, is Kousei in a much more colorful palette all while Kaori reflects a paler pallette. This isn't because she's being bedridden--her hair also reflects a paler shade--but a foreshadowing that she's losing the ability to shine due to her disease. It's a tragic tipping point in the series, but it was one that we've all known about for ages. 

Some people say that the symbolism is too obvious, but I like it for the part it plays in the grander narrative ^_^. Overall, an excellent an emotional episode, though melodramatic at times.

The symbolism and foreshadowing are almost like a character themselves with their presence.

We talk about scenes that make us cry in anime all the time, but nothing in my life has made me feel the emotions I felt in this scene. This show has broken me, and when it's over, I have no idea what I'm going to do with myself. Just waiting a week for the next episode is almost too painful. I don't know the requirements for something to be considered a masterpiece, but I feel like this show deserves the highest mention I can give. I love it so much!

Aw i'm kinda feeling sorry for the mother now too.
>> ARTICLE
[No one believed me!](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ozxk8/spoilers_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_episode_10/cms6cd0) I used to hate her so much but after I read these parts I only saw her as a desperate mother trying to do whatever she can in the little time she has left to help his son's future. No matter how much it hurt her or her son.
>> ARTICLE
I still think the same. She literally ruined him for 3 years though. Even if it's desperate, I think there are limits to what she does. I mean, sure, she succeeded in pushing Kousei to be a good pianoist, but what if she didn't? She's just gonna continue to beat him up? Continue to leave his life in ruin?

I sympathise with her. Though hating her a little bit isn't something that I can avoid even if she wasn't thinking rationally. 

Man, feels nice not needing to reword anything to avoid spoilers lol.
>> ARTICLE
That's still being a terrible mother.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, but imo she pushed the "tough love" concept too far... she didn't have to *physically abuse* her own son just to make sure he becomes the best he can be. Even if he succeeded, he'd be at least somewhat emotionally scarred as we can see
>> ARTICLE
What she did wasn't a rational decision she made.  It was desperation coming out in, from what has been implied, one of her worst moments.
>> ARTICLE
Damn it, damn it, damn it. 

It did it. It broke me.

I was already holding back tears when he was finishing up his song and said "Goodbye." Then he, his teacher, and her daughter started crying.

"Do you think it reached her?"

"Of course it reached her."


Dead. That broke me.

 I love this show.
>> ARTICLE
I thought we were clear of the whole mom thing. But I'm glad we weren't. This was a truly beautiful conclusion to that difficult part of his life. All sorts of feels were had. 

That said, the death flag factory Kaori seems to have ramped up production. She isn't even in the episode for more than 10 seconds and we still manage to get MORE death flags for her. There has got to be a revelation soon, so that the audience isn't the only people who know she's about to die. 
>> ARTICLE
Motherfucker...

This is a show about music, so why is it making me so GODDAMN SAD.
>> ARTICLE
Because music is emotional and when emotional things are emotional with emotional music it multiplies the feels.
>> ARTICLE
That episode was wayyy too much for me to handle. I stopped reading the manga when he started to play because I wanted to see it animated and those 2 months of wait were totally worth.

I cried so hard each time we saw [Kousei's mother](http://i.imgur.com/XJcWhXE.png) and we finally get her reasoning as to why she was so tough with him.

[The flashbacks were also](http://i.imgur.com/Yy5Hhod.png) [really heartwarming.](http://i.imgur.com/wSn55q5.png)

[Kousei's playing was just amazing, I had chills the whole performance.](http://i.imgur.com/RxHvx2A.png)

I'm really excited to see [the next competition between Kousei, Eimi and Takeshi.](http://i.imgur.com/x5aEXlo.png)

[Please no more deathflags.](http://i.imgur.com/I1Rwgj8.png) That "He might have to lose someone to move forward." is foreshadowing something atrocious.
I won't handle it if she dies and Kousei will be destroyed if that happened.
>> ARTICLE
"Pushed him so hard" =/= beat him so hard.

I still think what she did is unforgivable, and that's she a weak and selfish person.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a grown ass man! I ain't crying no bitch tears! I swear...
>> ARTICLE
Its these damned spooky ghost chefs cutting those damned ghost onions in my room. I swear I'm not tearing up at all....
>> ARTICLE
I don't get how losing someone else will help Kousei move forward.  His growth is spurred by sadness? What a weird philosophy.  I thought he moved forward a lot just with this performance.

Edit: Just to expand on this some more: I feel like this sentiment was completely antithetical to the course of the story so far.  If anything, Kousei completely shut down his growth because of the traumatic death of his mother.  It's only now that he's experienced the joy of life that Kaori brought back to him that he's slowly started moving forward again.  Kaori's death would only stunt his growth further, in my opinion.  I think the adults are misreading Kousei's renewed growth as something his mother's death gave to him after he was gone for a few years, but he wouldn't even be on stage again without Kaori.  Kaori is the impetus for everything he's doing right now.

Also, [this point of view shot](http://i.imgur.com/VESRNmv.png) in particular was really tear-inducing.
>> ARTICLE
I think there's a huge line that the show is putting forth for Kousei's artistry.  When Kousei was young, he was extremely technical but conveyed no emotion.  They called him the human metronome.  While playing in competitions like that will net you high praises, it isn't what makes a musician an artist.

What they're getting at is that Kousei's mother's death has finally given him the ability to put emotion into his performance.  Her death has inspired him to play this way.  What the lady was saying is that if sorrow is the only thing that inspires him to the extent that his mother's death inspired him, the only way to move forward is more of the same.

> Kousei completely shut down his growth because of the traumatic death of his mother

I think this is completely backwards.  If you remember his original performance that inspired the little girl, he was playing emotionally.  That is why she started her path to a career as a pianist.  As his mother grew ill and pushed him harder, his technicality completely overrode the emotion that was once there.  While yes, he grew as a technical musician, his artistry was completely hampered.  

> Kaori's death would only stunt his growth further

Why?  I somewhat agree with the women's conversation.  I think it will enhance his performances if he doesn't have some kind of emotional block like his mother gave him.  I think that another block is unlikely.
>> ARTICLE
Kousei says himself that the reason he has come back to the stage is so "he can see that sight one more time": the sight of Kaori playing so freely on the stage.

I think there's a part of Kousei that would never want to play piano again if Kaori died.  Piano would be attached to the two greatest tragedies of his life at that point.  His mother dying basically wiped out his ability to hear musical notes.  I have no idea what Kaori dying would do to him, but I really doubt it would further his progress as a musician.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more about being able to deal with all obstacles in life and use them to grow as a person and musician. Just in this case he happened to become attached to a walking death flag and is going to have to deal with that impending doom. And if he can learn to deal with it without running away from music, he will become an extraordinary musician. 

But that's just my $0.02

>> ARTICLE
> this point of view shot in particular was really tear-inducing.

That one was good. The one that got me was [this one](http://i.imgur.com/U9KqdcW.png) through his glasses.

I think they're referencing the idea that artists need pain to create their best work. You can't play your best until you have to play.

## Episode 13 List of Classical Performances:

This week's main performance was Kousei's performance of Rachmaninoff's transcription of Kreisler's *Liebesleid*.  It was the subject of last week's post, so you can check that out if you want to know a little more about the background of the piece.  As promised, here's [Earl Wild's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC67lQpAqpA) and [Jorge Bolet's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMbp5OTgW00) interpretations of Rachmaninoff's transcription of Liebesleid (They sound pretty similar, but I had to share both wonderful performances; Also, the Bolet link includes the performance of *Liebesfreud* in case you want to know what ''Love's Joy'' sounds like.)

This week, we heard a couple more pieces courtesy of the continuing violin Gala concert and the piece Kousei was playing towards the end of the episode.

It took me a while to figure out the identity of the piece Miike played for his performance.  I then happened to remember that I heard this piece in [Nodame Cantabile](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1698/Nodame_Cantabile), and from there I discovered the name of the piece (for those of you interested, this is played in Episode 15).

**Elgar: Violin Sonata in E Minor, Opus 82** - "Elgar wrote his Violin Sonata in E minor, Op. 82, in 1918, at the same time as he wrote his String Quartet in E minor and his Piano Quintet in A minor. These three chamber music works were all written at "Brinkwells", the country house near Fittleworth in West Sussex that Lady Elgar had acquired for her husband to recuperate and compose in, and they mark his major contribution to the chamber music genre. His Cello Concerto in E minor of 1919 completed the quartet of introspective and melancholy works that comprised Elgar's last major creative spurt before his death in 1934.

The Violin Sonata is scored for the usual combination of violin and piano, and has three movements:

*  [Allegro: Risoluto (as interpreted by Trynkos/Latsabidze)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49z16AD-1Y)
*  [Romance: Andante (as interpreted by Trynkos/Latsabidze)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9tYPfVMwSw)
*  [Allegro non troppo (as interpreted by Trynkos/Latsabidze)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9eIdjNB3uc)

Elgar's wife noted that the slow movement seemed to be influenced by the 'wood magic' or genii loci of the Fittleworth woods.

When the sonata was close to completion, Elgar offered to dedicate it to a family friend, Marie Joshua, and wrote to her: "I fear it does not carry us any further but it is full of golden sounds and I like it, but you must not expect anything violently chromatic or cubist". Marie Joshua died four days after receiving the letter, before she had had an opportunity to reply. As a tribute to her memory, Elgar quoted the dolcissimo melody from the slow movement just before the coda of the final movement.

The Violin Sonata in E minor was completed on 15 September 1918, and first performed on 21 March 1919 at a British Music Society meeting, by Elgar's great friend W. H. Reed, with Landon Ronald on piano. The first public performance occurred in June 1919. Albert Sammons and William Murdoch were the sonata's greatest champions in the early years, and they made the first recording, on 2 February 1935. (It was also Sammons who made the first complete recording of Elgar's Violin Concerto in B minor.)

The Violin Sonata has never had a reputation as one of Elgar's great works, and it features irregularly on concert programs." [(Source)](http://bit.ly/1KU2ZkT)

**Chopin: Nocturne in D-flat Major, Opus 27, No. 2** - "This exquisite piece, in one continuous mood, is the essence of fioritura. It is a favorite nocturne but demands a highly developed technical skill. Professor Niecks was fearful of the power of this luscious work: Nothing can equal the finish and delicacy of execution, the flow of gentle feeling lightly rippled by melancholy, and spreading out here and there in smooth expansiveness. But all this sweetness enervates, there is poison in it. We should not drink in these thirds, sixths, et cetera, without taking an antidote of Bach or Beethoven. Lennox Berkeley writes, A close study of this piece reveals the individuality of Chopins piano writing; the proliferation of the arabesques that embellish the theme are of a kind that is his own invention, bearing little resemblance to the work of any other composer. The melody is violinistic, yet to transcribe the piece is to destroy its very essence. It can only be sung upon the piano." [(Source)](http://chopinsociety.org/the-nocturnes#noct272)

With regards to the structure of the Nocturne itself, [Wikipedia](http://bit.ly/1yps3LG) had the following to say:

"The Nocturne in D-flat major is initially marked as *lento sostenuto* and is in 6/8 meter. It consists of two strophes, repeated in increasingly complex variations. The piece is 77 measures long.

Blair Johnson calls the main cadence, near the end of the piece, "one of the most glorious moments in Chopin's entire output". Johnson also calls the piece "one of [Chopin's] most graceful essays in fioritura ornamental practices".  Huneker states that the piece "really contains but one subject, and is a song of the sweet summer of two souls, for there is obviously meaning in the duality of voices."  He also claims that the piece is "harmonically most interesting".  Friskin states that the piece contains "broken rhythms and slurs which require a delicate hand touch"."

You can hear an interpretation of this piece by [Mauricio Pollini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cxkLZoEFEk) (if you like it a "little fast") or by [Artur Rubenstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ8RVjm49hE) (if you like it a "little slow").

This week's episode made me cry (more than I cried when I read this part in the manga).  Kousei's farewell to his mother through his performance of Liebesleid was executed beautifully.  It hurt seeing how she was so harsh on him because she wanted to make sure he could support himself with his music, and it was great to see Kousei finally admit to himself that his mother's ghost was nothing more than something he created as an excuse to run away from the piano.  [We will see Kousei (**MAJOR [and I do mean MAJOR] Manga Spoiler; READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!**)](/s "do something very similar at the end of the story in a future piano competition where he says his very emotional and tearful farewell to Kaori while playing Chopin's Ballade No. 1.") We ended the episode with quite the death flag.  With all of the death flags we've seen so far, coupled with the implied similarities to Kousei's mother, it's hard to see Kaori alive by the time this story over.  As you may have guessed, Kaori's health will become quite the hot topic...soon.  Before we get to that, though, Kousei will have to deal with [a certain impostor](/s "Aizawa Nagi (aka Takeshi's younger sister and the blonde loli that we see in the new opening)") before we can have permission from Arakawa-sensei to go on a few more feels trips.

Thanks again for taking the time to read my post this week! I hope you're looking forward to next week's episode as much as I am! :-)

Loved this episode. I cried tears of joy, and tears of sadness. Love this anime so much.
>> ARTICLE
"I play it so you'll get used to sorrow."

Beautiful and touching as this show has been, it didn't break me until that line.  Kousei and his mother clearly cared for each other a lot and had their touching moments before and while he was learning to play.  While I can see where his mother was coming from now she still took it too far.  Hitting a child is rarely okay and drawing blood never is.

As much as I'm dreading Kaori's inevitable fate (seriously, they couldn't make it more obvious) I want to see how Kousei gets through it.

Yeah, she talks about how she wish she could spend more time with him, but then the short time she did have with him she chose to beat him during it... Great parenting, no sorrow from me!
>> ARTICLE
She felt that violence, her last ditch effort, would be the only way to push him further than she was already.

I'm not saying it's right, nor am I saying we should pity her.  
>> ARTICLE
There's still an interesting perspective brought on by it. Being a mother who has a terminal illness while her son is still so youngthere literally could not be a worse feeling in the world. That is about as sorrowful as it gets.
>> ARTICLE
Forgiving someone is different than understanding someone and feeling bad for them. I feel bad and sad for his Mom because her time running out  forced her to be desperate and do the only thing she can think of to help her son's future. In her eyes it would be better for him to endure a year or so of physical abuse rather than being broke and poor for the rest of his life. She didn't enjoy hurting him. She didn't enjoy dying on him. She hurt just as much if not more but she felt like they both had to endure it for his sake. Which is why I feel sorry and sad for her. No mother should ever be forced to become that desperate. People become desperate when they are losing what's most important to them, in this case, her son.

Just an example that might be relevant even if a lot more extreme would be when a parent kills their child just before they are captured to be raped and slaved in some movies. Not the right thing to do in any way, but understandable.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. First real tears of the season. That was a really great conclusion to Arima's mother issues.

However, it seems as one door closes, another one opens. Seeing Miyazono at the end, hooked up just like Arima's mother... it's pretty jarring. Really bad timing*, after just having said a proper farewell to his mother, to be presented with this.


^*Not ^that ^there's ^really ^a ^good ^time ^for ^it.

Nice and all that Kousei could end his shit with his mom, but wtf piano teacher. 
Kousei doesnt need sorrow to fucking grow cus he's a fukkin badass.

Okay.. this is what I think will happen in the rest of the series. All speculations:

Kaori becomes more sick, they grow more towards eachother and fall in love. Kousei keeps playing, however, this time not as a metronome to satisfy his mother but he plays to move people, especially Kaori. He plays for the sake of Kaori, she watches him play from "his mothers spot" in a wheelchair. Kaori survives after the harsh battle, they live happily ever after and get many children. The end.

At first I was about to roll my eyes when he was underwater and couldn't hear the music but it turned out to go in a great direction. One of the most powerful episodes yet! His final resolution with his mom was pretty touching.

Just wondering, how many of you actually cry?

I mean cry like a river, not just teary eyes and then typing on the internet that you actually cried.

Honestly, I only got as far as a heavy feeling in the throat and teary eyes (same as when you yawn). I can't imagine people crying pho real.
>> ARTICLE
So, like, last week I was kind of down on the show, but somehow...SOMEHOW...this episode just *worked* for me.

It's kind of inexplicable, how I can be totally disengaged one week and totally emotionally involved the next. Like, this was just so relieving to watch because we've got 12 episodes of tension over this one issue in Kousei's life and now we get to watch it all flush out in a burst of song and in his tears.

This is pretty moving stuff, and I think it works because there's an emotional mass of the past episodes that we can draw on, even if our brains are chirping things at us like "Too much monologue from Hiroko."

It's always impressive when a show can overcome its weaker technical aspects by leaning on its strengths, and *KimiUso*, I think, does that on pretty much a weekly basis.

EDIT: [Full episode notes](http://mageinabarrel.com/2015/01/15/your-lie-in-april-episode-13/) if you care for them.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was just so beautiful. And I nearly teared up when the ending song started playing. Everything was emotional in this one and I could feel it.
>> ARTICLE
Ughhh the ending, why.
>> ARTICLE
This was definitely the best episode in a while, nice to just have Kousei on his own. Still waiting for Kaori to take her leave.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was in my opinion *really* well done in terms of making you feel a lot of emotions. 
They showed us how his mother felt, how much she actually loved him and how much sorrow it brought to her that she could not continue to supervise him for the rest of her life. 

This episode was especially good for me because it had that one line which let the feelings inside me implode.

"Did you get to see Saki again"... I cried like a little Bitch.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the [void](http://youtu.be/BRsZeJVN3wE?t=3m21s), and this was not even the last episode yet. It's been a really long time since a show's been able to get so many emotions out of me in a single episode.
>> ARTICLE
Still sighing a lot about how Kaori is probably gonna die, because that is just lazy as fuck. I loved this episode, just. I wish it was all leading to a different ending.
>> ARTICLE
I only have one thing to say about the final few seconds of the episode:

FFFFFFUCK OFF.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like a masochist watching this show.

Not only Kousei, but you have to give Tsubaki.... I'm done for today
>> ARTICLE
What I found interesting is that Kousei was a genius even before his mother's super strict training. Did he really learn how to play just by watching his mom do it?
>> ARTICLE
I'm no longer mentally stable after this shit.

And i swear, if they kill off Kaori i'm going to sink into a low life of painkillers and depression.
>> ARTICLE
Don't think I'll cry so much again at another anime episode EVER. This episode was perfect, even more foreshadowing.. wouldn't be a Shigatsu episode without it!
>> ARTICLE
They keep not-so-subtly hinting that Kaori will die and I am *not* okay with it.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was just so powerful and moving. Kousei was finally able to put the past behind him, but a present challenge emerges.

Also, does anyone not get what Tsubaki is feeling? Does she not like Kousei anymore, or does she realize that she is outclassed by Kaori? Or is she disappointed that Kousei doesn't need her emotional support anymore?

Kaori is going to die. I know it. 
>> ARTICLE
So, this episode shows Arima finally got over her mother's passing and reconciled posthumously through music. That's great, tears of joy, applause all around. Then BAM! Tsubaki's suffering, Kaori gets hospitalized and looks pale as a ghost, and the two mentors talk about how Arima always has an ever-present sorrow hanging over his music. We're like the concert audience after he finished playing. Shocked and in awe, but instead of applauding and feeling great afterwards, we applaud through our tears and feels! AND STILL WANT MORE!
>> ARTICLE
Man I was not ready not even a bit. I was all happy and excited then BAM the feels...

All it could make me think is that I don't want to let down my own mother.
>> ARTICLE
In the public bus right now, just finished this episode in a jam packed bus.

Didn't expect a tear to almost leak out.

You know, that hospital scene isn't going to soften things. I don't know what's going to happen next, but if they're trying to make something positive out of the goddamn death flags, IT'S TEARING MY HEART.

This episode definitely delivered the powerful emotions. Although, I was a bit disappointed with a couple of key moments that I was really looking forward to. The dialogue didn't quite deliver like the manga did in those two moments.

Oh my god. Those sick bastards! The series ends in April if it's a 24 episode series... If they let Kaori die in April I'll be pretty damn furious. She's the only girl in any anime that made me see the world in color! And putting April in the name to end in April is just too thought out for her death.
>> ARTICLE
Great show, but the random comedy is honestly getting annoying. For me at least. It's fine to have comedy but I wish they didn't just shoehorn it in there in between super dramatic feely scenes.

And I'm surprised Kaori didn't die yet

I tear up, ever single episode of this show. Toying with my emotions! I hated the mom, but now I see a bit of the struggle. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never ever been close to tears from watching an anime. Clannad was like nothing, Anohana was pretty close, but for some reason, this episode had me watery-eyed. I think it has to do with Kousei's relationship to his mother. I have had the fortune of not having experienced someone as close to me as my mother passing away. But *this* was strong enough to make me think about what it would be like. How I would handle it, how devastated I would be if I lost my mother. Seeing Kousei cope with it, along side Hiroko's attempt to comfort him only to give in and begin crying herself. The thought of experiencing this made me incredibly sad. Extremely powerful, and I have a feeling it just might get stronger. 
>> ARTICLE
This anime constantly has me on the verge of tears damn it T.T I love how Kosei was finally able to get his inner demons out. Sigh...but just seeing Kaori in the hospital... I know this emotional roller coaster is only just getting started :(

And on this weekly Shigatsu wa Kimi no Feels/Your Feels in April:

He did it! He got over the trauma of his mother by himself! Like I said on an earlier discussion thread, the fact that it happened the way it did adds a **lot** to his character. Based Kousei.

Death flags? Where this story is going, we don't need death flags.

Also... poor Tsubaki. The more of childhood friend they are, the more they are destined to fall.

Goosebumps all over in this episode; manly tears were shed.
>> ARTICLE
I think that at this point the feel train just turned into the International Space Feels Station. 

Such a wonderful episode, how he closes a chapter in his life. Growing up, as Tsubaki notices...

As for Kaori, i just don't know anymore. Her death is to be expected, but if they tease it so much, how do they plan to make it devastating?

This show is so depressing. But I like it so, so, so, so, so much.

Wow I admit I get teary eyed pretty easily but this is the first episode I've seen in some time that hit me this hard. Beautiful episode, so much sadness but he finally can close the chapter with his mother. Unfortunately it looks like another tragedy is right around the corner.
>> ARTICLE
Will we ever make it through an episode without Kousei sobbing?
>> ARTICLE
Damnit. I told myself I wouldn't cry while watching cartoons anymore.
>> ARTICLE
That was probably one of the best episodes of any anime I've seen. I know its a show based around music but GOD DAMN that was some amazing sound that episode. There was just so much emotion happening all at once, and it was so incredibly beautiful I don't even have the proper words for it.

Kousei just finally said his last farewell to his mother how many years later? And now Kaori is in the hospital with a bad case of the deads. How many years do you think it will take for him to say goodbye to her? What will that performance sound like? If I teared up quite a bit this episode what will happen to me in the next 10 or however many are left? Will I be reduced to a sobbing mess on the floor? I don't even think I'd mind. Anime that can make you feel as strong emotions as this one are very rare, and I treasure them greatly.
>> ARTICLE
Made the mistake of watching this right before going to work, almost called in sick ;__;
>> ARTICLE
I seriously can not handle any more death flags. It's just too much.

You gotta just stop it, please...

(In other news that was a pretty heartfelt goodbye to his Mom, and when it was over and Kousei cried, I found myself in tears as well, but it was kind of a ~~kuma~~ shock to me as I didn't realize how that would make me feel)

Aww damn, my favourite scene of the manga so far, they did it really well.. Too many damn feels

This episode was AMAZING.  It was very emotionally moving for me, no tears but jesus christ was I feeling it.  It was nice to see the MC come to terms with his mother and see her good side amongst the rocky later years of her life.  The abuse can never be justified but at least it wasn't because she wanted to be a prick and was sadistic.  If this episode can move me though, i just know now that later on it's definitely going to have an effect on me.  Funny thing is I finished Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 not too long ago, I can't seem to get away from the emotional shows lately lol.

I realize no one's really going to read this but I just wanted to really type out my thoughts while I was enjoying the episode.

* **Look At Me** - Gotta say that was a really well delivered part. The way each of them said it leading to Kousei was really satisfying. He really has serious guts to go on stage by himself. 
* **Traumatic** - God, seeing Kousei huddle in that corner is pretty heart breaking. 
* **Kid** - I feel bad for that kid that's waiting his turn considering he can't really follow up on a accompaniment that played miraculously solo and captured the audience. I really feel bad for him, looks like he's going to cry watching off stage. 
* **Goodbye** - That was a really strong exit as he moved on and walked off stage. It was really satisfying.
* **Poor Miike-kun** - I really feel for him being scared. However, the way he's grasped his courage and adapted to playing softer was really great. 
* **Tsubaki's Feelings** - Gotta say that I love how strong these scenes are. The thumps really sound good at bringing the mood and just the way her voice dominates the sound really did well to convey herself. 
* **Tragedy** - The way tragedy has been striking, I wonder if he's going to break again. I really don't think he's going to be strong enough to last another hit. I mean, he'll eventually get through it, but we'll end up with another big long development as he struggles through repeated loss. That's my theory currently.

Either way, I'm still loving this series with the color, sound, and powerful story telling. This series so far has really been top notch and I continue to look forward to more episodes.

Ahh, that was perfect.

Only one person matters to you, Kousei? Isn't that a little harsh to Tsubaki and Watari?

Actually, it feels like Kousei kind of replaced his mother with Kaori as "the one person that matters". I really hope there's not a parallel being drawn there with the illness.

> This show's really good at conveying emotions

Eh. It'd be better at it if it wasn't constantly reminding us how to feel with the repetitive monologues (and the visuals).
>> ARTICLE
This is honestly why I keep coming back week to week. I adore the visual imagery of Kousei's emotions. Theres something to it thats so gripping.
>> ARTICLE
> This show's really good at conveying emotions

I can't tell if this show just reduces me to a mushy person because I relate to the struggle of musicians or what. But let me tell you something, this show moves me close to tears every episode. It's not like this show is inherently sad or anything, it's just the show itself is amazing. It's perfect and beautiful and it does everything right. It's scenes are packed with emotions and it's so beautiful that it literally moves me to tear up by the end of every episode.

I've never watched a show that conveys emotion this well in it's characters. I feel that NGE did the best job with showing perfect human interaction from an emotional standpoint but this show CONVEYS those emotions flawlessly, so much that, as I have already said, it moves me to tears. 

AOTY for sure, it's already made #3 on my top 10 and it's not even halfway in. I know it's probably going to beat Clannad+AS for my #2 spot and it's going to give NGE a run for it's money for my top place for sure.
>> ARTICLE
I've still got F/SN, Parasyte and Amagi at the top but this season is too god damned good for me to decide what tops the year. I'm there with ya though.
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong, this is definitely anime of the season, and I love absolutely everything about this show, but I don't know if it will be anime of the year for me. Ping Pong: the Animation was just too good, with very deep and emotional characters (much like NGE) and one of the most satisfying endings I've seen to date. 

Also I'm a competitor myself, so I can really relate to both shows (but mainly Ping Pong, because it gets more into the competing side of it and individual mindsets instead of the more "falling from grace/finding yourself" side like YLIA does). Your Lie in April is definitely the second best of the year for me though, waiting a week for each episode is gonna kill me.

Hmm, I don't know if it'll be the same for you, but in my case, a show that had a similar vibe and brought me to tears every single episode was Silver Spoon.

Seriously, I stopped breathing like 3 times.

I think a part of that is because there's so many deathflags everywhere. Miyazono Kaori already looks like she has health issues and may burn up quick as a genius who sparkles brightly and briefly. 

Even with Kousei who has a lot of direct influence on his friends and potential girlfriends, who knows what can happen if a lot of these characters lose the one inspiration they have? I don't want any of the characters to die, but it actually may take the story in interesting places if either Kaori or Kousei is done for good.

That's why some of these major performances kind of unnerves me considering they almost feel like their last performances in terms of drama.

It's really in the masterful direction of A-1 Pictures, because the manga of this show doesn't really have this level of tension there.

It's the extended scenes that flesh out every single aspect of the character's emotions. This dragged time a little longer so the tension was built, and we were continuously kept immersed thanks to the dialogues and metaphorical visuals.

I wasn't stressed at all this elisode because we all knew Arima was going to have problems with his performance.

Who would've thought an entire episode focusing on Arima playing one song could feel so *immersive*? I just love this show so much!
>> ARTICLE
> I just sat there in awe, marveling at the beauty of both the visual metaphors and the inner monologues expressing the characters' feelings.

You sound like me every week. This show has the best narrative and presentation of story I've ever seen, and I mean that, it has the best of those out of all anime I've seen. I've already rated it at ten and at this rate it might beat out Clannad+AS and NGE as my top 2. This show is definitely an AOTY winner for me.
>> ARTICLE
>You sound like me every week. This show has the best narrative and presentation of story I've ever seen

It's such an artistic method of conveying thoughts and emotions, which while not realistic, is suited perfectly for this musically focused story. Though because of that lack of realism I can definitely see it not being for everyone. 

>This show is definitely an AOTY winner for me.

It's pushing towards AOTY for me too. I also love Parasyte this season and Barakamon was amazing during the summer(was it summer?). I'm sure there's a few more I'm forgetting at the moment. Frickin hangover. 
>> ARTICLE
> Though because of that lack of realism I can definitely see it not being for everyone.

Very true. I'm glad they went with this approach though, obviously not realistic but it's the perfect narration in my mind.

> I also love Parasyte this season

Parasyte was close to this one, but within the past 2-3 weeks Shigatsu put it in the dust.

> Frickin hangover.

Eggnog and Crown Royal should clear that up, it's my go to morning drink!
>> ARTICLE
>Parasyte was close to this one, but within the past 2-3 weeks Shigatsu put it in the dust.

Parasyte's been at it's best over the last three episodes too. Lookin like it'll continue to be intense next week. Who's best girl? Kana or Murano?

>Eggnog and Crown Royal should clear that up, it's my go to morning drink!

I'll take my eggnog and whiskey separate, please. I love both, but not together. My go to cure is a couple of fried eggs, refried beans, cheese, hot salsa, and a generous portion of guacamole. Served with OJ. 
>> ARTICLE
> Who's best girl? Kana or Murano?

I CAN'T TELL YET THEY'RE BOTH SO BEST GIRL LIKE! I want to say Kana because underdog, but Murano has great qualities as well! For now Kana, but it's so close I feel wrong deciding. It's nothing like Trinity Seven where Levi is leagues ahead of the rest.

> I love both, but not together.

Good to see we're on the same page like we are with Trinity Seven...although I do rank Mira as a close second now. I'm leaning ever so slightly Kana right now for Parasyte but I like them both a lot. What anime's discussion thread are we in again? :P

>[It's like I don't know you anymore](https://38.media.tumblr.com/a4084286fc4cd1b0c367001631145675/tumblr_mutrgz9GB81siudfjo1_500.gif), you've become so cold!

Daijoubu, Murano...I'm still the same but perhaps you didn't know me to begin with. Half the time when we're exchanging messages I'll have my [trusty bicentennial glass filled with whiskey over ice](http://i.imgur.com/QkMf7wf.jpg) sitting right beside me. I do go through a good deal of eggnog too. 

>I just threw up a bit.

I could eat guacamole/avocados on almost *anything*. Funny enough, I hated it until I was 17 or 18 and then quickly fell in love with it. 
>> ARTICLE
> although I do rank Mira as a close second now.

I honestly still have it at Levi, Grimoire Wingwoman and then Yui still. 

> What anime's discussion thread are we in again? :P

I swear you and I end up off topic everywhere we go.

> I'm a demon from hell who hates eggnog and whiskey

So why don't you like them mixed? You like your whiskey straight more?

> I hated it until I was 17 or 18 and then quickly fell in love with it.

Probably going to be me. I hate very few things now, mainly mushrooms, tomatoes and avocados. I am starting to warm up to mushrooms as long as they are the really good ones we get from chinatown. Tomatoes are going to take time, it's that nasty texture they have. Avocados might change, can't tell yet. I used to hate beer and vodka with a fucking passion and now vodka is my favorite alcohol and beer is pretty tasty, anything can happen. I love sushi, it's my favorite food so I need to get around to liking avocado since everyone is insistent upon putting it in their rolls.

> Insert something about Shigatsu so we aren't off topic ENTIRELY

Did you read the spoiler towards the top that tells you who that character at the end is? If so, let's discuss what you think she will be like in regards to her attitude towards Kousei. If you did not, What was your favorite Etude from the performances? 
>> ARTICLE
>I honestly still have it at Levi, Grimoire Wingwoman and then Yui still.

They're all in my top 5 too, along with Arin. All of them are great though. Wait that'd be a top 6 then, eh? In that case I refuse to make a top 5. 

>So why don't you like them mixed? You like your whiskey straight more?

I've grown to love drinking my whiskey straight over ice and I don't like it any other way anymore. I have on several occasions drank a glass of whiskey and eggnog side by side, taking a sip of one here and the other there. It's especially surprising when I mix them up, thinking I grabbed the eggnog class but getting whiskey instead!

>Hates tomatoes, coming around to mushrooms. Learning to love beer and vodka.

You might never like tomatoes, but mushrooms are *amazing*. I bet you'll like them more and more. Ya almost nobody likes beer at first, but the more you drink the more it grows on you. Vodka is just an great mixer. My later HS and early college years were filled with mixed vodka beverages(most often gatorade and OJ). Good memories.  

>Spoiler up top

Yeah I saw it. I suppose if we were paying closer attention in the previous episode we would've known already.

**Edit:** It was the Kodansha manga award. My bad.

And from reading the manga, IMO it gets better from this point on. The manga is really, really good. The character that is introduced at the end of this episode adds an amazing new layer to the plot. Unfortunately the scanlation process has been really slow.

Good. This show's okay, but I definitely enjoyed the Gin no Saji anime more than this one so far.

Well it looks like Kousei has been able to heal the damage that his mother left. The scene of her smiling melted my heart. But this brings back that theme that has been quiet for a while...Kaori's health. How will her illness affect Kousei now that she is his reason to play? I sense feels and heartbreak on the horizon. 

ALSO, who is that woman? a new teacher perhaps?(Don't spoil me manga readers please!)
>> ARTICLE
> Kaori's health. How will her illness affect Kousei now that she is his reason to play?

He has two obstacles now, her illness and Watari.
>> ARTICLE
I think its that women that tells his mother to stop beating Kousei on the previous episode, not 100% sure tho, she seems to know him from before and seems related to music, so that's my first assumption.
>> ARTICLE
Most likely Kaori's illness/death(probably inevitable at this point) will cause Kousei to lose his ability to play piano again, however with his friends help he'll learn that he can still play the piano for her or her memory and he'll be even better than before.

edit:I'm stupid
>> ARTICLE
> Most likely Kousei's illness/death(probably inevitable at this point) will cause Kousei to lose his ability to play piano

Yeah most likely. People often lose their ability to play the piano when they die.

haha, whoops I guess I should fix that

> The scene of her smiling melted my heart.

Just reading that sentence floods me with feels.

Watch after the credits!

Alright who was that clapping at the very end? Could it be an estranged relative of Arima's? How much do we know about his family other than his mother being dead?
>> ARTICLE
For some reason I have a feeling it's a sister, they look very alike.
>> ARTICLE
Ya that was my first thought too. The hell's she been though? Has she ever been mentioned before?
>> ARTICLE
dont think shes been mentioned, wonder why
>> ARTICLE
She was the lady seen accompanying Kousei's mother in the flashback last episode but with longer hair at the time, at least, that's what I believe.
>> ARTICLE
She might be his aunt.
>> ARTICLE
I like Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. I really do. It's in my top 3 this season even. I think the flashbacks and thoughts are a bit too excessive now. It feels like the pacing has gone to a crawl recently.

With all that said, I still liked the episode. Kousei can finally play the piano properly again and he got rid of his inner conflicts. The transition to the ED gave me goosebumps. It was really good.
>> ARTICLE
> I think the flashbacks and thoughts are a bit too excessive now

Well it's an Manga adaptation, what else could they do when playing piano beside flashbacks and thoughts? This manga was just meant to be adapted by an Anime though.  
Maybe he wanted to make something like this into an Anime, but he didn't get accepted or something? So he just went ahead to make a Manga in the hopes of it being adapted. 
>> ARTICLE
Heard it's 2 chapters per episode, and will adapt all of the manga. Pretty slow, but better this than cutting content.
>> ARTICLE
> It feels like the pacing has gone to a crawl recently

What? I think the pacing is good. While things aren't happening, it's substituted with extensive showing of how he's working through his inner issues, and the show's doing a great job of it.
>> ARTICLE
I think the slow pace works for the show.  I personally like it.
>> ARTICLE
I not only like it, I think that it's absolutely perfect pacing and the show would lose significant meaning if it was paced any other way.
>> ARTICLE
I like it, it fits the show pretty well, but maybe his mother calling out on him 10 times isn't the way to go
>> ARTICLE
Well I personally think it served its purpose. It was repeated for effect, for how much he couldn't get away from the fact that he blamed himself for his mother's death, which is of course completely irrational even though it does make sense. He had an obsession with seeking kindness in his mother's cruelty by playing the piano well and winning competitions for her. Then, when it finally gets to be too much for him to deal with he tells her to go and die, and she promptly does die immediately afterwards. If that happens to you as a kid, it would have to stick with you for quite a while.

So he punished himself, he subconsciously told himself that he didn't deserve to be able to play the piano, to be able to hear it, by telling himself "This is your punishment". It was half his mother's doing and half self-imposed. The repetition was meant to cause the viewer to feel excruciatingly stressed out. "Come on, this is enough, stop doing this to yourself". I imagine that's how the people watching him in the audience felt, at least the ones who knew him and cared about him.

So it was painful to watch, but hey, so is a lot of Welcome To The NHK. It's not for everyone. It's about watching a guy deal with life in the worst way possible, and a lot of the time you're going "Why are you doing this to yourself....please stop...please, I can't take this anymore. STOP IT."  However, that's also why it's compelling to watch. In a lot of cases, people can relate to having something psychologically holding them back from moving on as a person, and it's not always easy to break free from.

However, whether this is effective storytelling and whether it's enjoyable to watch are two completely different things, so I can COMPLETELY understand where you're coming from. I just think it's an understandable story design choice. It made sense within the context of the story. His inability to break free made it feel that much more worthwhile when he was able to break free, and made it much more powerful considering the reason he was able to break free. It's cheesy, but the thing holding him back the most was this complex he had where he felt neglected or he felt like there was a lack of love. He felt like he didn't deserve nice things. So it made sense that it was when he was filled with admiration and love for another person that he was able to make a breakthrough of some sort.

I am VERY sorry for the essay, but I just felt like explaining why I thought that it *was* the way to go.
>> ARTICLE
People need to write more of these essays. It's enjoyable to read, and that way I can relive the anima again from a different standpoint! Thanks dude

It's a little excruciating to watch week by week (more because I'm anxious for the next episode than actually feeling it's too slow), but if I were marathoning this it would be perfect.

It take so, so, so, so much to make me want to cry. It rarely happens. Only in the most profound moments of the best anime will make me feel this way. And in this episode, it totally did.

That dialogue between Watari and Arima at the beginning was really nice. The way they depicted Arima being unable to hear the notes was great, when I was reading the manga I didn't know exactly how to "visualize" that.

[Not sure if spoiler](/s "knowing her reasoning will help a lot in understanding why she was like that and thus not really hating her! Hang in there guys!")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I'll ever be able to not hate her, though. Understand her motives? Sure, if the story gives them to me. But at the same time, that kind of treatment is literally unforgivable. There is no room for mercy there, no matter the reasons.
>> ARTICLE
I beg the differ. Her reason was something I never thought of. Something far too realistic to see in a story. Which is why I felt same all of you before reading it! Hopefully they'll show it in the next episode or the one after!
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm going to do my best to keep an open mind but as of right now I still don't believe you.
>> ARTICLE
Yeaaaahhhhh I don't think anything you tell me about her can make me feel bad for a woman who abused her child when he was just trying to make her happy. Not unless somehow she was preventing all of mankind from extinction by beating him in public and making him bleed.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the same before I found out what it was.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, no. No realistic reason is good enough to be abusive to a child.
>> ARTICLE
No, but there are some that make it understandable.
>> ARTICLE
Understand, sure. Sympathise? No way in hell.  
^(I should note I'm a victim of child abuse so my comments are biased)
>> ARTICLE
I am not a victim and I agree with your statement. There is a limit to disciplinary actions, and this is coming from someone who is an active supporter of disciplinary actions.

Even if we sympathise, it's not a justification.

I was in the middle of studying for my exams tomorrow but i had to watch this instantly, it's the only anime that can directly make me stop what i'm doing. I'm in love with thursdays just because of Shigatsu.

Man that episode was sooooooooo amazing, i had already read this chapter but it was still so impressive. I'm so glad the cliffhanger wasn't in the middle of this episode, i would've cried.

He expressed the feelings he had for Kaori-chwan in front of every one (it was so cute when he said that he was going to play piano only for her). I don't want anything bad to happen to her with her illness and all T-T 

AND we get to see that woman at the end, i'm not going to spoil anything but she is pretty dope.
>> ARTICLE
Lol @ the people who thought this was going to be a terrible music anime :)

This show never fails to impress me with how pretty it is.

That episode made my heart melt, he's back. The one and only ARIMA KOUSEI! Seeing his mum smile right at the end was wonderful.

I can't help but feel something might happen later on in the anime to Kaori-chan, plsssss :(

Don't forget to watch after the credits guys, there's a little bit extra!

*When his mom smiled at the end...*

^Where ^did ^these ^damn ^tears ^come ^from!

Essentially, that was the best confession scene I've ever seen in anime.

I held it together, all the way through, then his mum smiled, and it suddenly started to rain...
>> ARTICLE
Guys... I actually started to cry...  The imagery was beautiful...  I just wish we actually got to hear more and not with violin and so forth...  Also, A teacher at the end to work with him?!?!?
>> ARTICLE
So much emotion, so many feels. The symbolism in this show is outstanding. Cannot wait to see where it advances to next! 
>> ARTICLE
Such a powerful episode. The animation when he was playing piano was really well done, you could tell they observed someone playing the actual piece because Arima was actually playing the right notes. The sheer amount of symbolism in this episode was crazy (though a bit basic). 

First off with his monologue about the stars, Arima revealed not only his inner emotions, but the feelings of his friends. The sky when he was alone seemed to consume him like his mother's ambitions, The stars with Watari were capricious just like how Watari feels about Arima, Tsubaki's were unstable, like her emotions regarding Arima, unsure of what she actually feels about him. 

Later on, we hear a violin in the background as he's playing which symbolizes the guidance and motivation that Kaori provides Arima with. In the beginning, he was playing alone, playing strictly to the score, consumed by his mother's ambition. In the middle, his playing collapses and he begins to drown in a sea of uncertainty and guilt, and finally at the end he is reborn as a pianist who has something to play for. 

This is probably my favorite episode due to all the subtle touches they've added. There's nothing more satisfying than analyzing and actually finding something significant.
>> ARTICLE
This show... This fucking show!

I didn't know music could bring me to tears.

The show just lifted itself up from a 10/10 to a 11/10
>> ARTICLE
"Only one person matters to me". Considering the show's ability to make me feel feels, and the heavy focus it has on character development... I'd say that's Death Flag number 2, after the mountain of pills in the last episode.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how to feel about this episode to be honest, the part where Emi "gets" his feeling was kind of a bit overboard... I mean... How can someone get something *that* specific from music. "Smell of chalk, window slightly open with sports sounds from outside, and the slight sound of someones breath while sleeping". 
>> ARTICLE
It's always been a pretty exaggerated thing when music is portrayed in almost any kind of dramatic media. A lot of extremely good musicians I know do music because it's 'fun and that they're good at it' whenever people ask why passionate with it, unlike most of these melodramatic explanations of why music is love, music is life. 

You have to kinda accept it, though, because the usual response is pretty boring for most people, but I do agree that the excess is kinda grating as someone who plays music as a hobby.

EDIT: I'm also not discrediting those who have a very personal attachment to music themselves and can relate to the scenarios in music shows like this. It's just that these kinds of people actually aren't as common as they're portrayed.
>> ARTICLE
I think that there are tiers of good musicians. People like me, who just won a few awards in high school are at the bottom. We can play a piece well and make it our own.

Then there are musicians who live for music so when they play a song it feels like you're living part of their life. It's difficult to explain if you haven't experienced it, but the music makes you feel certain emotions and puts vivid images into your head that makes you forget you're in the audience.

Major props to A-1 for a very faithful and vivid adaptation. 

I am extremely pleased that they dedicated an entire episode to Kousei and it still seemed like a short episode. 

A couple things I particularly enjoyed:

1. Watari/Kousei bonding. One of the greatest things Shigatsu does is their inclusion of the secondary main characters. 
2. I was skeptical at how they would pace it, but I am thoroughly impressed at how they spaced the flashbacks, performance, inner monologue and spectators thoughts/feelings.
3. At first I thought my ears were deceiving me because of the violin addition because it's never mentioned on hinted in the manga from what I recall, but god damn that was beautiful. 
4. They handled the triple stage evolution really, really well. I'm really impressed at how you could literally see and hear the performance changing as Kousei begins to slowly pass the hurdles of his past life and his realization to play for Kaori.

10/10 Episode. Perfection.

[Manga/Next Episode](/s "Arima's Sensei/Mother's best friend, Seto Hiroko, looks gorgeous and her daughter is so cute. I can't wait to her and Kousei's interactions.")

I feel like they picked the perfect VA for her (in the spoiler). She sounds exactly like she did in my mind when I read the manga.

Make sure to watch after the credits!

Yes! The wait is over, and we get to hear Kousei playing, and playing goddamn well!

And goddamn that ending put an enourmous smile on my face.

the ending with his mum just got me, I'm already so attached to these characters and their personal feelings that I preparing myself for an emotional breakdown at any moment.
>> ARTICLE
Make sure to watch after the credits!

Also, does anyone know the name of the background music playing after his performance? I really like how it's been played throughout the series.
>> ARTICLE
there's been so many beautiful little themes like that the entire series; that one is my favourite, closely followed by the one playing in episode 6 when Kaori and Arima are talking in the music room, and there's another in episode 8 in the buildup to Emi's performance. I hope they are all in the OST!
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know when the full OST releases?
>> ARTICLE
I think it's called Spring's Freedom or Music is Freedom, I'm not sure which. Here's a youtube cover of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoSnwZ7dGAk 
>> ARTICLE
Knew that wasnt the end of that performance, this episode was worth the wait, probably my new favorite trope with the audience in awe and silence it gets me every time, with that certain OST piece transitioning in was perfect and also was the ED slightly different this week?  

Only criticism so far is not to overdo the mother interfering, its happened twice but with this episodes conclusion hopefully there wont be anymore of that happening.  

Still have iffy feelings of her mother smiling in the end but im glad to see Kousei cutting loose from his robot personality into newound feelings he hasnt dealt with before.
>> ARTICLE
Every time I watch the illustrated hand movements when Kousei is playing piano, they're almost perfectly synced up with the animation.

I'm almost certain that they recorded the music and probably a video of the performance beforehand, but it's still impressive.
>> ARTICLE
Are there anymore performances after this? I hope the anime starts to pick up more plot wise since it seems that kousei is now over the whole mom thing.  
>> ARTICLE
I mean, music is a major part of the show; it'd be weird if the last performance was less than halfway through the show.
>> ARTICLE
Yup.

>> ARTICLE
That was beautiful, and you could tell the weight was lifted off of his shoulders.

Imagine being his age and the least thing your told your mother was you wished she would die. It haunted him, it ruined him. Finally he was able to move on and find something else to play for. Not the regret and pain that was tormenting him. Beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I was so frustrated and uncomfortable throughout most of the episode. You would think the episode was bad buts its just *that good*. I felt like I was Arima sitting there stressed out and lost and then when he found his own way it was beautiful. I didn't realize how great the episode was until the end because it really was an experience. 

Do we know who that girl was at the end? Looks like she might be related to Kousei but I'm not sure. Anyway looks like she's going to be a cool character judging by the attitude in her one line.
>> ARTICLE
So many feels this season. This is such a great anime.

This was totally worth the wait.  It was a bit slow up until now, but the imagery, the music...just came together in this episode.  Definitely bumped Your Lie in April back up in my top 3 for this season.

Almost cried when he stopped playing. The things this anime makes me feel lol. Glad we got to see the real Kousei in the end there. Wonder if that was a relative of his in the end, Aunt maybe.

Beautiful episode, fear shock acceptance and love all shown perfectly, nothing especially bad happened but waited so long for this nerves are shot and eyes are damp, applause for everyone involved. 
>> ARTICLE
what song does Arima play?

>> ARTICLE
Chopin Etude in E minor, Op.25 No. 5
>> ARTICLE
Okay..who put this bowl of chopped onions under my eyes. The emotions I had about this episode were all over the place. I felt disappointed in not the episode, but more in Arima in general. They did so well with channeling emotions and making you feel what the characters feel.
>> ARTICLE
Woah, I got a little teary-eyed here. Romance always hits me hard in the feels.

Is this how musicians confess their feelings to the one they love? Because that's a very badass way of doing it. And it obviously reached her, which made my heart all warm and fuzzy.

With the introduction of a new character this late in the season and the lack of a clear ending in sight, I'm guessing this will go on in winter too? I hope so.
>> ARTICLE
YEAAH ARIMAAA
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that was incredible when the violin started playing along with the Chopin etude. Really conveyed the feeling that Kousei felt that Kaori was "with him" at that moment in time. 
>> ARTICLE
As a musician, I can confirm. Putting the idea in your mind that you have to play for that "someone special" and ONLY that someone really brings out the best of you as a musician.

My biggest progressions as a musician happen at times of crazy crushes.


>> ARTICLE
Someone get this guy a therapist, please. IF he goes into another performance and he can't hear the notes, I'll break down.
>> ARTICLE
I feel as if this episode is partly about the question of why he plays. 

* Does he plays for his mother?

* Does he play for Kaori?

* Or does he play for himself?

They show him playing three different styles and each one represents a different person in his life. The first style was his mothers, mechanically and technically perfect, without error or fault but also stripped of all creativity or individuality. A harsh reality devoid of joy or warmth.

The second style represented himself. It showed how hollowed and ruined he had become after his mothers death. It is shaped by the years of physical, emotional and psychological abuse inflicted on him, the innocences of a young boy destroyed by a parents egotism.

The final style was moulded on Kaori. It was free from all fear and worry, a melody of peace and harmony. Into it he poured all of his feelings for her and out of it he discovers a new way of playing, the idea of creating music for the pure joy of creation rather than to please someone else or win an award.

In some ways I think of this show as being a coming of age story, he's moved from being being controlled by his mother to being free but he has no idea how to live his own life. He needs to learn who he really is and how to live his life.
>> ARTICLE
I know this is mainly me; but why is he hung up on Kaori so much, like seriously she was beating him for a misunderstanding, kept calling him "Friend A" for a while, forced him to play when he didn't want to. And to top it off she likes his      best friend (granted he does have multiple girlfriends), but still bro code much. I know she's helping him over come his issues, I...I just don't know. I guess it's one of those "you can't help who you fall in love" kind of things and just let go, move on, and enjoy the show (music). 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Kaori actually "likes" Watari. She's just playing along. Watari doesn't seem to care either way and even encouraged Arima to step up if he was interested. 
>> ARTICLE
These are manly tears, god damn it.

Rant incoming

Let me preface his by saying I'm enjoying this show. The characters are deep, and the plot is interesting. This show has some excellent visuals and the music is of course amazing, but I really can't stand how thickly they lay on the imagery and how the characters respond. How does the entire audience know that he is about to stop playing? I can buy that the other piano masters hear it, but they show random shmucks saying that he's going to stop playing. How would they know? And how does the girl piano rival(I forget her name) get that he's playing with the smell of chalk, with a sleeping companion in april? Thats extremely specific, and she got that from him playing the piano for a couple minutes? I understand that its a suspension of disbelief thing, but they go so overboard with it, the show gets hard to watch sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
> How does the entire audience know that he is about to stop playing? I can buy that the other piano masters hear it, but they show random shmucks saying that he's going to stop playing. How would they know?

He got quieter and quieter and slowed down playing.
>> ARTICLE
The fucking music though. Having the Violin fade in and out as Kousei fought his inner turmoil was absolutely wonderful. Kaori is always there to support him
>> ARTICLE
Well, that went exactly as I predicted. Kousei starts out good, eventually stops as memories of his mom become overbearing, and eventually plays amazingly as he thinks of Kaori. (I also saw his "mom" smiling at his performance coming from a mile away.)

The music's great and all, but the writing needs work.

When it started and Watari was talking about losing, I was worried that it was about Kousei and they just skipped through the rest of his performance. But I really enjoyed the rest of that episode and I continue to love this series more and more as the series progresses. Might pick up the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Amazing episode. The animation when hes playing is so magnificent. Just look at it, you can tell and see how softly hes playing, and how hard he is playing. The emotion was really high too, he no longer has to play for his mom, he has someone else to play for and hopes the emotion he puts into his play will reach her. Not to mention the mix of the piano and violin near the end was so entrancing. Arima's performance definitely not only reached Kaori, but the entire audience. They were so into it that they forgot to snap out of it after. 
>> ARTICLE
That flow of emotions from when he couldn't hear the notes, to his mom saying this was his punishment, to wanting to stop, and realizing who he really wanted to play for... that's a roller coaster of feels. This show is so good.

Well, this episode just decided it once and for all - Shigatsu is by far the best anime I've watched in a while, and stands out as my favorite anime this season, or even this year.

This episode was absolutely stellar. It makes perfect use of symbolism, art, music (oh god that soundtrack). It's just a perfectly executed emotional rollercoaster ride. I have to confess I cried a little at the ending. 

This episode is tied with Bakemonogatari #12 as my favorite episodes ever in anime. I don't know what more to say, each episode of this show leaves me absolutely speechless.

makes no sense why violins starting playing during the preformance. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to go on a tiny bit of a rant here. I know I'll be downvoted for this, but I don't care.

First off, a disclaimer: I do realize that he has some super serious issues that he is/was dealing with mentally. All of the crap he had to go through in the past that is haunting him now would break all but the strongest-willed or soulless people out there. That reason alone is probably enough to cause his failure of music.

That said, the whole "gimmick" of him not being able to hear the music and thus being unable to play properly is kinda lame. I mean, just because you can't hear your own notes doesn't mean that you are going to screw up a performance on levels that hard. Leaving out the example of Beethoven and his deafness not ruining him, not being able to hear your own notes doesn't mean that your tempo and mechanical skills would be shot. Sure, hearing yourself totally helps, but it doesn't destroy a performance.

Take practicing or warming up. Several times you see him (accurately) mock-playing his performances on the floor, hitting the invisible keys accurately. He can't hear a single note that is being played here, yet he is (and damn right should) be playing it accurately. Like I said before, just because he can't hear it doesn't mean that his muscles "no longer know where they are supposed to go." When I played music (admittedly not a piano), I could play it 100% silently and still not be off by a single bit.

Sorry about that. Whelp, here comes the downvotes! D:

**TLDR: While going through his issues is legitimately a good reason for him sucking, the whole "I can't hear the notes being the reason" is, in my opinion, a lame gimmick.**
>> ARTICLE
Not being able to  hear is not his problem.  His problem is that he is a mental basket case.


>> ARTICLE
I think you're misunderstanding something. If you actually listen to what he's playing, he isn't making any mistakes. (I have played this particular song.) It's details they are talking about. Nobody would be thinking "Hey, he sucks!" if it weren't a competition.
>> ARTICLE
+1 this, a million times over.

It's the difference between having a 8th-grade slacker read out a couple lines from King Lear, and then having James Earl Jones come in and read the same part. 

Both can have nothing inherently wrong with the actual *words* they say, but only one of those two would actually be enjoyable to listen to (assuming, of course, that you're actually into Shakespearian theatre).
>> ARTICLE
I respectfully disagree. Its true that yes, you can memorize where and when to put your fingers, the timing to hit keys, and so on. However, playing the piano is more than hitting the correct keys in the correct sequence, its also about subtle dynamics such as controlling the volume, the flow of the music, and its speed. To do that, you need to know how you currently sound like, and how the previous part you played sounds like so that you can make an accurate retard/legato/crescendo/fortissimo.

For Kousei, in this case because he can't hear the notes, he assumes he's not playing loud enough, and tries to force himself to hear the notes by slamming the keys harder, so that the sound produced is louder. 

Also, as an accompanist, when you can't hear yourself, you also don't know if your notes are in sync with the violinist. Which is why his playing seems 'rough, violent and loud', as well as uncoordinated with Kaori.

tl;dr: Not knowing how your sound like when you play the piano means you can't judge the volume and timing of your playing.

They're close, but i can't really find a good way to explain it. Then he started again. From there you really get to see the reason why I keep watching the show. The emotion. You could see it happening. You could hear him changing. Everything came together and I couldn't keep myself from tearing up. It was just so good. And then the one part that really hit me hardest. When he looks up and sees his mother, and you finally see her smile. Man. I love this show.

>> ARTICLE
I never watch this without headphones because the music and the voice-overs are very relaxing and soothing and don't forget very         (except for the Kousei's deep sea piano-ing) but at the same time very stressful to watch. It's one of those animes. It's so good and it has very good . The death flags are very anxious to think about. I don't know what'll happen to Baseball girl, Piano girl, Football boy, SSJ Pianist and especially Violin girl. Plus we've got a fairly new character introduced in the new episode at the end so that's even more intriguing. BTW does anyone know when the OST is coming out, it is die for.

Okay this show is great and it's definently one of the top 3 amine of this season. Amazing stuff. I feel like I should read the manga now 
>> ARTICLE
As much as I want to read the manga myself as well, I think I would prefer the anime for the music, the colour, and the animations...something that can't be expressed through manga.

Now that we're finally past the music contest I feel the pacing will pick up a bit which is good because whilst it's still a great show I feel the contest was really beginning to drag since we have to wait a week in between each episode.

She was chugging piles of pills in the bathroom during one of her breaks or something, almost identical to the guy's mom in the hospital chugging pills.  Pretty heavy foreshadowing of something along those lines.

Man, I've really grown to these character styles. I watched this in the beginning and thought that the lips looked off. Now, it is one of my favorite character designs.

* Tsubaki's monologue is... painful. I feel bad for her unrequited love even though I like Kaori more.

* I was wondering who [these two](http://imgur.com/a/BYqVu) were. Here I thought it was Kousei dyeing his hair to remind him of Kaori after she dies(Don't worry, pure speculation.) with the girl being his next love interest. I know, I have pretty bad ideas.

Opinions : 

Episode is slow. It doesn't necessarily mean it's bad though. I'm kinda liking Tsubaki more now that I know what her thoughts are and how she really feels.

Also, SO MUCH CRYING.


>> ARTICLE
> I was wondering who these two were.

Yuki Kaji and Hana Kana.  They're literally in everything.

His characters more often than not end up with arms missing... With a pianist, I can't see how this can go wrong.

He says while he carries the piano on his back and blocks the way to the stage so that other people can't perform.

That is definitely not Hana Kana. I'd recognize her voice anywhere. Sounds like Hatoko's VA.
>> ARTICLE
I just looked it up on MAL and it's apparently Hayami Saori who is, in fact, Hatoko's VA.  Kudos for the sharp ears.
>> ARTICLE
> SO MUCH CRYING

Pretty much sums up my experience watching this show so far. I'm afraid that near the end it's just going to break me. I can only pray that Kaori manages to survive the damn story despite what seem to be some suspicious circumstances.
>> ARTICLE
I feel worse for the other dude Tsubaki's meeting up with... 
>> ARTICLE
Might go a different route Kaori and friend A might hook up making Tsubaki and the dude hook up out of spite. 

Then Kaori might get worse and eventually pass away leaving Kousei and  Tsubakis relation ship in shambles. 

This anime just has to many ways to become so dam heart breaking.

That went from 0-60 in no seconds flat.

White Album 2 would like a word with you...
>> ARTICLE
I do, and don't. From the snippet of their conversation that we saw, it seems that she was pretty unequivocal in her interest in Kousei, even if she didn't say it outright. 

>> ARTICLE
The guy seems like he knows what's going on and just plays along with it.
>> ARTICLE
~~He's also dating like 100 people.~~

EDIT: Wrong person. He's still nothing but a plot device though.
>> ARTICLE
You might be confusing him with Watari, they're talking about Saitou, the older guy that confessed to Tsubaki in a previous episode.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes, I am. I, for some reason, read Tsubaki as Kaoru. I'm tired.

Yeah, he looks like nothing but a plot device.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly rolled my eyes when she asked if he wanted to go out, but I was glad to see she was upfront about her frustrations and how the guy took it so well.  I was afraid she was going to mislead him.

Gosh darn it... they make the OP look and sound so authentic. They genuinely enjoy making music, and it really shines. I freaking love them

THEY'RE SO ADORABLE

They look like a bunch of good friends just hanging out together playing music because they love it. They seem like they'd be fun people. Of course, this is only based on that video.

is that show as interesting as shigatsu? because that horse is tempting me to watch the first episode
>> ARTICLE
It's even better, in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
It's not as drama-heavy as shigatsu but instead very heartwarming. 
>> ARTICLE
Cannot recommend it enough. It is the best "twist" on the school/slice of life genre I have seen in anime. Also, the author of the manga is the same as FMA (you can see it in the character design).
>> ARTICLE
that's how I found them! IMO it was better than the first OP, and that shit was awesome too
>> ARTICLE
i just want to take them camping and sit around the campfire playing music

>> ARTICLE
My fucking heart man! Shit! This reality-like shit is hard yo. Why can't he just have a harem? 

The characters in this show, like the color scheme of the show itself, are very vibrant, full of life. I'd guess presentation of them is a bit heavy-handed for some, but it hits my personal sweet spot. You know you're getting invested when you scream "FUCK! WHY!?" when something happens. Makes it a lot of fun to watch though, fully engaged like that. Come on Tsubaki. You gotta fight harder than that! Take him while she's not looking dammit! 

I'm hoping we get a performance next week. The performances have always been heart-poundingly good. And it looks like we've got a passionate set of rivals coming up. (I was wondering if they were actual characters or just other random kids in the OP) And these two jealousy-ridden kids have 2 years of experience on top of Traumatised Kousei. Please. Please please please! Give me an energetic rage-tinged performance! A sorrowful tightly-controlled performance. A smooth but driven display of skill. I want this anime to deliver where the manga can't. With sound! 

Can't. Fucking. Stand. Waiting.
>> ARTICLE
I like Tsubaki, but she's not going to win with that attitude. Odds are already against her being the childhood friend after all.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah pretty much. Tsubaki has had her chance as a childhood friend. I'd bet you can find the number of times that the childhood friend has successfully broken into a relationship in anime on your fingers. Hell, there's even actual physical studies done on it. Heh, I'm not sure how much there truly is to it, but it's called the Westermarck effect. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, she is in deep sister zone.
>> ARTICLE
>My fucking heart man! Shit! This reality-like shit is hard yo. Why can't he just have a harem?

I know man...I keep thinking the same thing. I love my shitty harem anime as much as the next guy, but it's refreshing to have something emotionally challenging every once in awhile. I know you're not really complaining about it, but I figured I'd say why it's nice to have something like this that's hard to watch at times(in a good way).
>> ARTICLE
I know. Honestly the way it's set up is a very believable and wonderful. Emotionally stressful too. But because of that, it's just so good. I willfully offer my heart to be torn to shreds by this cast of characters. 
>> ARTICLE
The drama is starting to get into full swing now. My question now is, will it break me by the end? ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^don't ^^^^^^really ^^^^^^want ^^^^^^an ^^^^^^answer ^^^^^^to ^^^^^^that.

And finally we see the other two characters from the opening. I like the girl's look, but what's with the crazy shounen-style hair on the guy?
>> ARTICLE
Everyone knows that the true key to becoming a masterful musician is to have crazy hair.

There's no way it'll be as soul-crushing as White Album 2. At least I hope not...

This series has officially become my AOTS. That's really fucking hard to be when you have Parasyte and Fate/Stay Night airing at the same time. I feel like the pacing in this anime is just so smooth. As mentioned many times before, the characters animations/style looks amazingly brilliant and vivid. It's truly a struggle to have to wait till next Thursday that I end up watching the most recent episode a couple times throughout the week.

I couldn't help but cry once Tsubaki started crying...

### Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso's Classical Performances.

These posts typically provide some historical and structural background to the pieces performed in each episode and will also look into what these pieces tell us about the characters themselves.

## Episode 06 List of Classical Performances:

This week we get previews for two classical performances we'll hear in full in the upcoming piano competition, courtesy of Arima and the [~~second best~~ girl without a name](/s "Igawa Emi") at the end of the episode.

I'll include this next part in each future write-up while we're in Piano Competition mode (for at least the next 3-4 episodes).

---

### Information on the Piano Competition Piece Selections

In the manga, the participants in the upcoming piano competition were required to play two pieces; one of their pieces must be a Chopin tude, and [the other piece must come from](/s "J.S. Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier."")  [Based on this image in the anime,](http://i.imgur.com/TLk2h2N.jpg) I'm thinking they may deviate from what the manga did then, even though I hope that's not the case since [it's always nice to hear some](/s "Bach"). 

## Chopin: tudes - Opus 10 and Opus 25

Chopin wrote three sets of *tudes* (French for *studies*); the most popular tudes are the Opus 10 and Opus 25 studies where each one consists of 12 different studies, and the third set consists of three tudes with no Opus number.  These studies presented a new way to play piano, and they were radical and revolutionary when they first appeared.  They are also some of the most challenging and evocative pieces in classical repertoire, and this is one of the reasons why they're still popular to this day (I'm glad to say I know how to play a couple of them! XD).  

The Opus 10 tudes were composed between 1829 and 1832, and were published in 1833 when he was 23 years old.  He dedicated the Opus 10 set to his good friend Franz Liszt (another famous composer).  The Opus 25 tudes were composed at various times between 1832 and 1836, and were published in 1837. The final three tudes, part of a series called "*Mthode des mthodes de piano*" compiled by Moscheles and Ftis, were composed in 1839, without an assigned opus number.

Out of the Opus 10 and 25 tudes Chopin wrote, the more popular ones have been given nicknames; some examples include:

* Opus 10, No. 3: nicknamed "**Tristesse**" (meaning Sadness) or "**L'Adieu**" (meaning Farewell) 
* Opus 10, No. 5: nicknamed "**Black Keys**" since the right hand is only played with the black keys of the piano, except for only **one** white key [(yes, only **one** key (the only white key plays the note in red)).](http://i.imgur.com/pWNSIuI.png)
* Opus 10, No. 12: nicknamed "**Revolutionary**" due to it's powerful and strong melody.
* Opus 25, No. 9: nicknamed "**Butterfly**" due to light and bouncy nature of the right hand.
* Opus 25, No. 11: nicknamed "**Winter Wind**"; listen to it and you'll understand why this name is perfect.
* Opus 25, No. 12: nicknamed "**Ocean**" due to the stormy sound of the arpeggios.

Although no nicknames are of Chopin's original creation, they create interesting pretext and encourage the imagination to fabricate epic works embodied by these studies.

---

Both of the pieces we heard this episode were one of the 24 tudes, and interestingly enough both of them were from the Opus 25 set.

---

**Chopin: tude in E minor, Opus 25, No. 5** - This tude is nicknamed "Wrong Notes" by a few, and it makes sense when you listen to the piece.  "The main theme abounds with minor second intervals, leading to a feeling that the notes are wrong. The melody is carried on like this for a while, with difficulties being large rolls and ornaments in the left hand that can get quite intricate at times. A less substantial challenge is the dotted rhythm, somewhat similar to the one found in the Etude Op. 25 No. 3. The original theme repeats once before progressing to a middle section written in E major. The new theme is made of left hand chords and octaves while the right hand swoops up and down the keyboard in an accompaniment that can span several octaves at a time. This portion is structurally very similar to the middle section of Liszts Transcendental Etude No. 4. This new theme also repeats once before returning to the original theme. The ending is completely different than either theme: it is much stronger and very heroic, with a strong dominant seventh arpeggio upwards and ending powerfully on a G sharp. Musically, it is tricky due to the presence of "wrong" notes." [(Source)](http://www.ourchopin.com/analysis/etude25.html)

[Here's an interpretation of this study by Maurizio Pollini.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkdgFfKIWbA)

---

**Chopin: tude in A minor ("Winter Wind"), Opus 25, No. 11** - "Upon hearing the first four measures of this piece, one might be inclined to believe that the piece stays this simple. Not so! Originally, the etude did not have those four bars; Chopin was persuaded to add that introduction later by a friend. Once those four bars are over, the piece becomes infinitely more difficult. Fingering work for the right hand can take weeks of solid work, as the fifth bars right hand is representative of the right hand of the entire 10+ page etude. The right hand is also made difficult by the fact that there are two melodies  the "top" melody is the one that creates a chromatic scale in the fifth bar (the first, third, fifth, etc. notes), and the "bottom" melody acts as an accompaniment. This would not be difficult except that every other note switches melodies! The left hand is not technically challenging, but quite exhausting to play due to the constant enormous jumps that can reach three or four octaves.

Even though the right and left hands could be etudes in themselves, this etude combines both hands into an epic study of endurance and the ability of the right hand to emphasize the upper melody. Playing either hand for thirty seconds at proper tempo is not very difficult, provided one knows the notes. Playing the either hand of the entire piece at proper tempo, however, is another story! However, in spite of this, one must not forget that there is a musical element to this piece as well. It takes a true virtuoso to brave the trials of learning the piece and the technical difficulty involved in playing it whilst playing with the impassioned emotion Chopin intended." [(Source)](http://www.ourchopin.com/analysis/etude25.html)

This episode, we get to see one of the pieces Kousei is learning for the upcoming piano competition.  I liked how Kaori admitted how she was pushing him even though she knew about how much pain he was in, but Kousei thanked her for doing it anyway (you're such a good guy, Kousei).  Anyway, at the end of the episode, we're introduced to [a guy without a name](/s "Aiza Takeshi") and [a girl without a name](/s "Igawa Emi").  We will learn in the next episode or the one after how they know Kousei.  [(Manga Spoiler)](/s "When Kousei was much younger, he inspired both Takeshi and Emi to become pianists.  However, according to them, Kousei never acknowledged them at any of their competitions and they started to hold "grudges" against him and looked at him as their greatest rival.  We will see how they interact with each other soon!  I also can't wait for Takeshi to start shipping Emi and Kousei...due to reasons you wouldn't understand unless you read the manga. XD")

Thanks again for taking the time to read a much longer post this week! I hope you're looking forward to next week's episode as much as I am! :-)

I'm learning so much about classical music week to week thanks to you!  Keep up the good work!

() None of these tears are delicious. Please writers, bring the sadness to an end, even if only for one episode!

I guess it's kind of an obvious thing to point out, since it's a big part of why this series is as renowned as it is, but the way metaphors are subtly woven into the script and visuals is *really fucking good.* Easy example: The way the umpire yelled "out!", as if to conclude Tsubaki's thoughts regarding her relationship with Kousei. I can't express how much I appreciate stuff like that.

At least Tsubaki ended up *way* better off than I thought she would. That's definitely good.

Hey man. I'm right there with ya, but if he wants to keep punching me I won't stop him. This series is too damned good for me to ask him to take it easy on us. I wouldn't dare risk it.

Man, is every character in this anime going to hit me over the head with a feels bat? I'm now so attached to these characters that I am genuinely afraid for the rest of the series.

I'm reading the manga as well as watching the series, and I can say every character thus far that's had an internal monologue (other than Watari) has been fleshed out really well. I'm really excited to be able to HEAR the next competition.

This OST reminds me of [Nagi No Asukara](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16067/Nagi_no_Asukara) , [especially this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GunXy4QLbc#t=4018) (min 18:40~  on the ep. of Shigatsu), I love it!

I really like when Arima is alone, and suddenly Kaori appears unexpectedly,and now I have more empathy for Tsubaki.

Ah, so that's what the song reminded me of. Nice catch! :D  

As an interesting side-note, P.A. Works is involved in the production of "Your Lie in April" as well (as can be seen in the ED credits reel when the picture of Kaoru on the rooftop is shown).
>> ARTICLE
So this episode, in my opinion, is one of the best so far.

We got to understand Tsubaki more and her feelings for Kousei. There were a lot of hidden meanings as well as tears in this ep, but for me I loved it all. Especially seeing how competitive Tsubaki is, showing her devastation at the loss in her baseball game was the best. She won't give up Kousei without a fight.
>> ARTICLE
Wow that was BEAUTIFUL !! the ending was so pitch perfect and fit the mood, a great resolution to her doubts about herself and Kousei. 

What's on my mind right now is, who will kousei choose? Will he choose the girl who wishes to be by his side? Or will he choose the girl who he wishes to be by?

[Another small moment with just as many words.](http://imgur.com/IXWmRgs)

Actually a pretty darn funny episode, at least the first half. The second half focused more on Tsubaki and her inability to cope with Kousei seemingly having eyes for Kao. But at least for the moment, she isn't giving up. In her mind, the memories she has and the time she has spent with Kousei means more than Kaori's music with him. And for now, I think I agree.

THAT FUCKING ENDING. I cannot wait to hear Kousei play..hopefully he doesn't dissapoint! (Which he won't) 
>> ARTICLE
This show is such a fucking pain in the ass. I'm thinking about waiting for the first cour to be finished and then watching it, or watching it weekly.  
I always decide on waiting, but when the episode comes out I immediately watch it. It's such an amazing show, no Anime has ever put me into tears on the third episode. I fucking love this.  

>> ARTICLE
IDK, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi had a pretty fuckin' sad third episode. 
>> ARTICLE
it did, but everything else after that paled in comparison to those 3 eps T_T
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the whole vibe changed completely after that.

chihayafuru is the only other show I can think of were I was invested into the chars enough to feel for them on episode 3...

I thought for sure he'd sit beside her hen she was asleep. 

Friend A, you already have an image. You see it everyday. 

Tsubaki, I don't know how things are gonna be for you. Don't want you getting hurt in the end by whatever happens. 
>> ARTICLE
Kousei so OP he needs two rivals
>> ARTICLE
This was a really good episode. There was so much character development. We see that Kaori recognizes that she's at the very least being insensitive if not outright cruel. Kousei finally manned up and looked after Tsubaki for a change. Tsubaki started going out with her old crush, but I think even he realizes that she's in love with Kousei. On the other hand, she was a bit more honest about her feelings. That baseball scene was really well. That said, we I feel like Watari is still pretty shallow, but hopefully they'll develop him a bit more. 

Also, with all the hints that Kaori is dieing, it makes me wonder how Kousei will react if that happens. She's the reason that color returned to his world, so I could see that destroying him as a person. In any case, I imagine that feels are imminent. Has there been any word on how many episodes we're getting?

I think he hides the depth of his character by acting shallow. I'm just guessing based on the good advice he gave to Kousei earlier. Anyway, I agree - I liked seeing Kaori (and Tsubaki) acknowledge that they were kinda pushing him too hard and making him suffer as a result.
>> ARTICLE
This anime is gonna hurt us all one way or the other.
>> ARTICLE
My hopes are high for Kaori + Tsubaki relationship. They will somehow fall in love with each other and Kousei shall play his piano for them for the rest of his life. Happy ending.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or some of the crying by Kaori feel so god damn forced?
>> ARTICLE
Man, Kousei was a little brat :p

This show is amazing. Even though the focus has been on Kousei and Kaori, the baseball game was still an emotional scene. I wanted Tsubaki to win so badly...

Actually, I think I'm leaning towards Tsubaki as best girl for this show.

The two new pianists shown look serious. As much as I'd like to see Kousei win the whole thing, I don't predict it happening. Maybe he'll have a unique performance similar to Kaori's that sounds good but is technically inaccurate?
>> ARTICLE
Kousei probably rekt them when they were all kids, can't wait to see how they interact/play
>> ARTICLE
Well, the thing is that Kaori wasn't actually technically inaccurate, but that's just me being an angry musician.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's due to the presentation of the song. If you just read the manga, you assumed she randomly add or changes notes for krutzer (the song that establishes kaori's playing style), but the animators just used a different part of the song instead.
>> ARTICLE
Tsubaki's always been best girl. Although, with how dependent on Kaori Kousei has become, it'll be interesting to see how the whole conflicting crushes play out. Watari is player and is still seeing other girls, and we haven't really gotten any definite indication of how Kaori. 
>> ARTICLE
I really like the choice of piano pieces. The Chopin tude Kousei is playing (op. 25 no. 5) is also nicknamed "Wrong notes" due to the dissonances it contains. Which is somewhat showing of his current situation.

The piece the girl plays at the end is called "Winter wind" (Chopin tude Op. 25 no. 11), possibly indicating a cold character?
>> ARTICLE
The soundtrack for this show is amazing! combined with the unique character styles and fantastic animation, it's shaping up to be one of, if not the best show this season.
>> ARTICLE
I've got to say Tsubaki got my vote I feel she would be better for Kousei rather than Kaori, shes more of a musical partner/motivator. The piggyback scene got me her vote, feel bad for that senpai dude. it would be nice to see the childhood friend win :(

Monologues need to be toned down a bit, feel like its taking away from some scenes, actions can be equally effective too or even subtle gestures.  

Cant wait for the music to ramp up though from the 2 new pianists, Its lacking compared to Nodame which I am also enjoying so far. 
>> ARTICLE
Nodame, Beck and White album are musts/ should watch for music lovers and anime fans.  I would probably rank beck first or tied with WA2 and nodame 3rd... and I love nodame.
>> ARTICLE
Wow that was a perfect episode! Everything about it was beautiful, I was emotionally connected for every minute. Usually I'm not a fan of unconventional artwork in anime but this is one of those times where the art suits the environment beautifully. 

I'm glad Tsubaki got her moment there in the end, I hate when anime carries that kind of emotional tragedy for long periods of time. I mean, the triangle will still be there I'm sure, but at least she isn't so far away.

I'm not sure which anime that I'm watching is my favorite because there are so many genres, but this one gives me the most pleasure to watch by far.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I've ever been brought to tears so early into a series. The character interactions are just so powerful and I feel so invested in them. It feels like I'm reading a damn good book during Arima and Tsubaki's monologue; there's just so much power and descriptive pull in every single on of their words. This entire show is simply beautiful; despite budget issues, it's all just so pretty. 
>> ARTICLE
Dammit I really wanna see the tsubaki x kousei ship sail but I doubt it'll happen either way liked this episode, this series looks like its gonna be my second favourite of the season. Also I heard this is 2 cour does this mean its gonna be completed as heard the manga was ending soon too or just gonna cover some of it
>> ARTICLE
Yes the manga and the show will end at the same time. So we will get a true ending. That's why I'm not reading the manga. It's 22 episodes by the way
>> ARTICLE
Kaori, maybe his clothes wouldn't be so big on you if you buttoned the pants. WHY DO ANIME GIRLS NEVER BUTTON THEIR PANTS?!?!

Anyway, really good episode.
>> ARTICLE
Enter the rivals much at the end! This show has so many feels brewing, it's going to end up taking me down with it :') 
I can't help but feel painful throughout Tsubaki's monologue, but i prefer Kaori [and her death flags aren't helping] :(
>> ARTICLE
I hate how much I am loving everything about this show.  Plot, characters, animation, references (snoopy!), the OP, the music.  I hate that I just watched tonight's episode and I have a whole week till the next one. 

On that note:  Anyone have related shows to help fill the time?  I don't watch too many shows, so only Nagi no Asukara comes to mind, with a bit of SoL/Romcom in Golden Time.
>> ARTICLE
Toradora if you haven't watched it!

You answered my question, the show is on crunchyroll, and it's a pretty highly reviewed show.  Cheers.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, thanks a lot man! My first Reddit Gold.  Hope you love and enjoy the show as much as I did! 
>> ARTICLE
God damnit show, I was all for the blonde and making them fall for each other through the magic of reaching his musical genius again and now I'm a complete 180 and rooting for Tsubaki because their history makes their potential pairing look ridiculously promising...this episode definitely made me switch to the girl-next-door, well done Shigatsu, well done.  So many hilarious moments in this one.  I had to re-watch the shin-shiver-kick towards the end a couple of times because I found it so funny.  
>> ARTICLE
I am glad the show at least acknowledged that it was pretty shitty of Kaori and Tsubaki to push him into something he's clearly not okay with, especially in the way that they do. That said, it still doesn't change the fact that the show's basically suggesting that the ends justify the means. Acknowledging a problem isn't the same as solving it.

Also, the other major problem with this show is that it is way too full of dramatic monologues. It relies too much on exposition (in the form of the characters' thoughts); too much telling, not enough showing.

Tsubaki's clearly using her senpai to ignore the fact that her love for Kousei is unrequited... And he seems to be somewhat aware of this. I don't know why he'd bother letting himself be used like that, but I doubt he's going to get any character development. This isn't his story, after all.

The music is still excellent.
>> ARTICLE
Tsubaki best-girl. im hoping she and kousei end up together.

>> ARTICLE
me too
>> ARTICLE
So the rivals finally show up. Good chapter for team Tsubaki with the classic piggyback ride.
>> ARTICLE
Poor Tsubaki. I feel for the poor girl, but I still like Kaori a lot. I know they're pre-teens (middle schoolers), but damn I feel bad for the old baseball captain too. She's leading him on to ease her own pain. I know that she knows that she actually likes Kousei all along, but the poor captain has liked you for at least a year or so now, at least let him move on with his life! 

I'm excited to see the new rivals and hear the competitions. Can't wait for the visual and musical orgasms! 
>> ARTICLE
> She's leading him on to ease her own pain.

That totally describes Kaori. In fact, she's two-timing with Watari too but he's a womanizer so there's little chance of him getting his heart broken. Kousei on the other hand...
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, Kaori and Kousei aren't exactly going out. They definitely have some chemistry going on, but I don't think Kousei sees their relationship as romantic since he still recognizes Kaori + Watari as a couple more or less.
>> ARTICLE
> Kaori + Watari

That's just in name though. She's definitely testing him. She and Watari never do anything together because she's always hanging out with Kousei, going to his house even and changing into his clothes. You don't *do* that when you're interested in someone else. Especially when that someone is said guy's best friend.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know the two of them will eventually probably realize they like each other. At the least though, Kaori isn't hanging out with Watari and always complaining about Kousei in front of him; that's the part that gets me about Tsubaki and her senpai.
>> ARTICLE
[I just had to make a gif of Kaori skipping.](http://imgur.com/gallery/2lmQcJJ)

WHO DO I ROOT FOR. KAORI OR TSUBAKI. MY HEART CANNOT TAKE THIS.
>> ARTICLE
That ending was so emotional. Can't wait to hear Kousei's performance! They pulled it off brilliantly in the manga. The anime version is definitely going to be amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, the world of classical music is apparently full of a** holes. First we have that judge who takes things way too seriously and then it's contestants talking about beating the guy to the ground.

Also, Tsubaki needs a lesson in communication. Instead of thinking all of this about an unattached 14-year old move the skin and muscles on your face, called a mouth, and express those feelings. You're a homo sapien, not a species with telepathic abilities.
>> ARTICLE
>  Wow, the world of classical music is apparently full of a** holes. First we have that judge who takes things way too seriously and then it's contestants talking about beating the guy to the ground.

To be fair, most of it is due to the hyperbole of anime, but it's more or less correct in its portrayal.

Some people are anal as fuck in regards to playing the score exactly as it is, and, in music especially, you have people who are passionate about what they do. So the emotions run higher and lower than in sports (IMO), especially since these are solos and are based *solely* on one's own skill.

Also drama is drama so oh well  At least it is well done
>> ARTICLE
God damn it.

It was obvious that Tsubaki was going to suffer from just watching the OP of this show.

I thought I was prepared for it, but the feel was just way too strong this episode that I had to stop every few minutes and go watch something happy.

How am I going to last 18 more episodes like this?
>> ARTICLE
wait, what? this is 2-cour?
I dont think I can endure 6 months of Tsubaki losing. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep. MAL has it down for 22 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I hated the start of this episode, I think this shows comedy sucks, it is way too over the top with the art and i rarely laugh. The rest was great and it was nice to have uninterrupted drama without comedy that ruin the tone like some school romance shows. 
>> ARTICLE
So far this is what I feel: Violin girl gonna die, piano man will make her live on in his heart through his music and I will be kill because of this show. Hopefully not. But this is a school drama and surely A-1 won't kill someone of that easily. It aint gonna happen.

However this anime has really taken to my liking. Amazing visuals, that Goose House OP is so good, the story so far is very intriguing and the two new introduced pianists will spice up the story even more (Saori Hayami character plz). This anime had me listening to more classical music too. I've been listening  to Kaori sing twinkle twinkle little star and Mozart's  "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman" in like 7 different variations. If this keeps up, it'll surely be in my top 10.

Furthermore lots of crying in this episode and I feel really bad for Baseball Senpai because it seems that he does like Baseball Childhood friend Tsubaki, but then Tsubaki just keeps on rambling about Kousei and it seems that she has been doing this since Baseball Senpai was still in middle school. Man that has got to be rough. As of now I still can't read Tsubaki's feelings. Not only that, I feel that Violin Girl Kaori has to redeem herself more but deep inside there's a part of me that know she's amazing and I feel like I idolize her when she plays that violin. Don't get me wrong she's great and all and she's just oh so very attractive physical wise and personality wise (but her tsundere like side still doesn't convinces me). On another note nothing's wrong with Kousei, he's still bestest grill. and uhh new Saori Hayami voiced girl might contend for best girl. Those are my views so far. I binged watch all 5 episodes a day before my end of year Chemistry exam and it helped me a lot. It's so relaxing to watch too. 

Also this: http://i.imgur.com/T4hyFul.jpg

As a musician myself, this show really speaks to me. I'm on the Kaori side with how music is emotion and I can't follow sheet music for shit, so it's interesting to see how it is for someone confined by it. The one thing I feel kind of takes away from it is the amount of comedy scenes and how they're portrayed. Going into a ridiculous art style and all just doesn't seem to help the characters develop. But then again, I like serious anime for maximum feels.
>> ARTICLE
Yuki Kaji voicing yet another blonde character haha. Really good Shigatsu ep though!

Whenever new episode is out i GASP so hard its painfull but in a good way

Just started watching this show last night and caught up to the most recent episode. First off, this anime might be my favorite of the season, the animation is spectacular as well. Out of the other anime shows I've been watching this season, there hasn't been a character as likable as Kousei. The show makes you almost cheer for this character in every episode. 
>> ARTICLE
God, I was sooo 100% on board the Kaori train and Tsubaki just magnetoed me off the tracks in this episode. I love them both, and I love Kousei, and I'm really liking baseball captain guy, and I don't know how to handle these feelings
>> ARTICLE
The feels are real this episode. I don't know why,but this episode is like a good novel being arched on masterpiece art. Their monologues are so good. This episode have me on the verge on crying without I knowing why.
>> ARTICLE
Love this show, great episode, but that softball scene pissed me off.  Who the hell gets to third on a grounder between first and second!  I was surprised when she rounded first(very poorly done by the way, she went like a line to first, then to second rather than an arc), much less when she went for home.  I realize this is middle school softball, but come on! /rant

I never knew I would get so hyped for an upcoming piano face off

GAHHHH! I still can't decide who I want to end up with who...I just don't want to be crying too much on the way ha
>> ARTICLE
I'm definitely doing a full re-watch before the last episode. This show deserves it, and I want to be reminded of all that came before it at the end.
>> ARTICLE
I just love that scene where Kousei and Kaori are alone just together in the music room at night. It really shows how much they care for eachother! Hoping for more moments like these in the near future.

 Even for a Kaori fan, that ending was pretty darn emotional, such an amazing and well done scene! 

Oh damn the rivals!! Can't to see the all out music brawl thats going to happen :D
>> ARTICLE
I like how we will get an ending since it will be the same ending as the manga which is great. I can describe this show in one word a masterpiece. Everything about this show is great. This show is up there with parasyte and fate for me.
>> ARTICLE
Yay spikey haired kid from OP finally appears. Always thought he looked cool along with the music, can't wait to see him in action. Also looks like once again childhood friend losessssss
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad that they didn't drop off Tsubaki with that Senpai and leave it because now there is conflict
>> ARTICLE
I was NOT PREPARED for Yuki Kaji, however brief his appearance this week. Oh also this was another good episode that continued with the expanded POV that started last week, which hopefully is a sign it'll continue. Seeing the cast care about and do things that don't involve Kousei is exactly what we needed, and hearing Kaori worry about whether they were wrong to push him like they've been doing was also needed. So. A very good episode.
>> ARTICLE
It's kind of sad that they removed one of the 2 pieces that Kousei plays but i'm still happy that they kept Chopin's Etude Op. 25 No. 5. It's a really nice piece that I enjoy playing every now and then. Also I look forward to next weeks episode for the competition that will most likely begin.
>> ARTICLE
Dont know but in the middle of episode I almost cryed, this anime is so touching
>> ARTICLE
I am really loving this anime. I kinda wished I waited to watch it so I could just binge watch all the episodes, b/c watching this weekly is killing me. 
>> ARTICLE
Damnit... I thought Tsubaki was staying out of this. Now I don't know who to ship.
>> ARTICLE
Man I've never been so conflicted about who I want to win drama-wise in a show! I love all the characters, specially Kaori and Tsubaki so much! They're upbeat and fun! I love it!

Now let's just hope the thing everyone has been speculating about doesn't happen. I don't think I can handle it.
>> ARTICLE
This show just continues to impress me more and more, every week.  Freakin' love this shit.
>> ARTICLE
It took me 6 episodes to realize it, but in the OP, when all of the main characters are lying in the grass field, Tsubaki is **staring** at Kousei whilst everyone else relaxes.

Tsundere confirm? (   )
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how many of you are or were athletes. But loosing in what is equivalent to the playoffs is the worse feeling ever. I recently played my last highschool soccer game after loosing in the second round of the playoffs. I cried the same way, although not on someones back. That'd be weird. We are a boys team lol.

But anyways, this is quickly becoming my favorite show of all time. The music, drama, and characters are so captivating. I love it! I'm so anxious to see how it ends!
>> ARTICLE
[Kaori is such an angel..](http://imgur.com/6FVs1ZM)

my only hope is that it continues as much on the path of music as it does the romance/drama.  after episode 3 I was seriously contemplating whether this show would become my favorite music anime, and therefore into my top 5ish...  So far I rank this no better or worse than WA2 and Beck (maybe nodame's 1st season too).  That is solid company to be in though!
>> ARTICLE
There's no way where this won't end in tears huh? 
>> ARTICLE
If Kaori ends up dying I will never watch a romance anime again. 

First episode out of all the shows I'm watching this season that made me tear up. there were no man tears but a little Rom-com dust got in my eye. 

I am loving the monologues but the little piece of info we have about kaori and her condition is sitting at the back of my mind. If the writers end up using her death or major injury as a final push for kousei in his final performance...I will be too broken to ever watch another romance anime again
>> ARTICLE
I really want Kousei to end up with Kaori, but Tsubaki is a strong contender... We'll see in the long run.

Anyways, here is my [favorite scene in this episode](http://38.media.tumblr.com/173a07d5c071b4279a8f79f41ddb8f31/tumblr_nf0a57NNuy1qd0br1o1_500.gif) (And no, it's not Kaori changing)

I believe they are off tempo/beat and he misses keys/hits incorrect ones.
>> ARTICLE
Ok yeah that's what I thought. But I think he improved throughout the episode? There was a line about him playing everything perfect later on, but he said he was missing something.
>> ARTICLE
> he said he was missing something

I think he's talking about emotion or feeling - basically, as he tells himself, "What are you trying to convey through your music?" (I'm paraphrasing.)

Kaori said he got the piece down which I assume is he's no longer missing notes.

I love this slow rolling feel train. It's about the journey and not the end. We can speculate all we want but we'd just come to the conclusion sooner or later something major will happen. But damnit I want Arima and Kaori to confess to each other and have beautiful eyes/smiles/moment before the shit truly hits the fan ;_;. The anime pairs well with the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking hell... I am so scared for this show. I want happy fun times with Kousei and Kaori playing piano and violin together. 

Not... Not a bucket full of tears.

The episode, while slow, was really well done and gave quite a bit of insight into Tsubaki. It's hard to watch when she takes notice of how close Kaori and Kousei are becoming, an unrequited love of so long.

The two characters at the end of the episode are no doubt going to become Kousei's rivals of some sort. My biggest question is how they'll react once they learn he hasn't played piano professionally in years.

Solid episode and can't wait for the next!

>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna get downvoted for this, but I hope she dies soon and Kousei ends up with Tsubaki. I really don't like her. She comes off as a manipulative bitch. She bosses around Kousei all day long for her own self satisfaction only to run off into Watari's arms when she's had her fun. She disregards everyone's feelings. I mean who goes to someone's home for the first time, barges into a room that hasn't been disturbed in ages because of sentimental value and starts throwing things around? She acts like she knows Kousei better than anybody else just because she can play the violin. She totally brushed off Tsubaki's accusations that Kousei is suffering with her holier-than-thou "being a musician is suffering" bullshit but the next day she used that same excuse, along with a few tears for added effect, to garner sympathy from Kousei. Tell me that's not manipulation.
>> ARTICLE
Well stated, I hope is that the anime actually addresses her manipulative behavior. I have a feeling they will brush it off and make her seem like the only one who can help Kousei.

Tsubaki, despite being physically abusive, actually looks beyond Kousei's music, she actually thinks of him as a person not just a musician.
>> ARTICLE
If Kousei confessed and she said no and went to Watari, yes I will hate her. Until then i will wait. 
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps it's a Freudian thing. Kaori reminds Kousei of his mother by sheer presence and is drawn to her as a result. Remember that he lost his ability to hear his own music after his mom has died.
>> ARTICLE
> Perhaps it's a Freudian thing. Kaori reminds Kousei of his mother by sheer presence and is drawn to her as a result.

I was thinking along the sames lines. In the early episodes, when Kousei's mum is shown, in which they show only the lower half of her face, they also did the same to Kaoris' face. I wonder if they were trying to draw the parallels between the two, and mayhaps the "good" and "bad" side of music, or at least the lingering taste it left in Kousei's brain-mouth. Mouth-brain. It won't sound right pls help .-.

She's taking it and waving it around [like this](http://i.minus.com/imPSugr3Rod6U.gif). 

I swear it's almost like she wants to die. In any series I've watched, I have never seen such a prominent and pronounced death flag. It wasn't even just her little quote, her talking about the bugs being weak yet shining brightly, that was about her, she described herself. Then the light on the bug goes out as the episode ends..... that is not just a death flag, that is foreshadowing right there. Even the subtle flags are massive ones.

This show is going to be tragic and we're all going along for the ride.

Beautiful music this episode though!
>> ARTICLE
She really reminds me of the late Robin Williams, or most suicidal comedians for the most part. I can really relate to them in that you only see the passionate parts of their life, they shine like a star around people. But when they are alone with just their thoughts, a heavy anchor is tied to their feet. If Kaori is anything like Robin Williams, and she is, I am expecting to see a waterfall of waterfeels.

She *expects* to die. But this is her grasp at immortality; bringing the great Arima Kousei back to perform, giving him energy and life, even if that energy is borne from her death.

There are worse ways to be remembered.
>> ARTICLE
It's like Sundome except with music instead of  s&m
>> ARTICLE
That is a truly beautiful comparison and you have enriched my life by making it. Thank you.
>> ARTICLE
I've never thought about it from this perspective before. But thinking about what she says and how she says it, this is spot on.

It's almost like passing on her life to him so he can play. 

Now I'm going to cry harder when it happens.
>> ARTICLE
It's going to happen, and I will break down when it does. 

But seriously, how much foreshadowing can one episode have?
>> ARTICLE
"I had you"

HGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH
>> ARTICLE
Thought he was gonna lie or dick around the question, was pleasantly surprised.


>> ARTICLE
Can we talk about the AMAZING sound direction in the scene HOLY CRAP I almost cried it was beautiful
>> ARTICLE
I want to meet the entire crew behind the music/sound choices for this show, and give them a bloody medal because they continue to outdo themselves every episode.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, I'm surprised this isn't get more talk on the subreddit. Normally there are threads about it when an anime does something outstanding.
>> ARTICLE
Music will get better ;) Pinky promise
>> ARTICLE
Right? I got frisson during that scene, that major dynamic transition from complete silence to MARCATO that completely matches both what we can assume is Kousei's and the viewer's anticipation and feelings.

HO. LY. CRAP.
>> ARTICLE
AGH You're making me want to watch it *again*.

......

I'm gonna go watch it again, thanks.

Honestly, though, the entire soundtrack (including their performances) have been incredible. It's been a while since I've enjoyed an anime this much.

That's so damn straightforward coming from someone proclaiming himself as Friend A.

NOOOOOOOO FML!!!

I went from ecstasy to complete despair in a split second, you could see the frame my heart shatters.

I went from CHILLS because of that, and the amazing sound editing they had for it; and then *chills* because blatant death flag. It's Xmas next week and I'm sure I will be bawling because of this show.

Better than half the male leads in romance anime.

Seriously. I'm like "Welp, it's time for that "ohoho you know my *friends*"

Then he swung out his 100lb balls with "I had you" and I flipped shit. Finally.

Half? That's awfully optimistic of you. Being exposed to the usual myself, I was almost certain he wouldn't say it, was glad to be wrong.

I was yelling at my screen for him to say it, and I was almost certain he wouldn't. I really hope she doesn't die ;_;

A1 Pictures doin' it right
>> ARTICLE
thank god
>> ARTICLE
To be fair story is made by Naoshi Arakawa, so that part should be credited to her. A-1 Studios is doing an amazing job portraying the story though.

They could have totally end the episode just before answering though.

I was like: "Say it, say it, say it, SAAAAAYYYY IIIIITTT!"

Then he actually fuckin' did!

if that was kyo-ani that would be the scene-to-ED cut. since it went on a little bit longer you just knew something else would be said after and brought the mood down.

They should make an anime where the mc has a harem, but whenever he confesses to one of the girls in the harem she dies.  Then, all the girls take active steps to make sure the mc doesn't confess to them while still trying to remain close to him.

Too bad I can't draw worth a damn.  I used to know this one girl who was a genius at anything, art included.  Unfortunately, she died soon after I told her how much I loved her.  It's weird, I feel like bad things always happen to the girls I like.

The little girl hanging onto Kousei was too funny.

Uh for like a second I thought he was maybe going to throw himself in front of that train.

It would've made for a pretty interesting story, watching how everyone got on with life after he died.

same here, i thought it would turn into a hospital romance drama, until they showed the side shot of what was happening

The HD remaster version with less Iron in the blood!

Was the original in 480p?

haha no, in ping pong there is a similar scene to the one in the beginning of shigatsu today, and it even includes a guy in ping pong rambling about a hero, and another part about how his blood is iron.

And also ping pong's artwork is not the industry standard and turned off alot of people. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I know the scene you're talking about, I watched ping pong but I was referring more to the HD part of your comment. Ping Pongs art (Which i enjoyed a lot) was still HD.

Can they please stop foreshadowing Kaori's death, my little heart can't take this. 
>> ARTICLE
It's the worst buildup ever. We all know it's coming and we probably have 20+ episodes of amazingly well done building only to have our hearts broken and our tear ducts assaulted.

I can't take knowing that it will happen, it HAS to be foreshadowing at this point.
>> ARTICLE
But imagine the impact it would have.  We already see how Kousei has become almost dependant on Kaori's spirit to pull him through.  The real interesting thing to see will be how he deals with her probable death. Despite my fondness for the character,  I'm willing to sacrifice her to see Kousei's reaction. 
>> ARTICLE
There's always the chance that she will end up only losing her ability to play violin, but yeah...
>> ARTICLE
Did you see the way she apologized to it? If she loses the ability to play, it'll destroy her.
>> ARTICLE
> There's always the chance that she will end up only losing her ability to play violin, but yeah...

Oh god I'm going to cry either way.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe she's going to become an astronaut and the pills she is taking are so that she can handle 0 gravity?  She won't always be there for him, because she'll be in space
>> ARTICLE
if this isn't the canon ending I'm going to write this ending myself
>> ARTICLE
I will now accept no other outcome than this
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately, once she gets into space her ship is attacked by cockroaches and she dies.  After being told about her death Kousei proceeds to tell Tsubaki that he never has and never will love her before taking Kaori's violin bow and stabbing himself in the heart with it.  

Tsubaki, ruined by Kousei's words and death goes to Saito(baseball guy) and tries to have a relationship with him.  Unfortunately, Saito realizes Tsubaki only loved Kousei and stabs her, so that she will never leave his side.  Later, he was found in his bed holding the cold body of Tsubaki and whispering that they'll be together forever.  

Ryota heard about Tsubaki's murder and despaired, because he secretly loved her all this time.  He dedicates his whole life to the only thing still true to him, soccer.  This results in him tearing his ACL and never being able to play again.  Wanting to honor Kousei's image he joins a boy band and becomes the heart throb of every girl in the world.  However, he feels empty inside because he has no friends and he knows the terrible music he plays doesn't honor Kousei, so he eventually overdoses and kills himself.

Every girl in the world then kills themselves, unable to live knowing that Ryota is dead.  This causes /u/Mahazzel to remain all on his own for the rest of his life with no one who loves him.  Eventually he learns to love 2d women and dedicates himself to Best Girl, Holo.  However, due to a lack of a third season of Spice and Wolf, he kills himself.  

RIP in pieces /u/Mahazzel

It's....it's creative, I'll give you that....
>> ARTICLE
/u/fangirlingduck was upset that she wasn't able to see Ryota hook up with one or more of his band members.  She denied reality, due to the fantasy world she had made involving Ryota. 

 You see, growing up fangirlingduck was considered the ugly duckling of the family so she was always shy around boys and was never able to fully integrate into society.  One day she decided to go to her favorite band's concerts, so that she could see her favorite, Ryota, sing.  During the concert, Ryota sang his verse, "NANANANNANA, I'll let you be the third wheel" while looking directly at her.  

Ever since, fangirlingduck developed an unhealthy obsession with Ryota and learned everything about him that she could.  She knew that all women were at his beck and call and that the guitarist totally had a thing for him.  Thus, she wouldn't accept the news that he had killed himself.  

Eventually though, fangirlingduck could no longer deny the truth.  In despair, she picked up her father's gun and shot herself in the head.  Luckily, she ended up positioning the gun too close to her face and only shot her optical nerves making her blind.  The doctors tried to rehabilitate her using a medical amusphere. 

Eventually fangirlingduck lost herself in the virtual world and spent all her time in her favorite world, Aincrad where she met Kirito.  Inevitably, she became a part of his harem.  

One day, she walked in on Kirito engaging in intercourse with the rest of his harem.  Enraged that she was not invited /u/fangirlingduck took her sword and cut off Kirito's manhood.  Then she proceeded to shove it down each and every harem member's mouth until they choked and died.  Kirito's plot armor was actually attached to his manhood, so without it he bled out and died.  It turned out everyone's amusphere was defective so they all died irl too.

In despair, /u/fangirlingduck logged out, picked up one of the medical syringes in her room and stuck it into the carotid artery in her neck.  She decided that she had to go visit Ryota's grave once more before she died, so she ran out of the hospital with blood pouring out of her neck.  

/u/openreamgrinder1982 was riding his bike to the store in order to get the final materials he needed to create a time machine.  He was in his own world envisioning the things he could do with a time machine, like go back in time and tell his younger self to watch anime.  

Unfortunately he wasn't paying much attention and ran into something.  In horror, he looked at the body on the ground.  A beautiful albino duck was dead on the pavement.  It appeared the the tire spoke caused a puncture in the duck's neck which ended up killing it.  

/u/openreamgrinder1982 looked around for help and saw some animal rights activist protesting.  He called to them for help.  After hearing his story, they accused him of vehicular manslaughter and got him arrested.  

In jail please send money

Using google, the quote directs to the threads about the anime and to a [Peanuts twitter post](https://twitter.com/PEANUTSbot/status/333176471151599617). We would probably need a Peanuts specialist to find out from which of the 17,897 Peanuts strips this quote comes from.
>> ARTICLE
This is the [relevant comic strip] (http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1994/05/25).

It's not actually that hard to find, since the exact date of the strip is in the [credits of the episode] (http://i.imgur.com/tw17RkD.jpg).

This should be applicable for all the prior Peanuts quotes as well.

It's from what she's quoting. Most likely a line from Charlie Brown.

There it is. I stopped reading the manga right about here and I've been checking the discussion threads and waiting for this quote to pop up. I heard the anime is actually going to cover the entire series so it looks like it's time for me to catch up.

Yeah the manga and the anime will end the same day

Do I read ahead or wait for anime ahhh!

Either way it seems I'm going to feel depressed.

Yeah feel depressed sooner or later the choice is yours

I'm going the anime route personally. The manga is excellent as well, but having the music gives so much more impact in my opinion.

noticed tsubakis look when kaori told them that kousei and her will be playing again

this anime is just too much of everything , its soo beautiful though.

Was wondering if other people caught that face. She is not amused.

that's the face of someone realizing that they're going to lose the shigatsulion
>> ARTICLE
This series consistently makes me feel sorry for Tsubaki and I don't even support that ship.
>> ARTICLE
Got to say Hiroko's design and personality are really well designed and her panic is probably comes from past experiences from knowing Kousei and his mothers relationship.  

This show always cheers your week up until it all comes crashing down towards the end of each episode with some harsh reality.  
Had to end on a downer but the next performance sounds really really nice.
>> ARTICLE
"Here, have some amazing animation, incredible music, story and characters. Looks like Kousei is finally having a break through! Oh and here is a really cool, beautiful new character, she is going to take Kousei under her wing and help him to play the piano again :)

btw kaori is stil ded lol rekt"
>> ARTICLE
**Fun fact:** If you listen closely, the lead-in to the song at the end was an interesting variation of Kreisler's [Liebeslied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nvtnmpvp48), the piece that Kaori and Kousei are about to perform! I love the little touches and references to classical music that they add in the BGM. It's a gorgeous piece which also has an [arrangement for solo piano by Rachmaninoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exVFgbGRN-Q). 
>> ARTICLE
Minor manga spoiler here [Manga Spoiler about the Rachmaninoff arrangement](/s "Funny you should link that seeing as Kousei will be playing that at the gala concert")

Also if you're talking about the end at 18:30+ or so, that's definitely an arrangement of Saint Saen's Introduction & Rondo Capriccioso for the first few measures

I may be wrong, (not a manga reader) but I believe she's just quoting The  Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, If my memory serves she briefly mentions Snoopy in an earlier episode.

She does in relation to Kousei in some way, your memory serves you correctly!

*Fuck.* Kaori's death flags are piling up so fast, not even [Souta-kun](http://i.imgur.com/QtEuv7M.png) could break them at this point... ()

I really want to see Kousei become the free-spirited wild-card pianist he wants to be, but the show won't stop making me think about Kaori's illness. There's just no way this is going to end in smiles, as much as I want it to.

What? Kousei confessed to Kaori?  Welp, it's been fun seeing Kaori alive, too bad that jerk Kousei shortened her lifespan.

I don't really see that as a confession, just saying that she was his motivation and in his heart while he was playing. Even he doesn't necessarily believe that he has romantic feelings for her yet, it's just that she is undeniably the reason that he picked the piano back up, so it is clear that at the moment, she is his inspiration to play music.

Well to be fair, it is following a pretty standard story telling method. You don't go from the top of the rollercoaster and stay there. You go up, then down, up, then down again. So of course there is going to be some lulls in between competitions.

GOD Kaori, would you stop tripping death flags?! You tripped 3 in just one episode, that's way above casual tripping!

"We're still in the middle of our journey"

On episode 11 of the 22. I'm a sucker for things like that.

EDIT: Love every single character by the way. I have a real weak spot for music themed romance anime.

EDIT2: Btw, I'm really not liking the death flags. Not even because I don't want her to die, but because this show really didn't need it and it kinda feels like a cheap tearjerker trick.

I was completely sold on the whole overcoming trauma, becoming stronger and guy likes girl who likes best friend who likes childhood friend who likes guy. This coupled with great characters, fun humor and great music really already had all I wanted. I'm gonna be so mad when all of that takes a backseat to focus on some unneeded super forshadowed illness.

and even if she survives, that's arguably worse. Why bother with all of that in the first place if she's just gonna survive anyway? Man, fuck whoever thought this story needed a character to die for it to be engaging. You messed up.
>> ARTICLE
Everytime these Kaori death flags, the feels keep coming.
I highly doubt that Emi will play a big role in the rest of this anime but heres to hoping she does. I really like her character!

I can feel myself slowly dying inside ;_; this is going to be painful

I still don't like Kaori that much. But if the episodes continue like this one She could grow on me (and be emotionally destroyed from the major death flags). And good on Arima for having the balls to confess.

>> ARTICLE
I feel like she is living out a fantasy. Trying to fall in love with the popular guy. Trying not to fall in love with the guy she really wants, but still having her moment on the stage with him. Hanging out with the popular kids. Fixing the troubled genius... She is pretty selfish but well she is  you know waiving a flag.

People can say a lot about how this anime's dialog is a little overwritten, and about how it relies too much on inner-monologue, but this show is full to the brim with charm and heart no matter how cheesy and dramatic it can be.

Super enjoyable.

Okay I'll say it,this is the first Romance genre that I ever cried out to. I cried during Clannad,but only when it is family related scenes. 

But this,this. When he confessed,the song stop, the song starts again.... the show threw a brick at my face and suddenly my tears duct got itchy and starts producing liquid. Oh shit,that was a magical and very depressing moment.
>> ARTICLE
never before has an anime invoked the feels every single episode for me. Like everyone else, I've been expecting Kaori to eventually die; but I think when it actually happens, the water works are going to hit me pretty hard. Wasn't his mother's death enough?! Why must they (more than likely) take Kaori from us :|
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that scene was so romantic. Fireflies! What more could anyone want?! And then the last line...
>> ARTICLE
Before starting this episode, during the OP, I was thinking, "you know, this girl's so gonna die, and it's gonna be when Kousei finally realizes that he's in love with her..." Guess what happens? We're almost one episode away from that, it seems. I don't think I've ever seen so many death flags in a series before. Not even Terraformars has anything on this show.

The song near the end fit perfectly with his "I had you". I thought he was gonna chicken out at first but it's pretty awesome that he manned up. Pretty sad right after though

This episode was perfect. It didn't make me keep asking myself when the episode was gonna end and it didn't make me feel like it was too little. I'm glad to see that they're taking the development of everyone's character grow little by little instead of having one big spike in one episode. The fact that Kosei is also so confident now being able to say "I had you" gave me so many chills. This show is anime of the year imo.
>> ARTICLE
That entire firefly scene was just great. I'm really loving the art and music in this show; it always seems to fit perfectly.

I'm already loving Hiroko. She seems like a person that's going to be looking out for Kousei. I can't wait to see more of her. Plus, her kid was hilarious. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn the death flag, seeing Kousei manned up is everything I ever wished in this anime.

God damn what an episode. What a show!
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT A CONFESSION!! Anyway, lots of character development, I love the dynamic between kousei and his mother's friend/new teacher. I feel like she is going to be the one to teach him to stand on his own since it looks like queen of the death flags will not be around forever. Seriously how many death flags can you fit into one episode??
>> ARTICLE
THIS ANIME IS GONNA RUIN ME 
>> ARTICLE
I swear this show is going to destroy me emotionally.
>> ARTICLE
I like how Hiroko criticized Arima for having on the same clothes as the day before when she clearly was wearing the same thing too.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone please webm the end scene where he says "I had you."? I need it in my life.
>> ARTICLE
For a while it was a close race for what my AOTS is.  Kaori took her giant death flag and beat the shit out of everything else though.  This show is fantastic.

Man that insert song into that scene, and then Kaori had to killjoy the mood with her death flag.

Well i think at this point it's clear that this show is building up to a great "and they lived happily ever after" ending,  looking forward to it.. :')

even tho everyone can see it coming still wont be ready for it at all when it comes to the manga let along the anime, would still ball my eyes out most definitely no doubt about it.

I'm just waiting for the moment when this anime crashes and burns my emotions.

And I need to download that op song...

[All I could think of after watching today's episode](http://ragefaces.memesoftware.com/faces/large/fap-now-kiss-l.png)
>> ARTICLE
How this show got started and how it will end:

Kosei started playing piano when he was young, inspired by his mother and her talents as one of the best pianists. He is apparently a very talented pianist as well even when he just started, as witnessed by Takeshi and Emi.

Kosei's mother got ill. In order to make her feel better, Kosei practiced piano really hard, and became known as the human metronome.

Kosei's mother passed away. Due to grief and confusion Kosei lost hearing and stopped playing piano.

2 years later, Kosei meets Kaori, who is a talented violinist. Kosei is once again inspired to play piano, this time, by Kaori.

Kaori becomes seriously ill like Kosei's mother. Kosei, not wanting to repeat what happened, played piano as how it is meant to be played to make Kaori feel better, instead of playing it like a machine. 

After telling Kosei about her wish to deliver music to those that enjoy it, Kaori passes away. This time Kosei is grateful of Kaori and is determined to complete Kaori's wish. He becomes a great musician and Tsubaki accompanies him to tour the world to help him out. Kosei and Tsubaki eventually get married and live in memory of Kaori.
>> ARTICLE
O god! I love this anime to death (not kaori's death).
The ending of this episode where Kousei just says: "I had you." You better tell 'r Kousei!!
Wow. Thank you Shigatsu! I can not wait to rewatch this anime 10 times when it is done. 
Kaori, you better just stay by Kouseis side and ESPECIALLY do NOT die a tragic death and give him a mental breakdown and make him cry himself till he is dehydrated.
Thanks, bye.
>> ARTICLE
Sigh, I know they've been hinting at it, but really. Kaori dying is monumentally stupid, regressive, and hurtful to the themes of the show. If she dies, then she just becomes Kousei's mom 2.0, which means all of his growth for the whole show will be pointless. He'll be in pretty much the same spot psychologically by the end: overshadowed by the ghost of a woman he loved. Was it too much to ask for a tragic romance that *doesn't* end in death?

Other than that though this was a great episode, and I'm really looking forward to their gala performance.
>> ARTICLE
I swear to god if she dies I'm dropping this. I will not  be able to handle it. 
>> ARTICLE
The death flags are being laid on so think, I wouldnt be surprised if they did a reverse where we think she dies, but ends up surviving in the end do to the fact that she gets cured at the last second or something. Or maybe I am just being hopeful.
>> ARTICLE
I *would* be surprised, mostly because this show has done nothing to suggest it's anything but what it seems on the surface.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing your lie in April has to do with her dying at the end of the show

You just want to break down and cry don't you Kaori!? I can't handle this roller coaster of an anime!

why does such a beautiful anime have to be so sad

Oh god, that last line. It's coming closer isn't it :(

Guys, do you know if the manga Tsubaki was reading actually came from a real manga!? 

The artwork looks straight out of a real manga the artist of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso did, so I was just wondering..

**UPDATE:**

It's possible that it's actually a page from [a previous work of his](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=20329), although I'm not 100% sure since the series isn't scanlated....

I sense another Clannad AS incoming... Not sure if I want this...

Well, there goes Kaori's ultimate death flag. I've been waiting for that scene to get animated. It was beautiful yet... disheartening to see.

to be honest there is no way this is a red herring. neither is there a way for kaori to be saved.

she has to die and I think I might actually cry.

So many feels

It's 2 cour. 22 episodes.

What.

Really.

With the way the show is going right now I would have thought it would end on ep13.  Yikes.

Feels, bruh. We are now in the 1st half of KimiUso and I am pretty much anxious to continue this because it is making me depressed.
>> ARTICLE
ok she's gonna 

1.  Die
2.  Go overseas 
>> ARTICLE
RIP Kaori. I'm guessing she has the same condition as Kousei's mom. I'm also predicting she won't die before the show ends...

At least this episode was mostly monologue-free, though the lack of subtlety continues (and probably will continue until the show ends).

My thoughts on the show itself are not *that* positive, but man do I love that OP.
>> ARTICLE
Late to the party a bit, but I had to post [this picture of Kaori being awesome, as usual.](http://imgur.com/1iJ7KxV) :3

As everyone is saying, we are in for a very tragic ride, no doubt. Death flags and foreshadowing galore with this episode. I know it is going to happen, and I will probably still find myself crying in the end. :(
>> ARTICLE
I don't waaaant her to diiiie -_-
>> ARTICLE
This is my first post on the Uso pages.. My god the feels. I hate the idea of death flags and all that, but my god can it get any worse? She calls him CHARLIE FRIGGIN BROWN. I hate and love this anime so much just because it's so beautiful with every episode. The pure focus on Arima's fantastic growth, but with every single episode I can't help but feel this impending doom. WHY USO WHY? I blame you all for this... But the title alone seems to give it away. Christ... I'm going to go cry in a corner now... I love this show so much. It reminds me of my favorite novel that I've only read once because of how emotionally beautiful it was, The Time Traveler's Wife...
>> ARTICLE
We need a webm around the 20:18 time. Holy crap.

Just when you think the OST's can't get any better. They. Do. 

Reading this gave me butterflies, but actually watching it and hearing the beautiful OST really enhances it to the nth degree. 
>> ARTICLE
Those last lines.....I *juuuuust* might need some tissues around in case for when what we are all thinking actually happens...the characters have been so awesome for the show that when it happens, it's gonna hit like a bus thrown off of a plane into the earth :(
>> ARTICLE
Except it's been foreshadowed so much I'm already immune to it in advance.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the foreshadowing has been pretty heavy, but if they manage to do awesome character progression, building, etc up to that point, it can change it from "fuck, this is pretty depressing" to "Tears?  no....no...nOOOO STOP DAMMIT".  For example my friends let me know that Clannad was super depressing so I knew that horrible crap was going to happen but the journey to that point was executed so well that it hit harder than I thought it was gonna.  Show has the potential to really pull all the stops when it comes to that point, I hope the journey is executed so well that it does hit me that hard.  That would be pretty good sign of how great the show is.
>> ARTICLE
Geez what's with the ridiculous amount of death flags >.<

No actual playing this episode, which is kinda sad, but I guess A-1 doesn't want to completely obliterate their budget. :P

I do hope that that Takeshi and Emi show up again, as I really liked them as characters and Emi's scene in particular was brilliant and my favorite moment in the show so far. 

Just overall a pleasant episode. I think my one issue was that the dialogue continues to have a few moments every so often that feel beyond cheesy, like High School poetry.

Please stop teasing us with Kaori-death flag waving. We know it's going to happen so I'd wish they'd get on with it.

No Kaori. You'll always be here! Right? **Right?!**
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I have a (possibly) stupid question. Can Kousei actually hear his notes now or not? 


The second part of his performance seemed to be great, but afterwards, around 8:10 mark when talking to Takeshi, he said "I see, so it was a train wreck." Then Emi was like, "he really can't hear the notes."


Also, back he was accompanying Kaori, even during the most impressive part he was thinking something along the lines of, "if I can't hear the notes I'll imagine them and play with my whole body" - I don't remember the exact phrasing. So did he wow everyone towards the end even though he couldn't hear himself play?

It seems like an enormous handicap.

Nice ep, even if Kaori is saying "I'M GONNA DIE".

I wondering what Kaori's condition is, thinking maybe her heart. She's convinced its over for her, could it be fatalism or certainty? If they're foreshadowing her death so frequently, I have to hope the writer kicks fate in the balls and says no. If/when Kaori dies its going to be all kinds of gooey emotions which frankly I could do without lol. I knew this series would break me, damn you A1

Because of your comment, I spent the last 8 hours watching all of Nodame.

I have high hopes for this series.
>> ARTICLE
>  I'm proud of you(srsly). Nodame is one of my favorite series and I'm really hoping this can fill the hole that it left in my heart. My only major complaint with the series was the weird 3d CGI used for the instruments but Shigatsu wa kimi no uso is already using incredibly artwork for the instruments(that piano reflection was gorgeous). 

> Here's to hoping that Shigatsu was Kimi no Uso lives up to our expectations!


>> ARTICLE
From what little of the manga I read it seemed a lot like a shounen version of Nodame Cantabile, no idea how far it goes though.
>> ARTICLE
> Yea that's essentially what I'm expecting. I don't think it'll be quite as good, but I think it has potential to get pretty close.


>> ARTICLE
I didn't realize this was shounen. It seems to have some heavy leanings towards shoujo which is great for my tastes. 
>> ARTICLE
What is the difference between shounen and shoujo? I never understood it. 
>> ARTICLE
Shounen manga are targeted towards boys, shoujo manga are targeted towards girls. These aren't genres, but demographics, so it is possible to have a shoujo manga that seems "shounen-like" and vice versa.

Shigatsu is considered shounen because it is published in a shounen magazine. However, the art style - particularly the character design - clearly has a heavy shoujo influence.
>> ARTICLE
Is shounen always from the POV of male MC while shoujo always from the POV of female MC? At least that is what i observed in shounen/shoujo/romance.
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily. A lot of the "cute girls" type manga are actually published shounen or seinen (guys who are a bit older than the typical shounen demographic) magazines, and many of them have female protagonists. Every shoujo that I've read has had a female protagonist, but I haven't read many shoujo manga so I wouldn't claim that to be universal.

When it comes to romance, shounen generally are from the male POV whilst shoujo generally are from the female POV.
>> ARTICLE
There are a couple of shojo manga that have male MC. Otomen and Ore monogatari come to mind. 

Usually the way to distinguish which is what genre is to look at what magazine they are serialized in. 
>> ARTICLE
There is also Natsume and the book of friends. 
>> ARTICLE
Can you help describe what gives it a shoujo influence for character design?
>> ARTICLE
The eyes seemed very shoujo-like to me. It is common in shoujo to have big, round (or, well, mostly round) eyes with big sparkly pupils. Here's [a shot from Shigatsu](http://imgur.com/CD8oE4r), and [here is a shot from this season's Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji](http://imgur.com/OlvW77J), a shouji series. Now, one might say that it is common in all manga and anime to have big eyes, and yeah, that is definitely the case. Shoujo didn't invent that trope. It's just the way the eyes were drawn and the way the eyes were used in the episode itself - how the "camera" very frequently focused in on them, how we got a lot of head-on stares, et cetera, that seemed shoujo like to me. It is hard to put a word to it, but whilst a lot of anime have characters with large eyes and large pupils, it really seems to come through in shoujo, where the eyes are very frequently used to display emotion (and not just in the more comedic "reaction face" manner). The hair reminded me of shoujo series in its detail as well.

All in all, I'm not saying that it is a copy of shoujo style or anything, but there are similarities. Perhaps "similarities" would have been a better word than "influence" in my original comment.
>> ARTICLE
Ohh ok thank you that helped me a lot. I like learning about nuances in detail.


>> ARTICLE
Oh so all it means is marketed towards boys or girls. Thanks for the explanation!!
>> ARTICLE
It's true that the tags shonen/shoujo/josei/seinen are demographic targets. However, that doesn't change the fact that distinct tropes have developed within shows/manga that are targeted at those demographics, making them into something of a "subgenre"
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh. I see, this makes my earlier comment seem a bit ignorant. Thanks for clarifying! 
>> ARTICLE
The picture gag was a good bit more on the shonen side. I would say I'd prefer it if the show was more of a Josei, but I'm not really complaining.
>> ARTICLE
I am *shocked* that no one has mentioned the instruments in this episode!

They did an AMAZING job showing the instruments and the action of the keys, hammers and what not.

The Steinway & Sons piano is accurate down to the number of holes in the support, the model of the piano bench and everything else. (Source: I attend an all-Steinway university so I have seen them up close and even played them a bit. I am no where proficient with the piano but I have taken a little bit of lessons before.)

The keys that were played, throughout the episode, were accurate which really showed during the melodica scene during the trill around 17:07 is where I really noticed it.
>> ARTICLE
The instruments looked great, but I was even more surprised that they actually showed them being played correctly. I've played the moonlight sonata (the first song) before, and the keys he was pressing were very close if not exactly the same as the real music
>> ARTICLE
Well, it is a series about music, so I'm not that surprised that they paid attention to the details.
>> ARTICLE
It hasn't stopped other anime from animating them poorly. Same goes for live-action shows. I was quite impressed by the little clips of Kaori playing the violin in trailers, so I have high hopes they will animate things accurate rather than some random pressing of fingers or something.
>> ARTICLE
What other anime have done a poor job of it? And yeah, I figure that not all of them would pay attention to the details, especially if the music is not as much of a focus as the romance or whatever.
>> ARTICLE
BECK didn't make the greatest transition from paper to screen -- something I'd feared. Great manga, not as great anime.
>> ARTICLE
La Corda d'Oro comes to mind... the animation in that show is so ugly, it's like they had a tiny budget or something :(
>> ARTICLE
Maybe poorly was the wrong choice of words, but not accurate is more...accurate. I can't think of any recent shows that had such a strong focus on music besides maybe that anime adaptation whose name escapes me from last season (the one with the j-pop/j-rock guys in the meiji era or something where music is forbidden except by the government.) 
>> ARTICLE
> that anime adaptation whose name escapes me from last season (the one with the j-pop/j-rock guys in the meiji era or something where music is forbidden except by the government.) 

Sounds familiar. Google says... [Bakumatsu Rock](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23037/Bakumatsu_Rock). I don't know that that one really counts :P

Yeah, that one. The focus wasn't really on the music aspect so much as the men themselves.

I was thinking about writing up weekly comparisons for this show, but I decided to [do them for Grisaia no Kajitsu](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2id9xl/spoilers_grisaia_no_kajitsu_episode_1_discussion/cl2h33t) instead since I haven't read all of the manga released so far for Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.  However, I thought it would be fun to elaborate more on the classical pieces that will be played throughout this series.  Thus, I'll do an almost weekly write-up on the classical pieces that are played during each episode by giving some background information on the pieces themselves, and possibly analyze how those respective pieces shed more light on the characters themselves (while tagging spoilers where appropriate).  (I say *almost* weekly write-ups because it depends on whether or not any classical pieces are performed during any particular episode.)

## Episode 01 List of Performed Classical Compositions:

This week, we only got one classical piece (that I noticed, at least), courtesy of younger Arima Kousei's performance near the beginning of the episode. 

**Beethoven: Piano Sonata no. 14 in C-sharp Minor "Quasi una fantasia", Op. 27 No. 2 (Moonlight), 3rd Movement (Presto agitato)** - The moonlight sonata (well, the first movement really) is one of the most recognizable piano sonatas written by Ludwig Van Beethoven.  In this sonata, Beethoven does not follow the traditional movement arrangement in the Classical period (fastslow[fast]fast). Instead, the sonata starts slow and then builds up speed, leaving all of the rapid music to be played in the third movement. In his analysis, German critic Paul Bekker states that "The opening sonata-allegro movement gave the work a definite character from the beginning... which succeeding movements could supplement but not change. Beethoven rebelled against this determinative quality in the first movement. He wanted a prelude, an introduction, not a proposition."

The moonlight sonata consists of three movements:

1. [Adagio sostenuto (as performed by Wilhelm Kempff)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6txOvK-mAk)
2. [Allegretto (as performed by Wilhelm Kempff)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDNsX4DtzZs)
3. [Presto agitato (as performed by Wilhelm Kempff)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqSulR9Fymg)

The first movement (written in C-sharp minor) is the one of the most recognizable classical pieces out there and has a "funeral march" type of feel to it.  The second movement (written in D-flat major) is a relatively conventional scherzo and trio and is more cheerful than the first movement.  Franz Liszt is said to have described the second movement as "a flower between two chasms".  The third movement (written in C-sharp minor) is the weightiest of the three, reflecting an experiment of Beethoven's placement of the most important movement of the sonata last. It has many fast arpeggios and strongly accented notes, and an effective performance demands lively and skillful playing.  Charles Rosen has said that the third movement "is the most unbridled in its representation of emotion. Even today, two hundred years later, its ferocity is astonishing."

Frederic Chopin was inspired by this piece and, as a result, [wrote his famous *Fantaisie-Impromptu* (as performed by the legendary Vladimir Horowitz)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x93pwAvUkAA) as a tribute to Beethoven.  Ernst Oster writes: "... With the aid of the *Fantaisie-Impromptu* we can at least recognize what particular features of the C-sharp minor Sonata struck fire in Chopin. We can actually regard Chopin as our teacher as he points to the coda and says, 'Look here, this is great. Take heed of this example!' ... The *Fantaisie-Impromptu* is perhaps the only instance where one genius discloses to us  if only by means of a composition of his own  what he actually hears in the work of another genius."

----------

The level of skill required to play the 3rd movement of the Moonlight sonata is pretty high up there.  I've been playing piano for 17 years now (self taught!) and I still have issues with this piece.  It's *very technical*, but still allows the performer to put their *emotions* into such a stormy piece.  As it was revealed in this episode, his mother wanted him to debut in Europe for her because she was too ill to do so her herself; in essence, he was forced to be something he wasn't -- and that was his mother.  [We will learn in the future that (Manga Spoiler)](/s "she was very strict in enforcing Kousei to play pieces *perfectly* -- to play them *exactly* the way that the composers wrote it -- and was never allowed to play the piano with emotion and individuality.  This is why Kousei's eyes looked lifeless -- just like a machine -- when playing the 3rd movement of the Moonlight sonata; he was playing it technically perfect, but there was no trace of his own emotions in his playing.  In future episodes, one of the judges we will see knew of Arima back in the day and referred to Arima as his mother's "marionette".  The first part of this anime will be about Arima overcoming the psychological trauma that caused him to stop playing the piano.")
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I was hoping to see in-episode labels for the pieces as in Nodame Cantabile, but your posts will satisfy!
>> ARTICLE
In the manga, they explicitly say what some of the pieces are, so I expect the anime to say what some of them will be as well; that will make my life a little easier some weeks! :)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the writeup! I enjoy listening to classical music, but don't really know much about the history of the pieces.
>> ARTICLE
I admit that I know very little about classical music, so your write-up is very helpful, thanks! ;) 
>> ARTICLE
good stuff love your writeup on grisaia too!
getting more and more jealous at people who know how to play music xD
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's just because of all the pink everywhere, but I'm getting a strong Sakurasou vibe from this show.  I foresee a heartbreaking future where the childhood friend loses once again.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe this is why I'm liking it so much... Sakurasou is one of my favorites of all time 
>> ARTICLE
I'm a little afraid that Kaori will just end up being a manic pixie dream girl trope (similar to Sakurasou where Mashiro was sort of this trope), but the OP made it seem like she'll get her own character development and her own, independent goals.

I don't doubt the childhood friend will lose though.
>> ARTICLE
She feels dead in the water after this episode but we will see. 
>> ARTICLE
They're in junior high??? What are they feeding these kids nowadays?

This is one that was near the top of my most anticipated for this season, simply because it seemed like the best romance story among the descriptions that I've seen. And for the time being, it looks like it is going to be just that.

So Kaori actually doesn't have feelings towards Kousei from the get-go. Already this is a breath of fresh air; instead of one or both sides loving the other right from the start, they are going to have what appears to be an actual, growing relationship over the course of the season. The pairing works nicely because opposites always do: Kaori is the bubbly, happy, and carefree young girl while Kousei is the quiet, saddened, and reserved young boy. It's going to be a story about them and their love for each other and music, hopefully with lots of emotion placed into the mix.

The show does have the common trope of "young girl who was childhood friends with MC who secretly loves him," but I can forgive it as long as Kaori's and Kousei's relationship is developed nicely.

Being a music show, the soundtrack involved is great as well. Same for the voice acting; sound quality overall is above average in every department.

If you are a fan of romance, you need to be watching this one. Coupled with the beautiful visuals and superb animation, this one is shaping up to be one of the best this season.

IDK man, you should see Freshmen. I knew some girls in 8th grade who could easily have passed for 16.

This is a late reply! :P

I can honestly say that I have yet to see a middle schooler look as if they are ready to graduate from high school like these kids in Shigatsu are, but I'll have to take your word for it. :)

Oh, yeah, I always go back to these threads when I start an anime and see what everyone was saying about it as I watch.
>> ARTICLE
me too

>> ARTICLE
In agreement with your 1st comment, they look more like 16-17 than 14 yo.

As a 1st episode i enjoyed it a lot, my impression of kaori says she doesnt like watari at all, and tsubaki annoyed me a bit with all that "you're just friend A" and stuff. But overall, everything went better than expected.
>> ARTICLE
[Nice little homage to Laputa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix4-snNXXTM), even had the part about the pigeons.
>> ARTICLE
That little girl in the episode looks kind of like Sheeta, too, with the blue dress and pigtails.
>> ARTICLE
Gosh, thanks for posting this. I watched this movie so long ago that i completely forgot this scene.
>> ARTICLE
You know, I actually glossed over the fact that she was playing this particular song in the manga, but it makes so much sense hearing it. This scene alone gave me high hopes for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that straight away. Its my favourite Ghibli film and that scene has always had an impact on me
>> ARTICLE
Solid first episode, OP & OST were really good. Pleased that they'll be adapting all the manga for a conclusive ending. Some [Kaori](http://imgur.com/a/7nTX9) stitches.

Feel for the childhood friend, who just introduced her worse enemy.
>> ARTICLE
Just tried this out now. Looks interesting enough to give it a shot. Thanks for the images, that third stitch is really nice, and well suited for being a phone background. 

On the issue of childhood friend... she's just not selling it. She comes off as way too tsundere.
>> ARTICLE
No problem, seems like this will be a solid show, the music is definitely good.

I see where you coming from on the childhood friend but I've seen worse so it doesn't bother me that much so far.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for sharing the last stitch. Phone lockscreen go!!
>> ARTICLE
Right? As soon as it loaded, TIME FOR A NEW LOCKSCREEN.
>> ARTICLE
dem roses doe...MIKORIN?!

Childhood friend never wins -- it's like Romance 101 in anime.

The most you could hope for the other guy being thrown into the mix to make things complicated, but the main pair is all but given after this episode, unfortunately.  I kind of wish shows didn't make it so plainly obvious, especially in the OP.
>> ARTICLE
The sad fate of the childhood friend ;_;
>> ARTICLE
[What's up with this line?](http://i.imgur.com/VMcyRUa.jpg) It kind of came up from nowhere, or I'm just really tired.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah there were a couple weird lines. He called leggings spats, which according to Google refers to shoes. He also referred to his eye color being dark brown when they appear to be a steely blue. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Actually that would make a lot of sense for his depressed personality. Sounds like poor subtitle choice. Rather than referring to an actual physical colour, it's more like he was saying they don't shine because he's dark inside.
>> ARTICLE
or maybe he sees them black because he sees everything in monotone? Who knows..
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's a pretty crappy translation from CR. I think a more sensible translation would be something like "First you're pervy and now you're hungry?" which sounds closer to what a 14 year old would say.
>> ARTICLE
Also, when they referred to the song they were listening to as a "The Millions" song, when it's clear in Japanese, they said "Goose house" (the artist of the OP). Weird localization...
>> ARTICLE
Goose House did the OP?! They did my [favourite ED ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjUDCE6NTA) for the second season of Gin No Saji/Silver Spoon. Didn't recognise them from the OP. Can't find a clip of the actual ED animation, but it's a great one. Such a fun song, fits perfectly with the series.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, your translation makes much more sense.
>> ARTICLE
Omg, Goosehouse <3.

The fact that the characters in the anime listen to them too. I'm sold already. 

And omg, THE CASTLE IN THE SKY, HATO TO SHOUNEN THEME. OMG. This is a musician's wet dream, in anime form. 
>> ARTICLE
It seems pretty promising, i really enjoy animes about music.
I'm hyped to see his reaction after she plays violon.
>> ARTICLE
Fuuuuuck, *STOP GIVING ME MORE GREAT SHOWS TO WATCH*, Japan! I want to go outside already!

This show, like an absurd number of others this season, looks fantastic. I keep seeing comparisons to Nodame Cantabile, which I believe is a rather good thing. I actaully haven't seen most of Nodame Cantabile, so maybe it'll be interesting to check it out after this is done and do a bit of comparison myself. 

Great first episode, curious to see what blondie is really all about, and how she's gonna snap MC back into piano-playing mode.

Also, I get that they're all 14 and in middle school, but I feel like their voices should reflect that a little more and be more high-pitched. Really, they just strike me as regular high-schoolers.

>> ARTICLE
>Fuuuuuck, STOP GIVING ME MORE GREAT SHOWS TO WATCH, Japan! I want to go outside already!

This is my dilemma exactly. Number 25 so far and I don't think any of those are worth dropping so far.
>> ARTICLE
Childhood friend is going to get shat on again.

and I'm already in love with her anyway. 

Goosehouse is doing the OP. have not heard them since Gin no Saji. I enjoy their music. 
>> ARTICLE
i'm happy to see same opinion with me, goosehouse did a great job again
>> ARTICLE
This first episode blew me away, without question this takes a definite top 3 spot in the best first episodes I have ever seen. 

The pacing, the recursion of theme, the amazing music, the amazingly detailed visuals, the subtly of the writing; and I could still go on. This would probably be my favorite anime of all time, if this show keeps the same quality of animation, music and writing. 

Without a doubt a show that everybody should be watching. 
>> ARTICLE
Top 3 ever? You need to start watching better shows.
>> ARTICLE
...While I agree that this isn't really the best show I've ever watched, you could have put that more politely.

The episode was alright, but nothing amazing. Pretty clichd, all in all.
>> ARTICLE
My reply was really a lot more snobby sounding than I had intended. My sense of humor doesn't really translate as well from in-person to online.
>> ARTICLE
No worries. It's a common problem :P
>> ARTICLE
For first episodes the only other shows that I have watched that are as good would be wandering son, and personally technolyze. Most great shows like fate/zero, stiens gate, monogatari, madoka, death note, chihayafuru, spice and wolf, etc.. Usually don't have the greatest first episodes but pace themselves out. 

Because of this I am slightly worried about the way this show will unfold, but because the manga is pretty long and has won awards, I feel there is a chance that the quality we have seen in episode 1 could carry through the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
For a show with a spectacular first episode, I'd recommend Aldnoah Zero. They set the tone and portray the environment of the story pretty much immediately, and end with one of the most epic moments of hype that I've ever seen.

The rest of the show is decent too, but the first episode just blew me away.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know I personally thought it was good, but no great. IIRC it looked good, but there was slightly too much content; We see some training, we see the main character is pretty emotionless, we see minimal character interaction, we see his older sister cares for him, I believe we see some introduction into slaine, and his relationship with the princess (theres a good mirror between the characters here that isn't present in the rest of the series) and finally I think there was a introduction to the conflict. 

It was good and hit a couple key notes, but there were a couple of scenes that seemed out of place such as the scene on the bus, it served pretty much no purpose. Maybe I'm just jaded because I disliked the ending, and the QUALITY animation in some of the middle episodes, but I still thought It was good, it just wasn't great to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Death Note's first episode was really good. I definitely agree with the rest though
>> ARTICLE
The second episode where L shows up really cemented the show as something excellent.  The first episode was good but that's what made the series for me
>> ARTICLE
Didn't mean to be as in-your-face as I sounded. My bad dude.
>> ARTICLE
I especially like about the visuals that they incorporate still shots like the audience during the piano play very well.

Edit: Grammar
>> ARTICLE
There's no way [this isn't a parody of Laputa: A Castle in the Sky.](http://imgur.com/iQ2emm6) The same music, it's a pianica (which looks like a trumpet when you hold it like that), white doves, one of the lead couple is introduced to the other when hearing the piece, and the player is standing on a high place. Hell, even the kids were expecting doves and were arguing for trumpet/bugle.

For reference, [this is the scene from Laputa](http://imgur.com/PVDAUZq) that I'm pretty sure they're parodying here. It's an awesome homage and very well done that it gave me dj vu.

This episode showcases awesome animation, great voice work, great soundtrack, good-looking backgrounds, story and characters that are brimming with personality. I think this one would be my slice of life to behold for the season along with Kokkuri-san.
>> ARTICLE
My husband pointed out that the thing she is standing on also kinda looks like the head of the robots from Laputa.

Wow [Kaori](http://a.pomf.se/rhbvfq.webm) is [cute](http://a.pomf.se/bimnxb.webm)

Very strong first episode, I was already enjoying the art and music but when the [playground scene](http://a.pomf.se/hcqszs.webm) went full swing I was hooked. Can't wait for next week!

Drama, Romance, love triangle and Music. This is like a younger WA2.
>> ARTICLE
yes...Yes... YES! The PV didn't lie! I love it!
>> ARTICLE
Are you ready to tear up? I'm already crying a river.

Fucking romance coming of age shows with great music, they strung the right chord in my heart to transform me into a middle school girl. I'm not one to cry a lot for shows, but this show is bound to be a tear jerker for me.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sooooo happy this got off to a good start.  Now all I can think is...please don't let me down, please don't let me down, please don't...

By the way. Dat OST amiright?
>> ARTICLE
Can I just say when that OP went in, it went IN. Holy crap my jaw dropped and it was only the opening. 

As others have said, I now have too many shows I want to follow.
>> ARTICLE
I've never wanted a slice of life/rom-com anime before. I feel like i'm about to get fucked hard by the feels. Send help pls?
>> ARTICLE
There is no help. You are doomed to heartbreak.
>> ARTICLE
This was the anime series that I was most excited for and boy did that first episode deliver for me!

For some reason, that opening is just great to my ears and I just love the OST and the classical music thrown around. This is definitely living up to my expectations and void left by Nodame Cantabile.
>> ARTICLE
Usually I don't notice these things, and maybe it's because it's an anime featuring music, but I thought the sound design was fantastic. Like when the brown haired girl was talking and the voice sounded like you're listening from inside the locker.  
The main guy having a dead mother seems pretty common in a lot of romance anime/manga nowadays, but I totally didn't expect the abuse angle.  
Anyway, I'm still expecting this [song](http://youtu.be/tvlhzIQ7Y9w) from the PV.
>> ARTICLE
I'm waiting for this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3puyMPeafMI) :)

Finally I was really craving for a Music Romance Anime cause it's been ages   since Nodame Cantabile.

I feel like this is going to be one of those shows that will constantly remind me how much my childhood sucked.

WOW. i Just saw the OP. does anybody else know about Goosehouse?!??! I've been following their youtube channels for a few months. I had no idea they landed this to sing the OP / their song for this show!! :D
>> ARTICLE
That was amazing, genuinely looks like this will be my AOTS already competing with F/SN. That is how good this first episode is. Highly recommend at least watching this episode if you're even the slightest bit interested!

I've read a little bit of the manga in the past but didn't get very far in it, think I got busy or something and forgot about it but this is one of the first manga adaptations where I don't actually want to go and read it, I want to experience it first with all the music. Keep it up A-1, I'm looking forward to next week!
>> ARTICLE
Was looking forward to this to a stupid degree. Haven't done romantic dramas on a weekly basis before, so I get the feeling this show will be the death of me.

Presentation serves the mood of the scene strikingly well, often matching what the character in focus is conveying at the given mark. Its humor in form feels like an outburst of energy and exuberance before settling back down into an almost calming, sometimes melancholic, atmosphere. Its motif of color reminds me strongly of [A Tale of Memories](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2924/ef:_A_Tale_of_Memories.) so I suspect we'll see similar conflicts and developments in our MC. All in all I feel like this introduction is buttering me up to a level of complacency and satisfaction that will make the eventual heartbreak all the more worse. Do your worst, show.

Given the pedigree of the source, the studio behind the production, and the reception of the community, we're in for something good here.
>> ARTICLE
Loved the opening piano scene. I can only hope the violin animation will be just as nice.
>> ARTICLE
Please have a happy ending! Please have a happy ending! Please have a happy ending! Please have a happy ending. Please have a happy ending...

please...

They have noses!!

Everything about the show went well in my book I hope it continues and becomes one of my fav of the season.
>> ARTICLE
I usually find lips on anime characters kind of weird. They looked really good in this one though!

interesting.. maybe i'm used to "regular" lips on anime characters? These lips just weirded me out big time

I wish I were good enough at piano to play this piece..

Used to be before I started playing wayyy too many games and watching wayy to much anime. My fingers lack the dexterity now..
>> ARTICLE
This show is beautiful on the production front. Outstanding use of colors and excellent direction. However, I couldn't help but feel that the writing was very sloppy... We'll see how this turns out, I'm interested so far.
>> ARTICLE
That was absolutely gorgeous. Definitely watching this one.
>> ARTICLE
I'm loving it already! Beautiful artwork and great characters!
>> ARTICLE
I was expecting Kaori to be more similar to Nodame with the opening scene with the cat, but I'm glad that her personality is actually a lot different. With me not doing my annual re-watch of Nodame Cantabile this year I think I can look forward to this anime and not constantly compare it to Nodame (despite my first sentence). Hopefully it can fill the SoL void that Barakamon left behind. 
>> ARTICLE
Nice CG during the Moonlight Sonata solo, well animated and barely noticeable. The characters have nice chemistry right off the bat but I'm really hoping it doesn't turn into a love triangle drama...I need a break from that.
>> ARTICLE
what was the piano piece he was playing at the beginning?
>> ARTICLE
moonlight sonata movement 3
>> ARTICLE
Others have mentioned it but it's Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, 3rd movement. I'm a huge fan of first movement myself, then again, I have a thing for adagio. 

>> ARTICLE
the next nodame for me
>> ARTICLE
I love this manga so much, so hopefully the anime gets past where its translated.

Definitely the best music series since Nodame Cantaile.

Only issue I had with the first episode, is they kind of over did the comedy parts. Really was way over done vs the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I was pretty excited to see how this one would turn out based off of the PV's, but I'm still pleasantly surprised on how much I actually like it.  It was such a colourful, pretty, first episode.  

I think I'm going to enjoy this one a lot.  Calling it to be my romance of the season.
>> ARTICLE
Is this meant to be a romcom or a drama? It has some really heavy set pieces but takes nosedives into trope-y romcom territory every now and then. Will continue to watch for now. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably more of the latter than the former, though there do appear to be moments of comedy.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I think Im gonna love this show. Music can make or break, and this is ALL ABOUT music.  Def gonna be a show to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty excited for this anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'm hoping it'll be as good as Nodame Cantabile but I'm not expecting to like it as much in the long run. The kids are too young and the childhood friend (I have a soft spot for that kind of relationship) will inevitably be on the losing end of the love triangle.
>> ARTICLE
I was wrong. I know it's melodramatic by comparison and they're still too young but it hit me right in the heart, both on the musician and romance aspects.
>> ARTICLE
i love the op, someone please spoil me, why she is crying while playing?
>> ARTICLE
oh fuck. second scene with the kid playing the piano. 

now i'm obligated to watch this thing the whole way through no matter what happens from here on out.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, not only is this absolutely gorgeous, the characters are beautifully created. Not to mention It's super sweet but also has some good comedy thrown in. This whole love square is a Pain in the ass But I'm super excited to see where it goes from here! 
>> ARTICLE
I can already see it! It's going to be MC being able to play again, and then they are going to be duos. WOOT!
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful piano playing animations. I hope the quality will stay when we get to see Kaori play her violin and through the 22 episodes.

Maybe we will get some good character songs in the future too.
>> ARTICLE
Really glad I watched this, definitely gonna keep up with this show.  I'm really rooting for the MC because I see a little bit of me in him.  I don't really have a good opinion of myself, have zero luck with finding romance, my best friend (not a douche, he's still my best friend) consistently always got the attention from the ladies and knew how to flirt, talk, etc.  It was almost a tad bit uncomfortable watching him talking about himself considering I could relate to some of it.  Here's to  hoping the guy has better luck than I did in JHS and he becomes really happy with himself :) .  
>> ARTICLE
I'm having mixed feelings with this because of his child hood girl friend. She hit him with a baseball which lead him to start bleeding from his head and the first thing she does is run away from someone she just victimized? I think my current mood is just affecting me, but I'll wait until this reaches episode 6, then I'll watch it from episode 1 again.
>> ARTICLE
That was a great first episode. Can't wait to see what happens in this anime.

Beautiful OST/ED/OP.
>> ARTICLE
Dear god that was stunning. Kyoani's got some competition in the beauty department, that's for sure. Besides being gorgeous it was everything I was hoping it would be and then some. *Both* girls are Best Girl, and it's just...so *cute*. I can't handle it. One of the contenders of the season already, likely even has AOTY potential. Yes, even with stuff like F/SN and SAO and so on.
>> ARTICLE
Looks about as clichd and predictable as I expected from the preview.

The animation is still excellent, though, and I like the comedy. Plus there is fantastic attention to detail in the animation and sound design when they're playing the instruments, though that's not surprising coming from a music-centric series.

Pretty good episode to start us off and introduce us to the two main characters and their friends (well, Kousei's friends, really). I'm looking forward to the music.
>> ARTICLE
Well it starts off with Hanekawa saying Nya! so thats promising. And we follow up with a piano playing scene which is *much* better animated than most instrument playing in anime. Pet peeve of mine as a former orchestra member: badly animated/acted instrument playing. 

That transition from the intro scene to the present was pretty smooth, with the contrasting music choices of the protagonists. Already it raises some questions. 

From the looks of the baseball hitting scene, they blew the budget on the piano playing animation. And Im entirely ok with this. The over the top reactions feel a bit disjointed from the tone of that intro, but this *is* anime were talking about. 

Some interesting motifs introduced here: music described using visual terms, colorful vs monochrome, instead of auditory; Kouseis view on music as a tool (part time job, for his mothers sake), and going through the motions of playing music instead of *playing* music.

Man I feel bad for Tsubaki already because the love triangle here is pretty obvious and the main girl is also pretty damn obvious. Also there is no way in hell elementary school students can play the recorder that well (source: life experience). Kouseis actually enjoying music for once in this episode though, good for him!

And so the ending marks his literal first steps to moving on past his moms death, and starting music again probably. Kaoris eyes have that sparkle that Tsubaki was talking about earlier, and theres a ton of color in Kouseis last scene too in contrast to his earlier monochrome. 

Solid first episode, enjoyed it, the gags were funny if slightly out of place for some of them. Nice art and animation, especially the instrument playing. 
>> ARTICLE
This show is going to *destroy* me, isn't it?

I really like the OP, because it makes the show look like a sports anime with piano recitals instead of sports.

I can't believe I was going to skip this one, too. It's looking right up my alley so far.
>> ARTICLE
seems good so far. Cant' tell if it's gonna be sad/romcom/melodrama yet. But I think it's gonna be good.

On top, it's 2 cour too!!!

the second best Ryushi and Chitoge. I like it...

This was simply amazing, loved it.

Here comes the love triangle square circle already that's either gonna make or break this show

I have a feeling this is going to be one of my top 3 this season.

I was surprised at how much was always going on on screen. It seemed like there was always something moving.

Blondie got annoying when her crush showed up. I would have stopped caring if I was him somewhere between the beating (though that might be his thing after then child abuse) and her personality switch.
>> ARTICLE
Hi guys,
I have question, can anyone tell me what does FRIEND A mean,please?
>> ARTICLE
So there's no love triangle?
>> ARTICLE
Wow this show was really pretty. It's also nice to see a show worth a mix of girls and boys. I tend to enjoy those the most (like Toradora and Kokoro Connect). Definitely one of my top first episodes of the season. 
>> ARTICLE
Thought about not picking up this anime because of the sheer amount I'm watching this season but boy am I glad I picked this up. 
>> ARTICLE
This looks like the SoL Romance to watch this season. OP is in the top 2-3 for the season. Rest of the music is really strong too. This will be one of the shows I look forward to each week.
>> ARTICLE
I hope this one will live up to, or even surpass, expectations. The only music anime I've gotten to enjoy as of now was Nodame Cantabile (I'm on the second season). As someone who's played the violin for 10 years, I hope I can enjoy this one as well.

On a side note, anyone know any other good music anime?
>> ARTICLE
[Kids on the Slope](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon) is the first thing besides Nodame Cantabile that comes to mind - two friends bonding over a love of jazz.

I haven't seen it yet, but [Beck](http://myanimelist.net/anime/57/Beck) is also supposed to be really good.
>> ARTICLE
Art is beautiful. Music is beautiful. Characters are beautiful.

Really liking this so far.
>> ARTICLE
Second best first episode this season, behind Gogure! Kokkuri-san.
>> ARTICLE
I love this.
Exactly the thing I hoped it to be.
>> ARTICLE
I can see already that I'm going to really enjoy this series. Beautiful, fluid, vibrant animation (and my god, are they really showing off how dynamic it is with all the cherry blossoms) and a story all about music and romance. The tone of the series so far sort of feels like an odd combination of Golden Time and Tari Tari; the blonde haired violinist, especially her introduction, seemed very Kaga Koko-esque (the obvious; introduced as couple with MC's best friend, but becomes MC's love interest) and her personality looks to be just as over the top (but then so is the MC's childhood friend). This could easily either end up as the feel-good romance/music anime of the season or turn out to be another White Album 2 (the title is the very ambigious/ominous 'Your *lie* in April,' afterall).
>> ARTICLE
This show was nice 
>> ARTICLE
The was some next level Un Tan from the elementary schooler in the blue dress.

Omg thank you.. finally an anime that doesn't overplay the first movement of the moonlight sonata.. THEY PLAYED THE EPIC THIRD MOVEMENT SUGOI.

This anime gives me so much nodame cantabile feels when they start playing music.. SO MUCH FEELS

Oh boy it starts of with 3rd movement of Moonlight sonata. Hopefully the blonde girl plays Vivaldi on that violin now, but a love triangle isn't that appealing if not done right 
>> ARTICLE
can anyone tell me if this series gets more serious cause i don't like the humor...

that little shonen gag put me off a bit, but only a bit. There's already a greater emphasis on drama than comedy, which I really appreciate in a show like this. My hope is that it stays fairly serious, and I think it will.

I love this. Its like Nodame but with tragedy

This could become my favortie anime very quickly. Music, romance, hopefully a little drama. Perfect!

Holy crap I really enjoyed that! I didn't feel like 22 minutes. I was so into it that it felt like less. I like how the blonde girl appears to be sweet and innocent, yet she is just a step away from satan. I can't wait for next week! I feel like I'm going to love this one!

OK I just finished the episode. I'm so happy to pick up this show. I wasn't too excited about this season's line-up but i think this will be one of the most enjoyable shows for me.

I love the characters so far and the animation is so colorful! looking forward to more

Really? o.O. This season is nuts
>> ARTICLE
Lol yeah. Most of the manga adaptations I wasn't excited about at all. Nothing really popped out to me. But after watching the first episodes of some of the other shows, like Amagi Brilliant Park and this show, I'm excited for them! Oh. I also like psycho pass and FSNUBW. But I guess most manga adaptations turned me off. 
>> ARTICLE
What about Bahumat, Grisaia and Parasyte.

This is like the most diverse season in years, theres like 20 different series that are atleast good enough to qualify for the 3 episode rule. Very few of them are well know mangas, baring Trinity Seven and Seven deadly sins.

its ridiculous. Its one of those very rare season where there is actually too many damn things to watch. I dont have time to follow that many series rofl
>> ARTICLE
no interest in bahamut. watched first episode like 5 minutes in. (thats just me) and i'm ok with not wanting to watch it right now. grisaia the last few minutes REELED me in. i'm interested in it. i read parasyte so idk if i'll follow it weekkly but wait till its done

Great first ep looking forward to the rest. For those interested there is also a sub for this /r/ShigatsuwaKiminoUso

Interesting contrast between Arima having to be thrown into the river by Tsubaki, and willingly taking the plunge to follow Kaori. It's symbolic of how Kaori instils in him an urge to follow her to higher places, whereas Tsubaki has to force him.

Then there's also the contrast of how Tsubaki's eyes looked clouded to her friend, which also alludes to her "clouded mind" or indecision towards the confession, whereas Kaori sparkles in Arima's eyes.

Lots of neat bits of symbolism (although basic symbolism) that get thrown in to make this series that bit more interesting to watch.
>> ARTICLE
can I marry you? that was very beautiful to notice, most people just ignore symbolism in things like anime and series.
>> ARTICLE
To talk about your first point more; obviously I don't know what happens in the next few episodes. But to me I don't feel like Kaori has given Arima the opportunity to act on his own. Both the first performance and now this piano competition feel like she's tricking or forcing him to do something she wants him to do - not something that he wants to do himself.

But maybe the bridge scene indicates the start of him possibly wanting to do these things for himself. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, that's the point. He pretty much says himself that he wants to follow Kaori to a higher place, to see what she sees. And that's why he takes the plunge. It's not about whether or not she's coerced him to do something before, it's about how he sees her and reacts to her compared to Tsubaki.
>> ARTICLE
Another cool thing, when Tsubaki was flashbackiong to the concert whilst monologuing about "a certain someone" not being hot and awesome like the highschool guy, there was a shot of Arima walking to the fron of the stage most performance all sweaty like, and he was [*literally steaming*](http://i.imgur.com/lDTRmYX.jpg). 

Whatever visual director they stuck on this episode has caught my attention, he/she's doing a damn fine job. It's like the director and animators took the show's ideas about art to heart and decided to just have fun animating the thing.
>> ARTICLE
Oooo that's a nice catch, I didn't cop that one myself. He's so *steamy* haha. Yeah it's very well thought-out visually. The symbolism is very straightforward but the show itself is very earnest, so they work in its context.
>> ARTICLE
Well the steaming isn't really symbolic here, if it is it's not only symbolic because when you are on stage you have millions of watts of power dirrected into lights beamed strait at you. You sweat and depending on humidity start to steam. It's really not uncommon. 
>> ARTICLE
That's like saying that rain is never symbolic because it's caused by precipitation. That's a silly statement. Obviously he was steaming because his body was incredibly hot. My body steams a lot after playing sports. That doesn't mean it wasn't used in that particular scene in a symbolic sense. There's often a reason that directors bother getting their artists to animate a particular thing.
>> ARTICLE
There's also the contrast of rainy and gray to sunny and bright, which I liked this episode. Gray when Kaori was out of his reach, like in the hospital or when she was talking with Watari, to a bright late afternoon when he meets her and they talk.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even pick up on the weather changes, it's so prominent yet I missed it. I guess it seemed so subtle, another great thing I like is subtle symbolism. Nice catch!
>> ARTICLE
Yep, that was another part of it. They're simple visual metaphors that you see in a lot of things, but they do really add to the experience.
>> ARTICLE
I'm definitely enjoying, although simple and basic, the symbolism. It's the small things that set good and great apart and this show is nailing it!

I love eyes a lot. They are all so different and beautiful in their own ways. You can read emotion through eyes like nothing else and that's a beautiful thing to me. The fact that they are including the slight symbolism with the eyes is outstanding in my opinion! 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, think this show might be actually trumping NagiAsu in the "OOOO PRETTY EYES" category. The faces in general are great. Eyes and lips are very well animated. I'm loving every bit of it so far. Kaori is painfully cute.
>> ARTICLE
I love the animation and art but I wouldn't say they were well animated especially this episode. Specifically, the laughing art didn't match up with the VA's laughing at least imo. Thats a minor concern though since the art and animation is generally amazing in every other scenario. 
>> ARTICLE
And I came here to say how awesome the animation in today's episode was. I never noticed the scene you're talking about. But I did notice that train scene. Hair fluttering in the wind. That lighting as the train passes behind them. Accompanied by that eerie music. One of the best scenes I've ever seen in any anime. Period.Can anybody upload a 60fps version of that please?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I agree that looked a bit off. I think they tried moving Kaori's mouth a bit too much, so it created a bit of dissonance between what we were seeing and what we were hearing. They should've just kept it simpler, with less lateral movement on her mouth. I'd say that was an anomaly, though. As you said, it's usually top notch.
>> ARTICLE
Literally everything in this show is perfect for me. I especially love the music, I've picked up a piece or two that I remember my first conductor playing before we started class for band and it's euphoric. 

This show has pushed me to buy a clarinet and continue playing since I put it down two years back,  to me that is amazing because nothing moves me to much but this show has just made me realize how big music was in my life and how much I fucking ***MISS*** it. I miss playing and having people smile and enjoy what I can create with a vibration of the reed and a few finger placements. I love this show to death whether sad or happy.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't played trumpet/cornet since high school (back in the 80s) and if I had the money, I'd buy a trumpet (and one of the fancy mutes that are out now). 

My sister played clarinet (and her youth orchestra played at the Calgary Olympics), but even she hasn't played in years.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat. When Kaori asked Kousei if he could forget it, my mind flashed back to the large number of performances I did through school, college, and beyond. I haven't touched an instrument since moving to a new city a couple of years ago and I miss it, so much.
>> ARTICLE
Mine was stolen by the biggest asshole in the world AFTER my final performance of my Freshman year in high school, as a senior, I wish I would have kept playing because I'm sure I could have played for the universities band next year.

The clarinet I'm getting is an exact replacement and it's a bit pricey but it's worth it, even if I only play it for myself.

I hope that you will pick up your instrument against and play, even if it's for your own ears!

EDIT: Fixed an extra letter on the end of final

Haha, that reminds me of how Prince Of Tennis, which was the first anime I ever watched about 10 years ago, made me ask my mom to buy me a tennis racket. I was a bit impulsive at the time, so I didn't last long!

That's the thing about film and television. The right work can inspire you to better yourself in some way, or help you through a tough time, or teach you a valuable lesson. Not in the forced way that some children's shows do, although a lot of anime is cringe-inducingly full of "FRIENDSHIP IS IMPORTANT" messages. Nana, for example, opened my eyes to a lot of shitty things about past relationships I've had that I never would've realised otherwise. I started seeing parallels in things I'd done to what the characters were doing.

Glad it made you pick it back up, though! There's a new film coming out called Whiplash that I imagine someone who's into music will like. Still only screening in select locations, but I can't wait to see it.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I remember my interest in learning to play Tennis because of Prince of Tennis. I'm still terrible at it, but I've learned to appreciate the sport more.
>> ARTICLE
Same, I didn't last very long! It's the same with every sports anime I watch. Whether it be baseball (Major), swimming (Free!), basketball (Kuroko No Basuke), boxing (Hajime No Ippo), tennis (Baby Steps) or ping pong (Ping Pong: The Animation), I get to know a little bit more about the sports as a result, and learn to appreciate them all.

Yeah I've been noticing that if I get a bit more critical with how I look at the shows that I watch I pick up on a few lessons. 

To name a few

Evangelion: We are all fucked up on some level. Picked this up because I related with a few things from each character.

Naruto(I am watching and only on episode 50 of the first season): Don't give up, keep getting up when something knocks you down in life.

Anohana: Enjoy the time you have with the people that are there, it can end in the worst of ways.

Hanayamata: [Hanayamata Major Spoilers](/s "Fucking tell your parents if you have a big event so they don't have to fucking fly you back to Japan and spend all that money")

Cross Ange: I am a straight male who is a simple man, even in anime, scantily clad women are hot.

I don't think "death flags" quite covers what's going on here. I'd say it's more of a "death fireworks show followed by the annual Death Parade on National You're So Fucking Dead Day." I'm just hoping they don't try to pull it as some sort of grand twist in the last two or three episodes. They have conclusively lost the ability to do that, and it wouldn't be great writing in the first place.

Good episode for one where nothing happens. Kaori has been dragging Kousei along for the ride up until now but this seems to be setting up for a change in his attitude. Glad that this is a two-cour so we can get slower paced episodes like this. A-1 seems to be acting pretty...*conservative* with the animation budged but since the "badly" animated scenes are all for maximum adorableness, it kinda works anyways.

RIP Kaori, second deadest girl besides zombie-loli-necromancer-chan this season.

Opinions :

A slow but great episode. We got to know more about Tsubaki. Kind of feeling bad for Kousei for not realizing that Kaori has it for him though. But... never mind that. Kaori x Kousei is amazing.

The music in this anime still amazes me. Both the ED and the OP are amazing and fit the show well.

You know those both are lossless, so a .flac will have exactly the same information as a .wav file, provided they were encoded from the same source and the same settings (bit depth, sampling frequency).

["Your lie in April."](http://imgur.com/BWWRiw4)

Kaori is amazing, and the emotion behind what they do can really be felt. Animation is top-notch as always, too.

You can do it, Kousei! You and Kaori are destined for great things. :3
>> ARTICLE
This is kind of off topic but can anyone explain to me why Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is translated as your lie in April? It would be helpful to me as a beginner at Japanese. I know Shigatsu is April and Kimo no Uso is your lie. But isn't wa a particle that points out the subject? So technically it would be best translated as "April is your lie" rather than Your lie in April since April would be used as a prepositional object in the second one. 
>> ARTICLE
April is the topic, not necessarily the subject.  It could be "As for April, your lie".  An example where the translation of the title would make sense would be when talking about the weather.  "As for tomorrow, cloudy" would be written similarly in Japanese, but the subject is weather rather than tomorrow, which is the topic.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't understand the lie.. can someone explain Dx
>> ARTICLE
Hey, sorry, was at work.

I'll try to explain her line there as best as I can and how I interpreted it.

The three most important words in her little speech there are "create," "beautiful," and "lie." "Create" here means making music; whether it be the intricate keys of the piano or the subtle movements of the violin strings, people have to create music before it can be heard.

"Beautiful" is her take on what music actually is. Many people find music to be hip, cool, fun, etc. To her, music is this form of expression that can evoke emotions that other forms can't compare to. Music has the potential to be a wonderful experience, depending on the person creating it.

"Lie" is in context of the situation she was describing. Some people "lose their way" when they are pursuing the thing they love to do, not knowing if the path they chose was correct. In this case, Kaori is describing how, despite musicians questioning the outcome, despite musicians questioning their choice of piece, they inevitably sit right back down to play the music they love to play.

Taking it all together, the "your lie in April" here means that even though he may hate or not want to play the piano, the music he will "create" will be the most "beautiful lie."

I hope this makes sense. Let me know otherwise!
>> ARTICLE
I didn't quite caught the actual meaning of that line when I was on my first sitting. I didn't know did they call their path a lie or the outcome of their performance was a result of continuous struggle until they perfected it, hence a "lie" about their talent.

I don't think I'm good with reading metaphoric phrases.
>> ARTICLE
That's alright! It takes practice to get these things sometimes. And honestly speaking, I could still be wrong. This is just the way in which I interpreted it. How the studio/author meant to have it received is another thing entirely.
>> ARTICLE
Ah I understand a bit more. The music he creates will be a "lie" in the sense that it will be beautiful even though he despises it. Not an actual lie someone says to another but more of the situation. Amazing!

>> ARTICLE
I really like this show but the way violin girl has been treating piano dude is somewhat irritating. Maybe I missed it but it seems like she's treating him as though he has a rather extreme case of stage fright when he's suffering from the effects of prolonged abuse. I kind of want him to get mad in his own defense and say something like   
"No, I'm not just afraid of playing, I'm not just afraid that I'm not good enough or that I don't deserve it. I'm afraid because every time I try to play the piano I start fucking hallucinating that my dead mother is staring at me."  

>> ARTICLE
The thing is I don't think violin girl knows thats the reason behind piano dude not wanting to play. Her goal is to make him play again, or more importantly to make him enjoy playing again. There are multiple scenes which would go different if her biggest priority was them playing together or something similiar. I get the feeling that she will die soon or at least will be unable to play and therefore move others so she plans to make piano dude play again so that she has accomplished something before that. That he can do it in her place.
>> ARTICLE
It could go either way in terms of her knowing. On one hand she's new. On the other, she said she did her research on him so maybe she knows because of that. What's more frustrating is the friends who definitely know why he wont/can't play and his own inability to explain exactly what's going on. On the whole, this behaviour is somewhat excusable due to their age but it's still frustrating to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the friends know exactly what happened. If he is down iat the bottom of a dark sea I don't think he would share what happened with others. I don't thinkchildhoof friend would watch him play so happily if the knew he was abused to do it. They do however know that something is of and might have a slight idea, but not enough to confront him. He would just brush it off. Violin girl is the same but she knows a lot less because she doesn't know him for long. She might know about his mothers death but not more.
>> ARTICLE
I think what's he's experiencing is some sort of classical Freudian hysteria.

He has this psychological symptom of not being able to hear his own playing, she's not trained to help him, so it will get messy.  Her being sick just seems to be piling it on.

>> ARTICLE
>He has this psychological symptom of not being able to hear his own playing, she's not trained to help him, so it will get messy.

This oddly reminds me of the reactions to some of Kouko's actions in Golden Time, albeit in reverse.  Here, Kaori's being lauded and idolized for harassing someone who's clearly mentally unhealthy.  [In Golden time, however,](/s "the discussion threads were full of people cursing and villainizing Kouko when she broke up with Banri, yet another clearly mentally unwell character.  He had betrayed her trust and broken his word on multiple occasions, and she obviously wasn't capable of providing the necessary care he required.  Breaking up with him may have been unfortunate, but it was beyond justifiable.")

I love that how we are judging this on a intellectual and academic level despite the fact that they are **14** years old. My goodness, what do they know about therapy? You guys are seemingly forgetting that the author chose that age precisely because it isn't what normal people do.

Besides, how do they even know about it being a major psychological issue?
>> ARTICLE
No one is expecting them to understand their situation.
>> ARTICLE
I really, really, really want him to stand up for himself and snap back at his fucking friends.

You are completely correct - he isn't just experiencing stage fright, he's having fucking flashbacks to his abuse as a child. His mom had a terminal illness, really wanted Kousei to succeed as a pianist in her stead, and hit him in order to make him play better. That's fucked up on all levels.

I get that his friends probably don't know of that past abuse, but they should be well aware that he experiences a strong negative reaction when playing the piano, and yet they - like his mother - basically harass him into doing it anyways because *they* think that he'll be better off if he plays the piano. They have good intentions - but they aren't fucking therapists and they shouldn't be forcing him to do things against his will. Covering someone's room in sheet music isn't normal. They could respect their friend's wishes whilst trying to help him in a more gentle manner, but nope, that's too difficult, I guess.

My biggest worry is that this show will legitimize his friend's half-assed attempt at therapy by having Kousei just get over his issues as a result of being forced to play the piano. I want his friends to at least have *some* repercussions for their behavior.

I don't mind slapstick violence in something like Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun but KimiUso is not Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. It clearly wants to be taken seriously as a character drama, yet it has Kousei flashing back to his abusing mother in one seen and his friends harassing or hitting him in the next. It's galling, and unnecessary. I like pretty much everything else about this show, but this one thing is really dragging it down in my opinion.

I agree with this comment wholeheartedly. One other thing that irks me is the fact that the audience reacted positively to what was an absolutely terrible performance. Considering that Kaori and everyone else got motivation from a terrible performance but inexplicably well-received performance, if the show keeps on using unrealistic factors like that to drive the show, I'm going to have to drop this one.

>> ARTICLE
> I really, really, really want him to stand up for himself and snap back at his fucking friends.

There is more to his dark past than what the anime has been showing us as of recently. We will see more of his past in the next two episode or so. And my comment to your quote, I do agree with your sentiment about wanting him to snap back at his friends. [But] (/s "the last time he snapped back at a certain someone, he totally regretted it to the point that he quit playing the piano.")
>> ARTICLE
I have to disagree with you to an extent. We have seen multiple times that Piano dude is still trying to stay in contact with music. He still listens to it a lot, as seen with the headphones in episode 1, and he still enjoys the act of playing, as seen with him playing with the kids. His trauma is like a blockade, preventing him from playing. He still wants to, but he doesn't. Therefore he made up the excuse that he can't. His childhood friend has probably seen a lot of similiar scenes as these in the past, which are however not shown on screen. We have seen her doing multiple subtle approaches to make piano dude playing the piano again, but all of them didn't work. Who knows how often she already tried before? He hasn't played for 2 years after all. Then suddenly someone else comes sho shares her intentions, wanting to make him play again. She has already tried the nice and gentle way, trying to convince him, but it didn't work. So they tried a more direct approach, and it worked. Instead of running away he starts to confront himself more, starts to try to see if it really is impossible (there was a scene where he played piano in the air while listening to the music). They knew he still wanted to, that's why they kept doing it so strongly. Of course putting a million score-sheets everywhere is not normal, but so is the amount of violence he endures and the reactions and other stuff. I just like imagine, if I want to see it as real, it would be about 10% of what you see there. Obviously it's exeaggerated, it's anime after all. His deepest wish is to play the piano again, somewhere in the middle of the dark dark see he is in. He might not be able to see it, but I think his friends took a hint.

The show's done an amazing job at showing us what kind of trauma Kousei has with the piano through flashbacks with the combination of the pleasant and unpleasant memories of his mother. Saying things like "none of you understand my mom" when he was younger but remembering the physical abuse she inflicted on him is a very dangerous combination.

I don't think I agree with the idea that his friends don't know about his past abuse. In the flashbacks, some people in the crowd are talking as if they knew that his mother abused him, so his childhood friend (name is escaping me right now) would DEFINITELY know that something wasn't right, yet she's still enough of a bitch to force him to break out of his safe place.

I really didn't enjoy the comparisons of how Kaori is "urging" him to do these things. She's pretty much forcing him. Coming to him and crying until he agrees, tricking him into saying he'll do "whatever she wants"... it's all pretty messed up emotional manipulation. 

As for your worry, I don't think there will be any repercussions or legitimization. I think that the show will just conveniently forget that they forced a traumatized middle schooler to do something he was dead set on never doing again through somewhat messed up methods. 
>> ARTICLE
Art and animation were pretty weird this EP, but the EP was still good.

These are still the oldest looking 14-year-olds. So odd to think they're the same age as the chars in Sora no Method...and let's not even get into the girls in Denki-gai, haha. If you showed me the art and said they were in college, I'd have little reason to doubt you.
>> ARTICLE
Check bakuman they are 14 too, these look like kids compared to them
>> ARTICLE
I honestly think they look right for their age. Their faces are still a bit rounded and their height is about right. Maybe they would be first or second years in high school at most. I think this is one of the few anime where I thought, hm they actually look their age whereas in others, high school students usually = 20 years old. 
>> ARTICLE
Huh, maybe in comparison to some anime they look old, but definitely not college age. Compare it to something like Kuroko no Basket and they look really young (The guys in that are 15-16). It really depends on what you are comparing it to.
>> ARTICLE
I think you read his comment wrong. He described the characters in **Denki Gai** as too young for college age which they are presented as. He described this show's characters as just younger than they look. 
>> ARTICLE
Each episode is more beautiful than the previous :) 
>> ARTICLE
Phew! I just caught up with this last week, and it's quickly become my favourite for AotS so far. The soundtrack and art are fantastic, even though it does have a few "QUALITY" moments. Just watching this show gives me goosebumps every time. It has an incredible amount of potential.

My that was a lot of foreshadowing ("So I passed out *again*, huh?" - and she lies to everyone saying "It's the first time" ^^Oh ^^jesus ^^christ ^^why ). I'm kind of scared of the future of this show. It seems to be lining up for a tragic ending, which will probably kill me. Yet another great episode, the long wait for the next begins.
>> ARTICLE
That's my only problem with it. It's trying to hard to be sad and foreboding. Takes away from all the happy moments because you know something bad is coming.
>> ARTICLE
That just makes it better. The best feels come with a contrast between sad and happy parts.
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling that we are watching something really really special here guys.  I hope I'm not wrong, but this show has the potential to be beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Each episode never fails me to make me tear up atleast a little. It's not even about it being sad, it's just amazing to see the passion in their lines and actions that gets to me.
>> ARTICLE
I think I have a huge problem with shows like this. I'm a huge sucker for it. I'm a huge sucker for people who have passions and have the drive to try for things they love. I don't even know why considering I have no life passion but more weekly whims.

Sakurasou no pet was another show like this. Although that show has quite a few flaws and a dislikable MC, I still found it thoroughly enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
I knew this show was going to make me cry but I didn't expect it to happen every episode. I'm an amateur musician and seeing the crowd cheering at their performance from their perspective hit home; I'll never forget that feeling either.

I get you. Honestly I think the music is to blame. It seeps into your soul and brings out every emotion to the surface.

>> ARTICLE
This series is so heartwarming. Drive. Succeed. Push Forward. Despite it all. 

Keeps throwing those ideas at us rather bluntly. But I can't help but love the heart it has when it does. [That's embarrassing to say though.](http://i.imgur.com/zr3s9RK.png) Here you have a bunch of kids just passionately chasing something, and you can't say that's an original concept. But execution of the entire thing has been superb so far.

So then, can someone elaborate on what the 'Lie' was for me? Kaori mentioned it. But honestly, what I got from it is that... holy crap. I just got an epiphany.

Okay, so here's my take. Kousei says he doesn't feel worthy of picking up the piano again right? He doesn't think he's able to just pick it up where he left off, when he's already given up. He feels he shouldn't. Kaori then says that a lot of musicians are like that, and give up. So is her lie the fact that it appears that she's never given up? That it looks like she's never hit a roadblock thus far? That at one point she did? 

Bleh, well that's my word spew. What's the 'lie' guys? It's going to be damn central to this entire ride. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, there are times when musicians suddenly hate the music they are playing. But they buckle down and still play the music they hate because they are musicians. And despite their hatred, they still create beautiful music which is according to Kaori their "beautiful lie". 

And as of the title "Your lie in April" , taking from my explanation, it suggests that Kousei, as a musician, lost his way from the piano because of his traumatic past. But even though he quit playing the piano, he still played beautifully in Kaori's performance despite their terrible start. **To make it simpler, it's like saying, "I want to quit playing the piano but I will still play it because I am a musician." That is his lie. And as of the "April", they say that April is ending which in my opinion suggests that his lie is ending as he rekindles his love for playing the piano.** 

Hope my explanation makes sense. 

Edit: But the title can be a double entendre. It may also refer to Kaori's lie about her condition. Despite Kaori's shining light, she is actually a dying star, literally. But of course, it's just an assumption.


>> ARTICLE
I thought the "Lie" was putting on a false performance by "imaging" the music piece on Arima's side by pretending he could hear the notes when performing for the audience. Kaori possibly wanted Arima to put on a performance where it would seem Arima is perfectly normal. Your Lie in April being beautiful music played with "imagining" the notes. That's my guess anyways.

I of course can be wrong......May need to rewatch the scene myself.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the lie was more something like how musicians say they'll never play again and yet, they'll pick it up again. idk though o.O
>> ARTICLE
I think their going for the "kaori is lying to you about her condition" because her death flags are so large you can see them from space. Though that might be the lie that Kousei is telling. Maybe all the characters have something their lying about?
>> ARTICLE
I think this is closer to the mark. Whether is is their feelings for each other. Or their will to play. Or their health condition. Each member of this group is lying to themselves about something. And in theory those will all be dispelled 
>> ARTICLE
This show has by far stirred the most regret in me that I've ever had watching an anime. As someone in his mid-20s who has never felt as passionate about or been as skilled at anything as these two are about music, who wishes he had learned some type of instrument or had any musical inclinations in his youth, who's never had friends as close as Tsubaki and Watari, not to mention Kaori - it's an exercise in watching things I wish would have been different.

But regrets aside, I am immensely enjoying this show. The direction is superb, and while this episode was not as powerful as the last one was, the character relationships and motivations are being fleshed out nicely. No fantastic musical accompaniments this time, but there was another healthy dose of symbolism in lighting and actions to really send the messages home. Here's to hoping Kaori's condition isn't as bad as it seems (despite her lying to everyone else about it - always a bad sign) and we get to see the amazing musical duo in action plenty more times in the episodes to come.
>> ARTICLE
It's not too late. You still have most of your life ahead of you! 

When I was thirty I decided to teach myself the piano. Got some books and taught myself to read music and learn some basic scales. There was a long dry spell and I still can't play with any kind of fluidity, but that is mainly because I am lazy (hehe). 

I got myself a used performance keyboard for dirt cheap, and an old MIDI sampler for free. You can hook these up to a PC and lay basic tracks down easily and there are a ton of tools on-line to help you learn. It's a long process but something you can just do for fun, noodling around at your own pace. Or if you get serious, get lessons and maybe a cute girl will become your muse. :)
>> ARTICLE
As a music person myself, lessons are generally cheap and a very strong motivator.  If you really want to play well, set a goal, some kind of performance is generally best...  That or watch beck... just watch beck and go practice.  :P
>> ARTICLE
More emphasis on the opposite personalities of Kaori and Kousei this episode with the heavy play on lighting. They are two completely different people, and yet it is Kaori's free spirit that is drawing Kousei in.

Seems like Tsubaki also sees Kousei growing closer to Kaori and its hurting as a result. She clearly feels something for Kousei, and yet her sempai comes back into her life.

So Kousei will be heading back into the world of music. As a rigid by the books compositioner or like a free spirit like Kaori?
>> ARTICLE
Kaori is definitely hinting at more than just anemia with her, "I won't forget even if I die". She is most likely afflicted with some terminal disease and this is why she wants to play in competitions and live on in people's hearts. It would also probably explain why she's so care-free and quirky.

Childhood friend is maybe coming to realize she has romantic feelings for Kousei, but isn't yet ready to admit it. Poor childhood friend, we all know your chances of winning are so slim. ;_; Even though I adore Kaori, I will still cheer for you in my heart. Looks like from the preview that next episode there's some development for her, too. It'll only get worse as the show progresses: the hurt, cutting onions and sunken ships.
>> ARTICLE
You saw it in the previous episode, when Koari and Kousei looked at each other in the duel, childhood friend looked quite stunned and sad. She forgot about that moment because she collapsed, probably. 
>> ARTICLE
ALL THE FEELS!

nah i haven't watched it yet, these are preparation feels.
>> ARTICLE
RIP Kousei's glasses
>> ARTICLE
I only started this show today (thanks to a recommendation from /u/LordGravewish) and I just want to let out how stunningly beautiful and amazing this show is. I still have some trouble getting into the character designs (those eyes and lips are a bit weird), but the backgrounds, the scenery... damn, if that's how the TV version looks like, it's going to give 5 cm/s a run for its money when it comes out on BD.

And it does such a great job at conveying different tones. I usually don't like it when a show swings too much between comedy and seriousness, but this one pulls it off masterfully. You can really feel the despair in A-kun's monologues, it brings you down into his dark, soundless world, and a few moments later you can't help smiling along with energetic Kaori (I keep calling her Chitanda in my head, I'm really bad with remembering names), even if you realize on some level that her 'genki-ness' might be just a facade. And it can hit you straight in the gut with just a short well-placed phrase; for me especially last episode's *"Music is freedom"* felt almost cathartic.

In this season dominated by sequels (at least for me) it's nice to be able to witness something completely original that has so much potential to be brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
I still haven't watched episode 5 (I dislike most CR subs and the lack of karaoke/typesetting, so I usually wait for at least a TLC fansub), but considering everything up to episode 4, I completely agree with you - the show is really amazing and beautiful. I don't remember ever watching a show with such a strong start before.

As for the character designs, they are different, but I personally like them considering they're so expressive and fit with the rest of the art-style.

Anyways, I'm glad you enjoyed my recommendation :)
>> ARTICLE
Goddammit, would they just break poor Tsubaki's heart already? Stop dragging it out! ()

I'm sure they'll figure out what's really going on with Kaori sooner or later, too... Bring the pain! I-I can take it!... \**sniff*\*...

>> ARTICLE
This episode was absolutely beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Still like my fav anime this season
>> ARTICLE
I love watching this show, it's just... I am so fucking scared for Kaori. I love her character, especially when she is with Kousei. 

So if she truly is dying like it's implied. Fuck man, I'm not excited for this [feel-trip](http://rs1img.memecdn.com/time-for-a-feel-trip_o_958270.jpg) at all!
>> ARTICLE
[This scene was great.](http://youtu.be/JDdG1C6ydOk)

The tracking shot follows Kousei and slowly reveals Kaori. As Kaori comes more into view in the frame, Kousei spots her and comically hides from her. It then switches to Kousei's POV, which puts the audience in his shoes and makes it easy to root for the guy. The insert shot of the sandwich (suggesting he wants to give it to her) shows him finally mustering up some courage, then only to be thwarted by Watari.

Couldn't agree more!
>> ARTICLE
People need to take note that all of the key animation done in this episode was drawn by **one** person. We saw it GochiUsa Ep. 4, this week's Yama no Susume, and also Sora no Method's ED. It really is an amazing feat for one person to draw an entire episode alone, and still move it as much as they did this episode. So to the people who are saying "this scene was great" and "this scene was amazing," it was all drawn by the same person.
>> ARTICLE
Best show of the season. I'm in love.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone is getting some serious development so far Kaori is anemic, Kousei's 
passion for music and Tsubaki's Senpai, but Watari is seriously lacking compared to the 
rest of the cast hopefully in the next episodes we can see what he has to offer.

Kids really know how to live their childhood to their fullest  
That [scene](http://i.imgur.com/zfEMwk0.png) reminded me of poor [:'(](/s "Hatoko")

[She did it she dropped the title on us!](http://i.imgur.com/aD7sgXf.jpg), from here on out its going to be intense!  
Their relationship so far is actually quite cute they're both inspired by each other as musicians... so far wit only some subtle hints cant wait for that development.
His passion for music is coming back and the imagery of him leaping of the bridge and his cheerful [smile](http://i.imgur.com/XuCl6E1.jpg) warmed my heart [:3](http://i.imgur.com/QB0iugz.jpg)

Just letting you guys know that since there were no performances this week, there won't be a classical performances write up for this week's episode.  

**However**, I will be writing an Anime/Manga comparison in it's place (in order to maintain a weekly post).  I'm halfway done with it, and since I need to run off to choir practice right now, it will be finished when I get back (within the next 2-3 hours.)

What the hell kind of game is jumping off the bridge?! I don't know how no one stops bunch of kids jumping from the freaking bridge xD

I like Tsubaki more... Probably gonna become love triangle in which she gets left out :P
Kinda wished she'd go out with the baseball captain guy, but that's not how it goes...
>> ARTICLE
I have an uneasy feeling about this show so i'm calling it. Calling it now!

She plays in a so remarkably and unique way that they won't ever forget her, because she has some chronic illness and is going to die soon.

I hope i'm wrong about it ;__;
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I have a rough idea of the plot for the rest of the series now (the only question is does the flag proc). Tsubaki is getting cloudy, but on the bright side, this isn't the Psycho-Pass universe. Also a minor thing but worth pointing out: Kaori downplays her condition but it is clear she is depressed, there may be a point in the series where the roles are reversed, at the climax perhaps?
>> ARTICLE
This is an interesting idea.  She might even be manic-depressive.  All her sparkleiness  may just be the flip side of dark times to come.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, this episode sure was indeed appropriately moody. I love how blunt it is by making what should be noted highlighted through clouds and with the fancy expressions. You just can't miss anything because it basically highlights it for you using the scenery and effects beautifully that you don't notice the yellow highlighter beautifully making note of the lovely drawn scenery. As people said it has an awesome symbolism while constantly hinting and implying stuff.

But damn, Kaori, you're now reminding me of Arima's mother with how kind you both were with a possible twist of Kaori turning evil later. It's been suggested by people with my gradually leaning on it as well. Nice that she's being a happy beautiful human tornado though. She did have some interesting implied scenes while having important thoughts both implied and hidden through body language and mood changes. 

Tsubaki, it took a friend of yours to make note of how you're harassing Arima. She however shrugged it off while being blinded by friendship. She is aware, just blinded by friendship. Also more lovely symbolism and a forced coincidence with that train and cloudy bit. Nicely done scene with obvious response of it being nice. Typical love conflict point though. Reminding me of Golden Time.

A bit frustrating how I can relate to Arima in that school context. We've been there, I've been there, and seeing it in the anime is just frustrating when you see Arima unable to express his feeligns to Kaori with Watari coming in; Again when Arima felt like he was being used. Now patting Arima on the shoulder as I know that painful feeling. Thanks to those scenes I know feel horrible thanks to the feeling given. It revived memories I've been trying to keep hidden >_>

Bridge jumping? Damn. Pushed, then addicted then willfully jumping on his own. RIP Glasses/Megane. Too bad he can't swim, like me. At least I indirectly know people do such outside of my city and got introuble for doing so on a historical red scenic wooden bridge. Even took him long enough to note the glasses though. Kaori had to point it out!

(There's just so much to note that I tried keeping things summed up and short. Still ended up long, sorry!)

Let me enjoy this show in peace without all the death flags. I can't take it ;_;

Woah, was Yuuasa Maasaki or Yoshinari You in the team for this episode?  
Some parts in the episode really remined me of both's animation styles.
>> ARTICLE
So, there's are some who noticed the "Masaaki Yuasa scenes" too, nice... 
>> ARTICLE
Nope, this episode was the work of Takashi Kojima. He's done key animation for a lot of various episodes of various anime in the past, such as Bakemonogatari, Kill la Kill, The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, Penguindrum, Space Dandy, et cetera. He's never been the overall director for a series, but he is clearly a very talented animator.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I read that a few moments later. I guess I though that it could have been Yoshinari You since both Yoshinari and Takashi have worked on Kill la Kill, and parts of this episode reminded me of KlK.
>> ARTICLE
Just when I thought I might start losing interest after the Obvious Death Flags last week (can we *please* stop killing women in order to motivate male characters? please?) this show continues to otherwise be the perfect combination of everything I love in a hetero romance anime. The animation this week was so great, in a very weird way, too. The way it showed perspective in such a subjective way was a real treat. Seriously though, if Kaori dies (which let's face it she probably is) I will rage so hard because that is just lazy writing.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. That's the only thing stopping it from becoming my Aots. All this foreboding atmosphere, the abundant death flags scattered throughout the episode and the way Kaori talks and acts like she's lost all hope and is just going through her bucket list.
>> ARTICLE
I want their romance or whatever to end tragically, but goddamn. "Tragic" does *not* always have to mean "and then she died". It's so lazy and tired and complete bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
Truth. I'm hoping for a little more creativity in the writing.
>> ARTICLE
Does Kaori like Kousei or just use him because he is a talented pianist, I'm confused.

>> ARTICLE
My guess is she just wants to save him before she kicks the bucket.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, and she'll obviously actually fall in love with him somewhere along the way (if she hasn't already).
>> ARTICLE
My favorite episode so far...This was so great the sceneees they kept building up to and the dvelopment that goes through it AHHH. love this show.
>> ARTICLE
How I love this show.  It really just hits everything I like and want in an anime.  From lovable and funny characters to the fluffy lighthearted tone of the show.  It has gorgeous visuals and I can't help but smile when watching.  

Especially this episode.  I had the biggest grin seeing Kousei jump in after Kaori.  Watching him just laugh and smile so purely was awesome.  :)


>> ARTICLE
Just finished the latest episode and although I didn't see any performance's, I think the episode is filled with emotions wherein they get to think of what the characters are really after. 

I've been stressing myself about the English Translation of the Title "Your Lie in April" and when Kaori passed out on the previous episode the title caught me that this might be something related to what Kaori said in April and I think this episode is the start of their April.

Wherein Kaori lied about her experience of passing out, she said its her first time, and I did wish it, but it wasn't her first time and that lie just scares me of the possibilities T _ T
>> ARTICLE
Jesus does show give me so many warm fuzzies on the inside every Friday...it's so engrossing to watch
>> ARTICLE
My speculative theory is that the show will parallel Kousei's relationship with his mother to his relationship with Kaori. Kousei played the piano in hope that his mom would get over her disease, and this kept him playing until she passed away. Now he sees Kaori as that inspiration to play. Is Kousei going to go have to overcome another experience of lost inspiration, this time by himself at the end of the series? Doesn't bode well for her... I'm not ready for these feels. 
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people on here are talking about Death Flags for Kaori, I am inclined to agree because dammit if shes not a female Kamina though a lot less "Epic".

So, the 'lie' referred to in the title turned out not to be negative afterall... for now. There's no telling which way this series could go from here. Also; there was an unusual abundance of fluidly animated chibi version characters in this episode, compared to previous episodes.

EDIT: Everyone crying death flag. I don't think so. This anime really doesn't need it. The relationship square between the group is all the drama this show needs. Killing off Kaori would add nothing to this show, unless they plan to ditch the romance aspect and make it a "follow your dream even if it's hard show" which I would seriously hate.

The MC is pretty unstable as it is.  If she died this early, he'd be right back to square one.

This anime has really been meeting my expectations with every episode.  I really love how I can't tell whether I'm inside Kousei's head or not.  I love how Kaori is constantly spreading good feelings and cheer even carrying the burden of un-revealed disease.  With each episode, I feel like I'm being absorbed into the show's universe and actually caring about each specific interaction and what consequence it will bring.  I'm genuinely impressed by this show.  KEEP IT UP :)

And the clichs continue... No classical music this week either. Just repeated flashbacks to the *previous episode*.

Meanwhile, Tsubaki makes it obvious that she's in love with Kousei (as if we didn't all already see it coming), and the love triangle continues to be set up. And Kaori tells them "this has never happened before, I'll be fine" before eventually admitting in private that it's not the first time it's happened (again, we saw it coming). RIP in pieces, Kaori... Though I suspect we'll end the show on a happy note with her and Kousei making the most of their lives rather than on a "Kaori's dead, time for sadness" note.

Minor notes: Kousei seeing Kaori and walking toward her, then immediately turning around upon seeing Watari approach (while "rapping"?) was kinda funny and kinda sad. And the show continues to repeat the "violence against Kousei is funny" gag.

While I will admit I haven't been the biggest fan of this series so far, I thoroughly enjoyed this episode. The pacing and writing was for the most part well-done throughout, though it continues to be incredibly blunt with it's use of foreshadowing metaphorical images and dialogue. 

I do wish they would have balanced their use of  budget with the animation more, as out of what I've seen, it's the most completely inconsistent show I've watched. It's far from poor, but it's incredibly jarring and uncomfortable to go from these incredibly smooth and highly detailed seconds to the next scene being borderline rough sketches. I understand saving budget for the more intensive scenes when it counts, but here it's not even that, it's more so that brilliant animation is splice throughout lesser animation almost randomly, creating a very odd effect. 

Though I can say for certain that this show (and Yuki Yuna) have the best OSTs so far.

Wow, they're getting very heavy handed with the [death flags](https://imgur.com/a/6nbAI) now.

I really think it'd be lame if they kill her at this point.  They've foreshadowed her death so much it's just getting over the top now.  At least I hope they don't kill her. I don't think my heart could take it.
>> ARTICLE
I was hoping to get that wallpaper!  THANK YOU!
>> ARTICLE
Potential spoilers because I'll try reading into the symbolism here (though I think this outcome is the most likely either way)

I really enjoyed the symbolism there. The firework thingy only has a little glow left, but nontheless the violin girl didn't throw it away, she still treasures her life, even if it is on the brink of extinction and could go out any moment. On the flipside, she the "steals" the firework thingy from Arima, showing of his full potential with throwing it around and showing it everyone, while keeping her own thirework thingy in the background, behind her back.

I like how this reflects the whole dynamic of both of them and also her goal and motivation. She knows she could die (or maybe something a bit less bad, but similiar) any moment, but she seth erself the goal to bring Arima back on the track of a musician no matter what. She wants to bring him to the forground, on the big stage, and bring him back to how he once was. She thinks that she will not be able to play/live soon so she wants to do something lasting before that. There is probably a bit more backgroundstory on why she specifically decided on him that we didn't know yet, but I am quite sure this is why she decided to not come to the music show. Will be interesting to see if I am wrong or right :D
>> ARTICLE
i think she's probably in the hospital, that's why she missed the show. I hope they tell us what disease she has, I'd be pretty pissed if it turns out to be the Cough of Death
>> ARTICLE
Didn't they show her laying on the beach somewhere?
>> ARTICLE
...that's the ED. 
>> ARTICLE
My memories aren't as reliable as I hope they would be...
>> ARTICLE
That does sound very plausible.
Why do you think Kaori's parents' shop was closed?
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if I remember it right but wasn't it really late already when they met? I mean it after they did the fireworks. Usually backeries don't have open that late.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, sorry, I meant during the gala. It shows Kaori's phone and slowly moves closer to outside where you can see the blinds of the bakery completely shut (17:47).
>> ARTICLE
No idea. It didn't seem like anyone was home and she let her phone there deliberately, might be something like she wants to not be reachable and didn't tell her parents about it so they went somewhere together.
>> ARTICLE
If that's the case it'd be somewhat of a troll, which I don't think this show would do. I think the reason they introduced her parents earlier in the episode was a set-up for that moment. They run a shop, so would normally be working there in the daytime. But they weren't, and Kaori didn't have her phone. It could mean that there was an emergency so she wasn't able to get her phone (possibly even physicallycould have collapsed) and her parents wouldn't have got it because it wouldn't matter as much. I'm guessing something probably happened to her, like most people seem to be. It could be a "twist" but there at least must have been some sort of emergency that involved both her and her parents.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't they show her laying somewhere on the beach or did I just imagine that?
>> ARTICLE
I... don't remember that at all.  I... When in the episode was it?
>> ARTICLE
Someone else just told that it was in the ED and he was probably right... guess I am stupid sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
I look forward to rewatching the whole series looking for symbolism like this once we know how tragic (or not *fingers crossed*) the end is going to be.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah they are foreshadowing her death way too much. The show isn't even trying to be subtle. At this point it will be even more surprising if she doesn't die / get in a coma or something.
>> ARTICLE
Trying to imagine her receiving some sort of miraculous healing from a black reverand, but the Engrish is too strong.
>> ARTICLE
It's not supposed to be foreshadowing anymore. The end of last season was pretty much an explicit statement that she believes she's going to die. We're supposed to know, and now the death flags are just for dramatic irony.

I call it foreshadowing with a sledge hammer

I wonder what it means, I would love to see the lyrics of the song. She's lying motionlessly in an ocean, crying to herself. As she opens her eyes the sun is just setting and it turns night very quickly, like there is no real sense of time any more. Then for the last part of the song, the 'camera' looks up and we see Kaori floating throw space, again in a rather senseless way. I hope she's not ending up in a coma, the way she lies there all alone cut off from the world is really unsettling in a way.

I don't think I've wanted a character to live as much as I do for Kaori.

I love her character so much and I'm so scared for the future because I don't want what the show is implying to be true.

I'm glad Shigatsu is back, it was a lonely 2 weeks without it.

The new OP and ED were good, but not quite as great as the 1st of both.

Hopefully next week Kousei slays that keyboard!

I doubt it. If she actually does die it's hardly going to be in the middle of the show.

Well... I've seen things where a character actually does die in the middle of the show although the writers could have put the heaviest plot armor or created the biggest ass-pull humankind ever heard of...

Most likely shes in the hospital and her parents shop was closed because they were there with her. No need for a phone while you're a patient at a hospital either, since they're suppose to be off in certain parts of the hospital.

edit: After the Gala will be the point where Kousei finds out about her illness.
>> ARTICLE
Another cliffhanger ... WHYYYYYYY!

I'm so hyped for next week it's going to be insane, i binged the manga until the beginning of the gala concert when Kosei starts to play and i forced myself to stop. I've waited more than 2 months to know what happens to Kaori and to see how Kosei manages to successfully play.

Kami-sama, thank you for that beautiful anime.

Both the OP and ED are really nice even though i prefer Hikaru Nara.

[Here's a playlist of the classical performances we've heard so far in the show. (Updated weekly!)](http://bit.ly/1xUdUUD)

---

It's been a few weeks since I felt we needed a new classical write up (since the Wrong Notes tude was in the spot light the last couple episodes).  The piece in the spotlight during this episode and the next will be Liebesleid (composed by Fritz Kreisler).

---

## Episode 12 List of Classical Performances:

This week's main performance is courtesy of Kousei and Kaori as they prepare for the Gala Concert.

---

**Kreisler: Liebesleid (Love's Sorrow)** - "Musicians may argue about the quality of Fritz Kreislers music, but no one disputes its enduring popularity. His original pieces embody all the admirable characteristics of a bygone world: grace, charm, elegance, wistfulness, and heart-on-the-sleeve sentimentality. To these qualities, he added the idiomatic touch of a born fiddler who wrote splendidly for his instrument. 

The last of the great romantic violinist-composers, Kreisler was the youngest student to ever gain admittance to Viennas Musikverein Conservatory. He was seven. Studying violin with Joseph Hellmesberger and theory with no less than Anton Bruckner, he won the gold medal at age ten and never looked back. Barely pausing for a couple of years study in Paris, Kreisler was touring in America by the time he was 14. He pursued a stellar international career from 1899, with an interruption to serve in the Austrian Army during the first World War.  He lived in Berlin between the wars then, when the Nazis invaded France, migrated first to France and eventually to the USA.  Kreislers performing career lasted half a century, concluding with the 1949-50 season. 

Although often performed separately, Liebesleid (Loves Sorrow) and Liebesfreud (Loves Joy) were published together with Schn Rosmarin as Alt-Wiener Tanzweisen (a set of three Viennese-style dances). Collectively, they are Kreislers most famous miniatures. They were modeled after the music of Josef Lanner, a contemporary of Johann Strauss the Elder. Kreislers subtle injection of cross-rhythms and irregular accents relates this music to the Richard Strauss of Der Rosenkavalier. The melodic appeal and panache are pure Kreisler, however. " [(Source)](http://www.tecs.org/concert.php?t=alessio+bax%2C+piano&c=38&notes=1)

This piece has two versions: the original violin/piano version, and then the transcribed version by Rachmaninoff.  This week,  I will link a video of the violin/piano version [and](/s "save the solo piano version for next week since Kaori goes AWOL (for a very ''good'' reason) and Kousei ends up playing Liebesleid by himself.")  With that said, here's an interpretation of this piece by [Kreisler himself (recordings from 1930 & 1942).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jniNETA36Us)

---

Here's the kickoff of the second cour!  Kaori received a letter from the competition committee that there's a gala concert, and then gets Kousei to play with her again.  However, the song she picked was something that hit a little too close to home for Kousei - Kreisler's *Liebesleid*.  As we saw this episode, Kousei's mother loved this song and played it all the time as Kousei grew up.  Kousei's been trying to forget about his mother, and if they're going to be playing this piece, he's going to have to face these feelings about his mother once and for all. Does she resent him for what he did?  Will she forgive him for what he did?  Kousei will find answers to these questions next episode.  [(Major Manga/Ep 13 Spoiler)](/s "During the performance, Kousei starts things off roughly.  However, he then realized how his mother played the piece gently and then goes through another transformation and plays it in a way that lets you feel the love a mother has for her child.  After he finishes the piece, he finally said farewell to his mother and started to officially move on (in fact, it was even revealed that the visions he had of his mother were nothing more than a construct he came up with in order to run away from the piano).  The day after the performance, Seto-san and Emi's teacher had coffee together and discussed Kousei's progression/transformation.  Seto mentioned that the death of Kousei's mother pushed him forward and caused him to mature a bit.  The sad part, though, is that Seto-san remarked later on (while conversing with Emi's piano teacher) that in order for Kousei to advance and mature further, it would be from further loss (and that is heavily implied to be Kaori)")

Thanks again for taking the time to read my post this week! I hope you're looking forward to next week's episode as much as I am! :-)
>> ARTICLE
As a musician myself, the whole commentary of playing what is on the page versus what you interpret is just a fascinating topic. I know I've been told that my interpretation of some pieces are "too bold" but on the flip side.I've been criticized for being too mechanical like Arima.

Music is a universal language and whatever makes you feel good is all that is needed, there is no need to put restrictions on what music is and what music isn't
>> ARTICLE
To a certain extent I agree with you, but it's also important to honor what the composer intended as well.  If you stretch the score too much, you're not really playing their composition, you're playing something else entirely.

I'm all for expression in classical music, but not if you're wrecking the genius of the original score in the process.
>> ARTICLE
And that's where a lot of people start debating. A lot of younger musicians I've played with think that the genius behind a lot of pieces is that there's so much room for interpretation.

A good example is Hungarian Rhapsody. You can play it as written (danceable with predictable tempo changes) or extremely loosely (in regard to tempo and even some notes). Most professional pianists take the loose approach because there's so much room to make it personal despite the fact that it's technically demanding.
>> ARTICLE
But if the piece is played totally differently but still shows power, genius and emotion like the original, is it wrecking the genius of the composer?
>> ARTICLE
No, but it is exposing the genius of an entirely different composer -- the person who is playing. The original composition acts like a sort of springboard once you start to really make it your own.
>> ARTICLE
Koharu too cute imitating Kousei freaking out!
>> ARTICLE
Gah! What happened to Kaori!? Did she fall again!? Hospital!? Goddamn it...

Perhaps next episode is when Kousei finally overcomes his weakness? Can't wait to see the next one, cuz apparently it's going to be real good.

I love the new OP, and while the new ED is nice as well...I kinda like the old one better. The music fit better when the previews were coming on for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Uhh have you watched the setup this episode and the new ending? I'm pretty sure the next episode needs only 3 letters as a summary and those are R, I and P.

I was already thinking if they're going to kill kaori they'll probably do it soon, because otherwise they don't have enough time to show the consequencial character development and I also feel like the relationship between Arima/Emi will become much deeper which is hard to pull off when Kaori is still around.

I'd say she has max 5 episodes left to live, probably less.
>> ARTICLE
**LALALALALALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!**
>> ARTICLE
Really? I hate the new generic OP. It can be any other anime opening.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I can feel ya, the new Opening could be used for any other generic romantic anime, it doesn't feel right or true like the Goose House one did, the melody was catchy, the lyrics made a lot of sense for this series. Geez. I know it can't be avoided now but I'm really gonna miss the energy, the powerful sound of Goose House being the OP of this.

It made the perfect setting, it got you ready for what was coming. Damn, music really is something beautiful, isn't it?
>> ARTICLE
The old op was so catchy it would be stuck in my head for days.
>> ARTICLE
It felt grand with all of Goose House singing along and playing all their instruments. This new one just doesn't feel that way.
>> ARTICLE
I don't mean to say that all you guys who think that way are wrong, of course not. That's your opinion and I have no right to say you're wrong. And I'm not saying this one is better, but I certainly think it's just as good.

But I'm really liking the lyrics for this song, and I like how it's toned down a bit compared to the first OP. It makes it feel like we're in the second half of the show. I don't need both OPs to be extremely exciting and grand and OMGTHISISGOD!! (although, of course, I won't complain at all if it was like that.) I'd rather have the first OP be godly to hook people in, and the second be toned down and be more focused on something deeper than art and animation.

Is it generic? Maybe, but I think it matches well with the anime, and seemingly matches with the story of the second half.
>> ARTICLE
The fact is that the next episode will have a major progression one way or another. Either Arima will start to overcome his fears of being on stage (and begin to play with his emotions), or Kaori will return and we'll see the performance we wanted to in the beginning. Either way we'll probably see an introduction to Kaori's sickness to the rest of the group.

Well, considering all the deathflags for Kaori she's probably going to bite the dust sometime soon. So they need to replace her with a ~~worst~~new girl. Guessing that's her.

Taking bets. Who wants to bet that either:

1) She knew Kousei had a deep attachment to that song, was playing him like that violin, and bailed knowing he would do this (unlikely).

2) She's either on the ground in her bedroom sick again or in the hospital right now.

Great episode as usual. OP and ED are changed but both are still great. The ED, in particular, will hit REALLY hard once [Prediction spoilers](/s "Kaori dies.") I'm not sure I can handle that.

 Cliffhanger made this week's wait really really bad.

Alright guys. Sick Main Heroine, Fireflies and MC hates one of his parents. On top of that, now we know Sick Main Heroine's parents are lively, cheerful bakers. 

I guess all the deathflags were not just empty threats. I just hope the fireflies will come and save the day ^^^^andpickupthebrokenpiecesofourhearts

Missed this show. 


New opening was pretty good. First one is better. But the new ED is amazing

I'm looking forward to next week's episode amidst all the subtle deathflags. 

Also, thank you for caring about our safety anime. I'll be sure to not have two people on a bike.

I like to discuss the OP/ED of shows. However, instead of discussing just the song, I like to talk about what the song accompanied by the video might be telling us about what is to come. I think the ED tells us alot more than the OP tells us but I will still talk about the OP first.

After rereading it, I think I made a couple good points amongst a useless wall of text. **If you just want the good points read paragraph 3 and 4**.

**The OP**. The first OP gave us a cheerful, fun, joyful experience that I feel was trying to match Kaori and her joyful attitude toward music as well as show Arima's eventual acceptance of these same feelings. This OP feels a different. The long bridge to the chorus is accompanied by multiple scenes of the main [characters as young children](http://i.imgur.com/w19uNb7.png) as well as the main characters all [looking sentimental](http://i.imgur.com/76vmomg.png) but joyful. This feels a bit sweet but sad. It has a nostalgic feel with a bit of joy that increases as it leads into the chorus.

*"SHYMPHONY"* This is where it gets back to the main focus of the show: [the beauty of music!](http://i.imgur.com/mJyNclM.jpg) Kaori and Arima playing together quite happily on the surface of a peaceful body of water helps paint a beautiful image that supports this.

Finally, it ends with a clip of what I'm assuming is [Kaori and Arima holding hands](http://i.imgur.com/9yPr0dl.png). Wait a sec... it looks like Arima holding her hand but she isn't holding his. I like to entertain the idea that perhaps she can't hold his hand back because she refuses to love him back only to leave him if she dies.

**THE ED.** To me, this was the most striking part of this episode both audibly and visually. We are greeted with a tragic scene of [shattered Kaori](http://i.imgur.com/0FxOdUK.jpg) floating on a sea of still water, looking at the stars as tears have flooded her eyes and are streaming down her face. A sad piano and vocal duet play in the background as we stare at the motionless Kaori for nearly a whole minute. During the first 30 seconds of this song, all but the first line end on a down note, giving a sad tragic feel. This can't be good... I think we all know where this is headed now...

The pace and sound of the song pic up a bit. Kaori blinks and puts on a **very** slight [teary-eyed smile](http://i.imgur.com/j1Y2tHc.jpg) over her previously heartbreaking appearance. Suddenly, the song bursts to life as a shimmering shadow of Kaori is [falling amongst the stars](http://i.imgur.com/wB1StlF.jpg). I'm trying to decipher this part in my head without coming up of some rendition of "her soul is resting amongst the stars" but honestly, this is all I can come up with. I don't think the writers/animators were necessarily trying to portray this.

Anyways, what do you guys think? I'm just trying to inhibit some good discussion. I finished Golden Time recently and I really enjoyed how much of the story was told solely through the OPs and EDs. I think this show has some story in its OP and ED as well.

Also, if happen to read this and you think this whole wall of text was a stupid ramble please let me know.

The new opening is so bad I can't even..

The first one was so good how could they go for something so generic and bland..
>> ARTICLE
I didn't particularly care for it either, I liked the first one a lot. Oh well, it will probably grow on me with time. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldnt have cared at all if the first opening wasnt as good as it was. But it really raised the bar high so I have nothing but disapointement for this new subpar op..it does not even match the mood of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
.... I... I liked the new opening. I listened to it a couple times and sure, its not as good as the first one, which was pretty awesome, but I honestly don't think it was bad at all. I thought it was nice and set a relaxing happy mood.
>> ARTICLE
But the ending was nice
>> ARTICLE
Visually, yes. The song itself was pretty forgettable imo. I thought the old ED was much better.
>> ARTICLE
* Finally! It's here!
* This op isn't as good as goose house but it sure is catchy still!
* I swear the mom went 0 to 100 real quick on Kosei.
* Geez you pick a dead mother's lullaby, tbh I would feel pretty cheesed too...
* Whats-her-face just character developed Kosei more than the whole show in 5 minutes.
* AWWWHHH THE SINGING KILLED ME
* Cliche embarrassing parents are cliche
* pls no. pls no death flag. the death flag is here.
* oh shit. changing the angle at its finest! just feel the notes mannn
* emi is cute af
* ooof i hate that kid
* ED IS AMAZING
>> ARTICLE
First of all, new OP does a really good job in setting the mood. I love the old OP better as a song, but considering the abundance of death flags in the episode the old OP is a bit pompous.

Really like the piano for first practice scene as well. Arima's piano actually feels actively disinterested even without Kaori saying anything.

[This line was absolutely beautiful for me.](http://i.imgur.com/bOeAl04.png) I love how she could have meant herself instead of/along with the music itself.

[Love the word choice here.](http://i.imgur.com/5U1RwE6.png?1) Not sure to credit A-1 or subber, but "reeks" contrasts with "overflowing" from the previous quote really well in a way that shows how Arima thinks his mom rejects him.

What do the stars look like when you're with her? (From episode 6 I think, do correct me if I'm wrong) [Enough for you to break into song with her.](http://i.imgur.com/jwaz11v.png?1) Bonus points for her singing with you!

Charming [overprotective dads](http://i.imgur.com/fR7GMqN.png?1) to [utterly converted fanboys](http://i.imgur.com/862Mzg9.png?1) in 9 seconds flat. Arima got moves.^and ^cake

[This. Really tragic for me.](http://i.imgur.com/oAqGpPW.png?2) (I haven't read the manga so I don't know what happens. Please don't spoil me!)

[Competition has been removed by childhood friend.](http://i.imgur.com/pKe33qi.png?1)

[They just had to add a doujinshi prompt.](http://i.imgur.com/1c6svH3.png?1)

[Ouch.](http://i.imgur.com/Cv1XQZl.png?1)

[Jealousy is the fastest path to Sith enlightenment.](http://i.imgur.com/f6GvcPi.png?1)

Pool scene and not drowning builds up for [This moment, where Arima finally faces his old self.](http://i.imgur.com/u4WzZkT.png?1) Really liked how A-1 made the pool scene with a mellow flavor.

Bonus section: Spot the death flags!

The shop/house being obviously closed down/empty didn't help as far as flags either.
>> ARTICLE
Really solid OP. Surprised that they changed it, but it's a nice upbeat song in contrast for the show's constant death flags. Every time I am amazed at how well A-1 has adapted this series. Really focusing on all the important details and missing very little plot.

[Koharu-chan](http://i.imgur.com/CrVvghk.jpg) is so cute. 

I love how they did the pool scene. I had to go back an read it after, and it's exactly how I expected it to be. 

Gaahh! Emi is so cute! Saori Hayami is exactly who I wanted to voice her.

Edit: New ED is also amazing. It's expected to get great music/OST/acoustics from this genre of anime, but they are really setting the standard this time.


NEXT EPISODE HYPE!!!

Didn't think they would be able to surpass their first OP but they did. Love the new song!

[y u do diz no more deathflags please](http://i.imgur.com/IErsTUa.jpg)

I'm scared to watch next weeks episode now.

[In case you missed this.](http://i.imgur.com/SdISiNV.jpg)

Really? I thought the first OP was the embodiment of emotions that the series was. This new OP felt very... generic. Like pick any other school setting anime and paste this new OP and ready to go.
>> ARTICLE
>Didn't think they would be able to surpass their first OP but they did. Love the new song!

Most people are very critical of the new OP. I don't think it was better than the first OP at all but I honestly do like it very much. It sets a different attitude which I think will align with where the show is going. However, from what I read, most people are quick to dismiss it saying "This new OP sucks. The first was WAY better."
>> ARTICLE
I've seen oniisama or Favaro counters. This show needs a deathflags counter.

And then they cut to a shot of a [firework burning out.](http://i.imgur.com/7NCSYr6.png)

If she's not careful Kaori will be crushed to death by the weight of all the death flags she's carrying.

If there ever was a country called "death" they can order all their flags from Kaori! This hurts more and more every chapter/episode :(
>> ARTICLE
> Didn't think they would be able to surpass their first OP but they did.

I don't think I've ever disagreed with a statement so much

Sorry :(
>> ARTICLE
Same, but it's mostly because I just absolutely *loved* the art style of OP 1. I've only ever seen a similar/comparable art style in Gin no Saji's [second season ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtSvn2cSIw8), but that unfortunately doesn't have the fluid animation that Shigatsu wa Kimi's OP 1 had.

Edit: Awh man and I totally didn't even notice at first that the old Shigatsu OP and the Gin no Saji S2 ED songs are both done by Goose House. I like Goose House.
>> ARTICLE
I thought this OP was nowhere near as good as the first personally

It's a rather well received rom-con, definitely leaning more on the comical side of things so don't get your hopes up too high for the romance but it's a pretty good show. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... fireworks are a cool thing, right?
>> ARTICLE
I'm more in to the comedy aspect. Would you say it's something like Maid-Sama or is it really heavy on the comedy?
>> ARTICLE
I would *not* say it's like Maid-Sama at all, which, while comedic, I'd say is more heavy on the romance. (even though it's more the *build-up* to the romance and romantic tension than actual romance)

I'd compare it more to Ouran or something. It's a **great** show though and entirely worth the watch!
>> ARTICLE
almost all comedy, the romance is more of a catalyst for the comedy to shine through

The animation in that new OP is amazing.

That new ED...Really love the new OP as well. I'd imagine this cour will be more focused on Kaori.

Seemed like the art was a tad spotty. In a few early scenes the character detail varied a lot between close up and far away shots, especially compared to the detail in the backgrounds. Did they contract out some of the animation?

I can't wait for next episode ;/ i want watch now, but i can't. Millions questions like is Kaori sick,  will kousei show great concert solo or maybe Kaori will be back?

The new op sounds like op from Dragon Ball GT ;D (a little bit in middle part), but i prefered old op. Ending song is great.

God please do the friday became be thursday

Holy fuck, i've come here especially to say that. It's just too similar to Dragon Ball

New OP/ED, I prefer the music in OP1, but prefer ED2 is better on both the music and [visuals](http://imgur.com/a/syJVX). [Ending stitch](http://i.imgur.com/iZNPKdZ.jpg)

Some good build up this episode, greatly looking forward to his performance. Liked his [expression here](http://imgur.com/a/iqTyo), looks like he'll be delivering this time round.

Edit: I haven't read the manga, so I could be wrong! I^hope^I'm^wrong...
>> ARTICLE
I have the same suspicions.  They blatantly pointed it out for a reason.

If I had to guess, he's going to play brilliantly.  Kousei will be extremely happy with himself, and then he'll be hit with the bad news.  Whether Kaori's dead or seriously injured is the only thing I'm unsure about.
>> ARTICLE
This show is literally changing my life. I'd been regretting quitting piano for 8 years, tried several times to get back into it but never was able to... other stuff always got in the way.

A few weeks ago after starting this show I decided it was time. I've been playing nearly every day for a few weeks, and starting lessons on Tuesday. In the past I was always frustrated when I tried to play things I used to know so well, but now I just feel a sense of discovery, and I'm legitimately enjoying every minute of it even more than when I learned for the first time when I was young.

Thanks Kousei <3

And don't die Kaori please.

O god the engrish

Ive been waiting for next episode since the anime started soooo hyped for next week lets goo
>> ARTICLE
They are making these weeks of waiting feel like fucking centuries.
How can I wait to see what happened with Kaori?!

It is amazing how they show that Kouseis outlook on pretty much everything is gradually becoming better. 

Next episode: Loves sorrow... either they play the part or something terrible happened with Kaori.

Edit: I know what happened to Kaori! She was arrested since riding a bicycle with 2 people is illegal! Let's hope she makes it back in time!

Man, this episode was probably my least favorite so far.

The new op is nowhere near as good as the first

We had stillframe violin and piano playing

Engrish song

Tsubaki kicks Watari in balls(something that I hate in all media) twice

Then she pushes Kosei(who can't swim) and Watari into the water.  After Watari saves Kosei(she didn't even get in the water, dry clothes) she then yells at him even though it was her fault.  This whole scene made me go from liking Tsubaki to being annoyed by her.

The parent scene and Kosei telling off that kid were pretty good, but hopefully this episode isn't indicative of a downward slide for this show as I've really enjoyed it until now.
>> ARTICLE
I kinda forgot that most anime are continuing where they left off by next week. Good thing this post came up to remind me.
>> ARTICLE
What's with the walking around 18:00?

They legitimately look like they're trying to scratch something
>> ARTICLE
I love the ED, but it sounds so sad. She's just lying there, crying to herself. The way she's lying there motionlessly lost in thoughts, floating in an endless ocean, it feels like she's going to be in a coma, or something like that. I don't like this at all. But then something happens, it looks like she's no longer stuck in that endless ocean, but she is moving again. I wonder what it means.

Anyway, I'm afraid we're going to cry as much as Kaori is in the ED...
>> ARTICLE
How do you all like the OP ?
>> ARTICLE
OP is nowhere near as good as the first. Better than TG new op. The ED was really solid though.
>> ARTICLE
I came here for music. I got music *and* lotsa death flags. It was really good.

I'm just sad they changed the opening...

She dead.

Am I the only one that saw the picture at the end after the ED where it says " Two people on a bike is forbidden by law." I just thought that was hilarious

Fuck sake Kaori is just a walking death flag.

That moment when the female friend (i forget her name) asked Kousei and Kaori what their plans were for high school and then Kaori went quiet and her firework went out. That moment felt ominous.

RIP my favorite anime theme song. The new one just doesn't do it justice.

I'm really going to miss that opening song 
>> ARTICLE
The new OP isn't as nice as the old one, IMO. But the old one was one of my fav OPs of all time. The new ED is quite beautiful. Wish it had a bit more art going on, though.

So is Kousie still thinking WatarixKaori is thing? I thought we lost that a few episodes back...
>> ARTICLE
I'm not liking where they are going with the Mom.

"She actually beat the shit out of you because she wanted for you to be strong. It was all planed. She was very happy all the time. Donmai."

No. That's not how it works in life.

Sure, the main goal here for Kousei is to accept what happened, take what he can from that experience and move on. But I will not accept other than she went crazy and she was only thinking about herself.

* **Entertaining Parents** - It's interesting how the parents are fans of Arima. I'd sure love to see their own view points more in this series considering their daughter and all that. 
* **Kashiwagi** - Interesting that we got a new character. I look forward to her interactions in the story from now on. 
* **So Much Foreshadowing** - She doesn't even think about the future. I'm pretty sure they're just painting the statue of Liberty at this point, it's so obvious. 
* **Emi's Visit** - So adorable how she came to watch Arima at the Gala. I really love her character. 
* **Kaori's Missing** - This is really bad. There's no way something didn't happen.
* **Miike-san** - He's really like a young Arima in a way. I'm happy Arima decided not to be hard on him.
* **Alone** - Sure has the guts to go out by himself again. Gotta respect him for that. [My prediction is that ](/s "Kaori will appear part way through the performance.") Overall, I look forward to the next episode. 
>> ARTICLE
The new OP is ~~trash~~ actually not that bad... The ED looks better but the song is worse imho.

As for the story, i feel like Kaori's death is being over-foreshadowed and it's starting to drag the show down for me, but i'll let it slide for now because this show looks so damn good.

Also i wasn't the only one to sing along Twinkle Twinkle right?
>> ARTICLE
I have reasons to like it, but I'm getting really tired of this anime- it's extremely predictable and the characters aren't developing quickly enough for my taste.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. The show also has the subtlety of a brick to the face, and it's full of monologues.
>> ARTICLE
There's just something I don't like about this show anymore. I liked it at the start but now it feels like a chore to watch. i just can't put my finger on it though =(

I like the show, but it is pretty slow and doesn't cover a lot of ground per episode. It's also not subtle in the least, and likes to beat you over the head with symbolism.

After 2 weeks of waiting...another cliffhanger. FUUUUUUUU-

Of course there were absolutely no death flags, for the 5 episode in a row. She doesn't think about the future 'cause she lives the moment, that's all. Carpe diem and all that shit.

Still the feels are getting even stronger and i don't want this to end bad:(
Lets hope for the best guys!!

Give me the old OP back.... Please..

And when i saw the amount of still frames they where using at the start i had a bad feeling budget fell out of the window.

This continues to be beautiful; the new opening and ending are amazing. But, oh god, are they really going to kill Kaori off this early into the second half??? ;(
>> ARTICLE
No.... its going to be a long, drawn-out, tear fest until the very end....

Coming from a place in my life where I used to despise my mother, this series hits so fucking hard for me. Kousei's inner turmoil and the overall struggle strike a chord with me that most other shows can't. I'm so glad Shigatsu is back. Next week we get more piano and hopefully more good feels...^^^please


>> ARTICLE
The amount of death flags is too damn high! In fact, it's so high, she might not even die.

Will Kaori follow the route of Kousei's mother and die, or beat the odds and live to perform again? I can see both happening, especially with the slight feeling that there might be an overabundance of death flags planted.
>> ARTICLE
Well it seems like I'm in for more weekly feels.
>> ARTICLE
FAAAAAARRRRKKK, have to wait another week now. Ahhhhhhhh faaaarrrk, they needed to run two eps this week 
>> ARTICLE
Didn't expect a new OP. Noice
>> ARTICLE
Holy cow! I lost track of time I thought there'd be more when Kousei entered the stage. You know a show is good when you don't realize 23 minutes have gone by. Koari's phone being left in her room and their cake shop closed isn't a good sign. Is she in the hospital again?
>> ARTICLE
Two options about Kaori's actions:

A) In the hospital, sick. PLS DON'T DIE!

or 

B) Bailed on purpose so Kousei could get through this on his own. In some cases you can get all of the help in the world, but it's up to **YOU** to make a change.
>> ARTICLE
This show reminds me of the movie "stranger then fiction" where the professor tells will ferrel you have to die. That if he doesn't die it will make the entire series meaningless. 

>> ARTICLE
Damn this show. Damn it. I haven't felt this many feelz since Anohana. And no one has died yet, outside the abusive mother.
>> ARTICLE
The day when Arima became a man is the day that Kaori [](/s "dies... probably")
>> ARTICLE
Wow. I really thought I knew just how much I missed this show. I was wrong. Oh, *so* very wrong. I can't get over just how good of a job it does of conveying their emotions. I feel like that's this shows strong point. I haven't ever cried watching an anime (or any movie/tv show for that matter), but this show, for whatever reason, manages to get me to choke up nearly every time. The new OP and ED are fantastic. I can't wait to watch everything unfold. Prepare your tissues, men!

Edit: Also, a friendly reminder that two people on a bike is forbidden by law!
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, the death flags, someone hold me. The feel train is gonna headed for a rough ride. Someone tell me its gonna be alright.
>> ARTICLE
This episode left out a decent amount stuff from the manga. It was still nice but I would've preferred that it adapted most of the material since they're good. It also sped up the pace a bit and for shows like this I prefer a slower build up towards the big moments. Makes it more gratifying.

Perhaps they just changed the order of things.
>> ARTICLE
Probably my favorite show airing now. Second favorite once Kurobas airs in a few days, of course, but what can compete with that?

Goddamn A-1.  They've definitely outdone themselves actually improving on the source material with such vibrant animation.  Absolutely a future bluray purchase for me!

Oh it's been too long.  I enjoyed the new OP and ED.

Is it only me or some part of the OP has this resemblance to some Dragon Ball OP somewhere?

[The ED makes for a beautiful wallpaper](http://i.imgur.com/0P6KijL.png)
>> ARTICLE
I think I lost count but we're nearing about 100 death flags for Kaori. I don't want to believe it... 

However, after watching the ending I interpreted it as Kaori with paralysis. I don't know what sort of sickness would cause it, but seeing her floating on the water and crying just screamed paralysis to me. I could see it going the direction of her having to live on without the ability to make music. Both options are equally sad.
>> ARTICLE
That "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" Music.... Hmm....
>> ARTICLE
I love how every episode is a roller coaster of feelings.

I'd would be interesting if he overcomes his past only to see her to share the same fate as his mother
>> ARTICLE
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how amazing the new opening is? I can't stop listening to it, it's just so joyful oh my god 
>> ARTICLE
Omg, I think even new ED does some foreshadowing showing Kaori on the surface at the beginning and then only water at the end with a fallen star, so sad :(

aaaaand now the reminder of how the show seems so short has hit again and made me ravenous for 7 days to fly by....  Maybe I'm thinking too much into it but the firecracker burning out and her talking about her future just screams "SOMEONES GONNA DIE" lol

Is anyone else becoming concerned about pacing/finishing on time? I feel like there's too much material left in the manga to be fit into 10 more episodes... Maybe it's just me...

Also the non-chorus part of the new OP sounds super familiar.
>> ARTICLE
I've made the decision that this show is too detrimental to my life and I want to watch it so bad, but all of these death flags are just getting too my feels to easy. All I can think about is Kaori dying and I can't stand it :'(

>> ARTICLE
Wow, that was...an oddball episode from this show. Really jerky pacing between tones and scenes and cuts and pretty much everything all the way to the very end.

Hard to believe that episode 10 was just a few weeks ago. In terms of execution, this might as well have been an entirely different show.

Which really bums me out, honestly, because I liked the stuff that was happening at the end a *lot*, but the wackiness of the way it came across on screen kind of hurt the effect for me.

I'm conflicted. There's something to be said for the innate connection between musicians (it's something I value in my own life), but I always cheer for the childhood friend for some unknown reason.

i'm a bit mad we didn't get to listen to Kousei, but this episode was so great that it didn't matter. I'm glad the rivals got some development and weren't just leave at the state of token rival. Hype ON for the next week.
>> ARTICLE
his playing isn't going to be anything special
>> ARTICLE
Extra hype for the next one.
>> ARTICLE
My guess is that the entire concert is a massive cock tease, Kaori ends up fainting and being rushed to hospital and Kousei withdraws from the competition in order to be by her side.
>> ARTICLE
[From the next episode preview,](/s "we can tell that he'll actually be playing on the piano for awhile. It shows him trying to hammer keys while surrounded by darkness (panic mode thing).")
>> ARTICLE
My ranking of likely outcomes:

1. He withdraws / can't play for some reason like you said. More feels are had, this feels the most likely given the tone of the show so far.

2. He plays, it's alright, gets 3rd place or perhaps slightly lower (very realistic considering he hasn't really been playing much over the past 2 years. This is the 'real life result')

3. He starts out super strong and it looks like he's gonna demolish everything and then suddenly stops playing

4. He actually wins. I can't see this happening honestly, if it does it's gonna be a final episode thing after more development. If it does happen, something terrible will happen to kaori and he'll be unable to play again.
>> ARTICLE
I think there are only two ways this goes.

1. He withdraws like people have said

2. He plays like Kaori and not like his old self. Losing the comp but winning the audience vote and making his rivals question what they have been doing the entire time. 
>> ARTICLE
I really hope #2.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really digging your second probability, that would mean.. The end is near though, how many eps. Is this supposed to be?
>> ARTICLE
22 on MAL, havent looked into it tho. I think it could be a good way to start wrapping up the first arc tho if it goes that way.
>> ARTICLE
If it really is 22 episodes it's gonna take like 2 episodes for him to play! Damn man I didn't think I would feel like this over classical music.
>> ARTICLE
The two old rivals was a pretty big arc in the manga tho, they definitely deserved a episode devoted to them
>> ARTICLE
22 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
One of the most impressive things about this show is that I have literaly no idea if he's gonna fuck it up or not. I mean, be that he succeds or not, I'm gonna be surprised anyway (and that's amazing)
>> ARTICLE
Judging by the amount of episodes we are getting, I think there is a high probability of him fucking up. 

(22 episodes btw)
>> ARTICLE
Sure, but even if he loses, it will be classy as fuck (like breaking down in the middle of it or whatever)

Goku really knows how to play

He strikes me as more of a Gohan

Also, bet you anything he gets disqualified next episode for using Super Saiyan to enhance his performance.

Nah, the father-son Kamehamechopin. Kousei reaches in from behind in a sweet embrace and begins to play the best duet/duel you have ever heard.

STOP IT, why can't they do like Parasyte and surprise us with two episodes this week? I really, really wanted to see Arima play so two episodes this week would have been great. I hope that I survive until next week because the suspense of having to wait for him to play might seriously kill me.

Guys, this anime is pretty fucking beautiful, and even fucking more amazing. <3

Edit: half an hour since I finished the episode and I can't stop smiling.
>> ARTICLE
That would only happen if they were making a movie version of this as the Parasyte double episode was promotion for it.

Oh my god. Live action movie version of Your Lie in April would be amazing!

These performances are so beautiful they seriously bring tears to my eyes ;-;

Haha me too! When this episode finished my exact thought was that I wanted two episodes like Parasyte :p

Haha, I like that lady music teacher xD  

Damn, she was freaking awesome. I got hyped for her performance when   two music teachers were talking, and I wasn't disappointed. Really loved   the leaves and colors as well. Kinda want her to win now :D  
>> ARTICLE
loved the guy music teacher's face at that point as well

He was just like "Well, my guys fucked now"
>> ARTICLE
When she started crying, I did too. You can just tell how much she cares about and tries to understand Emi.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, two performances in one episode?  Also hype for Kousei's performance next week.  I just wish they would show more animation of the fingers actually pressing down the keys.  
>> ARTICLE
Nodame has similar animation and its one complaint I've read about it. The only one really. I was expecting it in Shigatsu, as others have said, it's expensive. I'd rather have the music over top notch every frame animation.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing the animation they do for those parts must be very expensive to produce, so they limit it to what they can afford
>> ARTICLE
As far as I can tell they're [rotoscoping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscoping) the hands-on-piano bits. Since, generally, it prohibits the use of most limited animation techniques (and is generally done frame-by-frame, i.e. 24 different drawings per second [EDIT: But in this case it's CG, so it's a bit different], not on twos or threes) it can be *really* time consuming. Plus, given that they'd actually have to bring in pianists (they can't just use a cheap out-of-work actor - they need whichever pianist played the piece they're using in order to accurately and completely sync the sound) to film the base footage, the costs add up pretty quickly.

^^So ^^yeah, ^^you're ^^right, ^^expensive.
>> ARTICLE
The hands are CGI. Maybe rotoscoped animation but they're not drawn. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, sorry, you're right, it was deceptive when I said "drawings". But I am still sure the movements themselves are rotoscoped in a way (and therefore a lot more difficult to deal with than regular CG animation).
>> ARTICLE
Probably Mo-Cap.  Not really a cheaper solution, it has it's own set of expenses and challenges.
>> ARTICLE
The first half of [this video here](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/tv/imagine/flv20141023_archive.html) touches on the process (though it doesn't go into detail). Basically they use live footage frame-by-frame as direct reference for both the CG and the drawn frames for the entirety of the performances. Not strictly rotoscoping, but closer to rotoscoping than mo-cap.
>> ARTICLE
I've always heard about 'budget' and 'costs to animate' but never understood what's meant by that. I kinda figured the animation studio would be huddled together with photoshop open and the dialogue being something like "Let's use the blur + blush tools this episode, it'll be $5 well within our budget!"

Can you explain what it really is? I'm actually interested now.
>> ARTICLE
I think basically good animation equates to time, which equates to money (in the form of more or better workers or more hours paid).
>> ARTICLE
Watch Shirobako.
>> ARTICLE
The more movement you want to show in a scene the more frames you need to animate at, the more frames the more drawing needs to be done. 

So you start to balance quality time and cost. Without hiring more staff you are going to either lower the quality of the rest of the episode or even multiple episodes or you are going to delay production of other episodes and put the entire project behind schedule.

If you hire more staff that will cost a lot of money, there is no getting around that, plus contracting a new animator in the middle of a project doesn't guarantee high quality results.

The reason Blu-Rays tend to look much nicer than television broadcasts is because the studios get to go back and spend a much longer period of time on each episode, while a show is currently airing you might be working on episodes that won't be releasing for a month but that still means you have to be working at a pace of one episode a week being produced.
>> ARTICLE
I understand now, thank you!
>> ARTICLE
The staff behind producing an anime has to be paid for their work, it costs time, and thus money to produce anime. Quality production takes a lot of time and talent to animate, and a show's budget might not allow for paying X number of animators for Y amount of time. 
>> ARTICLE
True, I bet it would take tons of money to animate those scenes properly, with the right technique and everything.  It would be cool if they would be able to do it though.
>> ARTICLE
I think they are already making sacrifices budget-wise to dialogue scenes just so they can pour it all into these fantastic performance scenes, I'd love it if they could do more, but they are obviously doing the best with what they have.
>> ARTICLE
And really, the parts in between the performances aren't bad by any stretch of the imagination. Lower quality, yes, but honestly I feel like it almost plays to the show's advantage in a way. I like the soft pastels and simpler style in between, and the payoff is that we get these stunning performances.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't agree more, the simplicity of the in-between scenes, helps showcase the mastery that is the performance scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
Loved the episode, can't wait for Arima playing next week!

I really enjoyed the piece Emi played, here it is, if you're interested:

[Chopin tude: Op. 25, No. 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx6-Z0nsWnw).
>> ARTICLE
I'm not very musically knowledgeable, I play a little guitar but that's about it, so maybe someone more with more knowledge can explain this to me without killing me for it lol. I always have this question whenever I listen to any classical music piece: why is this considered a classic? What's so special about this? Here again, the only thing I can come up with is that it's extremely fast and hence hard to master. 

Honestly speaking, call me a pleb but it doesn't sound good to me. As in it's not musically pleasing, which I think is the goal of any musical piece, classical or not. It starts good, but then it seems like the composer wanted to show off his skills as a piano player and starts kidding around. At first it's hard to even make out the music over all the overlapping notes but after listening to it a couple of times, it sounds like there's actually two completely different(incompatible?) tracks in different tempos playing one over the other in a repetitive manner. 

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7maJOI3QMu0) a piano piece that I really like. To the point that it brings tears to my eyes. This is what I think music should be. Something that paints pictures and takes you elsewhere. None of the classical stuff I've ever heard have had that effect on me.
>> ARTICLE
Is this July?  
Their works are some of my favorite :D
>> ARTICLE
You seem to desire a repeated motif in the music. Fair enough, perhaps you might enjoy Mahler's 1st Symphony for an example of a complicated piece that retains motifs from its constituent instruments.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how to explain this but i'll give it a try.. Basically you're comparing cheap wine to expensive wine here.. You fit in the catagory where you can't tell the different between cheap wine and expensive wine but winemakers can. this is the difference. People that are exposed to classical music over and over again can tell how rich the music sounds but not only that, they can figure out motifs, the structure of the piece (form), why the composer selected the notes he used, the tempo because everything the composer wrote in his music score had a PURPOSE. 

Like seriously you may think "1+1=2" is a simple math equation but
mathematicians would rather solve a much rewarding complicated question like:
 " 20(3/4)(x  2) + 20(3/5) = 20(1/5)(x + 1)  solve for x"
They both produce the same answer "2" but with your logic, since it equals 2 anyways why not just do the simple equation and get it over with.

simple equation = simple music like yiruma

complicated equation = complicated pieces like chopin's etude
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. You make some valid points. That analogy though. 20(3/4)(x  2) + 20(3/5) = 20(1/5)(x + 1) is still a very simple equation, something a sixth grader should be able to solve. A mathematician would rather tackle Fermat's last theorem. And now that you mention, a sixth grader can also master any Chopin or Beethoven with enough practice. However only a handful people in the world can prove Fermat's last theorem. There's also the fact that many theories thought to be absolute have been invalidated by modern science. I think the same applies for classical music as well. It may have been unique in its time. But today, music has evolved greatly and people are much more in touch with it so it's hardly anything special.
>> ARTICLE
That ignores the fact that classical music is being made today by composers. Classical music is music made for the sake of music. It explores and pushes the form in new ways and tries to elicit certain reactions from the preformers and the audience not just "be pretty" or "be successful." Sometimes the music is meant to be disconcerting, or unpleasant. It might be soothing or ugly. It might be rowdy, uncouth, uplifting, patriotic, nationalistic, religious, secular, rebellious, chaotic and orderly based on what the composer wanted and how it is interpreted today. 

It's unreasonable to expect music to be left behind just because you or the general public doesn't like it. The etudes of Chopin, the fugues of Bach, and the caprices of Paganini hold as much value as Shakespeare, Picasso, and Da Vinci and modern music doesn't replace it as a "better" or more "applicable" form of music. 
>> ARTICLE
This is within Chopins "Etudes" which means "study". Everything in the Etudes are supposed to be for perfecting techniques.
>> ARTICLE
> Honestly speaking, call me a pleb but it doesn't sound good to me. As in it's not musically pleasing, which I think is the goal of any musical piece, classical or not.

Not necessarily true on the last part. For instance, percussion solos, specifically ones played on the snare or tenor. All one can hear is sticks hitting drum. Big whoop. But in the mean time, this guy beating on a drum just busted out some wicked sick diddles and para diddles, all while syncopating upbeats and downbeats and doing "musical flair", as I like to call it, or twirling their sticks around and all that fancy jazz, which is required in most pieces in that area.

It's more so a test of mechanics than to sound good and pleasurable, less user-friendly and more skill-based. It's like comparing the operating system and GUI of Windows to, say, Unix and Linux, with Windows being VERY user-friendly, and Linux being a whole measure less so.

Of course, you can have a mechanically-complicated piece, whilst still being absolutely gorgeous to listen to. But beauty can only extend so far when the mechanics themselves sound bad, such as purposefully-off key notes.

Oh well. I'll end this semi-ranty rant with a concession that music is only as good as your own opinion. I just hope you can at least appreciate the skill behind such pieces, even if the sound is less-than-pleasant to your own ears ^_^
>> ARTICLE
The piece you chose, was beautiful, but boring (to me).  It used the same chord progression more or less the whole piece, the dynamics where only so-so at best, and the chords were almost always in broken chord style.  That is not to say I didn't enjoy it immensely, but when I hear that versus the mood changing, dynamic contrasts (volume), and chord structure of the Chopin that paints the picture for me.  The technique very well have been thrown in for the sake of it, but you hear the chords moving in one direction.

So if your still with me...  There is essentially 2 types of music, popular music and art music.  Popular music, as the name implies, is music for the gratification of the masses, is popular, and is often times very good (you can find "pop" music in all eras, not just present day).  Art music is more or less the opposite in that it is music in and for the sake of music, much more often composed by a musician who has studied how music works i.e. ways to change key, counterpoint, harmonies, chord inversions, etc. 

Neither are better than the other, and I find I like some pop, and some art, but there are pieces in both I think repulsive to some degree.  I don't like much anything Nikki Minaj, but I also have a hard time listening to most of Schoenberg.

If I can entice you to listen to something classical but much more in the style of your piece, check out Rachmaninov's [Piano Concerto Number 2!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vna-_bCgb70)

Sorry if this doesn't help...  The other person seemed quite capable at words.
>> ARTICLE
If you haven't yet, go watch Nodame Cantabile. 

Also Rachmaninov is awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
Yea I have, rewatched season 1 too.  Beck still is my personal favorite music anime.  Nodame Cantabile is the best music production anime I've seen due to them actually making shit sound not as good and amazing as the character talks about it.  

Yea, I wrote a 20+ page research paper on Rach already, the dudes amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I know it has been a long time, but I hope you read this.  I play classical piano, (don't misunderstand: not remotely professionally) but even so I don't think you're a pleb.

The first thing is just a simple clarification: "classical" doesn't mean "a classic". It's essentially some eras, a very wide genre, what have you, but it isn't an assertion of quality.

Second, the *main* reason why it doesn't move you is mere unfamiliarity:

1.) in the same way that I am not moved by tribal chants and my grandmother does not enjoy dubstep, but also

2.) it IS difficult to keep track of on the first go. And yes, there are separate tracks, but more than two. But just noticing that isn't enough, because a lot of it comes from what parts of tracks get emphasized as well as which ones you choose to listen to. 

Actually this is true of all music, if you listen to certain parts specifically it can change a lot, for good or ill. But it is often moreso in classical music where entire melodies may exist or not depending on how you play or listen. Other music usually can't get away with this, because people aren't expecting to have to pay attention to it in the same way that they expect to have to pay attention to classical.

But these are just kind of differences in experience. Supposing you were experienced in all kind sof music, what is the difference then? Because, there is no doubt that modern music moves you. I play classical piano, but I tend to listen to more heavy metal, or jazz. Am I going to listen to some Rachmaninoff to get pumped for a race? Heck no! It's powerful, but if it has an effect it isn't to pump you up but to exhaust you.

The following is a gross over-generalization, but it is *on average* consistent with my experience.

Modern music tends to be very *functional*. Like a music score. Take your example - I've played that piece, many have - it doesn't really seem to convey emotion. Rather, it *creates* it. And it is you, the listener, who feels it. The piece is constructed for one specific purpose, and it achieves that goal, on the first listen, with the first notes. Or pump-up songs; or party songs; or again, movie scores; they generate and control emotions. It is specifically intended to *move* you, and in a specific way. And it's *fantastic* and I love it.

Classical music tends to be very much more *conveyance*. You are not the one who is sad. You are listening to *someone else be sad* or *think about being sad*, etc. And you can connect to that empathically, if you like. Even this most forceful classical music leaves me in some sense contemplative or tired, rather than excited. Because it doesn't intend to manipulate you into feeling that emotion: instead, it's an exploration, and it's not necessarily you who does it either. Meaning that it is much easier, in my opinion, for different people to be affected much, much differently by the same piece. Even sorrowful stuff doesn't necessarily make me that way. But equally then, that may mean someone is not affected by it.

Also, for me modern music tends to feel the same to listen to and to play. Classical does not, by a longshot, unless I am imagining playing it.
>> ARTICLE
Don't try thinking of the piece as being beautiful, but rather think of the piece conveying an emotion.

Anyways, my favorite classical piece / performance : 

[Vladimir Horowitz performing Schumann's Traumerei in Moscow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq7ncjhSqtk).


  This was his return after 60 years to Russia to see it once more before his death, and to act as an ambassador to peace.  There were less than 400 seats offered to the public.  People stood outside the concert hall in the rain even though they couldn't hear anything. Hundreds of students broke through security to watch the concert from the balcony, and guards couldn't manage to remove them.




>> ARTICLE
Classical music generally refers to the era (in mainly Europe, 1750s-1880s) when there were many composers who composed and performed on the piano. Chopin actually falls into the Romantic Era, but the two are often lumped together as classical. Not classical in the sense of "classic", just period of music.
>> ARTICLE
Alright but it's also referred to as classic in that sense. Like it's eternal and nothing composed before or after it can ever match its legacy. It's the benchmark in auditions and music competitions around the world and some of the biggest performances in some on some of the biggest stages have not been original works but renditions of classicals.
>> ARTICLE
While there are classic's among them, as /u/bleakyy was saying, I believe you are mixing up the term classic and classical.

And as far as why it is used primarily in competitions, this part is just from my personal view, but it is much harder to how well an original work is played as compared too something that has been tried and tested.

Finally, you bring up the point of that piano piece you specifically like. That is just an unfair point. I will not dispute that it is a nice piece. But to say that YOUR personal taste in music, something that has personally affected YOU, should be the pinnacle of music, is really just not fair. Everyone looks for something different in music, and there a lot of classical pieces that really have some impact, albeit a different impact than the piece you recommended, but an impact nonetheless.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. That was the kind of explanation I was looking for.
>> ARTICLE
> (in mainly Europe, 1750s-1880s)


Sorry, Classical era was 1750-1820, Romantic started after that.  Everything else you've been saying is as close to right as it gets.
>> ARTICLE
Classical music in a very broad definition just means music that is made in the Western tradition that requires more from the listener than folk or popular music by generally being more complex in nature than other forms of music. Doesn't need to be just referring to the classical era of Classical music.

he's able to go into The Zone when playing.

synesthesia? synthesia is a game

Oh yeah, my bad. Got confused with both.

I'm just saying this much. 

I fucking love the amount of Chopin in this show. If there was some more Rachmaninoff, I think I would die of happiness 
>> ARTICLE
[We are getting a Rachmaninoff's](/s "Transcription of Liebesleid - Kreisler which is very beautiful!")
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember there being much (if any) Rachmaninoff in the manga...[but at least we'll be gettin some](/s "Tchaikovsky") soon! XD
>> ARTICLE
I don't think i have ever clapped to a recorded performance, the combination of what they said plus the performance was brilliant.  This show is really, really, damn good.
>> ARTICLE
Shit, man. 

During both performances, my chest felt tight, and I couldn't breathe correctly. I could feel the excitement in the playing and in the atmosphere. I was as enthralled as the crowd this episode. Especially since I connect to it on a personal level.

Cannot wait for next episode, swear to god.
>> ARTICLE
> my chest felt tight, and I couldn't breathe correctly.

That can't be good for you.
>> ARTICLE
If you're implying that I had some sort of health problem whilst watching an anime episode, then you're partly correct. I was as nervous and excited as Emi and Takeshi, and that nervous excitement caused me to breathe shallowly, which of course caused this tightness of the chest.

It felt like I was about to play a solo, not them. And I can relate to that. So, I guess I was emotionally and physically invested in this episode :p
>> ARTICLE
During Emi's performance I stopped breathing and when she was finally done and took that breath so did I. That was a really good episode.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same way.  I hold my breath more watching this show than I do Psycho Pass.

### Information on the Piano Competition Piece Selections 

(**Note**: This section will be repeated until the end of the competition; new stuff follows after this part.)

In the manga, the participants in the upcoming piano competition were required to play two pieces; one of their pieces must be a Chopin tude, and the other piece must come from J.S. Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier."  [Based on this image in the anime,](http://i.imgur.com/TLk2h2N.jpg) I originally thought that they would deviate from what the manga did; however, after this week's episode, I'm glad to find out that some of the competitors are playing some of the Prelude and Fuges in Bach's WTC.

## Chopin: tudes - Opus 10 and Opus 25

Chopin wrote three sets of *tudes* (French for *studies*); the most popular tudes are the Opus 10 and Opus 25 studies where each one consists of 12 different studies, and the third set consists of three tudes with no Opus number.  These studies presented a new way to play piano, and they were radical and revolutionary when they first appeared.  They are also some of the most challenging and evocative pieces in classical repertoire, and this is one of the reasons why they're still popular to this day (I'm glad to say I know how to play a couple of them! XD).  

The Opus 10 tudes were composed between 1829 and 1832, and were published in 1833 when he was 23 years old.  He dedicated the Opus 10 set to his good friend Franz Liszt (another famous composer).  The Opus 25 tudes were composed at various times between 1832 and 1836, and were published in 1837. The final three tudes, part of a series called "*Mthode des mthodes de piano*" compiled by Moscheles and Ftis, were composed in 1839, without an assigned opus number.

Out of the Opus 10 and 25 tudes Chopin wrote, the more popular ones have been given nicknames; some examples include:

* Opus 10, No. 3: nicknamed "**Tristesse**" (meaning Sadness) or "**L'Adieu**" (meaning Farewell) 
* Opus 10, No. 5: nicknamed "**Black Keys**" since the right hand is only played with the black keys of the piano, except for only **one** white key [(yes, only **one** key (the only white key plays the note in red)).](http://i.imgur.com/pWNSIuI.png)
* Opus 10, No. 12: nicknamed "**Revolutionary**" due to it's powerful and strong melody.
* Opus 25, No. 9: nicknamed "**Butterfly**" due to light and bouncy nature of the right hand.
* Opus 25, No. 11: nicknamed "**Winter Wind**"; listen to it and you'll understand why this name is perfect.
* Opus 25, No. 12: nicknamed "**Ocean**" due to the stormy sound of the arpeggios.

Although no nicknames are of Chopin's original creation, they create interesting pretext and encourage the imagination to fabricate epic works embodied by these studies.

## Bach: The Well-Tempered Clavier (Book I: BMV 846 - 869; Book II: BMV 870 - 893)

The Well-Tempered Clavier is a collection of solo keyboard music composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. He gave the title to a book of preludes and fugues in all 24 major and minor keys, dated 1722, composed "for the profit and use of musical youth desirous of learning, and especially for the pastime of those already skilled in this study". Bach later compiled a second book of the same kind, dated 1742, with the title *Twenty-four Preludes and Fugues*. The two works are now considered to make up a single work, *The Well-Tempered Clavier*, or "the 48", and are referred to as The Well-Tempered Clavier Book I and The Well-Tempered Clavier Book II respectively. This collection is generally regarded as being among the most influential works in the history of Western classical music.

Each of Book I and Book II contain twenty-four pairs of preludes and fugues. The first pair is in C major, the second in C minor, the third in C-sharp major, the fourth in C-sharp minor, and so on. The rising chromatic pattern continues until every key has been represented, finishing with a B-minor fugue.

Bach's title suggests that he had written for a (12-note) well-tempered tuning system in which all keys sounded in tune (also known as "circular temperament"). The opposing system in Bach's day was meantone temperament in which keys with many accidentals sound out of tune.  It is sometimes assumed that Bach intended equal temperament, the standard modern keyboard tuning which became popular after Bach's death, but modern scholars suggest instead a form of well temperament. There is debate whether Bach meant a range of similar temperaments, perhaps even altered slightly in practice from piece to piece, or a single specific "well-tempered" solution for all purposes.

## Episode 08 List of Classical Performances:

This week we have two performances (one of which I did a write up on a couple episodes back).  We start off with a bang, courtesy of Takeshi.

---

**Chopin: tude in C-sharp Minor ("Torrent"), Op. 10, No. 4** - "In direct contrast to the slower and calmer etude before it, the Etude Op. 10 No. 4 opens with a sharp chord followed immediately tumultuous sixteenth-note runs in both hands. There are several major difficulties associated with this piece. The sixteenth-note runs make up the melody. The difficulty with this is that the piece switches which hand does these runs every few measures. Therefore, the melody switches from the right hand to the left hand and back, many times. There is also a certain amount of difficulty present in playing the sixteenth notes softly but still very rapidly and fluidly. The pedaling of this etude may also pose a problem. The etudes nickname is the "Torrent". Just the right amount of pedal must be used to achieve this effect. If one uses too much, the piece sounds like a sluggish river; on the other hand, if one uses too little, it sounds very choppy and detached. To top things off, for its speed, this is one of the longest etudes of the 24. Fortunately, the piece is not as challenging musically as some of the other etudes, but one might find that one has a great deal of trouble in transferring the musical ideas from ones hands to the keyboard! The etymology of the nickname is immediately apparent upon listening to the piece." [(Source)](http://www.ourchopin.com/analysis/etude.html)

Here's an interpretation of this study by [Maurizio Pollini](http://youtu.be/XIKdCTmcTLs) and [Artur Rubenstein.](http://youtu.be/dFUlvEilmJo?t=7m37s)

---

We also get Emi's performance of Chopin's "Winter Wind" tude as well, which you can read the write-up for in the [episode 06 post](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2m7ebg/spoilers_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_episode_6/cm1wful).


Here's a couple more interpretations of this study by [Evgeny Kissin](http://youtu.be/lS9J2WAlN-0) and [Murray Perahia.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWgpvYdh4Y4)

---

First of all, I'd like to wish my fellow US /r/anime redditors a Happy Thanksgiving!

I must say, I was super taken back this episode by the animation of the piano motions, even down to the movement of the mallets inside the piano.  This week, we got to see Takeshi's and Emi's performances in full.  The confrontation between Takeshi and Kousei was pretty amusing, especially when Kousei said that he did an amazing job and [Takeshi got all creepy about it (according to Emi).](http://gfycat.com/InsidiousHelplessAbyssiniangroundhornbill)  I also love how they adapted the visualization of Emi's emotions during her performance with the red (anger) and yellow (loneliness) lighting and then the "winter wind" blowing the leaves away.  Next episode is going to be fantastic ~~especially with Takeshi being all pro Kousei x Emi~~ since [Kousei's going to perform, but then.......?!?!?!](http://i.imgur.com/mOeK7yh.jpg) [(Manga Spoiler)](/s "The "other person" [i.e. his mother] comes to "visit" him during his performance, and triggers his psychological trauma.  However, when all seems to be lost, Kousei's transformation begins?!  Also, you're going to start hating the old competition judge because he's a prick.")

Thanks again for taking the time to read my post this week! I hope you're looking forward to next week's episode as much as I am! :-)
>> ARTICLE
Do you know any performance/Chopin plays similar to "Winter Wind" etude? It has this intense fast feeling that gets me smiling. I was wondering if you can suggest some performances similar to it? 
>> ARTICLE
After watching the episode of Railgun where Biribiri plays the violin yesterday, it's goddamn awesome to watch people playing with proper. Fucking. Technique.

I just love this show.

>> ARTICLE
This show wraps up in 2015 (it's two cour, if you weren't aware), so it wouldn't just be AOTY 2014!! XD

If you think shit is good now, I'll just say that you can start raising your expectations for the second half because it gets *much* better!
>> ARTICLE
Honestly there are so many anime this season that are AOTY worthy that I can't decide. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm still unsure of what to pick up.  Any suggestions?  Right now I'm watching Fate/Stay Night and this.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte, Psycho-Pass, Shingeki no Bahamut. There's stuff like Log Horizon and Chaika S2 if you've watched the first season.

Donten ni Warau is also excellent, though it takes a few episodes to really get going. Also: Gugure! Kokkuri-san is probably the funniest anime I have ever watched, and it has some very sweet moments as well.
>> ARTICLE
Get aboard the Psycho-Pass 2 train.
>> ARTICLE
last episode was sooooooo good...
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte is great but the real winner for me is Shingeki No Bahamut, it's a fantasy and is, in my opion the anime of this season.
>> ARTICLE
Oh fuck you just tempted me to read the manga so bad.
>> ARTICLE
As much as I enjoyed Takeshi playing Emi, on her part, was really impressive and did not disappoint me while performing my favorite Etude's piece. 

It was one of the few times I got that many chills when someone was playing (last time was [Chiaki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1698/Nodame_Cantabile) playing the piano concerto Op. 18 No. 2 of Rachmaninov).

Also, THE HYPE IS REAL FOR KOUSEI NEXT WEEK !! We will get to see him performing Op.25 No.5 "Wrong Note" and who knows he might be able to impress his two rivals with his interpretation. [Minor spoiler](/s "At least one")
>> ARTICLE
> As much as I enjoyed Takeshi playing Emi



And this is why commas matter.
>> ARTICLE
Chiaki playing Rachmaninov was something, but sadly the piece is so long they only played such a small bit.  While that was amazing, this Chopin build was stunning.  I love music anime so much...
>> ARTICLE
Looking forward too seeing Kousei perform now, though I reckon Kousei will lose to them both for the plot's sake. Feels most natural to me considering what he's attempting.
>> ARTICLE
This is my anime of the season. It's just so beautiful and the feels you get from it.  
Looking forward to next week, thursday turned into my favorite day of the week.
>> ARTICLE
That animation is just amazing.

**Opinions:**  

I like that Takeshi dude. He's great and funny. I love how his hair stood up the whole time without moving even though he was sweating like hell.

I'm glad they're not rushing the romance. More background story is always nice.
>> ARTICLE
I might have the minority opinion here, but I find the two rivals who played in today's episode to be infinitely more interesting than Kaori. They think and have emotions like real people. Kaori just has this holier-than-thou attitude all the time about understanding other people. I'm hoping Kousei learns something from Kaori but then moves on beyond her.
>> ARTICLE
I totally agree. Though I wouldn't grant them *too* much depth, since they're basically presented as little more than foils for Kousei, but I do find them more interesting than Kaori.
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait til next week. This episode was way beyond my expectations. The back stories, music, atmosphere, all of it was so great. I loved seeing Kousei finally listening to the other competitors and you could see just how moved Goku was by it. Emi comes out and I really didn't know what to expect, then they show the story of how she got started with the piano in the first place and it really connects you to her character. At first I thought it was just two people who were going to be mean/bully Kousei, but those two are really just brilliant in their own right. Goku wants to catch up to the Kousei that motivated him but then vanished, and Emi started the piano due to the original Kousei before he got completely changed into this "machine" She has been playing up until now out of pure denial of what Kousei had become and once he left, she was just playing with an empty heart so random emotions and things swayed her play.

Next week we finally get to see if Kaori was successful in freeing Kousei from his mothers binds. I haven't been this excited for the next episode of an anime in quite some time!

Now to go watch some Tailyellow in action
>> ARTICLE
Can someone please explain to me something?

They keep saying Arima has been gone for two years, however they flash back to the time they last saw Arima and he is at max 8-9 years old. So if Emi is 14 in this performance wouldn't it had to have been at least 5 years or so..?
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing they flash back to when Arima first performed, he was probably even younger (maybe 5 or 6), and then i'm guessing there was 5-6 years of competitions in which played against Emi and Takeshi, during which that time his mother got sick and died Then he has his breakdown at the age of 12, and here we are 2 years later at 14.
>> ARTICLE
That makes more sense, it was just confusing.. Them going it's been two years and then flashing back two a young kid when they're late middle schoolers.
>> ARTICLE
Any other actual musicians feel disappointed at how much the music recordings don't fit with how the characters describe what they're hearing? Emi's Winter Wind etude was pretty much the most tame Winter Wind I've ever heard, controlled and steady. Not at all in line with all the emotions she was trying to express.
>> ARTICLE
This second half (EDIT: of the first cour) is picking back up to the quality of the first 2 or so episodes
>> ARTICLE
We're still in the first half. This one's 2-cour, 22 episodes exactly.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, this series is so beautifully done.
>> ARTICLE
We didn't get to see Kousei perform but wow I like the "rivals" a lot more then I thought I would! Great episode!

I really want him to do well next week but I have a feeling he won't :/
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the moment I saw them in the opening I was like "ugh, here comes the useless rivals". I couldn't have been more wrong.
>> ARTICLE
If you asked me a week ago that I should try watching music anime, I would have laughed. Now I'm completely submerged into this anime. This is absolutely amazing. I get goosebumps when I hear the performances. I'm feeling emotions I've never had watching other anime. SO HYPED FOR THE NEXT EPISODE!

That black hime cut with red eyes, fiery personality, nice backstory, Hayami Saori voice.

This show is really spoiling us with all these best girls.

Unfortunately this also means we're in for a lot of suffering...
>> ARTICLE
I wish I knew the pieces they were playing to compare how they were playing to the original. Of course some may have their own style when playing. 

I'm thinking Friend A is gonna lose this one to the other two. But he's gonna have those two as friends in the future. Kaori is ultimately gonna be the one to comfort him. 

Well either way, I'm excited to see him play. It's been too long. 
>> ARTICLE
One the great things that I like about shows like this is that they introduce me to music that I know existed, but normally wouldn't bother looking for and enjoy them. 

Like you, I have no frame of reference for these songs, but I will admit that I have downloaded every song played in the Anime so far. 

Don't even get me started on Kids on the Slope. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, those two performances were amazing. Next week will be even better though.
>> ARTICLE
Such a good episode! Chills throughout the whole performance. 
>> ARTICLE
What does this show do to me.  
Every time I watch a performance, I get super tensed up and feel like breathing would be interrupting something. They're absolutely breathtaking.  
Can't wait for Kousei's performance next week.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh...

The performances in this show are so beautiful. Please, *please* all be on the soundtrack when it releases.

^^^^^^^Takeshi's ^^^^^^^hair ^^^^^^^still ^^^^^^^bugs ^^^^^^^me.
>> ARTICLE
Was anyone else so worried that Emi was going to screw up in the end?
>> ARTICLE
Ugh as a former musican and big-time introvert this really took a tear at my emotions; "anger" - "loneliness" -- 

Especially today on Thanksgiving of all days -- I just wanted to get away from the endless family conversations (I can't juggle my focus, listening to 2-3 conversations at once is stressful & difficult). 

I guess a part of me really wants to sleep. Another part of me wants to cry because it knows how Kousei feels with regard to music. 
>> ARTICLE
Here's the full PV of the opening if you haven't seen it yet

>> ARTICLE
I've seen it. Multiple times. But I don't want to be rude so I'll watch it again!
>> ARTICLE
Got to say this week has been pretty amazing Snk,Inou-Battle 2 episodes of Parasite!, Psycho Pass and Shigatsu's top quality music finally playing this week has been really enjoyable.  
Were just halfway over this week and with Magic Hour coming pretty soon and Fate, I dont think we will see another week like this for a while :)  

>> ARTICLE
This show is absolute perfection! I'm glad they softened up on the romance and focused more on the supporting characters' back stories. They were very interesting too. The music gave tons of goosebumps and the symbolism has me breathless. Best show this season for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Those performances were really amazing, really like Emi and the development her and Takeshi got. So pumped to hear Kousei play next week. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't handle Takeshi's hair, it's so dumb looking. 
>> ARTICLE
This was a rather boring episode, IMO. I love music and am on Kaori's side of how music brings so much emotion, but I felt it was all very fillery. I mean, backstories are important, but all I Aizi's felt pointless since we already know his intent, and Igawa's left me with no clear answer as to her feelings. Is it just teenage girl moodswings, or is it something deep? Does she love or hate Kousi? But at least the animation was nice.

Also, is Watari actually serious with Kaori? I hope not so a breakup I'm expecting to happen someday isn't so painful.
>> ARTICLE
> Also, is Watari actually serious with Kaori? I hope not so a breakup I'm expecting to happen someday isn't so painful.

I used ctrl+F to find "Watari" to see if anyone had mentioned this and am surprised nobody has. Watari gushing over Emi's beauty was focused on intentionally. It provides some confirmation for what's been hinted at for several episodes now; Kaori and Watari's attraction to each other has faded. Notice how Tsubaki was trying to shut Watari up since Kaori was there? Kaori didn't seem to care much at all that Watari found Emi to be so cute. Pretty telling stuff right there. 
>> ARTICLE
just watching this show now and i went to the reddit post to see if this scene was mentioned.  it was hilarious!
>> ARTICLE
I think Kaori has Watari's number as far as him being somewhat feckless.  They aren't even sitting next to each other.


>> ARTICLE
Was that look Watari had when Emi came on stage more *character development*?!?! 

I'll be honest, I could ship those two. She wouldn't put up with his shit, and he'd probably end up genuinely charming her loneliness away. Plus I just would like him to not be a side character anymore, they've even given the two rivals more development than him in two episodes. 

It's weird because he's not even my favorite character, but the rest of the cast is so beautifully done that his own lack of development is starting to stand out, and I'd just like them to hit that peak with everybody, especially since he's so prominent in the opening and as one of the main four. I think they will, though.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like we'll get a time skip here after ep 12 or 13


>> ARTICLE
omg 3 episodes of despair, waiting for Arima to play (not that I didn't like Emi's and Takeshi's performance, it was amazing, but I'm dying to know if Arima will be able to play)
>> ARTICLE
Dialogue is still unnecessarily overwrought, but the performances were great. I'm looking forward to Kousei's performance even more now - I suspect he'll try to play with emotion rather than with robotic technique, and though he won't win, he'll impress the audience.

Monologues: still present, still excessive. Music: still great.
>> ARTICLE
A small detail, but this is the first anime that I have seen that used steinway pianos instead of yamaha ones. 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone knows the piece/music that starts at 15:00?
>> ARTICLE
In the previous episode, Arima was told that he would play Kochel number 265, Mozart's Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Unless he deviates from the original like the blonde does, I don't think the difficulty of the song comes near Chopin tude: Op. 25, No. 11... at least from what I can tell. But then again, I don't know anything about the piano so please correct me if I am wrong. That would just make me look forward to the next episode even more.
>> ARTICLE
Haha looks like the Piano teachers have the biggest rivalry.

>> ARTICLE
They only dressed up before going on stage.

I really, really want to read the manga so I can stop getting teased like this. But I don't want to spoil the surprise... Dammit!
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know the song that plays in the background right before Emi performs?
>> ARTICLE
Let it ring.  :')

I was hoping for at least one super magical performance, thinking that there was a very small chance they'd actually do two, but hot damn!  They actually did two!  
>> ARTICLE
Omg why is this so good I even get super nervous when they start playing and hold my breath o.o
>> ARTICLE
After those two im really wondering how Kousei is going to play. How is he going to live up to the hype from those performances?
>> ARTICLE
Daaamn, Emi's performance was spectacular.
>> ARTICLE
God damn, I really want to hear Kousei's performance after seeing these two. 

I really enjoyed this episode, but I am even more excited for next weeks.
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone besides me get goosebumps when Emi started playing and it was all soft and slow and then BAM she throws down this beautiful passionate piece. 

>> ARTICLE
It's obvious they are throwing the lion's share of the budget into the performance animations and less into the dialogue scenes; which I am completely okay with. After Takeshi I didn't think it could get any better, then Emi steps out...
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful episode. We really got into their heads, and it made the music more impactful. Can't wait to see Arima though. Will he blow them out of the water or not? Great show. It's just light hearted and fun....for now....
>> ARTICLE
shut up and let me see the fingers! D:
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this episode was breathtaking. Emi Igawa's performance really stole the show for me and I think she instantly became part of my top 3 Best Girls. Her character design in that dress was beautiful and the piano performance really brought out her emotions. Easily best girl in the show at the moment.

Although I know that Kaori is winning over Kousei's heart, I hope Emi gets some notice too.
>> ARTICLE
n2 best girl (and Takeshi just behind that ^^)
>> ARTICLE
This was out of this world amazing.
>> ARTICLE
The suspense for the performance of Kousei is killing me. These 2 really set the bar high for him, and it be a shame if he ruined it. I have a feeling he might just barely get through these prelims and then develop further in the competition, but it's all speculation. Until next week!
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh another week wait, its painful but worth it. This show is so beautiful and magnificently produced.  
>> ARTICLE
why does this anime always end up giving me goosebumps?
^so ^many ^feels 
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else thought emi would flip the bird at the end of her performance? On another note, HOT DAMN THIS MUSIC GIVES ME CHILLS!
>> ARTICLE
I hope Kousei brings his A game, those performances were excellent. Probably one of my favorite animes this season
>> ARTICLE
Best episode so far! In my opinion
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, leaving us just hanging there. Does the director realize how evil he's being? You can't make something this good and just let people suffer in waiting every freaking week. Just, no!

I swear I'll have to watch this in one go once the anime concludes.
>> ARTICLE
The scene where Aiza was blushing because Kousei said he was amazing, I think that's when I discovered my love for the character. Although last episode everyone saw them (Aiza and Emi) as rivals, I like how this episode turned that theory on it's head and explained that Kousei drove both of them to be this good!
>> ARTICLE
Chopin seems op
>> ARTICLE
It will probably end out with a 3 way final between the Igawa, Aiza and Kousei. I don't know if he'll win this competition.  
  
If he wins --> Then Igawa and Aiza will still be going after him making for a fun way for the story to go.  
  
If he loses --> Which I am more hanging towards, because they are implying he is on his way to recover, might be a storyline of him catching up to Igawa and Aiza or something like that.  
  
Anyway this anime surprised me, it's looking to me like the best anime of the season so far, but we'll only know that in time.  
  
Note: Ofcourse I haven't read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Another great episode, it was nice to see some depth to the other 2 players, makes them more complete characters rather than stereotypical rivals.  Still rooting for girl next door.
>> ARTICLE
Gets too excited watching.

Read the manga.

Feels.
>> ARTICLE
Ummm to reject him. I don't get that. He played for his mom not for anybody else. 
>> ARTICLE
not that complicated.
>> ARTICLE
to reject the "current" him that played as a robot, grinding to be good.

what she wants is the one she saw when she was 5 when it was his first time playing and he probly was just enjoying him self and playing for fun thats what she loves, and its obv she loves him.

its kinda obv they basicaly screamed this at you this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I think she meant she played to reject the piano player he became. She was inspired by his very first performance, that we didn't get to see, but I'm guessing was a very emotion filled. she rejects the "machine-like" player his mother turned him into by playing with her heart on her sleeve, pouring her soul out
>> ARTICLE
I guess that when she first heard him, he was playing with emotion, but after that he turned into that perfect robot. She rejects that robot and would like to hear him play just like when she heard him for the first time.
>> ARTICLE
Heres to hoping this next performance of his will be exactly that. His whole reason for playing has changed after all.
>> ARTICLE
I thought that was it too, I hope Kousei's performance will blow her away. Or something
>> ARTICLE
Ahh! I want to find out what happens next week! To read the manga, or to not read the manga. Decisions decisions....
>> ARTICLE
THe anime will over take the translated manga chapters, I'd say just watch the anime then read it after, cause they do condense it a bit.

The manga is great, but there's always something about having no sound in a series about music lol
>> ARTICLE
I can't fucking stand the dialogue in this show. Every sentence has to contain either a metaphor, simile or symbolism, or even all 3. Only paying attention during the performances is the best way to watch this show.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the dialogue is pretty overwrought. Too much metaphor, not enough straightforwardness. The music is great, but the monologues need to stop.

[BAKA KOUSEI!](http://i.imgur.com/s7GZPeW.png)

Well, the stage is set now, and there's really no going back from here.

Now that [Kaori](http://i.imgur.com/9sARMjU.png) and [Tsubaki's](http://i.imgur.com/j2fTdSn.png) intentions are clear, Kousei's going to have an awfully difficult decision to make.

I love the use of Claire de Lune in anything, but that [walk on the beach](http://i.imgur.com/zPHNgyM.png), humming the tune in the moonlight was especially appropriate.

It's a full-on love triangle, but it's going to be really difficult for Tsubaki to compete with Kaori.  Tsubaki has history on her side, and you can see that Kousei respects her, and is protective of her as ever when he came running for her at the drop of a hat...but I think the difference between their relationships can be adequately described in the comparison of their two nights under the stars.

While Tsubaki [is grounded and walks along side](http://i.imgur.com/1E22mPu.png) Kousei, Kaori is [flying through the air on his shoulders like a shooting star.](http://i.imgur.com/pn2ymC0.png)  This is the difference between the two of them.  Hopefully, Kaori's star doesn't burn out too soon.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's because he and Tsubaki can be together and even when Kaori is gone she's still watching over his shoulder? Like, watching out for him as if she's an angel.

If Kaori hasn't got time to read those books maybe she'll actually die sooner than expected. As in, not at the end of the show. Maybe it's when he's playing after she's gone that he realizes she's still there, in his music. Like he will keep playing and as he plays he can feel her beside him and the soundtrack will slowly let in that violin sound. 

I don't know, but if she has to go, it can be a beautiful way too.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Claire de Lune came on at the perfect time. Under the moon light and walking on the beach. Perfect setting. 
>> ARTICLE
Fairly certain that, with the way thinks look for Kaori, Tsubaki is going to win by forfeiture.

If she dies that means she spent the last days of her life trying to help someone she never even knew.; all the while trying her best to not fall in love with him nor him with her.  

If she was okay all along, then she is just another violent, greedy annoying anime heroine. 

I'm sorry but like in cabin in the woods; the gods demand a sacrifice. 
>> ARTICLE
"[...] she spent the last days of her life trying to help someone she never even knew."
Kaori's parents are Kousei fans. She probably knew Kousei from distance (well, musicians world is not big and everyone know everyone) and maybe she had the intention for help Kousei since the start.

>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna go for a no one wins ending. Kaori goes away, Kousei gets depressed but continues with his dream and goes to the music High school, Tsubaki ends up sad. Nobody wins.

Nah man, Kaori is gonna make a miraculous recovery, Kousei is gonna find a school with a music course somewhere close by and Tsubaki will accept that best girl is Kaori and happily move on.

Seriously, with the number of flags increasing since the first fucking episode there is only one way I see this ending, and it isn't good.

But you know what? This is what's going to make this show one of the best, heart wrenching stories of this season. I can't wait to finally see this ending despite the fact I think I know what's coming. I want to believe there is a chance for hope but even the god damn title of the show pretty much spoiled it. 
>> ARTICLE
Enjoy your last meal sir

I swear if Watari gets Tsubaki I'm rating this show a 3.

exactly, those two are similar, but not a good match for a couple. Tsubaki is just going to have to end up alone.

Why is everything so sad and why do I keep coming back for more. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
> it's going to be really difficult for Tsubaki to compete with Kaori

See, I don't even think it's that Tsubaki is competing with Kaori. That would be easier for her to deal with. What she does have to fight against is the unmoving fact that Kousei lives in an entirely different world than she does. He is, as Kaori and her both note this episode, an artist. He experiences and engages with the world in a fundamentally different way that Tsubaki.

It's not Kaori taking Kousei away from Tsubaki; it's the way he was built to be alive.

And she can't join him in that.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, the whole 'I hate music" clips/scenes reinforce that idea. Its not Kaori she's upset/competing with, it's music itself.
>> ARTICLE
Hey all, just a reminder that the superb OST is now out!  

This includes the [full version of the lovely insert song at the end of episode 11 which you can take a listen to here](https://soundcloud.com/delphic-runner/my-truth-ep11-insert-song-by-ena)

I kinda see Kaori as a platonic bestgirl - she and Kousei are like the ultimate musical duo, but I don't see it as a true romance.

If her friend had more screentime she would be  all time best girl. She's like the personification of my fantasy where I enter the anime and scream at all the characters for being stubborn.

So is it like pretty much confirmed by this point that shes gonna die right (i mean a show can only have so many death flags before its basically confirmed right ???), fuck man i see it coming but even knowing all these episodes ahead of time i know im gonna cry like a little bitch when it happens

I feel like in the manga they made the hospital scene where kaori cry's seem more like a bigger deal read the scene [here](http://bato.to/read/_/288161/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso_v7_ch27_by_easy-going-scans/22) if you want

Poor Tsubaki man the one that always wholeheartedly cares about the mc is always destined not to win :(
>> ARTICLE
To be fair. Kaori seems to be spending her last living days trying to help arima and seemingly at the same time, not have him fall in love with her (Nor her with him). That seems pretty whole-hearted then a girl dating another guy. 
>> ARTICLE
Those bits when she kept bringing up Watari :(
>> ARTICLE
People wonder how she really feels about arima; but the truth has always been in  the music. 

Who is she playing for? Who is she playing with. It was always Arima. 

Now that he we walked up on the stage alone, with out her encouragement; is her job done? Has she accomplished her last life goal?

She's not gonna die, she's just at the hospital for tests, didn't you watch the episode? Jeez, she'll be fine.

didnt u watch the part where the nurse comes back?
i thought it was already obv 
>> ARTICLE
well yeah, the Nurse is probably just giving IV contrast or something, its pretty common for medical tests
>> ARTICLE
From what I saw at real life hospitals, that is chemotherapy...
>> ARTICLE
the way I took it when I was reading the manga version is she was hiding the fact that she was on an IV from them
>> ARTICLE
it's pretty obvious that she's hiding the iv in this episode as well.

well they wouldn't want to hook her up with everyone in the room if they didn't need to, just shows that its not that urgent, and she'll be fine.

_______________
**For Tsubaki-chan**
_______________

Sometimes, a man boards a ship, realizes it's doomed to sink, and abandons it to save his life. That man is a coward, but wise.

Sometimes, a man boards a ship, realizes it's doomed to sink, but refuses to abandon it out of stubbornness or love. That man is foolish, but strangely noble.

But sometimes, a man is in the harbor and he knows that a ship is doomed to sink even before boarding. Still, he boards it. That man is the greatest fool of them all, yet he also has the most love in his heart for that poor, sinking ship.

DO YOU VALUE YOUR WISDOM OR DO YOU WISH TO SHOW LOVE TO THE LOVELESS? IF YOU ARE GENEROUS OF SPIRIT, RIDE THE S.S. TSUBAKI TO THE DEPTHS OF DAVY JONES' LOCKER WITH ME. IT SHALL BE A TALE NOT SOON FORGOTTEN.

I thought people only did stuff like this for harems. Seems kind of stupid to do it for what's more of a drama/romance. Does everything need to be turned into shipping and bestgirls? God damn.
>> ARTICLE
Son, insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' 'is mother.
>> ARTICLE
Easy there. Best girl is a tongue-in-cheek thing that is in no way meant to be taken seriously.

As for shipping, it is something that exists in every entertainment medium in some way, shape or form. It's not exclusive to harem anime, and it isn't even exclusive to anime. Or animated shows. Or fiction.
>> ARTICLE
I will reserve my right to engage with my animu in the ways that let me have the most fun.

(Also, I had to do something with all those sad Tsubaki feels)
>> ARTICLE
Ships don't sink! They become submarines...and resurface when they score a hit on a hostile ship!

At least I hope so with this anime...I have a hunch that they'll even blow the submarines out of the water with F.E.E.L.S. brand depth charges.

Koi to senyou to Chocolat seems like something enjoyable for you then.

I saw the ship will be sinking from the beginning, and I'm still boarding it and looking forward as it's sailing through the starry night under the shine of the moonlight. I'm prepared to fall with the ship into the dreamless ocean of 'Childhood friend'

AYE AYE CAPTAIN

I have never been so firmly entrenched on the side of a sunken ship before, but holy shit Tsubaki has done it. The only thing that comes close is Onodera from Nisekoi, but that hardly counts since every ship is doomed on that show.

The important think to remember is that a victory is still achievable, the question is will the SS Tsubaki-chan sink before or after the SS Kaori-chan can raise her death flag to half-mast?

It's less a contest about who wins and more about who loses first.

ehhhhhhhh. You're forgetting best girl, [Emi-chan](https://gfycat.com/CornyHighlevelCrustacean).

She's really not part of the love polyhedron though, maybe if she gets more screen time. 
>> ARTICLE
No she's more part of the music focus rather than the romance part. Which i personally enjoy. Sometimes its too much when all the female leads are in love with the main boy.
>> ARTICLE
Emi-chan was my best girl until the show decided to mire her character in tragically bad comedy and stereotypical tsundere traits.

Don't get me wrong; I like my tsunderesbut Emi, man, she was transcendent in her introductory episodes. She was driven, passionate, powerful...alive.

Now? She just feels like a generic girl with a thing from the protagonist, albeit with a desire to crush him.

O Bestgirl! my Bestgirl! our season's cour is done,  
The show has weather'd every scene, finale sought is won,  
The end is near, ED I hear, the fans are all exulting,  
While follow eyes the OTP, the show is bright and daring;

But O Heart! heart! heart!  
What price did these smiles cost?  
Where on the deck my Bestgirl lies,  
Bestgirl's ship has lost.

O Bestgirl! my Bestgirl! rise up and hear the songs;  
Rise up - for you fanart is drawn - for you the fanfic writ,  
For you backgrounds and stitches made - for you the threads a-crowding,  
For you we call, the rabid fans, our eager faces turning;

Here Bestgirl! dear onee-chan!  
Your hair so sweetly toss'd!  
Is it some dream that in this show,  
The Bestgirl's ship has lost.

My Bestgirl does not answer, her lips are pale and still,  
My Bestgirl does not feel my arm, she has no pulse nor will,  
The ship is sunk, abandoned, lost; its voyage closed and done,  
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with canon won;  

Exult, O fans, and ring, OP!  
But I now at a loss,  
Watch the show OTP fails,  
Bestgirl's ship has lost.

I like what you had to say in your blog. I agree pretty heavily with what you had to say about Tsubaki and enjoyed those paragraphs in particular.

About Kaori however... I had a change of mind after watching this episode. I came to the discussion on reddit thinking, "sigh, well, the discussion is probably gonna be dominated by a bunch more 'death flag' comments." Then I realized, that they aren't really death flags anymore. Sure, the first ones were most definitely giant, foreshadowing death flags, but now, they're more a reflection of Kaori's thought process and the consequences of her death. Its not about letting us know shes gonna die anymore. Instead its letting us know that Kaori thinks she's gonna die and that Kousei is starting to think something's wrong. Kaori is just trying to live life and love life but is constantly haunted by her illness and is forced to fake it. Kousei finally found purpose again and is very much attracted to the person that helped him find it, but he's about to lose it all all over again. This isn't a show where death or a main character's death is used as plot point and then the show goes on. In this show Kaori's death IS the plot.

**TL;DR** In short, death flags are devices used to build suspense. They built some suspense but **now** these aren't death flags anymore. Now, these are devices that are used and are going to be used for character development. Its important to keep this in mind as the story advances.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! Tsubaki's situation just made me so sad this week...

I like what you're saying about Kaori's death being the plot. I think it's super interesting to think of it that way, although I'm not sure I necessarily agree because Kousei is still the protagonist, definitely, of the show. The show is *about* Kousei.

I guess I wish we just got more from Kaori about her impending death than we do. Right now that whole situation feels really insubstantial to me. :/

This chapter in the manga is what solidified me as a Tsubaki fan. Don't get me wrong, I love Kaori, but the way the chapter was laid out (basically 100% the same as the episode) and the great amount of backstory/character development for Tsubaki had such a huge impact on me.

This will probably be my favorite episode of the series, as it's up there as my favorite/one of my favorite chapters of what's been translated in the manga thus far.

This character development for Tsubaki is pretty heartbreaking, and with Arima starting to get the picture of Kaori's situation (read: impending doom) it looks like there is going to be a crossroads with their relationship soon.

>> ARTICLE
> of Kaori's situation (read: impending ~~doom~~ tour of Europe)

Seriously though, Tsubaki still has some issues with Kousei's music, just judging from the flashbacks of all the times he couldn't play with her because he was playing music. If their relationship progresses, this is going to sabotage it.

[This scene](http://i.imgur.com/Y0uYaaE.jpg). Fucking phenomenal! I love moments of slow realization where you come to terms with their feelings.

Normally, I hate montages like that in anime. I felt this one was tastefully and well done. It didn't use only stills from previous episodes, and it slowly panned up towards Tsubaki's face. I don't know exactly what, but it was just a great, yet heartbreaking scene.

ok that ending hit like a bullet train. This show is starting to be bad for my health. I feel significantly more pain every week, and its going to be too much at some point.

Do the Japanese have an obsession with Debussy? I swear I've lost count on how many times I've heard [Clair de Lune](http://youtu.be/-LXl4y6D-QI) in Japanese media. It's not a bad thing though.
>> ARTICLE
Clair de Lune is one of the few songs that doesn't annoy me, no matter how many times I listen to it. Honestly, it's one of my favorite piano pieces and I love listening to Debussy and [Satie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU) when I need to relax.

I think a huge reason I really got into this show was the music. I've always loved classical music (even though I tried both violin and piano as a kid and found I wasn't very musically inclined myself). Honestly, it's probably the same reason why I loved Kids on the Slope because I also love jazz.

If only this show didn't make me so goddamn sad. Too many feels...

Not to mention that they were originally humming the Moonlight Sonata in the manga.

That's pretty weird. Wonder why they'd change it. Clair de Lune has officially become the Wilhelm scream of [Japanese](http://youtu.be/HGKM0Y4n-7c) [entertainment](http://youtu.be/e54srnkCZD4) for me now.
>> ARTICLE
Claire de Lune is just very recognizable and lots of people think it's one of the greatest piano songs.

I got really psyched when Kaori mentioned Liszt because [Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H99FM6S8rU) is one of my favorite show-y pieces and it would be amazing if they worked it into the show somehow.

## Episode 14 List of Classical Performances:

This week's classical piece is hummed by Kousei and Tsubaki as they are walking on the beach at the end of the episode.

---

**Debussy: Suite Bergamasque, Third Movement (Clair de Lune)** - "In the late 19th and early 20th centuries concert music was in a major state of flux and splintering into several schools of theory and discord. Largely because of Richard Wagner, music had become very chromatic (using all of the notes of the scales), and lost much of its sense of tonal centers. Symphonies before Wagner were written and organized in keys and key centers. We need only think of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in C minor, or the concerto on todays program in a minor, to see the relationships. After Wagner, we not only lost our sense of keys, but composers took their music in completely new (and often conflicting and difficult to understand) directions. Some composers wrote in two keys simultaneously (bitonality); others wrote with no keys (atonality); while Arnold Schoenberg created a twelve-tone system (notes could only be played once until all other notes were played), In France, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel and others championed and developed their own answer  "impressionism."

Debussy is generally considered to be one of the most important impressionists, and he did in fact move away from the traditional approach to major and minor keys. But his music only blurred the tonal centers  it did not destroy them.  Debussy used exotic harmonies and the largely unfamiliar whole tone scale (scales that use only whole steps  not the more common mixture of whole and half steps of our major and minor scales) as the basis for much of his music. In spite of this unfamiliar approach, his music was still written with key signatures, and it always felt centered. Because of the unusual sounds, he did have to find a way to organize the musical structure so that the listener could understand and enjoy it. He accomplished this by constantly repeating short phrases (often one or two measure segments). These repetitions helped to solidify the new sounds in the listeners ears, and thereby made the new music more approachable.

Most of Debussys output was for piano, and in fact he wrote only a few large-scale orchestral works. Interestingly, nearly all of those works  - La Mer (the sea), Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun, Nocturnes, Images for Orchestra, etc - remain popular in todays repertoire. There are of course many arrangements of his piano works for large and small ensembles, and many were made by well  established composers. The Claire de lune (moon light) is one of Debussys most famous and popular piano works, and has been arranged for many different combinations of instruments. It is the third movement of a four-movement work originally composed for piano, called Suite Bergamasque.  Bergamasque refers to the northern Italian city Bergamo, its music and an old peasant dance. This work has all of the hallmarks of Debussys creative genius  impressionistic harmonies, exotic melodies, and the evocation of dreamy/other worldly senses that are so typical of his music." [(Source)](http://www.mnsinfonia.org/program-notes-claire-de-lune)

Program Notes from the Seattle Symphony Orchestra give us a little more information about the movements of the Suite itself:

"Debussy began working on his popular *Suite bergamasque* in 1890 while still a student. 15 years later he thoroughly revised the music shortly before it was published in 1905. The opening *Prlude* is cast in tempo rubato, which belies its energetic beginning and closing bars as well as its prevailingly festive mood. Rich in dynamic contrasts, the piece can be heard as a paean to the Baroque era, especially in its improvisatory feel. The following *Menuet* posits a playful main theme as a counterpoise to a mystery-filled and dramatic middle section. Here too, the music evokes Baroque-era sensibility rather than the graceful and courtly minuets of Haydn and Mozart. The third movement, *Clair de lune* has enjoyed a life separate from the rest of the work, serving as an encore piece of exquisite delicacy and tenderness, further enhanced by mist-filled mystery. The Suite concludes with an old French dance from Brittany, the *Passepied*. Technically, this concluding movement is dotted with taxing staccatos in the left hand and rushes by in a trippingly merry fashion." [(Source)](http://www.seattlesymphony.org/symphony/buy/single/programnotes.aspx?id=13163)

Here's an interpretation of this work by [Andrew von Oeyen](http://youtu.be/lEwh1JsJwRk) (piano only version) and [David Oistrakh](http://youtu.be/SKd0VII-l3A) (violin/piano version). 

(*Aside*: if you haven't noticed by now, I have quite the thing for Oistrakh, and I'm going to share a video with him playing violin at any opportunity I have. XD)

The ~~struggle~~ feels are real folks.  The first half of the episode made me think I was watching "Death Flags: The Anime".  The way they keep raising left and right in the anime and the manga have us all worrying about Kaori.  If you think your emotions are being toyed with...[well...](/s "this is just the tip of the iceberg, folks. :'(") In addition to Kousei hoping that Kaori doesn't disappear on him just like his mother did, we have Tsubaki still not being honest with herself with Kousei.  When he tells her that he's planning to go to a high school with a music program and will have to move away because of it, Tsubaki finally realized her true feelings and how much of an idiot she was.  [Unfortunately for her,](/s "senpai dumps her next episode, and Tsubaki goes to Kousei for "comfort"...whatever that means. However, she also realizes that Kousei, Watari, and the various people she's met have been moving forward in her lives...but she's the only one not moving forward. Keep an eye out for more character development for the childhood friend in future episodes...especially the one where she..."confesses"...to...?!?!") 

[In addition to seeing](/s "more Tsubaki "drama"") next episode, we finally get to meet the [blonde ~~loli~~ girl](/s "Aiza Nagi") we've seen in the new opening and will learn [more about her mission](/s "in targeting Kousei because of her hatred for him?!  Anyway, you might not really like her in the next episode or two, but her development as a (side) character is pretty decent; it's sorta similar to Kousei's, but with the feels factor turned down like 10 notches.  Also, I'm looking forward to seeing ~~siscon~~ Takeshi make his first appearance since the piano competition!")

Thanks again for taking the time to read my post this week! I hope you're looking forward to next week's episode as much as I am! :-)
>> ARTICLE
That last still of the preview... is that a time skip??? right when I had almost let my guard down for this episode.
>> ARTICLE
OH NO. Especially now I DO NOT like timeskips. I don't trust this at all. I don't want to see a timeskip like in fuckin clannad AS. I'm scared.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it is actually after thinking about it. I think that girl is the blonde pianists [younger sister](http://i.imgur.com/YJ5e1jV.jpg). She appears in the OP [chasing him](http://i.imgur.com/ZC69a3v.jpg) up the steps.

At first I thought it was Hiro's daughter, but the above makes it seem more plausible.
>> ARTICLE
That would make sense if they are being going to become larger characters.

The feels in this show. 

I like Kaori, but Tsubaki made me like her even more. I'm rooting for her too!

one of the few animes where i hope they both win :( they are so different and yet likeable in their own way.

god damn it, the character development is spot on.

Every week I think "oh it can't get any more feel-sy than this". Every week I'm proven wrong.

[feels spoilers ](/s "The mudballs, the popsicle."). I'M SO SORRY TSUBAKI. Pretty sure I was shouting through the entire episode "NO PLEASE NO".
>> ARTICLE
Hey guys! For those of you who read my performances posts, I wanted to give you a quick update on when they'll be available.

I have a new work schedule which keeps me at my job until 7pm on Thursdays.  In addition to this, I'm in choir practice from 7:30pm - 8:30pm and thus the earliest I'll be able to watch the episode is 9:00pm.  With all of that said, my performances posts won't be available until ~11:00pm CST (GMT -6:00).

Due to other things last week, I didn't get the episode 13 post out until 3:00am (>_>).  [Here's the post in case you didn't see it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2sjj52/spoilers_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_episode_13/cnqr94h)  If I feel it's necessary, I'll post one for this episode sometime tonight.  

Thanks again for reading the performance posts! I learn quite a bit from doing these, and I hope you're learning from them too! :-)
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it was just me/my TV, but Kaori looked really pale in the hospital. Like in comparison to the other three her skin tone looked much lighter. 

Poor Tsubaki. You knew this whole time, but now that you're losing Kousei soon, it hits you like a freight train. Childhood friends never win. ;_;

Not sure if anyone else felt the same way, but Kaori looked pretty pale this ep. [I can't handle this I rarely get emotional when watching most anime, but with this one minute I'm happy and the next I'm sad and literally about to break.](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/river_soul/726597/247179/original.gif) My [heart](http://img.pandawhale.com/83685-MY-EMOTIONS-gif-Troy-Community-CDYQ.gif)  can't take much more.

First I was like nope, but then I saw the last bit of that preview, and I think you may be on to something.

It would be good for Tsubaki, she would go to a school near Kousei's, Kaori would be out of the picture [because](/s "she's touring Europe").

If Kaori dies and Kousei ends up with Tsubaki, I will probably kill myself on the spot

That walk on the beach may be the cutest thing I've ever seen. Realizations for both of them, and feels impending. Poor Tsubaki.

Please oh please gods of anime, just this once let the childhood friend win
>> ARTICLE
One of my least favorite episodes... I'll always be on team Kaori (best girl forever)
>> ARTICLE
hmmm.. that kinda ruins an anime if there's development for another girl or a change for an other girl. 

This episode is making me doubt though. Kaori, Tsubaki? HMMMMMM
>> ARTICLE
I was on the S.S. Kaori for a long time, but the characterization and development for Tsubaki has been so well done that she is rapidly overtaking Kaori for best girl. 
>> ARTICLE
Seems like S.S. Tsubaki knows it has no chance so it's firing all its torpedoes backwards and blasting all its fuel to get one last boost of momentum before the end. 
>> ARTICLE
God dammit, my eyes are anticipating feels, I started to tear up as soon as I hit play...
>> ARTICLE
GOD THIS SHOW'S SO FUCKING GOOD
>> ARTICLE
Weekly dose of tears. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt like everything from the Clair de Lune scene and on was really, really well done. Sure, it didn't have the same kind of emotional impact as the last episode, but there's just something about the sweet melancholy of Kaori that resonated with me. This is definitely my favorite anime this season.

>> ARTICLE
That beach scene looked beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
I love Thursday evenings more than every other day, cause of triple S we got this season - SaeKano, Shirobako and Shigatsu.

The first one delivers comedy and a little of harem. The second one is awesome in terms of learning something new about making anime by just watching anime! And the third one brings FEELS, a lot of feels btw.

I must admit I loved episodes with music contests or just some Kousei playing a little bit more, but this one was great. Another death flags for Kaori (STOP it already, it gonna be very very painful), sad Tsubaki story (which I actually found sad one only at the end, when she finally got Kousei leaving and stuff, because, you know, you start appreciate something (or someone) only when you understand you'll lose it). And that background OST was just in place, poor Tsubaki.

But I can see where this show can go, even with the death of Kaori (still, it's not necessary, you know, A-1?) and Kousei moving to another school.
>> ARTICLE
This show hurts. It really hurts. [my emotions](http://img.pandawhale.com/38353-the-feels-gif-2RqD.gif), [my feels](http://www.gifpal.com/uimages/BKre3FoPi8.gif) [tears](http://img.pandawhale.com/83683-Doctor-Who-raining-gif-David-T-K8Pf.gif)
>> ARTICLE
I actually feel sorry for that senpai. Guy has to listen to his supposed GF talk about another dude all the time.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think anyone else noted it, but Kousei's father made his debut this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Not that there was anything objectively wrong with the episode, but I just didn't enjoy it. I don't really care for Tsubaki too much and the fact that this episode focused on her instead of Kaori was kind of annoying to me. it's a side romance that will never pan out and I could really care less for.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I would even feel shocked when Kaori dies anymore...note how I say "when" and not "if", they made it so obvious and kept repeating death flags :/ 
>> ARTICLE
Please let the childhood friend win, for once =(
>> ARTICLE
Every episode renews might interest in the series but also reminds me of its flaws. I was hoping that Arima would have gotten over his mother, but it seems like the series is still very much fixated on repetitive dialogue and flashbacks as a way to convey emotion. I'm tempted to make a fan edit of the series, and I bet the first 14 episodes could be condensed into an hour and a half easily.
>> ARTICLE
Hm, only cried 4 times this ep guys. 
>> ARTICLE
Seeing his mom instead of Kaori in the hospital hit me with some instant feels why would you open the episode with that?!

This new OP is growing on me :)

This show hits me with so many emotions and lately it's been his mother and Kaori's health I forgot about the love triangle feels ;.;^hate^love^triangles
>> ARTICLE
Jesus, just when you think this show can't get even more depressing...

[Atashitte... honto baka.](http://i.imgur.com/WxWNcFf.png)

Just when you thought it couldn't get any better; MC wants to move, childhood friend faces inner fears and girl that lights up your world is probably going to leave you like your mom did. Only if they also include a sad story for Watari where he was secretly in love with Arami and ruin that scenario as well then it would be worse.
>> ARTICLE
does anyone know what song Kousei plays before the OP?
>> ARTICLE
This is gonna hurt in so many ways.
>> ARTICLE
Seems like Tsubaki's heart is set on Arima, but his heart is somewhere else. 

I don't know if I can handle 8 more episodes of this.
>> ARTICLE
i love this anime.

>> ARTICLE
childhood friends never win
>> ARTICLE
I can't remember the last time a show sparked so much life in everyone.. Is this show making as much of an impact on all of your lives as it is mine? 
>> ARTICLE
As much as I love this show, I feel like I'm just watching the really nice, poignant version of Death Parade...or at least the prequel to one of the episodes forthcoming in Death Parade.

I LOVED that running scene in tonight's episode. Perfection.

EDIT: Please tell me someone has made a photoshop edit to call this show "How I Met Your Death Flags"
>> ARTICLE
Far too melodramatic for me.  We all know that Kousei is going to suffer.  I think one of the piano teachers mentioned that, that suffering will lead to him developing as a musician..or something.  
>> ARTICLE
Yes.  He gains a super saiyan level in piano playing for each death he goes through.

Super saiyan 1 = mom's death 
Super saiyan 2 = kaori's death
Super saiyan 3 = watari's death 
Super saiyan 4 = his wife /tsubaki's death 
God super saiyan = him and tsubaki's child's death 
>> ARTICLE
For his sake (and Kaori's), I think we'd better start rounding up those Dragon Balls. Probably gonna need Earth's, Namek's, and any other planet that possibly has some.

>> ARTICLE
Good lord do I love this show.
>> ARTICLE
holy fuck the montage of kousei and tsubaki was beatiful
>> ARTICLE
Kaori is totally going to die. . . Way too many references in the last episode and this are made between her and Kousei's mother. Especially the one where Kousei walks into the hospital room and see's his mother for a second then it turns out to be Kaori.
>> ARTICLE
Finally we get to see Tsubaki realizing her actual feelings...
>> ARTICLE
This show's lack of subtlety is so eye-rolling. I liked Shigatsu at first but I'm starting to get kind of annoyed.
>> ARTICLE
At this point I feel like they are doing this just to troll us. No way would writers write such obvious foreshadowings.
>> ARTICLE
You might even say it's a little *heavy handed*
>> ARTICLE
I love this anime, but for god's sake, can the subbed versions PLEASE stop saying "song" instead of "piece". INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC IS NOT A SONG and it's bugging me every time.

but we all know thats not gonna happen because kaori's gonna die
hes gonna go sad,
shes gonna wait for him and hopefully not become a trainwreck like KGNE

>> ARTICLE
The new OP really grew on me. Holy crap, I don't want to see Tsubaki get her heartbroken ;_;
>> ARTICLE
I want Kaori to win because it's Kaori but i don't want the childhood friend to lose again...
>> ARTICLE
Gotta say, this show is on a fucking roll right now, making me cry for like 10 episodes in a row. The feels are real. 
Also, please stop those death flags, please. 
>> ARTICLE
tsubaki's moment reminds me of toradora episode 19, when taiga realized her feelings. but i think toradora did that scene better, with a more emotional OST and VA. or maybe its just me. still really good.
>> ARTICLE
I can't play any form of musical instrument and I don't understand many of the musical references made in this show.

But god damn this show is amazing.

/u/MikaelDerp had an explanation for that [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2tbdo1/spoilers_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_episode_14/cnxlzog).
>> ARTICLE
i cant decide if i want jump over to tsubaki x kousei   ...or if i should stick to kaori x friend A  .    UGH!!!! this woulda been easier if tsubaki woulda just went for the other childhood friend but no0o.  i get the sense that kaori  actually DOES see kousei as a kid brother, and family brotherly type love.   tsubaki obviously wants kousei's D and her brotherly feelings have matured.
>> ARTICLE
Well fuck it, I'm gonna call it, Kaori isn't gonna fucking die ever, there's no terminal illness or anything, she's there for a medical reason, but it isn't something that gets you killed, there's way too many deathflags for that shit to be true.  
But I don't think that Kaori or Tsubaki will end dating Kousei, most fitting ending that I can see if Kaori doesn't die is that everyone parts ways, Kousei goes to his new school to follow his dream, Tsubaki goes to another highschool, Watari joins a football team and tries to go pro and Kaori does what she does best: join competitions just for the hell of it and fuck around with the judges.  
   
If Kaori dies, I'm gonna carry with me a black flag with "Death" written on it for a week to everywhere I go, I'll even shower with it. Also don't reply with spoilers saying if she dies or not in the manga, that shit doesn't work on the inbox and I'm gonna get spoiled ;_;
>> ARTICLE
AHHHHHHHH KIMIUSO TRUUUUUUUU
>> ARTICLE
I really like when they expand the show's perspective beyond just Arima and Kaori. It's easy to forget all these other characters still have lives and whatnot when everything gets too laser-focused. (I especially liked the scenes with Kashiwagi.) The scene on the beach was so good! I like that sorta subtle understated feel, though I really did not care for how they ended that scene. I think I'd have preferred if they cut straight to the credits instead of giving us another montage.
>> ARTICLE
Huh. It's quite rare when an anime manages to show genuine denial this believable.

Pfft, don't worry you guys, Kaori said she's only at the hospital for tests. Clearly she's going to be fine. Nothing is gonna happen to her. It's not like she's got a terminal disease or anything. And she definitely wasn't lying about all that. The title is only a title, doesn't have to mean anything. Death flags? What are you even talking about? I saw nothing. Nothing. Right...?
>> ARTICLE
I'm so glad that I started watching this
>> ARTICLE
Tsubaki is such a tear jerker of a character 
>> ARTICLE
The music background in 7-11 minutes (when Arima was in hospital) sounds like music from Canon or Clannad. Maybe i wrong, but it is very similar. Someone can find this song?

Oh lord. I'm sure this series is going to hurt me a lot. Although, I regret catching up because now I have to wait a whole week between episodes.

I really like how they used colours in this episode, Kaori is less colourful and vibrant than everyone else and its most likely because she's got a death flag bigger then Jupiter.

I loved watching Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso because at first, when I watched the first few episodes it was so cheerful, amazing and heartwarming. There was a smile at the end of each episode because I genuinely enjoyed it.

Now I'm just sad and melancholic after each episode not because it's bad, but it's heartwarming, it's heartfelt and I don't know if I can take [this](http://i.imgur.com/d6H5Jli.jpg) anymore. I still have a small smile at the end but it's just me crying inside because of how good this anime is and how thorough each episode is. I can't take it anymore, it's just [deathflag](http://i.imgur.com/cJEfkHv.jpg) city. 

But you know what? [I'll surely be here next week] (http://i.imgur.com/dgrn7ti.jpg) (and I hope Kaori is their too). I think my face can be summed up by Tsubaki's crying in this episode's last frame.

Finally Tsubaki, took you long enough to at least realize it!  Damn does this show know how to do some damn good montages.  I have a feeling it's gonna be one hell of a ride towards the end :(
>> ARTICLE
God damn it. So many feels. I really disliked Tsubaki up until this episode. When it started I was pissed that the focus was going to be on her but man did they make it pay off in the end.

The flashbacks, the feet in the sand both times as kids and as teenagers, the way she REALLY cared about Kousei when he was in hell practicing the piano. (Scrub, scrub, scrub), omg so many feels.

Personal Death Flag Theory: At this point it's so heavy handed I'm leaning on two ideas. One, the authors are trying to desensitize us to her impending doom, or they're going to flip this somehow on us.

Either way, I'm not ready for the feels to come! Masterful show. Masterful writing, masterful characterization. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not that Tsubaki and Kousei make a bad combination... Its just that she can't inspire him in the way Kaori can. Tsubaki does not want "music to take Kousei away", but she was unable to make his world colorful again when he gave up on music.
>> ARTICLE
Tsubaki is denser than a black hole. At least she realized her own feelings for Kousei, which Kashiwagi-san figured out long ago. Kashiwagi-san confirmed best supporting character. Meanwhile, Kousei, faced with the obvious, *also* goes into denial as Kaori tells the weakest and most transparent lie ever.

I have zero interest in this love triangle. The show has telegraphed it from the start, and done nothing to draw me in to it.

But hey: good music.

In the last episode of the anime, Kousei sits alone in a darkened hall, lit by a single spotlight. As he plays to an audience of zero, he begins to glow and his hair turns blonde. Suddenly, from behind the curtain, his rival steps forth.

I'd say there are *too many* death flags for her to actually die. The writers are basically shouting "HEY LOOK GUISE! BEST GIRL IS TOTTAALLLY GOING TO DIE" only to be like "gotcha!" in order to play with our emotions while still giving us a happy ending.

I totally think this as well. She may have some disease that is supposed to be fatal but she will probably have some disney life saving tear cliche and everyone will be happy.

In me there are two souls, alas, and their

Division tears my life in two.

One loves the world, it clutches her, it binds

Itself to her, clinging with furious lust;

The other longs to soar beyond the dust

Into the realm of high ancestral minds.

Are there no spirits moving in the air,

Ruling the region between earth and sky?

Come down then to me from your golden mists on high,

Give me a magic cloak to carry me

Away to some far place, some land untold,

And I'd not part with it for silk or gold

Or a king's crown, so precious it would be!

You know, the funniest thing that could happen, would be to Kousei actually die and not Kaori, and then the cycle would repeat. Kaori would see Kousei's ghost and she'd quit the violin until she met another guy just like Kousei and she'd start playing again.

It's really hard to find spoilers anyways. Manga isn't translated, there's no tvtropes page, the english wikipedia just cribs the myanimelist synopsis and the relevant wiki is stupidly barebones. Yes, I searched that hard. I did something similar for chaika, as two spoilers on TVtropes seemed to conflict with each other. I ended up going to the Japanese wikipedia and machine translating it to find a third spoiler to disprove one of them, as nowhere else had anything solid to sort things out.

Woah I never noticed they spell Kaori's name , I assumed it was spelled . From the little Japanese I know,  is mainly used as a grammar device.

I've only been studying Japanese for 6 weeks, but I've never even seen  let along  (my keyboard can't even reproduce this character) used. Is  pronounced like , and is  pronounced like ?
>> ARTICLE
 (wo) is the katakana version of  (wo) (both usually pronounced as o), which is actually included in the standard katakana set, it's just incredibly rare because even  is just used as a grammar function 99% of the time. Probably only a few random foreign names use it, I'd guess. I've never really seen it used in anything else.

 is "we", and is archaic, typically absent from standard kana charts. In this context it is pronounced the same as  (e), though it can be  (we) as well. So in the case of Evangelion, it is pronounced exactly the same as the older title, because the "w" sounds of both kana are dropped. It also has a hiragana counterpart too, .

/, along with the other nearly-obsolete characters / (wi), are apparently only used when phonetically rendering certain Okinawan dialects and the nearly-dead Ainu language, just going off of what Wikipedia says.

### Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso's Classical Performances.  

---

These posts will provide some historical and structural background to the pieces performed in each episode and will also look into what these pieces tell us about the characters themselves.

---

## Previous Classical Performances Write-ups:

*  [Episode 01](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2is8kh/spoilers_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_episode_1/cl5bxme)

## Episode 03 List of Classical Performances:

This week we get two classical performances: The first takes place during Kaoris and ~~Friend As~~ Kouseis ~~date~~ get together at the beginning of the episode.  The second one occurs during the Second Round of the preliminaries of the Violin Competition, and it's identity is a little mysterious to me (I will update this post once I figure it out)

I will **not** write up anything on [Saint-Sans' *Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso* (as interpreted by Joshua Bell)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmvEdfNYsEg) this week; it will be saved for next week when we hear Kaori's and Kousei's rendition. 

**EDIT**: I updated this post with information on the second piece that was performed during the second round of the violin competition preliminaries.

---

**Mozart: 12 variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman" KV 265/300e - Variation I** - At first, I was like...we're listening to twinkle, twinkle little star?  How is that a classical piece?!  Then I recalled that Mozart composed variations on this familiar tune. This familiar tune comes from the French folk song ["Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFvzPWXHrSU) (from 0:05 to 2:00), which first appeared in 1761 (and this tune has been used for many familiar children songs, such as "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star", "Baa, Baa, Black Sheep", and the "Alphabet Song" [*Ahh...so that's why it sounded so familiar...*]).  Mozart composed these 12 variations when he was about 25 years old.  These variations were first thought to have been composed in 1778, when Mozart resided in Paris from April to November that year, the assumption being that the melody of a French song could only have been picked up by Mozart while residing in France. For this presumed composition date, the composition was renumbered from KV 265 to KV 300e in the chronological catalog of Mozart's compositions (see *aside* below). Later analysis of Mozart's manuscript of the composition by Wolfgang Plath rather indicated 1781/1782 as the probable composition date.

[You can listen to the piece in its entirety here (as played by rising-star Czech pianist Natalie Schwamova).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezvj-De6bxY) [You can also find the score here (it's in the public domain, so no worries about copyrights. XD)](http://dme.mozarteum.at/DME/nma/nma_cont.php?vsep=199&gen=edition&l=1&p1=49)

(*Aside*: Ludwig von Kchel originally created a chronological catalog of all of Mozart's compositions in 1862 titled *Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichnis smmtlicher Tonwerke W. A. Mozarts* (translated: Chronological-thematic Catalog of the Complete Musical Works of W. A. Mozart; more commonly known as the *Kchel-Verzeichnis* or KV for short).  The part that made cataloging Mozart's pieces challenging was the fact that the composition dates on pieces written before 1784 were estimated.  In the original catalog, these 12 variations were identified to be Mozart's 265th composition.  However, since Kchel's work, many more pieces have been found, re-attributed and re-dated, requiring three catalog revisions.  In 1964, the sixth edition of revisions to KV cataloged this work of Mozart's as 300e.)

~~(I'm still trying to figure out the piece that the first competitor played during the second round of the preliminaries. I will update this part once I figure it out.)~~ (I feel retarded for not realizing it sooner...future note to self: since the second round piece chosen by Kaori is by Saint-Sans, it should follow that the other contestants will most likely play pieces by the *same* composer.... XD)

**Saint-Sans: Violin Sonata No. 1 in D Minor, Op. 75, 1st Movement** - "Early on, Saint-Sans adopted an aesthetic that eerily presaged Stravinskys assertion that music can express nothing, that its "meaning" lies exclusively within its formal self. Saint-Sans, orphaned early and brought up by uncaring relatives, never married, nor even achieved much intimacy with his fellow human beings. To a degree, his aesthetic derived from the barrenness of his personal life, though in its rejection of the expressive potential of music, he was also reacting in French fashion to the excesses of German Romanticism. 

But whatever his psychological damage, he was a consummately gifted musician with talent and intelligence in many fields. An esteemed pianist and composer of great formal ingenuity, he wrote with facility in all genres from grand opera to solo recital pieces and virtually everything else in between. Chamber music figures prominently in his output, including the Violin Sonata No. 1 in D minor, one of five Saint-Sans wrote for the combination of violin and piano. 

The sonata consists of two distinct parts, each with two movements linked by a transition. The Allegro agitato bears two themes, the first an anxious tune alternating between 6/8 and 9/8, and the second a lyrical, somewhat bucolic melody over a stern bass line. The Adagio opens with a song-like gesture that left to its own devices could have lapsed into sentimentality, but the canny composer leavens matters with a playful section buoyed by virtuosic trills and runs. A graceful and carefree Allegretto moderato serves as third movement and first half of the second part of the work. A single theme grows out of a sequence of irregular phrases before yielding to a peaceful dialogue between the two instruments. A series of warm and expressive chords lead to the dance-like finale, which uses several themes heard previously. The exuberance and brilliance of this movement is in well-planned contrast to the circumspect demeanor that characterizes much of the sonata." [(Source for block quote.)](http://www.seattlesymphony.org/symphony/buy/single/programnotes.aspx?id=10814)

This is what the Los Angeles Philharmonic's Music Database had to say about Saint-Sans and this work:

"A genuine prodigy of wide-ranging talent and interests, Saint-Sans composed in almost every form and medium then imaginable. His First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, after Saint-Sans had already composed his three violin concertos. It was also the year before his popular "Organ" Symphony in C minor, a work with which it shares many characteristics. In this Sonata (as in the "Organ" Symphony) Saint-Sans took the standard four movements, such as are found in Beethoven's "Spring" Sonata, merged them into two pairs, and unified the whole with cyclic thematic recurrences. (And like Beethoven, Saint-Sans played the piano part in the premiere of his Sonata.)

The opening Allegro half of the first movement is a poised sonata form, the second theme of which - first heard in the violin against rustling arpeggios in the piano - is the one that recurs most frequently and conspicuously. (This Sonata, and this second theme particularly, was a favorite of Marcel Proust and inspired the fictive sonata by Vinteuil in * la recherche du Temps perdu*.) A quiet interlude connects this with a dreamy song, serving as the Sonata's slow movement. The two parts of the second movement form the scherzo (here a fleet waltz) and a brilliantly virtuosic rondo finale."

This week, we see that Arima has a weakness to ~~Kaori's peer pressure~~ children.  Kaori learns from Kousei that he quit piano because he can't hear it when he's focused on what he's playing (explaining why he suddenly stopped playing with the children at the cafe) and this is something that he considers to be his *punishment*.  Why does he think this is a punishment? [That will be revealed in the future](/s "during his first piano competition in two years (yes, that's right...he's going to be in a piano competition soon...because Kaori signed him up for it (after the events of next week's episode); also, the way she picked the pieces he would perform for the competition was pretty amusing as well).")  

Before reading the manga, I wasn't all that familiar with Camille Saint-Sans' work except for his *Le carnaval des animaux* (Carnival of the Animals; [my favorite is **Le Cygne** (the Swan), by the way);](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB-4YeeiFw4) however, after listening to the *Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso* in full, I realized how that piece was perfect for both Kousei and Kaori to play.  I will elaborate on why in next week's post. :)

The background behind "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and Mozart is interesting. Thanks for making that clearer! :)
>> ARTICLE
Yay, now I'll be ahead a bit in my music history class.

I'm assuming you're classically trained. What do you play?

And for anyone else reading, Camille Saint-Sans also wrote an [excellent piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyknBTm_YyM) that I'm sure depicts the dead having a merry-good time. His music is really interesting. Aside from Carnival of the Animals, this is the only piece by Saint-Sans I'm familiar with.

Is it weird for me to enjoy this more than any of the show this season? 

With each episode, I'm falling more and more in love with the show. Heck, everything is outstanding(I haven't seen any musical show this good since Kids on the slope), from the music, art-style(pretty much stay true to the original art), atmosphere build up, to the character development and interactions, they're just beautiful and very pleasant to watch. Each episode just feels like a 5 minute of joy for me, I guess time goes fast when you enjoy something ... 

And I really like the OP by Goosehouse, they did a fantastic job in Silver Spoon, just can't get enough of them xD. 
>> ARTICLE
The OP is amazing. I had it on loop all day at work following the first episode. I can't wait for the soundtrack to come out.
>> ARTICLE
If you like good musical shows let me suggest Nodame Cantabile in case you haven't seen it yet. It's absolutely brilliant and my top music anime.
>> ARTICLE
Ao Haru Ride was my favorite last season, and this one is my favorite this season. Guess I'm figuring out that calming romance/drama shows are my favorite.

If I wish the did one thing differently, it's that they don't have as much silliness. I like some of it, similar to how they did it in Ao Haru Ride, but this episode seemed a bit heavy in the tsundere and other silly things. It's not bad, it's just different than what I was led on to believe (based on how the last two episodes turned out). But yeah, definitely one of my favorite show this season. And outside of Psycho Pass, I don't even see any that are close.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah honestly, everything from art to theme is absolutely fantastic, I heavily doubt anything is going to leave a better impression on me this season.

I literally only have one complaint with this show, which is that the main characters look and behave like AT LEAST 16 year olds and also posess the same emotional and intellectual complexity. I know not all 13 year olds are dumb and simple, but lets be honest, the show would be way more believable if they were high schoolers or even older. 

This also kind of broke the immersion for me, which is why I told myself I'm just going to pretend that the characters are 16-18 since the second episode.
>> ARTICLE
I keep forgetting they're supposed to be in middle school.
>> ARTICLE
That scene on the roof when he stepped from the shade into the light to face get was such a powerful moment. 

I almost wish this would go over no one's head because that bit, was a very subtle symbolic moment! 
>> ARTICLE
It's not weird at all. This show is beautiful and it's story progresses in such a natural feeling way. This one is competing to be the top one for me, I have four I can't choose between but this one is up there for sure.
>> ARTICLE
What are the other ones?  I'm only watching UBW and this show right now.
>> ARTICLE
The one's rated as 10/10 on my list are all my favorites that I can't decide between. Those would be; Amagi Brilliant Park, Trinity Seven, Parasyte and this one.

EDIT: Am I really getting downvoted over an opinion?
>> ARTICLE
> Amagi Brilliant Park, Trinity Seven
> 10/10

I think theres the main reason for your downvotes, even if they arnt justified

>> ARTICLE
I forgot reddit likes to downvote opinions.
>> ARTICLE
Can I ask why you enjoy Trinity Seven so much? It's just so riddled with cliche comedy, story, and characterization elements that I can't think of it anything better than a 6/10 max.
>> ARTICLE
> It's just so riddled with cliche comedy, story, and characterization elements

I guess that's why I like it. Levi's character, MC and just all of them. They are all cliched and not cliched at the same time and I love it so much, I love the stupid overly sexual humor that Levi throws out and how all the characters react.

The problem I'm seeing in this sub is everyone thinks the show has to have some amazing story, with defining characters that break a cliche and that stand out above anything they've ever seen. People here don't realize some people just enjoy the living shit out of a show like Trinity Seven. I don't usually like Harems outside of Toradora and maybe another one or two that I can't remember but this seasons harems are so entertaining.

Grisaia is very enjoyable, I think I have it at a 8-9 because I enjoy it. Trinity Seven is something I just fell in love with. I'm aware that it's a harem with a bunch of ecchi but I love it for that. I love everything about it. 

Yeah a show like Cowboy Bebop or Parasyte or Evangelion hell even Claymore, they all are "better" by a critical standpoint. But I don't over analyze the shows I watch, that's tedious and job like. I watch anime to laugh my ass off or get invested emotionally in a show and to help escape all the shit I had to do during the day. So if a show can make me look forward to it, make me laugh, get invested, forget about my day, it's going to be ranked high, even a ten.

TL;DR: If I enjoy the shit out of a show, even if it's cliche, it's going to get a ten.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I guess you're immune to becoming jaded, then. I'm pretty envious.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if jaded is the word I'd use, since that's more being bored after having to much which is what happens when I game a lot.

I think I'm less (I don't mean this in a bad or negative way) pretentious about how I rate my anime. It seems that most people here like to analyze it a lot and I admit I do that for a few shows like Gurren Lagann which as you can see on my list is a 3. It's not a bad way to rate, and it's the best way to rate especially from a reviewers/professionals standpoint.

My ratings for shows change as time goes on as well, I think I used to have SAO at a 9 before I kind of sat on it and thought about it and now it's a 7. Most of the shows on my "has already watched" part have dropped around 2 points. When you're watching something you're caught up in it and you become overly positive towards it. My 10's will likely drop to 9's but they might not, I'll just have to see how I feel a month or so after the shows air.
>> ARTICLE
To be more on-topic, when I meant jaded I meant strictly in terms of anime. Most anime like Trinity Seven just feel so derivative and "done before" that I can't enjoy it as much as other anime. This is what I mean by Trinity Seven being cliche. It doesn't really do anything praise-worthy, it seems more like an anime made to simply be an anime. It doesn't have the "soul" that an anime should have, I guess. That's how I feel about most anime these days. It seems like there are only five or six shows that don't fall into that category every season to me.
>> ARTICLE
Well if you look at MAL you'll see I'm not experienced but I don't think I'd be jaded towards it even if I was. It's just so damn enjoyable and I get really excited every time there's a new episode and I make my big "Fallen_Glory pointlessly talks about Trinity Seven" post in the discussion. 
>> ARTICLE
Haha, and I don't think pretentious is the word I'd use, either.

Maaaan, how did you not enjoy Gurren Lagann? That's nuts. Trinity Seven gets a 10 and Gurren Lagann a three. Your taste in anime is definitely not the norm, that's for sure. Not that that's bad, it's just very peculiar coming from someone who mostly agrees with the ratings the median watcher gives shows on MAL.

I think the biggest outlier I have in terms of that though is Monster. I gave that a 7/10 because I didn't feel like it needed to be 60+ episodes long, among other things. It was definitely an achievement, and I enjoyed what it had to offer, but the story and the characters didn't really resonate in a consistent manner, personally speaking.

edit: Now that I think about it more, I also don't think FMA deserves the #1 spot on MAL either.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, it's BECAUSE I analyzed it haha. *Spoilers incoming if someone else is reading this* 

That timeskip was stupid, the fact that everything was solved through MANLINESS RAAAAAGGGHGHHHHHHH was annoying and they didn't explain shit that should've been explained during the time skip. It just fell through for me I guess.

My rating for "has already watching" is actually 0.00 deviant, which obviously means I'm perfectly average. The reason why is because I have that weird taste though, I rate some shows far higher and some far lower which averages out in the end. 

The real test for me is coming after I finish Haruhi and Durararararararararararararararararararararararararararara because I'm going to be watching Naruto+Shippuden and actually going to form an opinion on it and critically analyze it. I've always said the show was shit even though I enjoyed the first 100 or so episodes I watched when I was 10-11. I want to form my own opinion on it before I end up not having time due to college next year.

FMA was good but not #1 good imo, people liked it that much though.
>> ARTICLE
You have 4 10/10s in a single season? How are you going to rate your favourite show of all time then?
>> ARTICLE
I don't even know anymore. I love all of these shows to death and this season is just amazing on every level for me. NGE+Clannad are my favorites but these four are all perfect in their own regards and I think they are up there with my top two.
>> ARTICLE
Do you actually think they are perfect though? I mean if you rate them 10/10 you are implying that nothing could ever be made that you would is better.

Also there have only been 3 episodes of those shows. It's kind of hard to rate something 10/10 only knowing the beginning, since 10/10 pretty much means it's a masterpiece with a flawless storyline from beginning to end.

Ofc you can rate your shit however you want, I'm just saying.
>> ARTICLE
MAL defines 10 as Masterpiece, which certainly doesn't require a show to be perfect. 
>> ARTICLE
To me yes. Other people can pick them apart and critique them but I have enjoyed all four of these shows to a point where I can hold them in my 10/10 spot. 

Every show can be improved, it doesn't matter what show it is, it can be improved. My ratings may change and they may drop as the season goes on but so far, I have enjoyed these shows to the point where I consider them 10/10.

I don't rate shows based entirely on being flawless. I'd rate NGE around a 7 if that were the case because there are flaws all over it. But I enjoyed it and I loved the universe around it so much that I gave it a 10. I try and rate based on entertainment provided and how much I enjoy something. If a show can hold my attention and entertain the shit out of me, it's going to get a higher rating than a show that might be perfect in every regard but that bores me to hell.

A good example is Watamote, it's a good show, has alright animation, the VA is great but good lord it was so boring I could barely get through it so I gave it a 3.
>> ARTICLE
I have this way of rating stuff too. Sadly I have way too many 10/10 cause I love pretty much all shows that I finish. And I know that I am never gonna be critic... that is not job for me. I am way too overjoyed by anime to be critical.
>> ARTICLE
It's not sad at all, you find enjoyment which is what it's about! You don't need to deeply analyze anime and only have 1 or 2 at the top. If you enjoyed it and it passed the time rate it at ten if you want! I could easily critique all of the anime I watch down to a 6 or lower, but where is the fun in that, then it becomes tedious and job like. 
>> ARTICLE
While I absolutely disagree that things like Amagi Brilliant Park is a 10/10, you're completely wrong in saying that if he rates it as such then he's somehow saying it's completely perfect, absolutely flawless, and can never be surpassed. That is not why 10/10 exists.

Perhaps if he were correcting a maths exam where there were 10 problems, you would be correct.

When critiquing a piece of entertainment media, 10/10, for me, is a film/show/game/album that is enthralling from beginning to end that shows me something I've never seen before, or something I've seen before in a whole new light.

If you consider it any other way, the 10 point scale doesn't make sense, since nothing can ever technically be perfect. The only way it can ever make sense is if you treat awarding a show a 10 as a way of saying:

"This is so amazing that, for me, in this type of story, it's as close to being perfect as you can get...even though art can never be perfect!"
>> ARTICLE
I wish every show I came across was somehow 10/10 to me.

I wouldn't even care what anyone else thought of my rating system.
>> ARTICLE
Psycho Pass 2
>> ARTICLE
The others come to my mind are Shingeki no Bahamut, Parasyte, Log Horizon2 (beside UBW), which make my top 5 xD.

Ofc there are other shows worth to mention such as Madan no Ou to Vanadis, Grisaia no Kajitsu, Amagi Park and so on but I just enjoy those(my top 5) the most.
>> ARTICLE
That's weird...you named all of the shows I'm watch this season, pretty much exactly. Other than SAO2 and Akame Ga Kill, but they're technically last season's shows.

Edit: Actually, I'm also watching Psycho-Pass 2, Nanatsu No Taizai, Yowamushi Pedal: Grande Road, Mushishi Zoku Shou 2 and I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying. I guess I'm just watching almost everything that's on. I'm loving everything I'm watching though, more or less.

[Man, Kaori can get angry!](http://imgur.com/1XgSbIh)

[Master of the violin and karate, it seems.](http://imgur.com/PaKJg8k)

Kousei is starting to see some color. While he is afraid of what may come, Kaori has his back through the good and the bad.

The most important scene this time was something somewhat subtle: Kaori presumably stopping off at the local hospital. Who could it be for? My guess is [Speculation](/s "for herself. During her rooftop talk with Kousei, she says that as a musician it is their jobs to 'live through the hearts of people,' or something to that effect. So, my guess is that she has some type of terrible illness, such as cancer. This is why she acts extremely cheerful, doesn't care about winning awards, and wants to play with one of the best musicians of her generation. Because she wants to experience everything left that life has to offer.") I could be wrong, but that's my hunch for now until we get more information.

Three episode rule verdict: must watch. Probably in my top three for this season, the show is beautiful in both presentation and music, the characters are interesting, and the story should be very emotional when all is said and done.

I have Hunter x Hunter and Gintama on my queue as well as the Fate series so that alone means I'm only making gauruntees to finish in the decade. Besides, chances are Problem Children and Maoyu is coming back after this show ends and I want to finish that. And then there's gonna be new stuff that is gonna be good.

I hope heaven has good fansubs or Crunchyroll and Funimation subscriptions.

Didnt expect this show to be so [heavy](http://imgur.com/zRZTq2f) at episode 3 though, seriously the music playing in the background really helped to convey their feelings and monologues, cant wait for the OST to come out.

He's already done it twice now. People are assholes, they think they are funny or cool for spoiling it for others who are invested. We can't do anything about people with the mental capacity of a two year old but downvote and report them unfortunately. 

EDIT: Even if it is true, don't care about it. Honestly I knew it would be something to do with his spoiler right when [Your Lie in April Episode 3](/s "I saw her go to the hospital.") But that should not change you enjoying this show, it's a beautiful show, moving enough to make me want to pick up my instrument I put down two years ago. Keep watching and enjoying it, even if it's spoiled there is still a lot of stuff I'm sure!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that scene hinted there would be some tragedy ahead, though there was no way of knowing then they were planning on going all out. What set it in stone was [Your Lie in April Episode 3](/s "the whole monologue at the end. Notice the abundance of death flags! "I'm going to play *as long as I have a chance* to play. I'm going to play with everything I've got. So that people who've heard me will *never forget me*. So that I can *live in their hearts forever*. That's *my reason for existing*....Please support me in this moment that *I'm about to lose heart*." And then she broke down.") Do we need any more confirmation?

I honestly missed that scene and cannot find it. Could someone tell me the time? I'd appreciate it. 
>> ARTICLE
My guess is some kind of debilitating disease or degenerative disease like Huntington's or Parkinson's. While there are no cures, there are treatments and drug trials to stop or slow down the symptoms like the shaking (which we saw in the previous episode, but it's entirely possible she was angry or just a reaction to the adrenaline from playing in the competition).

I've fallen in love with this show so far. After reading the manga I was further convinced that this would be added to my list of favorite Anime's of all time.    
The character interactions are great and the story itself progresses like your typical shounen sports anime. Instead of spending an entire arc breaking down an individual game, you're greeted with a performance instead.    
Add in some characters with personality and a bit of romance and you've got me sold. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been listening to this anime's opening none-stop. I can't say much besides I"m happy the show hasn't taken a dive at all and we get to see MC play the piano for real next episode.

I can't wait for the full version of the OP to come out in a few weeks.

Yo, wait, [**this show is 2-cour?**](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1278867) Hell *yeah!*

---

Uh oh... Guys... I'm starting to get *dem ol' feels* again.

I'm more interested in seeing how he develops, but I feel like Kousei's gonna be stuck in the *lackey/friend-zone* for the majority of this show. Like I said, I'm sort of alright with that because I wanna see him re-develop his love for music more than anything, but I'm afraid of it becoming a source of frustration. Depends on how the show progresses and portrays their relationship.
>> ARTICLE
thats great, it will get past where the manga is currently translated to. Hmmn to stop reading the manga and wait for the anime or not. Having sound in a music based series is always a huge plus
>> ARTICLE
Q: Whatdoes 2-cour mean?
>> ARTICLE
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cour#English

> From Japanese  (kuuru), from French cours. Attested in English among the anime community from at least 2007.

> 1. a three-month unit of television broadcasting

> 2. a portion of a television program aired over the course of one such period

Japanese anime is generally produced in units called "cours", so a 2-cour anime would be 22-26 episodes. Think of it as correlating to the four real-world seasons in a year.
>> ARTICLE
Basically goes on for 2 seasons (24ish episodes) instead of 1 (12ish episodes).
>> ARTICLE
That u r basic
>> ARTICLE
Two seasons. (Each season is ~11-13 episodes long so this one will go for 22-26 episodes)
>> ARTICLE
What about split cour?
>> ARTICLE
It is where a series of two, or more, cour length is split over multiple seasons alternating whether it is airing or not.

Most of the time it just airs for a total of two seasons, but for the first time there is a series that is going to do split cour for a total of three seasons' worth of episode. (It will take five seasons to complete) It is the new Durarara anime that is doing this. 
>> ARTICLE
Never heard of it. But isn't UBW split cour as well?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but that is only two seasons worth of episodes. (1 on, 1 off, 1 on)
>> ARTICLE
Oh okay. Kind of like Aldnoah.Zero and Tokyo Ghoul.
>> ARTICLE
I hope this means we'll get a real ending instead of 'go read the manga!' ending. Maybe they'll pull a FMA:BH and end the manga and anime at the same time.
>> ARTICLE
Yo is the show actually confirmed 2-cour? Dont fuck with me like that please

***There is some asshole who made an account just to post a spoiler that totally ruined the show for me, don't make my mistake, I already downvoted him.*** EDIT: Seems his comment has been deleted be wary though, some dude ruined Parasyte for a lot of people yesterday and I bet you there will be more.

I'm really enjoying this art style, and obviously the OST. I'll probably update this as stuff happens like I do in Trinity Seven and Parasyte. **This thing is going to have major spoilers do be careful while reading it.**


The OP is pretty good as well, not Parasyte or Trinity Seven level but I like it, it fits really well.

I believe this is what they call ["peer pressure".](http://i.imgur.com/82OO1CR.png)

And he snapped, I'm really hoping this girl can get him to play again but his negative memories are going to be hard to get over. This show is going to be sad and interesting as it goes on.

You guys, this art style is so beautiful. This music is so beautiful. These scenes are so beautiful. The narrative is so beautiful. This show is honestly one of the most beautiful things I've seen in a while.

Ah good she's making him play. Hopefully he will make good memories.

Another amazing episode that introduces a few things that seem like major foreshadowing. Like I said above, I love everything about this show, it's all so perfect to me. It's made me decide to start playing clarinet again, just, a beautiful show. I'm glad I decided to pick this one up.
>> ARTICLE
:( I wanted more music this episode :P
Next week looks to be great though.
>> ARTICLE
**A short summary:** *A young boy finally succumbs to peer pressure after days of violence and threatening, ditching school to steal bikes and break traffic laws.* 

The moral of this story is peer pressure always pays off!

In all seriousness, this series is pretty freaking good! It's got a nice balance of both comedy and drama and has a lot of room to spread its wing in both directions. The premise is also original enough to get behind. My one peeve is that the characters speak too... beautifully. No middle-schooler talks like that and it often makes the dialogue feel unnatural.

I think this may be AotS.  UBW is amazing but this feels so fresh and original.  The scanlators need to get on this manga, its 30 chapters behind the releases.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah UBW is a cinematic masterpiece, but story wise there hasn't been much progress and won't be for a couple more episodes until UBW route starts officially. This and Bahamut on the other hand established themselves from scratch and have already proved themselves in just three episodes, without either the hype or the budget of UBW or Grisaia to go around. 
>> ARTICLE
[Speculation](/s "Now I believe that the name of the show is derived from a musical piece that Kousei writes for Kaori after she dies. Her enthusiasm in the face of whatever illness or issue she has is her lie in the springtime of their youth. Final episode has him performing at a concert by himself and playing Your Lie in April rather than the set piece.") Not sure how much merit this has, but I'm ready to go on the feel trip.
>> ARTICLE
If you're right this could be damn beautiful, if it's executed well.

I can feel the tears coming, if this actually happens I will be bawling

I almost did already, just thinking about it.

I literally rushed home and ran the last ten minutes to come watch this show!

I can relate so much, it's scary. 

I love this anime.

Only a few seconds in and I get to see [this](http://imgur.com/8Vs2mby) adorable face.

And [another](http://imgur.com/qpjEqlD) one.

Now she's singing in english. That is just... HNNNNGGGGG.

Alright just got done with the episode. So much screen time for Kaori and damn was it good and slowed down the pacing for some much needed interaction.

The two got some good development and it seems like we will finally [](/s "see them play side by side") next episode. 

The show so far has been amazing: the art, the soundtrack, the drama and the comedy. Hopefully this doesn't lose quality as it goes on.

I'm loving this show, give me more NOW. D=
>> ARTICLE
I really didn't like her this episode. It's quite clear our MC is suffering from a mental illness he should probably be seeing a professional about, but she quite selfishly doesn't give a fuck. At the end, it seemed to me like she was trying to guilt-trip MC into agreeing to accompany her because she's doubting herself, and wants to be able to blame someone else if she falls from grace in her own mind. "It's not my fault I'm exactly like he is, it's his for not helping me when he clearly not only didn't want to, but was entirely mentally medically incapable of doing so." I know some people will see this as her trying to break him out of his shell, and while I found her disregard for his mental illness troubling, her crying and saying basically "Help me, I'm about to lose hope in myself" at the end really made me dislike her for her actions. This isn't how I feel he should be "breaking out of his shell," I feel it's something he needed to do on his own terms, and that they could have very well led into that.
>> ARTICLE
I always feel like my opinions on this show are in the minority... I have to agree with you on that. Made for some good humor at times, but it didn't feel like a very natural development - she just harassed/guilt-tripped him into being her accompanist. Her persistence is not the problem on its own, but the fact that she basically emotionally manipulated him (whether she meant to or not) did not sit well with me.
>> ARTICLE
I love everything about this show. The animation style, comedy, drama, romance, and the music. Honestly if this show keeps up the quality it will be my anime of the year/season. I have no faults with any of it. The little animation "faults" in the second episode can't even hinder the over quality of this anime to me.
>> ARTICLE
Is this show for real? Not 3 episodes in and it has already made me cry, a grown ass man, EACH FUCKING EPISODE.

The art style and animation are ridiculously good, but the soul this show has is like little I've seen before.
>> ARTICLE
Twinkre Twinkre little star indeed. 
>> ARTICLE
Why am I having bad feeling from combination of her stopping on hospital stop and saying that she wants people to remember her forever. Anime pls. Dont do this. I have weak heart for this. 
>> ARTICLE
Its interesting that I found Kaori to be far less grating in the manga than what shes been shown as in the anime. I didnt mind her character at all in the manga, but so far in the anime she kind of comes off weird.

Still, solid episode as usual, the adaptation is doing pretty well so far
>> ARTICLE
I'm really enjoying this show but this episode was kinda so-so, I think there was just too much comedy as well as abuse from Kaori.  The show is at its best when it is serious, at least in my opinion, and some comedy is fine to keep things light and not melodramatic but I feel like some of the comedy took away from the maturity of the show.

Still a solid episode and will be looking forward to the rest of it, its my frontrunner for AotS so far.

Eh. I'm liking the comedy more than the drama, which is mostly predictable and a bit clich. I seem to be in the minority on that, though.
>> ARTICLE
Next episode will up for it. 
>> ARTICLE
I find it unrealistic to be a bitch to someone going through hard times. Kaori ruins the dramatic moment with her attitude and the way she treats Kousei. For someone on the outside it is pretty clear that Kousei can't play due to more then just "I don't want to," and the fact that she doesn't try to learn what that something is makes a little dislikable. Kousei should have agreed to accompanying her becase he wanted to not because she got angry and then played the guilt card.  
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I wouldn't have minded if she made some attempt to really understand what Kousei was going through; instead, she just harasses him all week (which at least makes for good comedy)... And then she guilt-trips him (intentionally or not) by crying in front of him.

I might want to watch Nodame Cantabile after this... but the art style of it doesn't seem to fit well with me(I watched a snippet of it on Youtube about a week ago). Maybe a couple of episodes will help me break into it.

So is "the lie" going to be that Arima does play the piano despite his protestations or will it turn out to be something else?
>> ARTICLE
My guess is that it has something to do with her stop at the hospital. 

She acts happy and healthy, but I bet the reason is because she doesn't have much time left. Maybe that's why she wants to live on in people's hearts forever through music. 

That would be a bit too predictable, so I'm hope I'm wrong.

I mean, it's been pretty predictable so far, so I wouldn't be that surprised. It would be nice for it to break from the mold, though.

While I think Trinity Seven has a better overall soundtrack, the OP for this show is one of the best I've ever seen. Like GuiltyCrown/KLK teir good.

Quick Edit: I would give my left nut for an OST of just all the music from this season. Seriously, some of the music this season has been top freaking tier. Between this, World Trigger, Trinity Seven, ABP and F/SN oh bby.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why this is so good. It's basically something like [Sweet November](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230838/) with musical performances.

The female lead in that film, and Kaori, are both examples of the [Manic Pixie Dream Girl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl), but it doesn't matter too much because she still seems like she has a good bit of character depth. I like her reactions to Kousei, and how she keeps on scolding him for his self-pity, presumably because she has personal problems of her own, but is doing her best regardless.

It's hard to decide whose lie is worse, hers for putting on what I'm assuming is a mask to pretend she's happy/bubbly/carefree, or him making excuses for why he can't play the piano anymore.

Holy hell is this show heartwarming.  It's been so awesome so far that I'm really drawn into each episode and the characters.  I know a romance-geared show is done fucking awesomely when I'm bummed the episode is over.  Hopefully happiness comes to the MC over the course of the show, it'll be satisfying and fuzzy inside to watch if it does.

>> ARTICLE
Way Late to the party, only catching up on this series now, but I thought I caught the explanation for why the series title is "Your Lie in April" this episode?

When Kosei looks at Kaori, as in really look at her after their outing at the Cafe, he remarks that "She Exists in Spring". Which strikes me as both a summary of her character as well as possible foreshadowing.

"Existing in Spring" can mean she is the similar in the way that she is a force of renewal; something that comes along after a long and dark winter. Like where Kosei has been for 3 years. Symbolizing her with a Season like Spring could also mean that she will only be around for a time, which is the dark foreshadowing.

So "Your Lie in April" could mean being in that state of renewal and resting in it. Be it for a time only or from a certain starting point. This could reference both Kosei and Kaori, or more likely, their relationship.
>> ARTICLE
A fairly solid episode, I'm really [not feeling the CG](http://i.imgur.com/6RFcf1s.png), though.

I think I'm going to be depressed by this anime, it's pretty clear my [best girl](http://myanimelist.net/character/69409/Tsubaki_Sawabe) isn't going to end up with mc :( (She's shown crying in the freaking OPENING, for goodness' sake, and it's already pretty clear who the boy is falling for.)

The 'not being able to hear my own playing' plot aspect felt a little cheap, but there was wonderful music as always. 
>> ARTICLE
People like you man. 

It's obvious as fuck who he ends up with from the fucking pics of the show before it even aired. Why bother picking the obvious loser as best girl. She even admits in this episode (the fucking 3rd episode of the show) that she likes him like a sibling. 
>> ARTICLE
Did I say *your* best girl? Did I say the *shows* best girl? No, I don't think I did. Am I not allowed to have an opinion? 

[edit]: I *never* said I didn't like the show, or wouldn't like it because of this, merely said that I had a feeling that *my* best girl would probably not end up happy with MC by the end and that makes me sad (and I'm like 95% sure she probably does like him). I'm sorry that my character preferences annoy you, but it's not exactly something I control willingly. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh God, I'm getting Golden Time flashbacks...  The ol' onee-chan best girl romance is back again!!!!!

Tsubaki is Linda and Kousei is Banri... 

It doesn't help that I maratbkned Golden Time last week too...

Yeah, yesterday some asshole PM'd Parasyte spoilers that apparently only happen early on so it wasn't to bad. The one this dude said seems like it is going to ruin the show. I am not to happy right now, I don't see why people get a kick out of this.

I could ruin The Walking Dead at least a little bit from spoiling the comics to my friends but I hold off because I know they enjoy the show. I hate people some times.

This show is really shaping up to be one of the most promising shows of the season.  The music, characters and artwork is all amazing.

Except for [this](http://i.imgur.com/Bip6Mdd.jpg)...someone dropped the ball on this one.
>> ARTICLE
I just thought they were just doing that for fun. Like "Oh you like top notch animation, well hows this for a change!"
>> ARTICLE
This is probably the Mohawk dude's fault (in Shirobako).
>> ARTICLE
We're clearly making a tradeoff - a big one - to have a few of the musical scenes animated properly. The pianist in while Kaori was playing was rotoscoped, I think. That costs a lot. Overall, I think I'm okay with that.

>> ARTICLE
I would of been fine if it was quick, but they had to have that on for like a full minute.
Other than that I thought was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that the music sheets disappeared annoyed me more that the animation.
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling that they were metaphorical, rather than actually being there.
>> ARTICLE
Well, they had to save their budget somehow after that unlimited budget works with Kaori...
>> ARTICLE
Can't believe this [QUALITY](http://i.imgur.com/W7wry1r.jpg) lasted a whole minute. [Them lips](http://i.imgur.com/cCoSROa.png) & [Kaori stitches](http://imgur.com/a/2a6hf).
>> ARTICLE
They blew their budget this episode on the ~~Kaori~~ violin competition scenes; something had to give...XD
>> ARTICLE
True, they do have another 20 episodes to go through so I wonder where else they'll cut corners if it comes to it again.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing they'll continually cut corners when it's dialogue between the dudes, except for specific cases where they can show something useful. They'll pour all that into the music scenes, which I'm totally okay with.
>> ARTICLE
>I'm appointing you as his substitute

The f#ck?
>> ARTICLE
Why are you/people confused by this? Other dude was going to walk her home/she was waiting for him so they could walk home together. He isn't there. Therefore glasses piano dude will now be walking her home.


>> ARTICLE
Watari was going to walk someone called Keiko home, not Kaori. Kaori was waiting for Watari to come out so she could to surprise/scare him. Arima stalled her when she said she'd go look for Watari, presumably half because he doesn't want her to see Watari with another girl already, and half because he doesn't want her to go see Watari at all (but he probably doesn't realise this is partially the reason himself).
>> ARTICLE
Watari is going to walk Keiko home, but I seriously doubt Kaori knows that. Most likely, Kaori wanted to spend time with Watari in some form or another, not just scare him and then leave immediately. So Arima is the substitute that she'll spend time with instead.
>> ARTICLE
The guy I replied to said "other dude was going to walk her home", implying Watari planned to walk Kaori home, which wasn't the case. Obviously she wasn't going to turn up, go "BOO" and run away. I was explaining to this guy that there was more to it than "Watari isn't here. Arima will do."
>> ARTICLE
I interpreted that as he'll substitute him for walking her home, but I feel she has another reason to appoint him. She was very interested in his opinion on her piece.


A lot of the audience knew who he was, just walking in, after not playing for so many years, why would she, of all people in the classical music performance field, not recognize him? I have a feeling she's just teasing him with all that "Pervert!" nonsense.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder for what purpose. Was she going to have Warata listen to something but figured Arima would be fine too? Will they start playing together? I mean, the girl (woman) on stage had trouble keeping up with her, but I'm sure that Arima would do fine as a pianist.

Also since Kaori has the opposite ideas of how music is supposed to be played (Like his mother said it's not worth if if you don't win, whereas Kaori didn't think that was so important) from Arima's mother, maybe that's the thing that will get him to play piano again. I mean, the look in his eyes when she's playing says it all.
>> ARTICLE
That has nothing to do with the walking home thing. It was simply her being like "he can't walk me home so you can."
>> ARTICLE
Damn man, it's like you took the words out my mouth. I hope everything you said happens.
>> ARTICLE
The OP shows them playing together on stage, so.. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like that OP pretty much told us how the show will play out. Obviously she and Arima will end up getting together, the other (female) childhood friend is clearly in love with him as well (hence her crying in the OP), and... I'm not sure what role Watari will play since he's basically leading on every girl in the school.
>> ARTICLE
Well if we follow the chain of cliches, and that line he said in the music room, Im guessing he likes childhood friend who likes MC, who likes Violinist girl.
>> ARTICLE
Not totally sure, that sounds like a Ron and Hermione thing.  
>> ARTICLE
The way she asked for his opinion on her performance and how she practically dragged him into it makes me think that she knew who he was and wants to do something or another with regards to him, at least as a pianist.

They're also making it really simple for her to have a reason to leave the other guy, forgot his name, since he's seeing 500 girls at once.

This week, we get one classical performances courtesy of the violin competition (I had a write-up prepared for one more piece, but it looks like well have to wait to hear that piece towards the beginning of next weeks episode).

---

**Beethoven: Violin Sonata No. 9 in A ~~Major~~Minor, Op. 47 (Kreutzer), 1st Movement** - This violin sonata is known for its demanding violin part, unusual length (roughly 40 minutes long), and emotional scope:  The first movement is premoninantly furious, the second movement is meditative, and the third movement is joyous and exuberant.  It was originally dedicated to violinist George Bridgetower by Beethoven.  In 1803, Bridgetower visited Vienna and performed with Beethoven, leaving the genius impressed.  As a result, Beethoven decided to dedicate his Violin Sonata No. 9 to Bridgetower.  Beethoven originally subtitled Sonata 9, "*Sonata mulattica composta per il mulatto Brischdauer [Bridgetower], gran pazzo e compositore mulattico*," meaning "Mulatto Sonata composed for the mulatto Brischdauer, big wild mulatto composer."  During the debut of the piece on May 24th, 1803, Bridgetower was sight reading the second movement from Beethoven's copy over Beethoven's shoulder and made some bold, improvisational changes that were met with the fast approval of the composer.  Their friendship didn't last long, though. About a year after the debut performance, Beethoven and Bridgetower had a falling out over a woman.  Bridgetower apparently insulted a lovely female friend of Beethoven, and the two never reconciled.  Beethoven then rededicated the piece to Rodolphe Kreutzer, who was considered the finest violinist of the day.  Kreutzer, though, never performed the piece, considering it "outrageously unintelligible". He did not particularly care for any of Beethoven's music, and they only ever met once, briefly, in 1798.  Hence, this violin sonata was later given the nickname "Kreutzer" in honor of the dedicatee that never performed the piece. 

[In the original edition of the "Kreutzer" Sonata, Beethoven gave no key designation.](http://i.imgur.com/SqlDwCY.jpg)  Although the work is usually titled as being in A-major, the Austrian composer and music theoretician Gerhard Prsent has published articles indicating that the main key is in fact *A-minor*. Prsent has revealed interesting connections to the 6th violin sonata op.30/1, for which the third movement was originally composed, and he believes that the unusual opening bars for solo violin form a kind of transition from the earlier sonata (or from its structural material), supporting the belief that the acquisition of the finale of op.30/1 for the "Kreutzer" was a compositional intention  and not a result of lack of time, as long suspected.

This violin sonata has three movements, and takes about 43 minutes to perform (give or take a few minutes):

1. Adagio sostenuto - Presto - Adagio (~15 minutes)
2. Adante con variazioni (~18 minutes)
3. Presto (~10 minutes)

[Here is the entire "Kreutzer" Violin Sonata as interpreted by Oistrakh/Oborin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uPGz7NU-mk)

Wikipedia describes the structure of the Sonata as follows:

"The sonata opens with a slow 18-bar introduction, of which only the first four bars of the solo violin are in the A-Major-key. The piano enters, and the harmony begins to turn darker towards the minor key, until the main body of the movement  an angry A-minor Presto begins. Here, the piano part matches the violin's in terms of difficulty. Near the end, Beethoven brings back part of the opening Adagio, before closing the movement in an anguished coda.

There could hardly be a greater contrast with the second movement, a placid tune in F major followed by five distinctive variations. The first variation transliterates the theme into a lively triple meter while embellishing it with trills, while in the second the violin steals the melody and enlivens it even further. The third variation, in the minor, returns to a darker and more meditative state. The fourth recalls the first and second variations with its light, ornamental, and airy feel. The fifth and final variation, the longest, caps the movement with a slower and more dramatic feel, nevertheless returning to the carefree F major.

The calm is broken by a crashing A major chord in the piano, ushering in the virtuosic and exuberant third movement, a 6/8 tarantella in rondo form. After moving through a series of slightly contrasting episodes, the theme returns for the last time, and the work ends jubilantly in a rush of A major."

----------

Kaori, as a violinist, has a very intense side to her that one wouldn't expect at first.  Her interpretation of "Kreutzer" was bold and intense, and had a lot of emotion and passion (when compared to the piano performance Arima gave 2 years prior, or any other musician's performance this episode for that matter... XD).  Arima is taken back by her performance and states how this piece no longer belonged to Beethoven but instead was hers.  [It will be interesting to see in the future](/s "how her boldness and passion helps Arima get over his trauma.  Man tears shall be shed in the process, so prepare yourselves for some delicious feels. ;-)")

Please look forward to the next performances write up!

Bravo!!!!

Thanks very much for taking the time to make this/these post(s). I've always loved classical music, but as someone with little understanding of the fundamentals, it's difficult to get into because of it's complexity. I can't really tell anything about a piece other than whether or not I like it, but something like this is a nice source of information.
>> ARTICLE
U da real MVP /u/Mathemagician2TheMax 
>> ARTICLE
jeez i took music theory 5 years ago and apparently still retained a lot.

i want to get back more into making more complex music instead of just pop. but what does one do? theres too much i dont know. sigh
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure there are subreddits that could help you :)
>> ARTICLE
Wow that was my first time listening to an entire classical piece and i really enjoyed it. I took a break from studying for my midterm to watch the episode and then listened to this while i studied, it was awesome please keep doing this.
>> ARTICLE
I find it difficult to listen to even classical music while studying because I get too focused on and into the music :P
>> ARTICLE
If any of you gave the Oistrakh version a listen and thought it was boring compared to Kaori's rendition, two things to keep in mind:  
1. Kaori's recording used better equipment, with a little concert hall echo added in.  
2. Watching a moe girl do something often makes it more interesting.


>> ARTICLE
Funny. I thought the Oistrakh version was better, without the moe girl to distract me from the excellent music.
>> ARTICLE
If I had RES I would tag you as 'fellow music snob with good taste'.

imho, I don't know if Oistrakh's violin prefers deeper tones but he could have aimed for a more vibrant sound. Kaori's version was kinda flashy. Everyone's saying it was bold even though musically it was a standard performance.

So far my favorite is Joshua Bell's performance which someone linked in the [other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2jie9s/kaori_violin_performance_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso/clc1bj4). Although he's catering to modern tastes, it really helps that an amazing pianist played with him. I don't think this sonata can sound good unless the pianist is adventurous as well.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the link! I will have to check it out another time.

EDIT: Gave it a listen! I can definitely see the differences.
>> ARTICLE
Please keep doing these for every episode. Awesome write up.
>> ARTICLE
I made you all a 60fps WebM of the OP: http://a.pomf.se/vntdiv.webm
>> ARTICLE
The only issue I have with frame interpolation is getting used to the panning shots -- everything else looks great.  I think that's a common complaint with that though.

Definitely one of the best OPs this season, if not already my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
These look great, dude. Really appreciate you making them.
>> ARTICLE
I'm doing them to all the anime I'm watching this and future seasons
>> ARTICLE
Show is really good.

Ok Mr MC time to man up and show some ballz for duo. 

Also I hope this isn't next Glasslip.
>> ARTICLE
> Also I hope this isn't next Glasslip.

In the form of Girlfriend Beta we already have the next Glasslip, let's hope we won't have another Glasslip this season. Whatever, I personally doubt that this anime will be another Glasslip.

This post contains way to often the word Glasslip nonetheless this post is better written than the dialogs in Glasslip.
>> ARTICLE
Based on the settup I'm pretty sure this isn't going to be a "And then nothing happened", show.  The MC is stunted by a psychological trauma and those things don't go down easy. 

The girl is clearly going to be part of shocking him out of it, but she's not exactly trained so I don't expect it to be smooth sailing.
>> ARTICLE
You must be joking, this show has already entertained me more than the entire 13 episodes of Glasslip did. There's already a more defined sense of what kind of people the characters are. More characterisation for these guys in 2 episodes than the Glasslip characters had in a whole season.
>> ARTICLE
> Also I hope this isn't next Glasslip.

As a manga reader, I can tell you that there's no chance in hell that this will be the next Glasslip.
>> ARTICLE

>It won the award for Best Shnen Manga at the 37th Kodansha Manga Awards. It was nominated for the 5th Manga Taish.

Pretty sure it can't be that bad.
>> ARTICLE
What's up with Glasslip? I'm only one episode in. Another half-baked ending?
>> ARTICLE
No, the ending is perfect for the show.

Just watch it through. It picks up soon.
>> ARTICLE
You've seen one episode? Good. You can stop then because they're all the same and nothing happens.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I dropped it half way through but basically every episode makes you feel like something big is gonna happen. But then you get to the ending and realize nothing actually happened.
>> ARTICLE
You mean, carrying chickens around wasn't hype as fuck?

But yeah, I guess I'll drop it too
>> ARTICLE
>So you're saying that I just watched 13 episodes of "character development" being foreshadowed through... chickens...

This is basically what you'll get for finishing the series and looking at the discussion of the last episode on reddit.
>> ARTICLE
That performance gave me goosebumps.  
This anime is really good so far imo. Looking forward to Kaori and Kousei performing together!
>> ARTICLE
I just about teared up. That was a damn powerful scene in the second episode. I have a great feeling about any later moments - there's bound to be some tears involved in this one, boys.
>> ARTICLE
Can confirm goosebumps did appear on my skin too
>> ARTICLE
Hmm not sure about goosebumps but shiver down spine count?
>> ARTICLE
Goosebumps and spine-chills through out the entire episode, including the OP and ED. Thursdays have become my favourite day of the week now.
>> ARTICLE
That performance was amazing in literally every way.
>> ARTICLE
The animation during her performance was stunning, but its a shame the show has so many still frames and lack of faces during most of the episode. Oh well its still enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's because I actually know the field, but the bow strokes and vibrato were off from the music and that irked me really badly.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I noticed it too. Playing violin from 5th to 12th grade will do that to you :P

I mean, it looked like actual violin playing - but it didn't match the music.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that too, but I played violin in various orchestras for 14 years so maybe I'm overly critical. I've never seen violin animated accurately, and very rarely is it even portrayed accurately in live action film and television. I was impressed that they animated vibrato at all, but it definitely didn't match. Overall, it was an above average reproduction of violin performance, but it didn't wow me like it could have.
>> ARTICLE
I've never played the violin but I still noticed it. The entire scene felt off with the violin, especially since the speedier parts looked too slow and janky( the result of how few frames are drawn per second in most anime). Still a nice scene though.
>> ARTICLE
At the very least, whoever they used for the recording was pretty damn good. I wonder if it's original or cribbed from elsewhere, and if it's the latter, where they got it from.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't see the issue, those scenes aren't about the visuals anyway.
>> ARTICLE
absolutely agree...it's about *feel*
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I'll sacrifice some of the conversation moments to get more of that gorgeous animation from the performance scenes. Besides, I felt that the scene in the music room was fine. Were they well animated? No, not really, but the feel of the scene mattered more there and that's what got across.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. It was a cute chibi moment. At the very least, they try to make what are obviously budget cuts look like it was intended...
>> ARTICLE
Well you know, they don't really have unlimited budget like Ufot ....
>> ARTICLE
Kaori's performance was, unlike stated in the series, as per the score: the dynamics were in place, well phrased, good sound and perfect pitch. Only the tempo gets faster at 10:37-10:43 (to create the rush sensation and setup for the ensuing fermata (the stop), bar 164 ends just a bit prematurely (10:22) and the 10:02-10:03 end of phrase ritardando (not in the score, although very commonly used to end a part and return to the main theme). 
In music, tempo can be used to create emotions and doesn't have to always be metronomic, for instance almost every performance of music has little variations in tempo that sets the unique mood for a certain passage. Furthermore, the timing with the accompanist was flawlessly coordinated in all the above cases.

The first three contestants were expected to not play the full piece due to the performance time of this piece being around 10 min. They were only shown to play a fragment (and the same fragment each time).
I could tell it was the exact same music copied and pasted, every detail (accent, accidental sound, bowing, phrasing...) was identical. I also noticed that the same real life musicians are playing for Kaori's performance.

It is very interesting how the show used the hard to understand "boring" part of the Kreutzer sonata and repeated it three times to contrast it with a selection of the most rapid and contundent parts of said sonata... which is what Kaori played, in a full uncut scene. 
Yes, she really skipped most of the Sonata playing bars 1-4, 19-36, 117-193, 583-599 (end), a nice adaptation, and while it is the real thing, it is definitely not the whole thing (of course, they can't use 10 minutes of the episode on this).

And here I was expecting some crazy Kreutzer sonata... oh well, it was quite nice.
>> ARTICLE
You should be upvoted to the top.

I also want to point out that the accompanist is a highly skilled pro in the context of the show, and it wouldn't be surprising for her to pick up Kaori's cues for slight tempo changes. In reality, the recording artists probably agreed ahead of time during rehearsal where to add some dramatic phrasing.

I liked the energy they put into Kaori's animation. Although not 100% percent accurate, they tried pretty hard to get the bow movements right, especially with the limited frame rate. I like watching musicians 'live' because I can both see and hear how they feel about a song - and I think they captured that pretty well.
>> ARTICLE
Man if the show had an episode length OVA with the full blown sonata, I would blow my money of the BDs.

Also, did you recognize the recording they used? I can't help but shake the feeling that they got it from somewhere.
>> ARTICLE
Like episode one, the [ending credits](http://i.imgur.com/IbiEBFY.png) the classical recording used.
>> ARTICLE
It kind of ruins the immersion if you know the piece and realize she just played the most expressive section and everyone else didn't. I wish they changed it to something more logical; like maybe she deliberately chose to play the part of the piece that wasn't assigned by the judges.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it was very clearly a different part of the piece from what everyone else was shown playing.
>> ARTICLE
Realistically speaking, everyone had to play the whole first movement at least. The anime chose to show only certain parts of their performances to highlight Kaori.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, I think it was a valid choice. While it might be easy for someone accustomed to the regularities of the piece to identify shifts in playstyle - and, more importantly, the importance of those stylistic shifts - to the layperson it'd be a very tough sell.

In this instance, intentionally framing the different pieces against each other to amplify an effect that'd otherwise go over the heads of most watchers was a good decision, especially in the context of character establishment.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know the piece, and caught on to this quickly, but it makes sense that they had to do it, so people can have an easier time picking out why Kaori is "better."
>> ARTICLE
This anime is super pretty, but do they actually just cherry blossom petals fall everywhere into their school? Wouldn't it be more sensible just to close the windows?
>> ARTICLE
THEN U DON'T GET THE FEELZ
>> ARTICLE
Lesson learned: If you want artistically pleasing things, throw logic out the window.
>> ARTICLE
That too. You won't be able to throw logic out the window if you close it.
>> ARTICLE
And throw cherry blossom petals in the other direction with respect to the logic.
>> ARTICLE
throw petals in the window

This reminds of me of when I first watched Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. I was just blown away by the art direction. Also I think I have a new waifu...
>> ARTICLE
Definitely has that feeling! Show reminds me of the first time Sorata sees Shiina (at the train station) with the cherry blossoms.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I'm loving this show. The music, the characters, the sceneries. Great. Can't wait to see more.
>> ARTICLE
This show is amazing :O had to go back and watch that violin performance again. 
>> ARTICLE
It's official. Miyazono Kawori is the next Nodame. Tempo. dynamics. aggressive playing. ignores composers intentions. She reeks of nodame LOL
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but she's missing the correct [facial expression](http://i.imgur.com/T8ZFR05.jpg).

GABUU!~

"Those seats over there are open!"

>> ARTICLE
I cant lie this is AOTS for me this episode confirmed it so much happened  
* [OP](http://imgur.com/oaZLKY2) that [captures](http://imgur.com/pTFC2ll) what this show has, favourite OP for me. The ED is also a nice touch to cool down at the end  
(also havent heard a a male and female sing together in a while too)  
* The background music is subtle but it fits the atmosphere  
* Yep its [happening.](http://imgur.com/XgHCg7D)  
* The visuals are spot on the contrasting scenes of what Kousei sees and the memories of his mother  
* The different ways they play music, Kaori does it for [fun](http://imgur.com/FmmasB1) whilst Kousei does it to fulfill her mothers [dreams](http://imgur.com/2hmRcM1), I can definitely see where this will go  
Overall this anime has exceeded my expectations, it may just be the calming effects after watching Psycho Pass and all the action packed shows this autumn or it may just be my love for SOL's.  
EDIT: Added some screenshots
>> ARTICLE
Does anybody understand why it's called "Your lie in April"?  But man, this show is gorgeous.  I also can't decide best girl by episode 2, which is unprecedented.
>> ARTICLE
my guess : April= Spring, how MC see fresh *spring spirit* in heroine, how MC to restart his performance with new view himself as musician
>> ARTICLE
For some reason I have it stuck in my head that the lie is that Kaori likes Watari. I don't think she likes him at all, and it's just a way of her getting to Arima, be it so he can play piano with her, or again maybe. Perhaps she saw him playing at a recital when she was younger and was captivated by him.

Basically, I think the lie is Kaori's. But that's just an inkling I have. I'm far from set on it.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. I like it.
>> ARTICLE
My guess: The lie was between everyone but our MC to go see the violin competition. It sets the stage for our MC to begin moving forward with his life instead of staying stuck in the past.
>> ARTICLE
This has certainly been the most impressive show so far this season, at least for me, which is saying something because this season is excellent.  The show is refreshingly mature for a high school romance drama and the focus on classical music is just the icing on the cake for me.  Not to mention the gorgeous color palette and art style, although there was a bit of "Quality" this episode towards the end.

Overall a very promising show, I hope it keeps it up and if anyone is debating picking this show up, you definitely should, the first two episodes have been fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
And it's not even a high school drama! It's middle school!
>> ARTICLE
>They're all 14

This will make the fanfics awkward, methinks.
>> ARTICLE
Aw, you're adorable.

Plz no senpai, I'm pure ;_;

no senpai, this is our ~~fight~~ fanfic
>> ARTICLE
It's kind of jarring every time they show MC's profile and the frames of his glasses become invisible.  I want magic glasses like that.

The OP and ED for this show have got the be the best for this season.  I'm never skipping these.
>> ARTICLE
> It's kind of jarring every time they show MC's profile and the frames of his glasses become invisible.

This happens a *lot* in anime, but the frames aren't usually as thick as Arima's so it's usually more subtle. It's so you can see the eyes; windows of the soul and all that.
>> ARTICLE
At least here, the thick frames blend into his low-cut hair so it's not *too* bad. When the frames are contrasted against bright skin, though, is when it becomes painfully obvious (see: World Trigger).
>> ARTICLE
Both Baby Steps and Haikyuu did it with nets/fences.
>> ARTICLE
This is the first time that I have ever heard Hebrew used in an anime.

Elohim means "God" and is used in the Bible to refer to God.

I can't find much about "Essaim" though...
>> ARTICLE
Essaim means "swarm" in French...I'm not sure what that could possibly mean, though. God swarm?
>> ARTICLE
I dont know if i actually like this show, or I'm use to watching glasslip on thursday that it seems really good 
>> ARTICLE
This is already Best of the Season for me, to me it's only a matter whether or not Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso can keep up its success to be a year contender.

Kaori's performance is one of, no, the BEST I've ever seen in a musical anime (nodame, kids on the slope, or idol shows), realistic, artistic and many more.

Everything was setup on the stage, from the moment Kaori walked in, a piece of music was specifically arranged for only her, the beautiful white dress, her expression, moves during the performance and even the sweat on her body was just .... perfect! (can't really find any words beside that to express my opinion on this).

Episode 1 was exceeded way more than my expectations, episode 2 was even BETTER.


>> ARTICLE
I disagree that it was better than Kids on the Slope. Episode 7's scene was way better, IMO. 
>> ARTICLE
Well if you take into consideration that the show has 2 cour and it has already proven itself to be one of the best only in 2nd episode. 

My assumption is that the mc and Kaori will perform together on stage(as he is a pianist) on later time. Furthermore, Kaori's performance in episode 2 impressed me more than Kids on the Slope(even more than the scene when they played together as a band in basement, and in the school fes). 
>> ARTICLE
[This still brings tears to my eyes.](http://puu.sh/bQtn7/a5753bd728.webm)
>> ARTICLE
Damn, parts of this show (especially in the OP visuals) feel like they're channeling Makoto Shinkai in terms of sheer vibrancy balanced with realism. The visual direction of the scenes is also pretty fantastic in places, like the scene with Kousei's inner monologue when Kaori came to them after the performance.

Anyway, the episode. Okay, so remember those "Nodame Cantabile" vibes we all had last week? Well, they just got *stronger*. Kaori's unique point seems to be that she approaches music as an individual, using her own style rather than trying to replicate someone else's. I can only assume *that's* the part of her that will break little Kousei out of his funk, but I guess we'll see.

Also, can we just skip to the part where Tsubaki gets her heart broken into a billion pieces? The sooner I take that stab, the better.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure where I want this show to go and not sure who I'm rooting for yet but I can easily say it is the show I look forward to the most out of the season...so far haha if this gets too dramatic I may die haha
>> ARTICLE
The source material imo is really good. I have high hopes for this series.
>> ARTICLE
How much source material exists? Might have to read it if theirs enough to cover 2+ seasons.
>> ARTICLE
20th chapter just came out, they're about 40-45 pgs ea.
>> ARTICLE
The translation is a fair way behind, the manga is up to volume 9 in japan. There is more than enough material for a season
>> ARTICLE
This show is utterly, utterly gorgeous, the animation in the music sequence was captivating... and I love classical music.

Glad I kept this one.
>> ARTICLE
A-1 pictures did such an amazing job on the performance scene...the violin play wasn't just some lousy arm going up and down disregarding the notes, but it was totally on point.
>> ARTICLE
From tuning to the bowing, fingering, vibrato, playing stance and gestures... totally nailed it yes, except for...

[10:56](http://i.imgur.com/04JgeLO.png) I can't help but wonder how she starts that passage at fifth position in the G string. It doesn't sound like that, and it's impractical at that speed.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
the friendship between Watari and Kosei is pretty good. One telling the other to keep on liking the girl that likes him.  Then Kosei covering for Watari with Kaori. What bros.
>> ARTICLE
It's so great. I was annoyed when he didn't compliment Kaori's playing because I thought it was normal MC bullshit, but then he said he was playing the part of Friend A and I realized he was just being a bro. And then Watari has his talk, emphasizing how many *other* girls like him, because he's a bro. Followed by Kosei covering for Watari, because he's a bro.

So it had the same same result as most other romance plots (a setback followed by unexpected gains), except it was due to the characters being great people rather than because of stupid, contrived bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
Watari best man.
>> ARTICLE
he is playboy
>> ARTICLE
I love the OP to this and the shows stepping up... just hard to believe they're middle schoolers...
>> ARTICLE
This show is very promising. The music is obviously great. I didn't hear that guy mess up, then again I'm not that savvy with music competitions. Of course, she was great. The comedy is just so out of place that it works. And it's good comedy. 

Sucks being Friend A. Best friend gets the girl you like, have to lie to cover for friend because he's out with another girl, just a replacement til best friend shows up. Being Friend A is suffering. 

I just know MC is gonna end up with the girl, but I wanna see their development to how it happens. 
>> ARTICLE
Just watched the opening in the first episode and it already looks pretty promising.

I'm guessing that this will be a love quadrangle with the MC meeting the new girl, while his female childhood friend has a crush on him and the other childhood friend has a crush on her, but roots for her crush on MC anyway.

Does that sound about right so far?
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like what I've been predicting as well. That's my only real complaint about the show: it seems like I know exactly how the plot will unfold.

Hopefully the show surprises me.
>> ARTICLE
Hearing the OP again makes me so happy. \^.\^

So far I'm liking what has been shown of the characters and the music, but I can only hope that they don't screw up their animation quality by the end of it. (Almost) everything about this anime is beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
This show is beautiful I get to look forward to Thursdays again ()
>> ARTICLE
One word = Amazing 

I don' know how to describe this, but i was charmed and mesmerized like it was a dream or something, I didn't feel time passing .. wow just wow 

I hope it will turn out good
>> ARTICLE
Looking for this to be my warm-fuzzy-feeling anime of the season. 
>> ARTICLE
well on to reading the manga...
>> ARTICLE
I feel this is gonna be one of those shows where you have that childhood friend who gotta a crush on you, but you like another girl.
>> ARTICLE
It seems pretty obvious judging by the OP.
>> ARTICLE
this anime hold candidate for best OP for the season,
the violinist is wild, violent, blonde=>it's Chitoge without tsundere.. no doubt about it
>> ARTICLE
Been playing violin for 13 years and I have to say that performance was astonishing. I didn't really care that the animation was a bit off from what it would actually look like playing the actual piece. The way they showed how Kaori put her soul into playing that piece caused me to pick up my violin and start playing (Concerto in D Major by mozart if anyone cares). I hope this show turns out well it has so much potential.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, can you feel that guys? The feeling of heartbreak coming in 10 episodes or so? I know I can, and I'm so fucking ready.
>> ARTICLE
Holy cow, I did not expect another anime after Nodame Cantabile to bring me back to classical music.

My god this show is great.
>> ARTICLE
This is a fantastically animated show, I think it perfectly matches the tone set forth by the rest of it.

If I had one complaint it's that the show is bordering on cheesy as fuck, for a shonen show (which I assume it is since the manga is classified as such?) 

Then again we're only two episodes in so it wouldn't be fair of me to judge it based on that quite yet.

Yet again, killer music. I am probably going to listen to the OP every week all the way through.
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe I read all of the manga after the first episode. This anime is just too amazing ;(, I have failed the anime community.
>> ARTICLE
Love this show but there were a lot of super budget looking scenes.  Hopefully there aren't many more like that.
>> ARTICLE
I literally can't handle my shit while watching this show. When I read the synopsis i got goosebumps, when I saw the PV I was hyped as I had never been before, with the first episode all my hopes were concentrated into animation form and with this episode I already got what I was looking for, a breathtakingly thrilling performance by this season's most adorable, and my personal favourite, character, Kaori.

Please ''Your lie in April'', I can only get SO erect.
>> ARTICLE
I love the art, concept, characters, and music. but goddamn do I hate love triangles. I really am enjoying this show a lot though.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I know what you mean. 90% of the time they're just so contrived.

But yeah, other than that clichd aspect of things, I'm enjoying the show as well.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really enjoying this show. Before it aired I was pretty hyped for it, now as each day passes I get more and more anxious waiting for Thursday afternoons.

The key animation frames are beautiful. The music is well done and the animation follows what it would actually look like in real life. I've always had a soft-spot for classical music, but this show is scratching the hell out of that itch. 

After her performance her hand was shaking a bit. Was she just nervous/excited from the adrenaline? Or does she have some kind of debilitating disease like Parkinson's or Huntington's? I really hope it's not the latter, from an anime-only viewer. 
>> ARTICLE
Was it her reacting to the MC saying her performance was "not bad"?
>> ARTICLE
That's a possibility. Maybe she was angry that it was just "not bad".
>> ARTICLE
I really want to write like...a paragraph or two on why I'm already in love with this series.  

All I can seem to get out is what I've been thinking since the beginning of the first episode.  "Please don't let me down. Please oh please oh please A-1 don't let me down."
>> ARTICLE
I'm really liking this one, I almost wish I discovered it after the first season finished because this is a show I could binge watch for sure. I rewatched the first before starting this second episode. So far, its just that good
>> ARTICLE
It's got that feel good feeling to it.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm really in love qith this show. The osts are ALL awesome, art is great, the main characters are interesting and the plot seems good. I think it'll become my best of the season.
>> ARTICLE
this could beat out nodamem not like it matters though. But damn that violin scene was so moving
>> ARTICLE
Kaori's performance was simply stunning, not only in animation but also in the actual performance as well.

Characters are solid, soundtrack is fantastic, and I can't wait for the romance elements to ramp up. Should be one of the best shows from this season, just because the quality in every department is so damn high.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm enjoying it so far with a couple small reservations, but I don't think the art style switches during the goofier scenes are doing this show any favors.  Spending 90% or more of the show in [a style that borders on photorealistic in some aspects](http://i.imgur.com/kan9Ouj.png) with little deviation, then suddenly cutting to [this for two minutes](http://i.imgur.com/LuYm8GS.png) is jarring.  The tonal shift due to the gag scenes also strikes me as odd.  Not that there shouldn't be some levity or silliness, but it's hard to take the rest of the show seriously when it suddenly pulls a hard left into Nisekoi-type antics.  That stuff works in Nisekoi because it *knows* it's an inherently silly show.  Here, it just kind of pulls the rug out from under the mood or atmosphere that had just been set.

Maybe I'm just expecting a very different show from what Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso wants to give me.  I'm still enjoying it, but I'm worried my nitpicks are going to get the better of me in the long run on this one.
>> ARTICLE
Def the best new anime airing this season.

Wow, this episode was amazing. As much as I love Unlimited Budget Works this is well on the way to being my Anime of the Season.

This show amazes me...it really might shape up to be one of my favorite anime if it continues with this awesomeness. MAN! So pumped after watching this episode.

You know I didn't really get into this waifu thing like other people did but I think I just found my new waifu
>> ARTICLE
Things I really really liked about this episode: the accompanist's face during Kaori's performance was priceless. I get the feeling my dad (an organist) and Kaori wouldn't get along at all.

Also, it's just the right mixture of pretentious narration with heartfelt romanticism to really make me doki-doki in all the right ways, which is a bit unusual, given the setup. Usually these sorts of shows leave me pretty cold, but I'm feeling it here.
>> ARTICLE
This is the one I look forward to the most. AOTS.
>> ARTICLE
This, Log Horizon, Denki Gai, Girlfriend Kari and Nanatsu no are easily my favourite this season so far. Just gotta hope it isn't NTR though, I don't think I could survive the russling it would cause me.

EDIT: Pretty sure they blew the entire episodes budget on Kaori.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn, please tell me they recorded full tracks of Kaori's passionate music playing for the OST release.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure the soundtrack will be full of excellent classical music that Arima and Kaori end up playing (individually and together) in the series.
>> ARTICLE
A part of me wishes there were little to no romance in this as I could see it detracting from the great music.  I hope at the very least it becomes plausible and not too melodramatic, especially with the two childhood friends.

I find it kind of amusing that one of them is a womanizer though, as if to make the initial pairing easier.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know what you mean - the clichd nature of the love triangle/square/line is the one thing I have reservations about regarding this show. The music is fantastic, though.
>> ARTICLE
I will cry if Kaori get urobutcher.. T^T
>> ARTICLE
I'm so pumped up for the next episode. Can't wait. (and hope they'll be playing together soon)
>> ARTICLE
This show is really freaking pretty to look at. 

...uh oh. Stills? *Stills?* Please dont tell me that first episode was a fake-out, I was looking forward to well-animated instrument playing. 

I hear the source material slides into melodrama, but from what I see its pretty realistic about the drama, if slightly exaggerated a bit. Personally I can relate to Kousei, maybe a little too well, since I grew up in a strict Asian household, though my parents let up halfway through high school. But even now I still suffer from a big inferiority complex for not being the very best, like no one ever was- well its not all bad, since I now have pretty high (but sometimes unrealistic) standards for myself.

Kouseis conflicted about music. He clearly enjoys it and knows a lot about it, but at the same time his trauma and his mother forcing it on him in the past dampen his enthusiasm for it. I can also relate to Kouseis thoughts during the various performances, since as a musician, when I listen to an amateur/non-professional performance I am practically praying the entire time that they wont mess up out of sheer empathy. 

Woo I guess they were saving the animation budget for Kaoris performance (makes sense). Tuning! Points for accuracy. OH MAN MATCHING BOW MOVEMENTS WITH THE MUSIC. THIS IS WHAT I WANTED. DAMN THAT PIZZICATO LOOKS STELLAR TOO. Kaoris playing is flamboyant as fuck though. Thats some terrible concert etiquette by the audience, but whatevs. I got my smooth and accurate violin animation. I am a happy camper. 

Kaori blatantly represents what Kousei wants from music: the passion and the fun of performing it without the pressure of the competition or his mother. Which is really what music is all about, the performance, and what it means to the performer and how they convey their feelings to the audience. Thats the kind of performance Kaori wanted as she asked Kousei for his opinion, and he knows that thats exactly what she delivered. 

The only downside is the budding romance subplot with the love triangle(square?) which I expect Ill get tired of if it becomes the main focus.

...or not? Wataris being a bro and it looks like him and Kousei have everything out in the open. And then Kaori pulls a thing that Im not sure about at the end. Maybe this wont be so bad? Cautiously optimistic. 
>> ARTICLE
God-damn that performance scene was serious media-visual eye candy.  Awesomely done, and it ropes me into the show even more.  Not much for the romance genre, but so far this show has me gripped; great job so far Shigatsu, great job :).  The simply drawn, joke scenes are a tad bit jarring, but I get used to them.  The basketball shot scene was hilarious with the sounds he made lol. 
>> ARTICLE
It is too easy to get tempted to go and spoiler myself with the manga, but I am going to try and occupy my mind so I can enjoy this with all the amazing animation (and the budget cuts that comes with it) in this show.
>> ARTICLE
So far the adaptation has been pretty solid, I still feel they are over doing the comedy sections just a tad. I love the manga, its easily in the top 3 music mangas around... I'm really looking forward to some of the stuff later being animated, theres going to be so many feels
>> ARTICLE
this show is just so fucking damn good , epic classical music anime , hell yeah
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes it takes me a while to write these. Some times it is because I don't get to watch the episode until later in the day, other times it is to sort out how I feel about the episode.

This is the first ~~Shoujo i've watched that focuses on the male MC and his feelings for the girl.~~ (ok, so it's actually shounen. I thought it was shoujo by the art style).

I enjoy listening to classical music, but I'm not one to study up on it. When the other kids started playing the piece, which I don't believe I heard before, it was enjoyable, but when Kaori started playing her version of it, it felt very moving, very emotional, and I really enjoyed it. I really can't wait to hear more from her.

So she is a competition music player, just like Kosei was. I doubt that she hasn't heard his name before, or seen pictures or videos of his performances. I'm pretty sure she recognized him, but I'm not sure when, probably before the performance. It became fairly obvious that she knew of him after the performance, when she asked him what he thought. I sensed something when she said "you'll be his substitute". I first thought she meant to walk her home, but I wonder if she'll admit she knows who he is.

I think this may be my favorite overall for the summer. It's a close race with this season's Fate, which I am also new to.
>> ARTICLE
its pretty clear that Kaori knows who MC is and pretended to go out with his friend just to get close to him 
>> ARTICLE
The music is, as always, beautiful. ...Though it was really obvious to me that Kaori was playing a different part of the piece than the others were shown playing.

My only real complaint regarding this show is that the overall plot seems clichd and predictable - Kousei's depressed and withdrawn (because of the way his mother forced him to play), he sees Kaori being all happy and carefree, and gets inspired to play again like her (and, obviously, falls in love with her) - his childhood friend is revealed to be in love with him, and is heartbroken, but eventually they go back to being friends. Not sure how Watari fits in yet, since he's kinda getting with half the girls in the school. I do like his levelheadedness about everything, despite that.

I'm still enjoying the show, though. I need more classical music in my life. Especially violin music :)
>> ARTICLE
this anime makes me smile so much. it's so freaking beautiful. I almost cried in Kaori scene.
>> ARTICLE
Love almost everything about this show, but those random outbursts from the characters need to stop. It tosses a bucket of water on every scene.

*warning* 


Unless you're up for something seriously sad please drop this show.

I don't know if my heart will be able to handle this show to the end. It already aches with anticipation.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely hate that head judge.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope this anime will get more people into classical. I love classical. I am hoping they will also do some sonatas instead only concerto's or duets. So far they seem to have the right idea with the judges disliking the piece not being played they way the composer intended. All in all love it. Hoping to hear some Dvorak

>> ARTICLE
Okay, great show but the fact that they're 14 is kinda bothering me. So far it seems at least to me the concepts they've been exploring are a little too mature for their age. Which while not a really significant problem, it just kinda bothers me watching this.

Edit: Hey people I'd just like to remind you down voting is not suppose to be on something you disagree with. Like Holy Hell people, it's just my personal opinion. From personal experience, I just think they are a little mature for 14 years old.

It might end somewhat well. Probably better than if she died in like the final episode
>> ARTICLE
Well she isn't dead yet and we have 2 episodes left so it might still happen, sadly.

Heh, I guess you're right, i thought there was 24 episodes, goddammit 

I don't have much hope for her tho :(

How do we know she isnt dead yet?
>> ARTICLE
If she had died in that moment it would have been more clear that she died. Although it is still possible that she died after he left the hospital/during a moment we didn't get to see. More likely though she had a seizure and is in very bad shape but isn't dead quite yet.
>> ARTICLE
Yea probably, but I have seen too much horrible shit in series and anime to be scared of a funeral next ep

>> ARTICLE
When we got to the Kaori scene at the end I was like "Oh for fucks sake"...then the cat in the road and I was like "FUCKING COME ON!" 
>> ARTICLE
This anime is making my heart crumble. If she at least sees Kosei play live one more time in person, and gets to say goodbye to him, I will be satisfied for them to have closure. 

But I swear, if Kosei starts to play at his important concert and he looks up and sees Kaori sitting in the same place his mom used to sit when she was ill, Im going to cry myself to sleep.
>> ARTICLE
When they dropped the bomb of "she has some pretty nasty disease", i thought it would end with her sitting on his mothers spot... i still hope this is not true and if it is, i hope she at least doesnt die
>> ARTICLE
I wish there was more insight as to what illness she has. As of right now, all we know is that she is dying from something and there's a surgery that could possibly give her more time, but its risky. That doesn't give to many clues as to what she has.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it'd be good for the story that she have some specific, real-world disease. It would just be a distraction as people look up off-the-wall treatments.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. I totally prefer anime-itis over anything involving a real illness. 
>> ARTICLE
Seriously there is a lot of ground to cover in two episodes. I'm just hoping that there is some closure or conclusion, whatever it is.
>> ARTICLE
Dude exactly!!! With everything that just happened this episode, and with only 2 episodes remaining to wrap things up, I'm absolutely terrified by how this all might end.
>> ARTICLE
they covered chapters 39 and 40 this episode, so if they keep going at that rate the math works!
>> ARTICLE
I suppose you read the manga? And i guess since its only 22 eps, hopefully (fingers crossed) they have a quick OVA after the series ending
>> ARTICLE
There is going to be an OVA, but not for a few months.
>> ARTICLE
i think we're gonna get the finale of the manga on the final episode, so i really have no idea what the OVA is going to be about


>> ARTICLE
maybe an epilogue? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm really confused, so what exactly happened between episodes 19 and 20? I feel like episode 20 is completely different, initially I legitimately thought that I had already seen episode 20.  
  
  
Kaori sorta just dropped the whole idea of "performing on stage once more" with Kousei, there was nothing said about it. I feel like the focus between this episode and the last one changed quite abruptly, and it actually put me off quite a lot.  
  
  
Did anyone else notice this? 
>> ARTICLE
if I am to understand it correctly, in episode 19, she was preparing for the surgery and undergoing some rehabilitation, I assume the surgery happened in between the two episodes
>> ARTICLE
It did. A full month passed between episodes 19 and 20.
>> ARTICLE
[manga info about the surgery not really spoiler I think but better safe than sorry](/s "the surgey began in the latest manga chapter(42) so I don't think it already happened in the anime. the surgery should come up next episode")

The manga itself had that strange leap in time and where character motivation seemed to change really quickly. So it's not just in the anime.

>> ARTICLE
[that's her fetish](http://i.imgur.com/sg3OSw1.png)

seriously though, she could not be sending more mixed signals to Kousei..
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if she actually knows that Kaori is so fucking sick. She almost acts as if she doesnt.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure Tsubaki does know. She was right at bedside for all those breakdowns by Kaori. But she keeps a happy face on because it's not just the end of the road for Kaori but for her relationship with Kousei if Kousei does stake out into the world as a professional musician. Not to mention she'd be a drag on Kaori's life threatening condition if she adds drama to that.

It can be irksome to see Tsubaki constantly deny her feelings and send mixed messages, but I think this is probably the only way she can go on without totally breaking down or hurting those she cares about. 
>> ARTICLE
The most irksome thing about her character, I think, is that she's showing a complete lack of regard towards Kousei. She knows he's worried sick about the girl he loves dying, and she's trying to shovel a whole new load of shit onto his plate. She's partially responsible for his breakdown at the end of the episode. He's already emotionally unhinged at the moment, but she doesn't give a fuck. All she cares about is herself. Having said that, it makes for a brilliant story. She's a well-written character, and for that reason I completely hate her.
>> ARTICLE
To be frank, I wish she was written to nag a bit less at Kousei at every turn. But that seems to happen almost all the time when the mood gets too  heavy. It is unfortunate for Tsubaki that she is really stuck in a terrible situation, relationship-wise. 
>> ARTICLE
I like Tsubaki's character. She's constantly a walking conflict between what she says and how she feels and it's left to the audience to discern the motive in each case. She says Kousei is just like a little brother to her, but she loves him as much more. She talks about Kaori as though she's still just going to school and hanging out with them every day like she doesn't know. She says Gorilla's don't catch colds even though she knows why she's sneezing. All this while calling Kousei a liar.

The manga's [translation](http://i.imgur.com/gJ3oXvX.jpg) of that sort of confession scene was better.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I think it's befitting. She's always been a very pushy girl and not only that but she doesn't really know how to make a move let alone express her feelings. So doing something like that was (imo) absolutely adorable and fit her personality to a tee. 
>> ARTICLE
The anime's translation is correct though. She literally says that the only person he has a choice to love is her. She doesn't say anything about her own feelings in that line.
>> ARTICLE
witch makes more sense in my opinion because he wouldn't have to think that hard about the manga version.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I didn't really like how it was translated in the Anime. Glad I wasn't alone in that. 
>> ARTICLE
> I didn't really like how it was translated in the Anime

The anime's translation was literal though. I have no idea what the original text in the manga was, but what was said in the anime was exactly what the translation conveyed.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was like she was saying he should like her instead of saying she's the one that liked him. So odd why'd they go for the former.
>> ARTICLE
She actually says the former in Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
The anime's translation is what she literally said. The manga's translation is what she was implying.

Manga translation still suits the scene better. Literal translations are not always the best.

Especially with Japanese. The language works in a way where a lot is left unsaid or said in indirect ways.

It might follow from her thoughts, but Arima is not privy to her thoughts, so the actual words she said are translated properly.

I never really understood why Kaori is still going out with Watari.. maybe we just didn't get to see much relationship development between the two but it seems like Watari fawns over every cute girl he sees and Kaori only likes him cause Tsubaki set her up with him in the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
I just figure she ios trying to play out her fantasy before she dies. To play on stage with her childhood music idol and show him the beauty of music. To date the good looking bad boy  and change show what true love is like. 

It just never ended up that way.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think this can be answered at this point in time.

>> ARTICLE
[I really hate how the spoiler tag on this sub works. I prefer the button reveal spoiler thing instead but oh well...](/s "Kaori is only going out with Watari because she wants to know what it's like to be in a love relationship before dying without giving a shit on who it is and because Watari is a scumbag and is somehow Arima's friend, he was the perfect guy. She always loved Arima but she knew that if she was going to be in a relationship with Arima, she'd be desperate to keep on living despite being far better than dying with regrets. The worst about this is that Watari knew and did nothing about it.")
>> ARTICLE
Buttons to reveal spoilers are not possible. Only a subreddit's CSS can be changed.
>> ARTICLE
Is this discussed in the manga? do you think it will be in the show?
>> ARTICLE
yes but it's only highly suggested in the final chapter (44) and it's most likely going to be in the final episode of this anime series.
>> ARTICLE
I've always thought it was heavily implied that Kaori liking Watari was a lie she told Tsubaki to get closer to Kousei, because she admired/loved him or something along those lines. Maybe Watari knew this all along, and just kind of plays along and accepts his role as the "true" Friend A. That's my guess. Watari knew Kousei's feelings towards Kaori before Kousei did, and basically encouraged him to reach out to her a few episodes ago. I've gotten the feeling that Kaori was after Kousei from episode 1, but maybe that's just because I've seen so much romance anime.

Edit: It sounds like I'm talking from my experience reading the manga, which isn't the case. I haven't read a single page of the manga, nor do I plan to. 100% of what I said could be total bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
Are they even going out? All I get is that Tsubaki and Kousei knows (or thinks) that she likes Watari, and Watari is basically a playboy. I've never seen or heard them as an official couple.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure they are not going out. Besides spoiler reasons, she started hanging out with them simply due to liking him--it never really went further than that. 

[Going into spoiler reasons:](/s "Every supposed date where she may have went with Watari ended up being substituted with Kousei and if they were actually going out, I doubt it would've gone that far and by the end, it's probably likely she meant to go with Kousei in the first place. Kaori also admitted that her only lie was saying she liked Watari and she felt they could be good friends. Considering the only time Watari did attempt something she slapped him, I think that immediately killed any kind of chance where Watari may have tried dating her (and he also kept complimenting/flirting with other girls/ladies anyway--which she said was part of why she never really would've liked him in that sense). But yeah, while she said she liked him, Kaori never let it go any further than that.")

That said, I will say that it makes me sad that it seems Watari never bothered trying to set Kaori and Kousei up. He knew Kousei liked her and since they never seemed to date and Watari will hit on almost any girl, it just kind of bothered me he didn't do much about it... but he's 14 and liking ever girl, so I can't be too harsh about it. He did give advice and said in the end, it really is up to a girl to say if someone has a chance. I'd like to think part of why he'd bring Kousei along was so Kaori could choose between them. Watari even said how Kaori always depended on Kousei and never him. 
>> ARTICLE
Idk, Kousei is kind of high maintenance and Watari is just fun all the time. I could see Kaori enjoying just being able to have fun with Watari without any of the heavy emotional stuff that Kousei has.

I also don't really think they're going out? Just kind of flirty friendship.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure Kaori wanting to "date" Watari was more of an excuse to get close to Kousei and get him to start playing piano again. Watari also acknowledged this a couple of episodes ago when he told Kousei that Kousei is the one who Kaori keeps relying on. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I also feel no commitment from either of them. Kousei and Kaori are far more emotionally invested in each other.

NO. MY HEART IS BREAKING EVERY WEEK. NOT OKAY.
I was hoping Kaori would get better unlike the mom... no. FUCK.
And then the cat. That's like, my worst nightmare (losing my cats, which is why I keep them indoors). 
>> ARTICLE
I suppose we can consider this episode to be the "calm before the ~~feels~~ storm."  Next episode will be great and feels-tastic, so I can't wait for next week to get here already.  I'm also glad that the preview for next episode didn't spoil anything. 

Anyway, there were no new pieces this week, so there won't be a performance's write up this week.  If you would like to read through my previous performances write ups, I've included them below.  We have at least two more performances left to hear in the show: Emi's performance (which isn't known at this time), and [Kousei's performance of](/s "Chopin's Ballade No 1.") I'm super excited for Kousei's piece, but I'm also hoping they'll give Emi a great piece to play next episode.

I think it's pretty obvious by now that nobody is going to have a happy ending in this show.

> What are you two doing here? We're treating her now. Go home today!

So that's what's going on: The nurses are very possessive of Kaori, and don't like Arima bringing her snacks. Next episode she'll be back and full of food!
>> ARTICLE
So basically its decided, she will die. The LEAST thing they can do is give us the song that MC will play for her. The sadness on his piano, his frustration i wanna listen to it!! Then cry like a bitch. PLEASE for the love of god dont let it finish with her death and no finals :/

God damn all the girls in the airing shows are getting sick of waiting and making their moves.

The hand washing scene was excellently storyboarded. The graphic match cuts of Kousei and Kaori's hands working in rhythm with the alternating silence and sound of running water was serenely melancholic.

Also really liked the reserved use of canted framing. It was saved for the right moments. A lot of anime tend to overuse canted shots when things get tense or dramatic and the effect gets lost. The hand washing scene saved it for the last shot and it worked well as a visual supplement to Kousei's emotions.

Ummm I guess we wont be getting any more Emi... this is the real tragedy folks.

Reading these comments and seeing the screencaps reminds me why I've put watching this show on hold until it finishes airing.

It's not that I don't love the show; I love Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso to death. It's really amazing, and that's why I went and read all of the manga before the show even came close to being done airing.

But sad stories honestly kind of piss me off and have a lingering effect of making me feel really shitty even hours/days after experiencing them. I don't think I could watch this show week to week the way the rest of you have. I'll still watch it, but I want to get it all over with at once so I don't get a weekly dosage of sad.

Brilliant show; I'm just SO glad I stopped watching it on a week-to-week basis.

I don't know Kaori's condition, but is it possible her hand was relaxing because the nurses gave her a powerful sedative to calm her? I know in some situations that is a dangerous thing to do, but if a patient is having a seizure that is so bad they risk hurting themselves, what else can they do? It doesn't look good, though. Kousei, man... If the worst comes to pass, I don't know if he will mend this time. A human can only take so much.

RIP Cat-ori. And probably Kaori, too, soon. This show is not very good at foreshadowing...

At least Tsubaki *finally* fucking confessed her feelings (and then kicked Kousei in the shin  because that's the best way to get someone to like you: physical abuse)... And then Kousei *finally* realizes his own feelings for Kaori, and Watari's just like "yeah, dude, we knew that like 3 episodes into the show".

The episode ends with DRAMATIC CLIFFHANGER. Nobody is surprised.

I marathoned all 20 episodes and I'm completely enthralled. I know I'm going to be an absolute wreck once it ends and although I'm rooting for Kaori to survive, I just don't see it happening.

Yeah, the anime does a good job showing off how seriously the condition is affecting her body, never really noticed these things in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why we keep calling them death flags, she is dying we can clearly see that. They stopped being subtle hints and being full blown, SHE IS DYING OPEN YOUR EYES moments a couple of episodes ago.

I don't know if I can handle this anymore. Kousei spent the first half of the anime getting over his mother. That was two years.

Losing Kaori is going to break him.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if it's just me, however I've noticed that Kousei has really veered away from Kaori. He's constantly preoccupied with other stuff so I feel like it wont be quite as serious as the time he lost his mother. 
>> ARTICLE
That's the point, he's purposefully avoiding meeting her and she constantly forces him to see her. same reason why he's like "oh this ain't like my mother at all". It'll hit twice as hard on him, reopen old wound and a new one.
>> ARTICLE
Kaori dying is going to shatter him into a thousand colorful pieces. He'll never forget, and his music will never be the same for it.
>> ARTICLE
> Losing Kaori is going to break him.

that would be against the point the show (and Kaori herself) is trying to make.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly.  I think it's setting up for Kousei to continue being an excellent and happy pianist, even after Kaori's death.  He might break for a little bit, but it's not like Kaori isn't preparing him for this.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I know people are probably joking at this point when they talk about death flags, but I feel like it's doing a bit of a disservice to the writers of the show :(

They are crafting a really well written tragedy, and to keep pointing at 'death flags' makes it seem like they are still sneakily inserting hints about Kaori's death and giggling behind their hands, going "We're gonna get 'em good! They'll look back on this moment where her legs stop working and it'll all be so clear!"

I think we've mostly stopped at this point though, so I'm just complaining about things that don't matter. I just really love the writing of this show.
>> ARTICLE
>They are crafting a really well written tragedy

I started watching this show thinking "oh this looks like a nice heart warming, easy going, slice of life show"

God dammit...
>> ARTICLE
Same here! I had no idea what was coming, I thought it was going to be a pure slice of life/romance the whole way. I got into it because of the art style and musical influences. Obviously, both of these things have complemented the story wonderfully, so I'm happy. And it still is probably one of the most heartwarming shows currently airing.
>> ARTICLE
But it's honestly so beautiful in it's own way.
>> ARTICLE
Oh this show is amazing and I'm so glad I got into it.  I hated that I caught up at episode 11 (I thought it was already over when I started) and now it's my most looked forward to show.  I am definitely buying the crap out of this series as soon as I can.  
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree, this episode sealed the deal for me that this is definitely going to be come a tragedy. There are too many hints and too many dying color transitions for the anime to go a happy ending. Although, I think Kaori likes Kousei alot, there is no way you wouldnt wait for your crush and settles for a friend instead on your (god knows how long til) day away from hospital.

I however think if Kaori were to die, Kousei will react differently, because this is different to his mother, playing piano for his mother was something that drives him to show off to his mother and nothing emotional except wanting to satisfy his mother's wish and hence why he responded angrily in that concert just before his mother died, and this broke him because he sees his mother's death as his fault and he regrets that the last time he spoke to her was to tell her to die, this in turn destroyed him and his ability to perform because at that time performing was purely for his mother.

With Kaori, its different, he loves this girl, so much so he started to enjoy the life as he knows it, he starts to enjoy things he never enjoyed before, he is much more happier now as a person compared to when he was younger, he plays piano now for her for her to listen and for the audience to remember and showing his affections to her, and this episode shows that she will forever live in his heart and he will eternally play to impress her (in the school scene) and bring about color to life and perform so others will remember both their existence, so yeah I dont think this will break him as badly as what happened to his mother.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you, losing your mother first as young, then losing the girl you (probably) love and are very close to. Kousei can't be unluckier, I just want this to end, it's Clannad all over.
>> ARTICLE
[clannad spoilers](/s "So everyone's going to come back to life?")
>> ARTICLE
Do you really want another tragic trainwreck?
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Well there was those light orbs floating around in the arena when Kousei was playing Liebeslied...
>> ARTICLE
oh shit. You're right. 

Fuck it. I'm still not getting my hopes up. 
>> ARTICLE
Losing Kaori is going to break me... 
>> ARTICLE
This all started way too early on, they made us watch a guy broken from a long-term struggle of losing someone and now they are doing it to us.  No quick and easy feels that pass.  Horrible, gut-wrenching, H2O/Clannad level of long-suffering.

>> ARTICLE
How can you open like that and follow it with such a happy OP?!

I think my new goal for this series is to picture the worst possible outcomes and just hope the actual ending is happier then that ;.; 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm...

This delves heavily into personal interpretation but the second OP is probably an essential part that makes the show as bittersweet as it is.

Everything including the lyrics of a love that won't happen, the dream-like visuals and the portrayal of an impossible performance isn't meant to be happy. Instead of showing off something akin to a bright future like the first OP, we get something melancholic, as though the show was reflecting upon the good times and teasing at what could have been. When I first saw it, I fully expected Kaori to have kicked the bucket during Kousei's competition because of how poetic it would have been.
>> ARTICLE
just predict a nice boat ending, then the actual ending *should* be happier
>> ARTICLE
School Days was not, I repeat, not a nice boat ending.
>> ARTICLE
Boat was certainly nice though.
>> ARTICLE
nice boat ending was a nice ending. I mean my OTP did get shipped.
>> ARTICLE
She was a musician. She loved the violin, and she was beautiful like the sun shinning even brighter when she played it.
She heard him play the piano. She learned love, but he lost his. Night was coming, so she gave him her light, her warmth. She gave him colours, but lost her own. Now, a pale winter sun, at her twilight.

Quote from Mircea The Young on Disqus.

Currently wathcing this series and looking at the discussion threads in between the OP and ED. MANN WHAT IS THIS COMMENT  _

is this a word for word quote? absolutely no modification? It sounds like you just described the whole show. Now I have to wonder whether the author actually based the show on this.

That resonates with the episode and the show as a whole. Apt choice of quotation.

In the first or second episode when Arima gets decked with a baseball through the window i thought for sure something serious was going to happen, but nope they just laughed it off.
>> ARTICLE
I do get mixed emotions sometimes when it's a really serious scene then suddenly the mood completely changes due to some slapstick comedy. I get that they try to provide comic relief to cut the tension but at times it does take away from the atmosphere of the situation they're in.

I think it's done on purpose. I feel like it's within Kaori's personality to, she's been hiding her condition for so long afterall.

Honestly, this is the *absolute biggest problem* I've had throughout the show and it *often* ruins the mood for me.

## Episode 16 List of Classical Performances:

We have a couple excerpts of pieces this episode.  The first is a few second snippet at the beginning of the episode courtesy of Nagi (and subsequent snippets of the same piece were heard throughout the episode), and the second piece was played during Kousei's visit to Kaori towards the end of the episode.

**Mozart: Piano Sonata No. 8 in A Minor, K. 310** - "In 1776 it was becoming increasingly evident to the 20-year old Mozart that Salzburg was not the place that would nurture and promote his musical talent or ideas, and the strained relations with his employer, Archbishop Colloredo, only added to Wolfgangs struggles and frustration.

In August 1777, after long and detailed planning with his father Leopold, Mozart resigned from his position as a court musician and a month later left on a tour through Europe in search of employment. Since his father could not leave his own position at the Archbishops court, Wolfgangs mother had to accompany her son on the trip to Munich, Mannheim, and Paris. This trip proved to be disaster both professionally and personally, as Mozarts attempts at securing a position did not yield any results, while his fathers increasingly frantic letters put more and more pressure on the young composer. In Paris Mozart never even entertained serious hopes for some kind of success, as he truly detested the city, its people, and its music. There, he did not make any important contacts, rarely performed, composed very little, fell into debt, and took to pawning valuables. And when it seemed things could not get any worse, in the summer of 1778 his mother fell ill, became bed-ridden for three weeks, went into a coma and died in July.

The A-minor Sonata was written during that Paris summer and one can be almost certain the tragic events surrounding this period account for the dark, tumultuous, and unrelenting character of this work. Being the first of only two Mozart sonatas written in a minor key, this composition opens with an aggressive, almost furious-sounding theme with a very distinct dotted rhythm in the right hand accompanied by equally aggressive and relentlessly repeated eighth-note chords in the left hand. The energy and turmoil of the first movement leave the listener breathless, with wild cascades of endless 16th notes persistently pierced by the angry repeated dotted notes of the main motive, ultimately ending without peace or resolution.

The Andante Cantabile, with its lovely melodies and elegance set in F major, sounds in stark contrast to the tumult of the first movement. It exudes the emotional depth of an especially mature and confident composer, while managing to put reins on and preserve the hidden  but always present - underlying dark energy from the beginning, ready to explode in any moment.

The last movement opens with a hauntingly beautiful but troubled melody with which Mozart brings back the tumultuous mood of the first movement. For nearly three intense minutes, this final Presto pushes through with unrelenting dark energy to its dramatic conclusion. And yet, somehow Mozart finds a way to offer glimpses of light in the midst of the angst, recalling the tenderness of the second movement. And even though those moments are ultimately drowned by the turmoil, we are reminded of the lighter and positive nature of the young Mozart, only temporarily darkened by the tragic events of the summer of 1778."

Here's an interpretation of the work by [Daniel Barenboim.](http://youtu.be/OWIEI9Qn_cA)

---

**Ravel: Pavane pour une infante dfunte** - "Maurice Ravel was born in the French Pyrenees, only a few miles from the Spanish border, a
geographical boundary he often crossed in his music. Even though his family moved to Paris while he
was still a baby, Ravel came by his fascination with Spain naturally, for his mother was Basque and grew
up in Madrid. (His Swiss father inspired in his son a love for things precise and mechanical that carried
over into his impeccable music, provoking Stravinsky to dismiss him as a "Swiss watchmaker.")

One of Ravel's earliest pieceswritten just after he left the Paris Conservatory in 1895was a habanera
for two pianos, the first indication that he would join that group of French composers, which includes
Bizet, Lalo, and Chabrier, who have written some of our best Spanish music. The habanera was Ravel's
first music to be performed publicly, in March 1898, and, despite the two pianists' inability to stay together,
it made a strong impression on Claude Debussy, who was in the audience. (He hadn't yet met the
composer whose name would one day be linked with his own.) Debussy asked to borrow the score, and
his *La soire dans Grenade* (Night in Grenada), written five years later, suggests that he studied it
carefully. (The suspicious similarity of the two pieces contributed to the eventual falling-out between the
composers.)

Like the Habanera, the *Pavane pour une infante dfunte* (Pavane for a dead princess) was conceived as
piano music and benefited greatly from the translation to a full orchestral score. The piano piece was an
instant success. Ravel later realized that music of such apparent easea simple melody over broken
chordsis doomed to a life at the hands of amateur pianists, and so eleven years later he rescued
the Pavaneand rescored it for the modern virtuoso orchestra. A pavane is a slow processional dance from
Padua (Pava is a dialect name for Padua). According to an old Spanish tradition, however, it was
performed in church as a stylish gesture of farewell to the dead. As to the identity of the dead princess,
Ravel finally admitted he picked the title because he liked the sound of the words." [(Source)](https://www.cso.org/uploadedFiles/1_Tickets_and_Events/Program_Notes/ProgramNotes_Ravel_Pavane.pdf)

Here's an interpretation of this work by [Elena Kuschnerova.](http://youtu.be/GEUpQ5pCSOQ)

---

In this week's episode of *Shigatsu wa Kimi no Desu Furagu*, we start things off with a bang.  Kaori ends up in the hospital *again* and more comparisons are being made between her and Kousei's mom.  In addition, we learn more about Nagi and her hatred for Kousei; however, after interacting with him more and more (and especially after the scene at the shrine), she starts to realize that they're similar in some regard.  As for that ending, they did a pretty good job in adapting that scene; it made things more emotional for me in comparison to how it was executed the manga.  [Anyway, the next couple episodes are going to be good (**Juicy Manga Spoilers; read at your own risk!**) --](/s "Kousei stops going to see Kaori after she asked him to commit lover's suicide with her (the reason for this will be revealed in these upcoming episodes -- I won't say it now).  Watari gets confrontational with Kousei about this at which point Kousei reveals to Watari the things Kaori said to him and that he doesn't know what to do.  He eventually goes to see Kaori, and during this visit she tells him that he should just forget about her. After hearing this, Kousei snaps and says how he doesn't know someone that irresponsible (while stuffing his face with the canel he finally brought her).  In order to knock some sense into her, Kousei asks Nagi to allow him to perform with her at her school's festival.  There will be some good character development for Nagi during the time leading up to the school festival, so look out for that; I can't wait to see her start calling Kousei "Arima-sensei" and to see Miike reaction when he finds out that Nagi knows "Arima-san." XD")

I think it's supposed to be "do you want to commit lover's suicide with me" which is a famous quote from the book she was reading.  It's also the same book Kousei had checked out previously.

Another interesting note is the music that was playing during this scene was Ravel's Pavane pour une infante dfunte which translates to Pavane for a Dead Princess.

The sub seems to be a bit off( though not necessarily wrong) right there. In the manga I think it was translated as "Will you commit lover's suicide with me?", which is still fucked up, but at least it carries a bit more meaning. And like someone else said, it's a quote.
>> ARTICLE
She said that in the Anime too.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure "Double suicide" doesn't necessarily mean the same as "Lover's suicide". Sure, it's mainly a question of definition, but "Lover's suicide" seems a bit more, umm, romantic(I guess). Or are  you talking about what the voice actor actually said, in which case: yup, whoever translated the subtitles fucked up.
Also, the way the sub was written made it seem like something along the lines of "so, wanna go get high?"

>> ARTICLE
Wow, this is my first time being mentioned by my username on reddit. I'm honored.

Since this seems to be a sort of big topic, I guess I'll elaborate on what I said.  can be translated as either "lover's suicide" or "double suicide." There's one word in Japanese, but in English you can use either of those two terms and it means the same thing. As I said before, I think the better translation for English is "lover's suicide" because of the  kanji in the word . The nuance is definitely kind of romantic, but would you not say that double suicide is also romantic, if not just a little? It's two people committing suicide together. 

To confirm what she said, her line was , which does in fact mean "Won't you commit double/lover's suicide with me?" (Common mistake here though. =watashi, =atashi. Both mean "I," but  is a more feminine version of "I," much like (ore) and (boku) are masculine versions of "I.") This *is* a quote from the book, and yes, it is meant to sound a little romantic. As I said, I do think "double suicide" on its own already sounds a bit romantic, so I think the subbers were afraid of using "lover's suicide" because they didn't want the viewers to think that she had suddenly fallen deeply in love with Arima.

sorry for wall of text^^^not^really
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for expanding on that :) I was aware of the watashi/atashi distinction, it just sounded like she said watashi to me, and I had found some google results for the quote with "". However, "" comes up with two orders of magnitude more results, so you're definitely right.

This is all very interesting. I really need to keep studying Japanese more diligently before my trip to Tokyo later this year. Though hopefully I'll never actually have to use the term "" ;)
>> ARTICLE
>Or are you talking about what the voice actor actually said

Talking about that. The subber definitely screwed up. 
>> ARTICLE
The word used was "[ ()](http://jisho.org/words?jap=%E5%BF%83%E4%B8%AD&eng=&dict=edict)" which can mean either double suicide *or* lover's suicide. So technically they're both correct.

Edit: What it sounded like she said was "", which *does* appear to be a quote from the book she has (Ichigo Doumei by Mita Masahiro). I don't speak Japanese that well, so I may not understand the full nuance here, but my understanding of the literal meaning of that would be "Will you not commit double suicide with me?"

Good episode, the impact of that last scene for Kousei was pretty intense. I wonder if this will make him distance himself or draw him closer than ever.

Why do they have to make Kaori so god damn likable, they should just decide that all of the main characters are immortal. I'd like that ending. Please make that ending a reality.
>> ARTICLE
I would approve of that ending
>> ARTICLE
its because she is so likable that it was so horrifying/saddening to see her turning into Kousei's mother, having that same desperation to "finish the job" helping Kousei.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that scene where she was freaking out burned that parallel image into my mind. It was pretty chilling.

Then at the end of the episode, it literally used the imagery of Kaori's likeness fracturing into the likeness of Kousei's mother, to the tune of creepy sound effects.

This show upsets me.

[Pavane pour une infante defunte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQXWcrM8rs) played at the end of the episode. That translates to "Pavane (dance) for a Dead Princess." I know it might not mean much right now, but damn... I love that piece, but I know this show will continue on it's path to sadness T-T The end of this episode was so heartbreaking for Kousei... He must know that feeling too well :\

Would just like to add that the composer of this song didn't put any weight on the title. He just liked the ring it had. I think this guy would have gotten along really well with her, and if anything totally makes the song choice that much deeper. For me anyway. Like the show is giving a meaning to the title of a song not written to mean anything.

You know, normally I like to play about a bit and meme it up in these threads, but I'd honestly feel kind of cheap for doing that with this episode, so sentimental musings it is!

Somewhere along the line this has started to turn into a question of what you do with the time you've been givenno matter where you are on your journey through life. I find it really compelling that we've just come from an episode of Tsubaki wishing her time would start moving forward again to an episode where both Kousei and Kaori wish time would stop.

And as they wished it would stop, we're shown how much things have changed. The colours became more grim, just like scenes that showed his mother would be faint of colour. That one shot that's the top comment right now shows it too, how much she has changed, even if it's subtle.

That scene where she wasn't able to hold her bow... It was in a over in a flash and she was all hyper again, but that kicks in.

Truthfully I'm not to sure what to say about this weeks episode, other then it appears as if it's setting up for the homestretch. 

Although, when [Kaori started laying it on Kousei](http://i.imgur.com/k1hlgnT.jpg) for not practicing it practically felt as if he were speaking to [his mother](http://i.imgur.com/NkDCfs5.jpg). Something pretty unsettling considering [Kaori's personality](http://i.imgur.com/hQV26Bo.jpg).

I'm so glad that they introduced Nagi, if they hadn't this show would have been suffocated by all the death flags in it. Adding a new character gives it a streak of energy and excitement, it also shakes up the dynamic between all the old characters.

Her being a child amplifies this even more.

Kaori is so pale now...

Just a reminder to anyone who didnt see the PSA a day or so ago, the finale chapter of the manga was released so be wary of spoilers.   However, if you are the type of person who needs to know what happens to decide whether or not you will continue with the show you can head over to r/manga for that. There is also a very solid summary of the events that lead up to the finale, which I recommend as well. As a manga reader most of my criticism are with the later half of events leading to the finale rather than the finale itself (mostly pacing reasons). 

[No Actual Spoilers. Just my general thoughts on the story and if I think certain people should continue with the show. People may or may not want to see my opinion on this subject.](/s "I would also like to say that for anyone strictly watching this show as a romance story i.e. who will Kousei end up with, only cares if Kaori lives or not, wondering if they achieve their dreams, etc. this show might not be for you. At the end of the day this is a coming of age story.  If you cant accept that this might not be a show for you. If there are any manga readers who disagree I would love to hear your opinions.
I apologize if it seems like I am trying to impose my opinions on anyone, I just dont want to see these discussion devolve into a weekly threads where people just throw a fit especially when the finale rolls around. ")

Finally to any manga readers still watching the show, I am excited to relive this beautiful journey with you all.

Thank you.

OK, thanks for this, I guess I won't be dropping the show.
>> ARTICLE
I have to say I am really not prepared for the feels that the end of this show might bring or not bring. 

I am currently reading the manga too but only the english version because I can't read japanese. 
I got a little curious about what you said and went to /r/manga to check things out.

I barely was able to read 3 random phrases scattered over one whole thread about the final chapter before renouncing and now I'm obsessing over what I just read.

One advice for those who only read the english release, don't check out the spoilers in r/manga unless you really want to know what happens without having the material translated. I'm saying this because 2/3 words can really fuck up your sanity and make you want to connect the dots.
>> ARTICLE
Haha that's understandable. If you want any questions answered just shoot me a PM.
>> ARTICLE
So, i am currently just watching the anime, but would you suggest just reading it to the end and still watch, or rather just continue to watch it only?
>> ARTICLE
Hmm that is entirely up to you. How much are you enjoying the show? Do you think knowing what happens will spoil it for you? I mention in my discussion with /u/LightBladeX that knowing before hand gives me a deeper understanding and appreciation of the characters and their actions while I am watching. Though some people may not feel the same way. What parts of the show are most important to you? For example is it the romance or how people deal with the hardships of real life? 

I found the manga to be beautiful (not perfect but still pretty damn great) in its own right and am very excited to see how the anime deals with a lot of the events that happen at the end. Yes the anime has followed the manga very thoroughly so far, but I personally believe each medium has its own charm and beauty. I am very much the same way about most shows/adaptations etc. like the Game of Thrones series though that show is definitely following the books MUCH more loosely. 
>> ARTICLE
The romance for me is the most important. From what you've seen, would you think that the manga and anime portray it differently and would carry different effects?
>> ARTICLE
Mmm I don't think it would carry any different effects. The anime probably will only enhance it all. If you're still tentative about the whole thing you can read a few chapters and see how you feel about everything. I think this episode finishes Chapter 32. There are 44 total so don't go too far until you are sure.
>> ARTICLE
okay, sounds like a good idea, thanks for the advice!
>> ARTICLE
hmm i thought the manga was finished so i just read all chapters up to 39 but there are no more, didnt they get translated yet or whats the problem? :D
>> ARTICLE
The English translations are lagging a bit. There are 44 chapters total. If you don't know Japanese they are fully translated into Chinese and Korean if you happen to know one of those. If not then you still have to wait a bit on the full English translations. 
>> ARTICLE
Would you recommend reading the manga from the beginning or has the anime been very faithful. What chapter would this be around?
>> ARTICLE
It's been very faithful so far, but there's no harm in starting from the beginning if you have the time :D

I'm pretty sure this episode finishes chapter 32. There are 44 total and I think the english translations are at 38. 
>> ARTICLE
Does this mean the anime will be doing the full series?

Yup! There will also be an OVA released after the series is over. It is supposedly an original story written by the author, but I have not found any other info on it.

The fucking intro scene. As if I needed another reason to be depressed from this show. :/


EDIT: THAT LAST SCENE. FFFFUUUUUU-
>> ARTICLE
So that was how she fell.  

The second opening song is really addictive too. Symphony~!  
Makes me forget what is going on.. sort of?

Jesus Christ, I thought he stepped in dog crap but it turned out to be an ordinary leaf. 

>He's my son.

What.

Holy shit .. that was sad. Poor Kaori, poor Kousei.. I am going to be scarred. Why is this happening?

I don't really like how this anime cuts from the sad stuff, to the funny stuff in one instant. Oh well. It almost immediately went to some life counselling by a younger girl.. Funny.  

Welp back to the funny stuff.  
**KISS MARK?!** the hell

KAORI IS SO... PALE. I CAN'T LOOK. This is a sad episode, I like it, but dislike it for that reason. I want to order one happy ending please. "We don't have that right now!". A moderately happy one then? "Sorry, we only have the sad endin- no. The soul/heart-crushing ending in stock."

Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck 

Wow thought I heard Nagi no Asukara's Fonte OST coming up, I miss that song.

Is she in love? or...? no wait nevermind. She is sadistic!. Shit!

THE ONE SHE LOVES IS HER BROTHER. 

Back to the sad stuff, what oh what is Kaori dying from? Closest I've found is [Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_spastic_paraplegia). There is no treatment, but it also does not seem to be fatal. It may also be [Cerebral Palsy \(CP\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy), which is fatal. 

What the hell was that? The subber put it in quotes, and they showed a book. Was it a quote from that book? Was it real? "Want to commit double suicide with me?". Man I can't take this anymore I just want to know the ending.

..don't spoil me I am not going to read the manga I will stay and cry until the show ends... noo.

I normally don't watch airing shows, but I stumbled across this a couple days ago and something about it seemed similar to White Album 2, so I felt I should give it a try.

Got caught up to the airing episode after marathoning like 9 last night, and I'm enjoying it a lot so far. Some of the scenes tend to drag on, and could have been trimmed to give them more power, but overall it's a rollercoaster of a show.

I don't think it'll get a 10 like WA2 did from me, but it's definitely a good watch and I'm glad I picked it up. I'm kinda scared about where it's going, with the tone and narrative, I don't want Best Girl to die.
>> ARTICLE
How would you describe WA2 in a couple sentences? I've been meaning to watch it but need something of a nudge.
>> ARTICLE
Watch it dude, it's such a great portrayal of  real romance. The characters and decisions that they make are so relatable it's crazy.
>> ARTICLE
White Album 1 left a bad taste in my mouth haha. I will add WA2 to my cue, probably the next thing I'll watch.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't even finished watching WA1.

I started watching it because everyone was raving about WA2 so I watched the first couple of episodes and then ending up dropping it because I didn't like it and found out that the two seasons didn't correlate at all.

WA2 is completely standalone, it's just set in the same universe and has a few small insignificant references that really won't change much of your view on the series whether or not you've seen s1. It's by far my favorite romance anime and I don't think anything will beat it for a while.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah take my advice and don't pick WA1 back up. I made the mistake of watching it first because of the title, "Oh I hear WA2 is good so I should start with 1." newp. A grade A School Days level MC.
>> ARTICLE
that bad huh?

Well, thanks for the advice!
>> ARTICLE
Allow me to play devil's advocate.

I dislike WA2. It wasn't a bad show, infact it was good, but it was a boring one. If you seen any J/K drama, you can predict the whole show.

WA1 though, was an interesting show. It's less likely to attract the mass audience, but it juggles with more themes about young adulthood. I personally gave WA1 credit for what it sets out to do, even if the end is kinda badly wrapped up.
>> ARTICLE
It's good.  I really enjoyed watching it, and the soundtrack is the bomb.
>> ARTICLE
An amazing story about love, music, passion, determination, friendship, heartbreak, and pain.

It was the first show I ever gave a straight 10 on my MAL, and the only anime so far that actually made me, a grown ass man, cry.
>> ARTICLE
Welp time to get off my bum and watch it!
>> ARTICLE
Your description just made marathon the whole series. I honestly don't know what to feel right now. 
>> ARTICLE
You're not alone in that. I've finished several shows that have had an impact in different ways. TTGL, Steins;Gate, Code Geass, all were ones I sat and thought about for awhile after finishing.

But, man, White Album 2 just hit me like a train. It came in sweet and subdued, and ended in such a way that all I could think about was how badly I wanted them to finish the story.

The anime is actually only the first part of the Visual Novel I think, which I really need to sit down and play, but I don't think my feel-factor would survive it.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished reading some summaries of those other parts and various paths you can take in them. I can't imagine I would be able to emotionally handle watching them. Such an amazing story, and I can't believe this was only the beginning.

I'm a bit miffed that they used the translation " double suicide " instead of " lover's suicide ". Otherwise it's an amazing adaptation as usual. The minor details that you can't see in the manga such as Kaori's complexion becoming much paler and how thin her arms and legs have become really bring out the full effects of her[](/s " impending doom.")

I just came here to say  usually means Lover's suicide, but it can also be taken as double suicide. I am assuming Arima took it as double suicide while Kaori meant it as lover's suicide.

I thought the first few episodes were EXTREMELY beautiful. After that is became so depressing yet beautiful, I don't know what to think anymore.

I so much want Kaori to live. Still I think the story would be more interesting Kousei dying of his sadness and trying to cope with it without a clannad-like "happy" ending with kaori rising from the grave to give Kousei a beating because he did not practice enough.

I read your last sentence and somehow imagined the five different endings.  
Sadness - Coping with - Clannad 'happy' - Zombie Kaori- Comedy Zombie Kaori

I had to go back again and check that she actually just said **THAT** 
>> ARTICLE
She was quoting the book lying on the chair. Not that it makes it any less laden with meaning.

It shocked me, wtf level of shock. I'm guessing it will be treated as a joke in the next episode. Nervous laughter and then Kaori saying sorry.

Personally that aspect is going to annoy me to no end.

You know I'm fine with a [double suicide...](http://i.imgur.com/cL56VLF.jpg)

I feel like she is so dead at this point that she will have to make a miraculous recovery for there to be any more dramatic tension.

One particular point in the episode today ticked me off: at the end of last episode, we saw that Kaori couldn't move her legs. All of a sudden, in this episode, we see her in her school uniform and going shopping! This isn't explained and we are left to believe that her legs not moving just didn't happen! WTH?!?!?! Can someone explain this to me, as that last scene from last week's episode was particularly heart-renching and we are left hanging....
>> ARTICLE
I'm not a doctor but those things look like they're just occasional (until now at least). The same way she sometimes lets things fall off her hands but they usually work just fine.
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong, I really like this show... but sometimes there are just too many cringey quotes to handle.
>> ARTICLE
Despite my not caring for Kaori a great deal these writers/animators are just too good at building up a tragedy and conveying the characters emotion.
>> ARTICLE
It seems that Kaori is suffering from an onset of one of the various [motor neuron diseases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron_disease), most likely [ALS](http://www.alsa.org/about-als/what-is-als.html) which affects the upper and lower motor neurons in your body.

Motor neurons are basically the part of your brain that send electrical impulses to your muscles in order for them to move. A motor neuron disease generally results in the degeneration of motor neurons in your body, usually causing a feeling of weakness and the atrophy of various muscles in your body, most notably your arms, hands and legs at first. This would explain her not being able to grip the bottle when Kousei hands it to her, and why she keeps falling over. Her muscles are basically degenerating because they're not being told to move.

It's a horrible disease. In my opinion, it's one of the last things I would ever want to happen to myself or a loved one. It's basically a person helplessly wasting away, with no available cure, slowly losing the function of their body until they eventually can't walk, then they can't move their arms, then they can't move their fingers, then their more vital systems like their respiratory functions begin failing. It's basically that your body no longer listens to you, and you slowly waste away and die.

I'm not a health care worker of any sort, nor do I fully know the details of the disease or if it is even the one Kaori has. There may be others. All I know is, even with all the foreshadowing, I'm not ready for this. It reminds me of a certain arc in Space Brothers. I'm really not ready for this. Prepare yourselves.

Am I the only one who hates Watari? ...
>> ARTICLE
I can see why you might feel that way, but more based on what Kaori says about him than what he's doing. It seems to me that he's being "normal friend" to Kaori (which is a goddamn important thing to have), and the whole "Kaori likes Watari" dynamic is really just the filter she chooses to interact with Kousei.  I don't think Watari is actually acting under that assumption, or even believes it.
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty obvious that she uses that routine for Kousei. I had that suspicion from the very beginning. She knows something bad will happen to her soon, and doesn't want Kousei to be romantically involved with her because she doesn't want him to suffer. I'm still trying to figure out if the first meeting was planned for Kousei's sake as well, or if it was truly a coincidence. If it wasn't a coincidence, then Kaori's plan from the beginning involved helping Kousei get over his trauma. I don't know how to feel about that.
>> ARTICLE
Also Watari seems like he wants to help Kousei with Kaori, so he's obviously a good friend in all of this.

From early morning Nisekoi shenanigans to mid day Tokyo Ghoul action and now this. 

My emotions are all over the place. I don't think I've ever been this emotionally invested in an anime like this since Anohana or some of the Fairy Tail arcs.

Well last episode only had one death flag(albeit a big one), so this episode was making up for lost time? Poor Kousei, leaving the trauma of his Mother's illness behind, to be thrust back into it once again. On a lighter note, I love Nagi as a character, I think that she is an excellent way for both herself and kousei to deal with their issues and help each other at the same time.

Kaori's hair just scarin me. Crazy how a blander color of blonde is having this kind of effect on me. Loli blondie cute and lessons bring in a glimmer of comedy in what is turning into a sad show, but when I'm kinda hoping the love for hero stuff won't go into the Oreimo direction if you know what i am saying. Also happy that Seto views Arima as her kid. I'm glad hes got someone like that looking out for him now.

Most I can say friends is even though this is going to 22 episodes, we prolly don't have much time left for Kaori T.T

That last line made me go WHAT

GOD STOP THE DEATH FLAGS I CANT HANDLE IT
>> ARTICLE
Finally got around to watching this episode.

I've been seeing a lot of people complain about the constant moodwhiplash throughout the show, constantly alternating between the serious and the comedic. And they keep talking about how they have trouble taking both situations fairly/well since it happens so well.

Personally, I think it creates a nice contrast in Arima's life, and that it's fairly expected of a bunch of middle schoolers. They don't really want to tackle issues head on. They wanna sidestep around it, hide it behind a curtain, or pretend that there isn't really a problem. That explains some of the comedic scenes on one end.

On the other end, I think that the author is trying to establish that, despite all the fucking bullshit that's going on that's terrible, life still has its fun/happy moments. It's also to point out that to Kousei even after his mother dying, and even after Kaori's potential death/permanent handicap status, he still has a life to return to and that the world isn't going to end.
>> ARTICLE
WTH WAS THAT ENDING?!

"Want to commit lovers suicide with me?"

WTF WOMAN. GOD DAMNIT KAORI

I like how this whole time, Kousei has been saying that she brought color into his life, but at the same time she's losing hers. She made his life lively, at the cost of her own. The producers did a great job at remaking the scene from episode 2, where she was waiting for Watari. I thought it was deja vu, but it was to show how much she has changed. I can't wait for the finale.

No full performances of any classical music, though we got a few excerpts.

We did get to learn a little more about Nagi this week, like the fact that she's Takeshi's little sister (unsurprising), though she seems unhealthily obsessed with him - and so she apparently "hates" Kousei. Though in classic anime fashion, she ends up helping him work through his personal troubles.

And the melodrama continues.

Hullo everybody,
I'm sure everybody's question now is about whether Kaori will end up dying or not. While no direct answer can be given due to the nature of this thread, I very highly suggest you all take a look at the source material if you really wish to know. The manga recently ended so if you really have such an insatiable curiosity the answer is available. Pretty sure someone already mentioned this, but it is good information nonetheless. So anybody feeling uneasy about how the anime is going to end, know that that option exists if you so wish to use it. However, regardless of how the plot is wrapped up nobody should be deterred from finishing the anime as it still presents a good message. Enjoy the feels as plenty are sure to follow :3

Theres one thing i don't get. Why did his mom beat him? Like I dont understand her logic. "One day he won't have me" so I must beat the memory of me into him! Like wtf.
>> ARTICLE
For the drama.

...But actually it's ostensibly because she wanted to do everything she could to make him better at piano before she died, and as her condition worsened, she got stricter and more emotionally unstable.
>> ARTICLE
She was worried about leaving him with no means to provide for himself that she wanted him to be a perfect pianist, following the score perfectly. This caused her to get extremely strict with him and beat him when he did "wrong". It's a perfect example of the end not justifying the means. She knew she was only hurting him, as is shown at one point in the show, but she just couldn't get out of doing so.
>> ARTICLE
What if shes already dead, and living in kousei's subconscious?

Dont take this seriously 
>> ARTICLE
Can people really buy into this level of melodrama? I thought this show had a strong start but it has almost reached parody levels of hammy recently.
>> ARTICLE
...And unsurprisingly, /r/anime downvotes an opinion they disagree with.

I'm totally with you there. The show started on an okay note, but it's just gotten more and more overly melodramatic - and the one element of the show that's still supposed to evoke dramatic tension ends up being repeated literally every episode. Kousei's having trouble playing piano? Kaori's dying. Kousei performs at the gala concert? Kaori's dying. Kousei's unsure of his feelings for Kaori? Kaori's still dying.

Given that the show never gave me a reason to care about Kaori to begin with, it's just getting more and more tedious to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, why does the show have to shift tone so quickly? One second Kousei is talking about Kaori being so great and colorful while we get to see her crying and dying, next we get crazy hospital visit from all the friends where everyone is way too fucking energetic. It's like the show is trying to bait me into crying, but right when I'm about to start it's just like NOPE.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't give two shits about Nagi's character at this point in the story. All I think whenever she has a scene is, you're taking time away from Kaori you little creep. 
>> ARTICLE
She has more meaning later on in the series and like all the other characters and pianists she develops and is important to the plot
The themes of this show extend beyond Kaori and Arima's relationship
>> ARTICLE
I can see how she's important, but I still don't like the character. She actually thought about slamming the piano lid down on Arima's hands. And its not that she's taking time away from Kaori and Arimas relationship story, by now I think we all can see its doomed (hopefully not). Its her interruption of the stories flow that bothers me the most. Her introduction at an earlier time may have made it more acceptable to me. However right now, its building up to a crucial life altering moment. Which I feel Nagi takes away from with her stupid crusade to crush Arima. Again it boils down to at this particular moment I don't like Nagi's character at all.
>> ARTICLE
Wow what a choice of words to end on...thank jeebus I have my choice of Shirobako or Saenai Heroine to watch after this, gonna need some comedy :(

Its definitely frustrating, but I would rather them do it this way so that the anime and the manga are able to finish together and we get the true ending, rather than some fabricated one when the anime eventually passes the source material.

Going into it:

"Heh, considering last episode maybe we'll actually have *Arima's* performance this time! Ha! Just kidding, it'll be 25 minutes of flashbacks"

After watching it:

"Well.... I wasn't too far off....."

Edit: The name.
>> ARTICLE
The extended Emi flashback definitely could've been included in the last episode but even if that was done Kousei's performance wouldn't have fit into one episode. In the manga the performance is a little but more than three chapters long. Emi's flashback was extended to make the cutoff of Kousei's performance less awkward.

The show has been a very faithful adaptation of the manga, so the flashbacks were suppose to be there. The performances would've been emotionally empty without the flashbacks. You can argue about their placement and perhaps the story should've began from the very beginning but altering the story structure so much is something the manga author might not agree with.

I'm guessing that he's gonna end up playing the piano in order to improve Kaori's health just like he did with his mom. Hopefully it goes better than last time or else this is gonna get real grim.

I have a feeling that it's going to be tragic. Maybe something like:  she ends up dying and as a tribute he keeps on playing but in the way she wanted him to play. Freely without following the music score like the human metronome he used to be.

Yeah, it's pretty obvious this is the route the show will go.

>> ARTICLE
I only meant to playfully jab/slapstick him for playing the wrong notes.. It's not my fault he's not an anime character that doesnt bruise from that! I'm not the one at fault here, if this bastard would only play as I told him to!
>> ARTICLE
I have very rarely felt worse for someone in an anime then I did for Kousei in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. That was absolutely brutal. Kousei taking that much abuse for so long and at such a young age, all just so he can try and make his mom happy... that was just heart-wrenching to watch. The aftermath of that final performance where he snapped in front of all those people was probably inevitable, but it still hit like a sack of feels-bricks. 

And the worst part? I can't even bring myself to hate the mother. She was dying, and she was trying to give Kousei the life that she never could have as a musician. Her intentions were all good and fine from her point of view, and I think Kousei's little counter may have broken that, hence why she passed away so soon after. 

Goddamn. This show just doesn't let up. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah fuck that bitch.
>> ARTICLE
So, not saying you are wrong to feel that way, cuz it's a show and of course people are gonna read different things into it. But this woman is hitting a 10 year old in the head with a wooden cane, and she isn't holding back. 

I'm honestly having a hard time believing her intentions are to try to help Kousei with his music at *all*. The scene in which she beats him in this episode seemed much more to me like she is *angry* - maybe she's angry with her condition, or the fact that she never got to be a musician, but she is taking her rage out on Kousei, not trying to help him. She regularly strikes him on his *arms* - it's really hard to play an instrument with bruised arms (not impossible, but painful).  

I don't know if she was sick Kousei's whole life, but if not, I'd appreciate a scene where they show what she was like before being wheelchair bound/sick. I wonder if she was still abusive, or not, because that would be very telling.
>> ARTICLE
When Kousei was playing with Kaori and started bashing the keys in an effort to hear the notes, he has a small flashback of him mum without the the tubes, standing up, and in colour telling him (gently) not to bash the keys. Seems she started out teaching him purely for the sake of passion and became abusive *after* she got sick.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, someone else mentioned there was a flashback and I just could not figure out where it was. 

That kind of backs up what I think is wrong with his mom - I don't have trouble believing it started out with good intentions, but the abuse it devolves into is symptomatic of much larger problems than her just wanting him to become a successful player in her place. I think he became an outlet for her anger in the end (maybe out of jealousy/pain or frustration - also, where is his dad?), which is just tragically sad. 

I can't imagine much sadder than being a small child who starts off with a loving parent and a dream, and it turning into such a nightmare. It must have felt like such a betrayal. 
>> ARTICLE
No problem! But yes, she clearly had a lot of problems (terminal illness is of course hard to deal with, never achieving her own dreams etc.) and she would take them out on her son. 

We have heard Kousei say many times that no one understood, that no one was on his mother's side, and, while they knew about the abuse nobody did anything about it - quite possible because in a twisted way, it did achieve results i.e. Kousei sweeping the competitions. His dad seems to be away on business a lot (even when his mother was sick) and may or may not have been aware of the problem.

It's really very awful. I cried this episode when he finally confronted her, because it was a long time coming and yet he still suffered for it, because they were his last words to her. I can't imagine the guilt.

But her actions seemed to have transformed playing the piano from something he loved, to an obligation, and, after her death, something impossible.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I have a lot of feelings regarding the illnesses in this anime. We just found out a few months ago that my best friend has terminal cancer - she's 24 (a month younger than me). People always confuse us for sisters. She's an artist and is pursuing acting, and will forever be the coolest person I know - I don't know what Kaori is facing yet, but her "fuck it, don't back down" attitude reminds me so much of my friend, which is probably why Kaori will stay my favorite in this series. 

Contrast that with how Kousei's mother reacts and treats him, and I just feel so angry. I can't understand what it feels like to be in her position by myself, but I can understand Kousei's need to want to do whatever he can to help (even if his child's naivete makes him take it too far). And to see him be used and abused like that makes me sick to my stomach. I can't ever imagine my friend turning against me like that, because the only thing we can do now is to be together. I can't understand why you'd want to hurt someone who loves you the way his mother hurt him. 

I freakin' love Kousei so much, and I love the kids surrounding him and trying to help him in whatever way they can. Their methods may all have their flaws, because they're children, but god damn I really think they're going to help him through the trauma he suffered. 

Also, it's really *really* terrible that his dad did nothing to help Kousei and his mother out. I understand the rigors of the Japanese work ethic, but I don't think they're at all giving the father a free pass in the show. I hope they address the issue directly at some point. 

I just love to death how they've developed the characters in this show. Their emotions all feel so real, not like words written in a script. So the flip side is that the show makes me cry a lot (I know I'm not the only one), but I think I'm okay with that. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow... I'm so sorry to hear that. I wish you both the best.

Yes, you must really empathise with Kousei in such a situation. The fact that he doesn't even realise it's wrong, because he cares for his mother so much (even her manipulation, her "you have to play, else I won't get better" is awful, let alone all the physical abuse) and just wants her to be happy. To see her twist that wish is really difficult. It seems she may have realised what she had done after he finally stood up to her, but we have yet to see. Even then, I don't think there is any way she could possible make up for what she has done.

Yeah, I really feel for the characters, and while they may not be doing what's best for Kousei, they're trying. I think by the end of the anime they will probably have succeeded, fortunately ^^'

Yes, it is pretty awful. But in real life, situations like this do occur. However, in an anime where parents have had such an impact, I imagine it should be a matter of time before his father makes an appearance. Hopefully.

Yep, this is the kind of show where you really get all of the feelings, be they happy or sad. I look forward to it every week.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you, I appreciate that. 

I saw some comments saying the drama/issue's he's had with his playing and his mother have drawn on a bit too long, but I don't feel that way at all. If they're going to draw upon such serious subject matter, they're going to have to pay it proper attention. I wouldn't be surprised if it's a theme throughout almost the entire show - and there's 22 episodes, so I think they're moving along pretty well.

Also, jeez. For years, Kousei probably was close to believing that his skill at piano playing was keeping her alive - no wonder he played like a metronome. He had no room for emotion if he was trying to be so perfect that he kept his mother from dying. And then the one time he finally resists her, she dies shortly after. I think even most adults would internalize that as their fault, let alone a little kid. 

I'm really interested to see her reaction that they didn't show as well - I imagine they will. I hope if they show his dad, that he is still a good parent, even if he is absent a lot. It's hard to be both, but being a widower working parent in Japan is probably also incredibly difficult. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I saw them too. I was a little confused because a) they have had him stop playing two (maybe three, if you count the time in the cafe) times because of it (it being the premise of the show, that he can't hear piano notes) and b) he is clearly extremely traumatised, they can't really "pull that card too much" - a ridiculous claim in this situation I think.

When you consider how young he was, it is easy to believe that he was taking his mother's words literally. His reaction when he heard his mother was coming to watch him clearly shows that. And yep, that was what made me finally crack and start crying during the episode - how he would immediately start blaming himself.

I'm pretty sure they'll reveal her final day to us eventually, I'm excited to see how it went. And they definitely need to show his dad, we need to find out what role he played/plays in all of this.

Pretty much this. It sounds cold, but a lot of mothers have dreams that they couldn't fulfill before they realize they're dying. Doesn't make beating your kid that brutally when all they want is to make you happy even remotely acceptable.

I'm just going to pretend those weren't Kaori's meds in the bathroom, she just had to fill some scrips for her grandma and will take them to her after the competition.

yup, they just fell out of her purse in the bathroom because she couldn't quite make it home from the pharmacy before the competition is all.

I can't believe that we didn't even get to the end of Kousei's performance, but this episodes pacing didn't feel slow at all. First time in a long while that I've actually been surprised when the ending song came on.

Only 167.5 hours left till the next episode!

She has cancer I'm pretty sure. They both do/did. If it's a cocktail like that it has to be cancer and I recognize a few of those medications from what I had to take and what I saw others taking when I was in the hospital.
>> ARTICLE
God it's logical but I hope you're wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, sorry if I bummed you out, but yeah, chemo meds mainly come in packs like this so that you can easily know if you took it that day or not as opposed to coming in a jar. I was on some chemo meds for a period and even though mine came in a pill bottle, whenever I was in a hospital they came from strips like this. I'm pretty sure the long pill one is a chemo medication (usually coated like that so that they're long release) and the other two are anything from painkillers to another chemo med (there is a round one that's small like that) to iron (I'm almost certain that brown one is iron as they mentioned anemia and almost every single person with ANY auto immune disease has to take iron supplements).

This show is hitting way too damn close to home for me though between all of the medication, the abuse from his mother (my father and sister beat me as a child), the music (I played the piano from the age of like 2 on), and all of the death tones (I spent the last two years in the hospital literally dying) and being able to find your musical voice again. It's a damn good show, but it's a bit painful for me to watch and relate to, especially this episode.

This episode was dotted with refreshing scenes of childhood, they seemed brighter and vivid, especially Kousei's expression talking to them before he performed but her Mom just ruined it.  
Had some sympathy towards her but beating him with her cane in public was hard to watch,  she took her childhood and still couldnt be satisfied, it got more of a reaction from me, compared to shows like Parasite and Psycho Pass.

Another cliffhanger T_T and they stopped just before the best moment of the concours (IMO).

It was tough seeing animated the scene where his mother beats him with a rod, i felt really bad for him as he played as beautifuly as he could for her.

Also, i'm a bit sad about the musique before the OP, it was really weird and i didn't enjoy it at all.

And i'm having the feeling that Kaori-tan's condition is going to get worse and worse as time passes. WHY.

They're being really heavy handed with the foreshadowing on the Kaori front, the medication in her purse and the medication pile in Kousei's mother's sickroom :( I was hoping there wouldn't be a cliffhanger but alas, can I go ahead in time a week please >_<

I liked the bit before the OP. It was a bit odd when the young her was playing alongside the older her, but for the rest I thought it was a nice way to show some backstory about her.

I wonder if the mom is going to be redeemed in any way. Of course no one who beats her son with a cane can be right, it's just that at this point she is indeed just a demon puppeteer whose motivations we can only guess. Was it just frustration at facing sickness and death before accomplishing a successful career as a musician? Was there something more?

Also, the mix of the modern music and Emi's performance at the beginning was great. This show never disappoints in the sound department.

We never saw her facial expression after Kousei said his last words to her. I'm sure she felt regret after that.

[Prediction in spoiler tags just 'cause.](/s "She will have written a letter to him to apologize since she wouldn't have the chance to say it to him. That letter would hopefully get Kousei back onto his feet and move forward.")
>> ARTICLE
About that prediction: I don't know, it seems too convenient, imo.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, I don't see how a [](/s "letter") can "fix" years of emotional and physical abuse. If the show decides to go that route it would be really disappointing. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, me too. I'd rather Kousei comes to terms with it himself; that'd make him a very strong character. I think anything else would be detrimental to the story and the character, both of which have been superb until now.
>> ARTICLE
Her getting sick prevented her from becoming a great musician. She wanted her son to live her dream. That's what I think happened at least.
>> ARTICLE
All I can say is it makes sense the more you read the story and why/how things happened the way they did.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say so. Even as a manga reader, I honestly think her action was not justified.
>> ARTICLE
Beating a child with a cane is never justified. I don't care what reasons you have. Making your own kid bleed is disgusting. 
>> ARTICLE
Hasn't that been pretty explicitly stated?  I think they even said it this episode.  Not that I think it redeems her, of course.
>> ARTICLE
It was definitely the sickness. Remember how she taught him to play "twinkle twinkle little star"? 
>> ARTICLE
The thing that continues to impress me about this show (putting aside the amazing animation, music etc etc.) is how it approaches the extremely sensitive issue of child abuse, both physically and mentally.
>> ARTICLE
>is how it approaches the extremely sensitive issue of child abuse, both physically and mentally.

With a sledgehammer to your knees, so that you can't walk away and watch AGAIN AND AGAIN how bad Arima had it as a kid.
>> ARTICLE
I think it does approach those issues well. But Kousei's friends tend to make things worse for him, especially Kaori. They have been forcing him into playing music as if that will solve his problems and never address his relationship with his mother. I know in a story this might seem like the romantic way of fixing things, but it is really unrealistic in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I guess you have to remember that they are still just kids, delicate issues like this are a little bit beyond them; Also from what I can tell Kaori doesn't actually know about his mother's abuse, and it seems like a lot of it was hidden from Tsubaki as well.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really understand why there was no child protective services or anything when people were seeing him being beaten until he was bleeding and verbally abused..
>> ARTICLE
Someone in the crowd ran off to get the staff.

Probably has a lot to do with Japan and the mentality regarding child rearing there (not sure, but I'm willing to bet child abuse laws in Japan aren't as strict as here), but it's fairly common for crowds of people to [ignore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) things like that, even in the US.
>> ARTICLE
What about that scene from Wolf Children?
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea what scene you're talking about.
>> ARTICLE
Child services, Cause the children haven't gotten their shots and something.
>> ARTICLE
It was regarding vaccinations for them, I believe, which is probably the same law the US has (kids need vaccinations to enter public school.) I mean if they have the same vaccination laws, that's fine. I'm just saying in a general sense, there's probably more slack with regard to beating your kids as punishment.
>> ARTICLE
Most situations are ignored, noone wants to be alone in helping out. Though the one to help out first is usually the best bet to get others to help out as well.
>> ARTICLE
Well he said that was the last time he spoke to his mother.  As that scene was ending people in the crowd said to get someone to stop the abuse and people seemed to just be noticing the bruises for the first time. Since his mom died so shortly afterwards  it makes sense nothing was done. 
>> ARTICLE
[Both of them are well characterized rivals.](http://imgur.com/W3CaYrm)

[Her condition seems pretty bad, considering the amount.](http://imgur.com/qezLMl2)

[There's my comedic relief!](http://imgur.com/fb6w9nw)

[He certainly *looks* like he had enough.](http://imgur.com/4QkQTKv)

This time, we learn more about just how messed up Kousei's past really was. An abusive mother, both physically and mentally, put a massive strain on him throughout his childhood. At the same time, Kousei tried so hard and practiced so often not because he liked doing it, but because he really thought that winning and doing well would make his mother both healthy and happy. Despite always crushing the competition, the mother was just never satisfied, leading to his final words towards her.

This is the first episode that I actually find to be slightly disappointing. I'm guessing my worries will be resolved next episode, but after everything that Kousei has done and experienced: Kaori's playing, Kaori's encouragement, the support from his other friends, the emotion and drive behind his rivals, etc., he *still* has huge issues. Now, obviously, this episode was supposed to showcase why it is such a deeply rooted issue. And I guess I should be somewhat happy that he was at least able to hold his own for a minute or so. But this is the moment where he has to overcome his anxiety, his guilt, his *past.* I don't think using his "inability" to play the piano is going to work anymore beyond this competition. There are just too many factors working to help him to make it seem realistic enough.
>> ARTICLE
That last picture hurts to look at... Or think about, apparently.
>> ARTICLE
> He certainly looks like he had enough

When your happiness that your mother is out of the hospital shows in your performance, and you get beaten with a cane until you bleed because of it by that very mother, that's when anyone would have enough.
>> ARTICLE
I agree; I was really hoping he'd overcome his anxiety.  I suppose that's more of the story itself rather than the anime, but it just felt like it was time.
>> ARTICLE
I think it is almost paramount that it occurs next episode.

The "story" itself has really three plots going on at once: Kousei's musical troubles, Kaori's medical issues, and the developing relationship between the two (both on and off the stage). I think narratively speaking, the first one pretty much needs to be solved soon in order to transition our focus to the other two. Him constantly being held back by his mother's wishes loses its intended effect the more it is used. This is the second time, and while I'll say that I'm not fed up with it at this point, if it were to happen again I'm not sure I would agree with the writing at all.

It's hard, though, because I've never been in a position like that. Having to cope not only with an abusive parent but with trying to make someone else supremely happy only to be shot down time and again. I can appreciate, respect, and understand Kousei's feelings, but I personally cannot connect with his situation. So while I may want him to "just get over it," I need to come to terms with the fact that sometimes it isn't so easy.
>> ARTICLE
And sometimes it is impossible.
>> ARTICLE
It's even worse than you think because it looks like nobody helped him through it. Nowadays if somebody goes through child abuse like that, assuming it's as obvious and blatant as that (she beat him in public, like seriously? If it happened once it probably wasn't the first time) someone else usually gets involved. Even after his mom died it doesn't look like he got an mental help asides from his kid friends, who, let's be honest, are just kids. Child abuse is disgusting, and for me, realizing that there ARE KIDS that go through that stuff make me sick and feel bad for him.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair it's only twice that this was used, and a lot more detail was revealed in this second time.

So far, they're using it sparsely and very well I would say. It's only one season, so he should be getting over it soon.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that his rivals will approach him and offer to help him "hear the notes" again.
>> ARTICLE
That would be so cool!
>> ARTICLE
>[He certainly *looks* like he had enough.](http://imgur.com/4QkQTKv)

He looked way too much like [Pharos](http://i.imgur.com/ctSFltM.jpg) from Persona 3 in that scene, Pharos literally being [Persona 3 spoilers](/s "Death"), which is oddly appropriate...
>> ARTICLE
I waited all week for this and I STILL don't get to hear Arima's full performance ?! ^pls ^why ^you ^do ^dis
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, Arima couldn't hear it either.
>> ARTICLE
LOL i just died.
>> ARTICLE
so did his mother
>> ARTICLE
That scene of Emi climbing the jungle gym bar thingie and declaring she would be a pianist was so cute. It looks like Karoi does have a more severe condition that she let on. I can't believe how harsh his mom was, smacking him with her cane in public because of some small mistakes even after he got first place. 

I'm guessing he probably won't place in the top 3, but we are only at 9/22 episodes so there is still plenty of time for him to recover and make a full comeback later.
>> ARTICLE
Why am I the one crying? He is the one getting hit in the face fuck this episode. I didn't sign up for these feels.

I'm so ready. I've been listening to Op. 25 all week

edit: Not a fan of the Winter Wind arrangement at the beginning, but I do like that song a lot as Emi's theme. Kousei's Op 25 No 5 is a fantastic backdrop for the erraticism of Kousei's emotional state.

Kousei is just an amazingly built character. He's really real and well developed(?). Good god this anime is awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes I have to check my pulse when watching this show. The pressure man! Such a good job of presenting it. It's heart-pounding. There's so much intensity in both Takashi's and Emi's performances. So much drive. I'm how sure how they did it, but when Kousei started, you didn't feel that. It felt measured, and precise, as it should. I'm not sure how the sound guys pulled it off, but it was such a contrast. I loved it. 

Fuck his mom though. Fucking demon! His childhood is just fucked up. Fuck all that shit. I'll take my childhood of self-inflicted bruises and head collisions anyway. Fuck her. Fuck her ideals. Fuck her child rearing. 

Gah! Heh. If you guys are watching Chaika, [Chaika 2 Ep 9 spoilers](/s "Doesn't Gaz's speech feel fitting here? How do you get the strongest emotions? Fucking war. Let's turn the rage up to 11!")

Fuck. I'm calling it now. At some point Kaori is going to be hospitalized when Kousei has a performance, and will attend in a wheelchair in the same spot his mother had sat.

For the episode. I loved it, but I'm also disappointed that we got mainly flashbacks instead of Kousei's performance.

His mom though... What a bitch.

The way they started this episode was great. I love the way they showed Kousei's past. Being animated made it feel like it had more impact compared with the manga, that and the way they suggested but didn't outright say the reason for his inability to hear the piano was great too. Plus all the classical music in this episode....[mmmmmm](http://i.imgur.com/TjrJvk0.gif)

### Information on the Piano Competition Piece Selections 

(**Note**: This section will be repeated until the end of the competition; new stuff follows after this part.)

In the manga, the participants in the upcoming piano competition were required to play two pieces; one of their pieces must be a Chopin tude, and the other piece must come from J.S. Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier."  [Based on this image in the anime,](http://i.imgur.com/TLk2h2N.jpg) I originally thought that they would deviate from what the manga did; however, after this week's episode, I'm glad to find out that some of the competitors are playing some of the Prelude and Fuges in Bach's WTC.

## Chopin: tudes - Opus 10 and Opus 25

Chopin wrote three sets of *tudes* (French for *studies*); the most popular tudes are the Opus 10 and Opus 25 studies where each one consists of 12 different studies, and the third set consists of three tudes with no Opus number.  These studies presented a new way to play piano, and they were radical and revolutionary when they first appeared.  They are also some of the most challenging and evocative pieces in classical repertoire, and this is one of the reasons why they're still popular to this day (I'm glad to say I know how to play a couple of them! XD).  

The Opus 10 tudes were composed between 1829 and 1832, and were published in 1833 when he was 23 years old.  He dedicated the Opus 10 set to his good friend Franz Liszt (another famous composer).  The Opus 25 tudes were composed at various times between 1832 and 1836, and were published in 1837. The final three tudes, part of a series called "*Mthode des mthodes de piano*" compiled by Moscheles and Ftis, were composed in 1839, without an assigned opus number.

Out of the Opus 10 and 25 tudes Chopin wrote, the more popular ones have been given nicknames; some examples include:

* Opus 10, No. 3: nicknamed "**Tristesse**" (meaning Sadness) or "**L'Adieu**" (meaning Farewell) 
* Opus 10, No. 5: nicknamed "**Black Keys**" since the right hand is only played with the black keys of the piano, except for only **one** white key [(yes, only **one** key (the only white key plays the note in red)).](http://i.imgur.com/pWNSIuI.png)
* Opus 10, No. 12: nicknamed "**Revolutionary**" due to it's powerful and strong melody.
* Opus 25, No. 9: nicknamed "**Butterfly**" due to light and bouncy nature of the right hand.
* Opus 25, No. 11: nicknamed "**Winter Wind**"; listen to it and you'll understand why this name is perfect.
* Opus 25, No. 12: nicknamed "**Ocean**" due to the stormy sound of the arpeggios.

Although no nicknames are of Chopin's original creation, they create interesting pretext and encourage the imagination to fabricate epic works embodied by these studies.

## Bach: The Well-Tempered Clavier (Book I: BMV 846 - 869; Book II: BMV 870 - 893)

The Well-Tempered Clavier is a collection of solo keyboard music composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. He gave the title to a book of preludes and fugues in all 24 major and minor keys, dated 1722, composed "for the profit and use of musical youth desirous of learning, and especially for the pastime of those already skilled in this study". Bach later compiled a second book of the same kind, dated 1742, with the title *Twenty-four Preludes and Fugues*. The two works are now considered to make up a single work, *The Well-Tempered Clavier*, or "the 48", and are referred to as The Well-Tempered Clavier Book I and The Well-Tempered Clavier Book II respectively. This collection is generally regarded as being among the most influential works in the history of Western classical music.

Each of Book I and Book II contain twenty-four pairs of preludes and fugues. The first pair is in C major, the second in C minor, the third in C-sharp major, the fourth in C-sharp minor, and so on. The rising chromatic pattern continues until every key has been represented, finishing with a B-minor fugue.

Bach's title suggests that he had written for a (12-note) well-tempered tuning system in which all keys sounded in tune (also known as "circular temperament"). The opposing system in Bach's day was meantone temperament in which keys with many accidentals sound out of tune.  It is sometimes assumed that Bach intended equal temperament, the standard modern keyboard tuning which became popular after Bach's death, but modern scholars suggest instead a form of well temperament. There is debate whether Bach meant a range of similar temperaments, perhaps even altered slightly in practice from piece to piece, or a single specific "well-tempered" solution for all purposes.

## Episode 09 List of Classical Performances:

This week's main performance is courtesy of Kousei.

---

**Chopin: tude in E minor ("Wrong Notes"), Opus 25, No. 5** - This tude is nicknamed "Wrong Notes" by a few, and it makes sense when you listen to the piece.  "The main theme abounds with minor second intervals, leading to a feeling that the notes are wrong. The melody is carried on like this for a while, with difficulties being large rolls and ornaments in the left hand that can get quite intricate at times. A less substantial challenge is the dotted rhythm, somewhat similar to the one found in the Etude Op. 25 No. 3. The original theme repeats once before progressing to a middle section written in E major. The new theme is made of left hand chords and octaves while the right hand swoops up and down the keyboard in an accompaniment that can span several octaves at a time. This portion is structurally very similar to the middle section of Liszts Transcendental Etude No. 4. This new theme also repeats once before returning to the original theme. The ending is completely different than either theme: it is much stronger and very heroic, with a strong dominant seventh arpeggio upwards and ending powerfully on a G sharp. Musically, it is tricky due to the presence of "wrong" notes." [(Source)](http://www.ourchopin.com/analysis/etude25.html)

Here's what wikipedia had to say about the structure of the tude: "After the first theme of 'minor seconds' closes, Chopin introduces a Pi Lento section in which a new melody (without dissonant minor seconds) is played in the parallel key, E major. The final section of the piece starts with a recapitulation of the first theme, with climaxes in a coda played in E Major.

The second section is marked as *Pi Lento* (*It.* More Slow) despite Chopin's metronome mark of =168, a very quick tempo.

tude Op. 25, No. 5 features an unusual overall structure, surrounding a major second theme, with the minor main theme. This idea appears only one other time in Chopin's set, in tude Op. 25, No. 10. Styling the tudes in this fashion further emphasizes Chopin's deviation from the standard set before him by composers such as Carl Czerny. Both are structured much like the sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven, in which Beethoven set apart three movements in this same structure."

Here's an interpretation of this study by [Evgeny Kissin](http://youtu.be/xCEQdUlxbJY) and [Andrew Tyson.](http://youtu.be/zVe8xsOg1kc)

This week, everyone has boarded the feels roller coaster, and we've just reached the first of many loop de loops!  We finally get to see how brutal his mother was and it definitely brought tears to my eyes as I was forced to remember something I didn't want to remember reading.  I loved the cliff hanger that the anime used because it was the same exact cliffhanger used in the manga (see [this image](http://i.imgur.com/b9H4jMx.jpg) and [this image](http://i.imgur.com/dcKhBZm.jpg) to see what I mean; in addition, I'm pleased with how faithful this adaptation has been).  Next week, we will if Kousei can get through this.  Given how inspired he was by Takeshi's and Emi's performances, and how much Kaori has helped him, I can promise you that even though things look bad now, it will end on a rather satisfactory note.  [The parts that hit home for me was seeing (Manga Spoiler)](/s "more sunflowers, an illusion Emi had for a moment where she sees a younger Kousei playing the piano again, Kaori stating that Kousei was finally back, and the fact that Kousei "saw" his mother...S...S...SMILING...after his performance.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen...you read that correctly...she fucking SMILED after Kousei successfully overcame this trial.")  Furthermore, given where the episode left off chapter-wise in the manga, it looks like we're in for quite the juicy cliffhanger to wrap up the first cour.  I can't wait to see you all go nuts over it in two weeks. XD

Thanks again for taking the time to read my post this week! I hope you're looking forward to next week's episode as much as I am! :-)

Well this was really unexpected, his final words was that he wanted her to die, that's more than sad... The entire episode did only advance like a couple of minutes in real time, but the entire ride was emotional as hell. We should not forget the backstory of Igawa Emi because that was amazingly done. Holy crap what a great episode!

But to end it again without hearing him play the entire piece is the worst kind of torture! I can't even describe how much I look forward to next episode. Holy crap this anime is brilliant!

I thought that finally!! we could see Kousei play. Nah.
But.. i guess we could finally see through how much shit that guy went when he was younger.
That and I don't think Kaori only has anemia.

Will it soon be Kaori in the special spot, when she gets hospitalized? That was a lot of medication and with the vibe she's giving off, it doesn't look well.

I hope he will finally be able to get over his trauma the next episode and that he will be able to play with warmth, colours and emotions. I hope he will be able to pull off a performance like Kaori did in the first episode, even if he doesn't win with it.

Damn. Every time [this theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoSnwZ7dGAk) plays, I get goosebumps. I was expecting Kousei to go ham for a full performance right after that theme played in this episode, but instead, we got a flashback and a cliffhanger.

Honestly, despite the show waving Arima's performance in my face and only giving me a little of it I still enjoyed his new character development. Really explains just how complicated the situation was with his mom. 

10/10 for me.

Edit: This show is my AOTS at the moment by a long shot.
>> ARTICLE
no character had bigger death flag than kao-chan. also, this show defo know how to make me wait. dem cliffhangers, been waiting for 2 episodes already
>> ARTICLE
Wow, my heart is beating like crazy. This show has so much tension! All the competition-episodes are like that but this one... so many feels... AND THEN - it's over. *sigh*
>> ARTICLE
I thought I was the only one.  I think I *felt* his anxiety.  It was not pleasant.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, very heavy strong episode.

The child abuse was horrible, how old was he ? 4 or 5 ? The hell? , this episode made us understand his condition.

>> ARTICLE
I've only just noticed the way in which this show distorts and destroys Kousie's mothers face, take [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/JXclK59.png) for instance where they cut off her eyes, its an incredibly unnatural way to frame someone. It makes her look like a villain but it also removes part of her individuality and identity.

Its also something that Kousie himself [mentions](http://i.imgur.com/49TzSqj.png) near the end of the episode.

There's a lot about his mother that they don't tell us about, the most interesting thing is why she acted so cruelly towards him. My guess is that its because she was dying she was trying to live her life thought him. She projected all her aspirations for herself on to him, with the result that she ruined his life. She forgot that the person she was yelling at was a child and a son.

If so then Kousie's inability to remember her face would be the ultimate "Damnatio Memoriae", a total rejection of her legacy as a musician.

This is why I think the only way he will ever be able to play again would be by coming to terms with the harm his mother inflicted on him. She taught him to play for her and he needs to learn to play for himself, otherwise it will always be a mental block to him.
>> ARTICLE
Surprised people thought last week that Arima would successfully play during this competition as the show would likely be over then.  It would make more sense for him to falter in front of an audience and those that look up to him, and then to later bounce back after he recovers.

That was the reason for the complaints about Kaori as well -- she didn't do much of anything to help him other than brute force him into playing again.  Something like this was inevitable.
>> ARTICLE
As much as I like this show it is dragging out way too much. I honestly think it could have been completed in a 13-15 episode time frame. 

It really needs to pick up from here.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the source material isn't finished yet, they will end together in the spring. This means we get a true ending, which I prefer, as well as development that isn't rushed. 

That being said I'm so anxious to see Kousei finish his performance already!
>> ARTICLE
I loved the episode and the progress but that ending is pretty frustrating to me. We already saw him go through this multiple times. We got to the deeper part of his past this time so I understand why it ended like it did but I feel like I've seen it over and over already. I guess the one thing I did like about it is that this time Emi and Goku are there to witness him on stage and see firsthand what his issue is instead of just thinking he ran away from music without a comprehensible reason. 

Everything else was great. Emi's passion after her performance and then the flashback to where she decided to become a pianist were really great. Kaori's medicine thing seems like some more foreshadowing. We know she has a medical situation but now its being  confirmed as something to really worry about. 

I really like how they show Tsubaki always by Kousei's side. We know they are childhood friends but this episode reinforces their connection without putting the splotlight on her. She is there for every rough moment. When he's being beaten, after his mother passes away, etc she is always there.

I'm predicting Kousei has a turn around this next episode and starts playing with Kaori-passion - a bit off the scripted style. He'll confront and break through the barrier his mom has created. Well, its either that or another breakdown and he'd have to be built up again.

I stayed up all the way till 4 am on a school night to watch this, totally worth it

I'm gonna be so salty if/when Kaori starts to take a turn for the worse.

I feel like the pacing is a bit off recently, with too many flashbacks and repeated scenes each episode. While I do like seeing the rivals' backgrounds for instance, I felt they were pretty fully explained last episode, making the first 4 minutes of this one a bit wasted. 

That said, things are still hitting home as they explore more thoroughly just how badly Kousei's mom scarred him with her mental and physical abuse. And perhaps even worse than that, the scarring his own guilt would leave from having his last words to her be "I hope you die!". Regardless of how terrible she might have been in her final days to him, it's very difficult to get a young kid like that to truly hate his mom. I imagine not being able to retract that last statement will have been the larger scar, all things considered. 
>> ARTICLE
The pacing has been brutal these last 2 episodes. Some great parts, but way too much time spent showing nothing.
>> ARTICLE
I'll admit I had to pause the episode one time because my heart was pounding so fast.

What a fucking episode!
>> ARTICLE
I love the show and its character development. The abuse (particularly the physical abuse) by the mother was certainly very potent, but at the same time, with how liberal the show has been with violence to the point of turning it into a joke, I can't help but feel like one of the pieces doesn't fit. I'm all for humor and all, especially since it does make some characters more "fun", but this is a little inconsistent.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad they slightly redrew Kousei et al. to look a bit older in the past. The time lapse of 2 years just seemed so strange since he looked way too young every time they showed his breakdown compared to his present self.
>> ARTICLE
I was supposed to get closure this week :(
>> ARTICLE
i swore to myself that i would stop watching this if Kousei didnt play today....
There is teasing and there is making someone lose interest. This show is the latter :(
>> ARTICLE
Technically he did play for like 40 seconds.
>> ARTICLE
Don't.. don't tell me Kaori is going to take Kouseis mums special spot in the wheelchair and all. The spot where he can see her sick during every contest. Please tell me this does not come true :(
>> ARTICLE
ohhhhh sheeeeet...
y u say dis ;-;

>> ARTICLE
Not to sound cruel but I was relieved to see his problem at the piano coming back, it would be really unnatural development to have him be awesome at performing after 2 years of no competing.  With that much baggage, nobody would be 100% back to glory, it makes sense for his performance to be faltering.  I do want to see him past these problems by the end of the show though, it would be depressing if the show concludes everything with his problems still affecting his ability like this. 
>> ARTICLE
I really love just how real this show is.

And not that cliche as hell real that makes your cringe when you watch it.

But "real" I can fear for him. the abuse is portrayed as so real. he does things so real. He faces his problems like a real person would.


I also love how true its staying to the manga.  

Even though i know whats going to happen i still feel for him all over again.

This is my new favorite show.
>> ARTICLE
That beginning of this episode was intense. The music was perfect.

What a cliffhanger.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I do appreciate that they added another layer of complexity to Kousei's relationship with his mom, but holy hell this was not how I was expecting it to go.

To be totally honest, I'm not really that thrilled with the way the direction set her up in a few places. Her haunting him is okay, but the creepy smiles are just a bit too far. She wasn't a demon, and he knew that. She didn't make him suffer out of malevolence, and he knew that, too. All those shots of her smile seems to indicate that she enjoys his suffering, but that's wrong. That's not how it went at all. Bad direction, if you ask me. 

I'm also kind of bummed that they added the weird instrumental stuff to Emi's performance at the beginning of the episode. It sucked out all the passion that the performance last week had. :(

Either way, it seems just as many of Kousei's issues come from himself as they do from his mother. Just makes me want to see him triumph over this and learn to live again all that much more.

EDIT: [~Full Episode Notes~](http://reallifeanime.wordpress.com/2014/12/04/your-lie-in-april-episode-9/)
>> ARTICLE
> All those shots of her smile seems to indicate that she enjoys his suffering

She's dead. What does an apparition of her have to do with her feelings? I mean, it's Kousei's trauma. Of course it's not going to mirror reality.

If you want indications of her feelings, the fact that she succumbed to her illness right after Kousei told her to die is way more telling. 
>> ARTICLE
You're skipping over what I said before about what he knew. It's not about what happened in reality; you're exactly right. It's about Kousei's perception of reality and of his mother.

Presenting her like demon seems to pretty much contradict all the other information we were fed about their relationship. If there's any emotion that we were lead to believe Kousei has about that relationshipit's *guilt.* He feels the weight of his last words to his mother being "I wish you would die" and her dying right after he said that. *That's* what this episode told us his trauma isnot the oppression of his mother.

Think about it. Up until when she beat him with the cane and he wished her dead, he was *happy* to put up with her abuse because he loved her. He wanted to make her happy, to win competitions, and help her get better. It was in that one moment that his feelings changed, and then she diedleaving him with guilt.

So, it seems to me that the way the apparition of his mother appears directly contradicts everything else we've been lead to believe about their relationship and how he feels about his mother.
>> ARTICLE
What I was getting at was that it was a *trauma*. It's going to make everything negative. Just because he loved her and was happy to put up with it, doesn't mean he thought everything was fine and dandy. The part of him that told her to die views his mother very negatively because of the abuse he received. His feelings for her are not as straightforward and simple as just guilt. It's a whole mix of things, and it includes feelings like fear and anger.


>> ARTICLE
I agree that it's more complicated than guilt, but I still think the episode sold that as the dominant emotion.

Really, though, it's just a matter of presentation. The content is good, but the way they're conveying it visually on screen seems to be just a little bit off to me.
>> ARTICLE
I really didn't think there was a problem though. Like, how Kousei said that after he said what he did, he couldn't remember the face she made. We can guess it was how you'd expect, but his mind is instead filling in that blank slate with something twisted as further punishment. Kousei couldn't possibly know how she truly felt about him, so of course there's that worry that she didn't love him. His trauma feeds on that, and presents her exactly like that.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus the feels during that beating scene. 

[Manga Spoiler](/s "Got reminded about the part in the manga where Kousei's mom is all sad and shit when she's dying and how she wants to leave Kousei with something and for him to be able to support himself when she's gone etc. That scene nearly made me tear up ;_;")
>> ARTICLE
Dude you and I both, I was doing everything I possibly could to not spoil the anime watchers though.  All I can say is wait for catharsis.
>> ARTICLE
I know we need to know where he came from and what he suffered, but I wanna hear him play. 

Was thinking mom was somewhat good since she's telling him he did a good job, but she goes around hitting him in front of others. Not cool, you do that at home. The beatings reminded of Michiru from Grisaia. 

Well, sounds like he lost this one. Wonder what's gonna happen now. Is [Kaori](/s "gonna take her place in that special seat?")
>> ARTICLE
Ugh... A-1 you've drawn this competition out enough already. Come on, now, we're all antsy waiting for the conclusion at this point.

That beating was brutal, though. It's kind of surprising that he doesn't have more issues related to that, in my opinion.

The other thing that stuck out to me was I really didn't like what they did to Emi's performance. The drums sounded very out of place and sort of corrupted it.

Overall the episode was still really good, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. Can't say I'm all that happy with it.
>> ARTICLE
Just cause I want to throw out a crazy theory, Kaori is suffering the same disease as the mom.  Reasoning:

1) lots of meds shown in mom's hospital and Kaori had lots of meds.  

2) Fuck the feels

3) used to get Arima over his condition even more, or mess him up...  


Well that was fun, now for the unpleasant 7 day wait...
>> ARTICLE
My expectations were extremely high for this episode considering how epic and amazing the two episodes were in the case of the performances and detailed back stories. This episode was actual great but it didn't match up to the show's perfection. I like how the show is introducing Arima's story very slowly to continue to be curious instead of showing everything in a single episode. Either way, I wanted to see Kosei play, oh well. 9/10
>> ARTICLE
Okay this show offers great insight and is quite profound. But seriously this wasn't an episode, it was braindead fucking nothing. Also, can we have an actual introduction, not a copy+paste of the last 2 minutes of the last episode with useless backstory? And for the love of God, don't remix one of Chopin's greatest works like the Winter Wind Etude -- that introduction was complete horsefuck.
>> ARTICLE
You're not alone in that... my goodness. What a butchering of the etude.
>> ARTICLE
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO

why the cliffhanger!
>> ARTICLE
Fuck this...another week to wait. God I wish I could marathon this anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad this anime is 22 episodes, there seems to be a lot to explore especially since we learned that Kaori has some kind of medical condition. My guess is that his performance is only going to get worse but now since kousei's  harem is complete with emi and goku joining they all will slowly help rehabilitate him. 
>> ARTICLE
It'll hopefully balance out because it feels like each episode is 5 goddamn minutes.
>> ARTICLE
Well we now know she'll die at the end also guys if you want to read the manga I believe the show boss caught up to chapter 14 or something like that and you can read it now 
>> ARTICLE
this is the first anime I follow on a week to week basis, damn so hard with all these cliffhangers
>> ARTICLE
More 32140 episodes to listen Arima playing the piano? Wtf please let the backstories for after this, and let us see the whole perfomance please, although it was a good episode.
>> ARTICLE
Kaori is on medicine, just like Kousei's mom was. I have a feeling this might come in to play later but I don't know if it's going to cause some crazy flashback or not.

That scene with his mother beating him. Wow. That was the first thing that has moved me to tears in a while. There are parenta like that, some beat there kids because they can, some do it because of their kids not living up to expectations like his mother. It's sickening, but that scene was brilliant.

These cliffhangers are killer, I can't wait for next week to come even though the episode will feel like it's passing by in 2 minutes.
>> ARTICLE
What happened to kousei's dad again? o.o
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that child abuse. I can't wait for next Thursday!
>> ARTICLE
That medication on the table when Kousei's mom was in the hospital looks kind of familiar wouldn't you say?
>> ARTICLE
This show gives me anxiety to watch it but I love it.  I only wish I had waited until it finished to marathon it, the weekly wait is killing me.
>> ARTICLE
The way that this show just continues to pound you into the ground with emotion is definitely something I have yet to see. I'm relatively new to the Slice of Life "game" but my goodness. Next week looks to be promising. 

Sidenote: Tsubaki was too cute. Worrying about the performance while Kousei worried about it :D
>> ARTICLE
Im really picky with my animes and Im just straight up annoyed now with seeing Kousei keep messing up because of his mom. Its extremely realistic and A1 is doing a great job of sowing it, but I personally just hate seeing my favorite characters do poorly regardless of their situation. Especially when i can't marathon to the part when they start kicking ass.    
Its just basically getting old for me, seeing Kousei fuck up his performances
>> ARTICLE
Kaori is on a ton of medication. During the flashback to Kousei's mom in the hospital, she had a lot of medication too. If the show hasn't hinted at it enough already, Kaori more than likely has a terminal illness. 

Kousei's mom was living voraciously through him. It still doesn't excuse the abusive behavior at all. I wonder why no one else has said anything about the obvious signs of abuse. I imagine child abuse laws are different in Japan, but for a country with a negative population growth you'd think they'd try to do everything they can to protect the children. Or is it a cultural thing where they believe family life is private and even though the poor kid is being beaten, they should stay out of it? I can understand Tsubaki and Watari wouldn't quite understand what was going on, but I'd imagine every once in a while they'd talk to their parents and bring it up in passing. Even Tsubaki had to bring over some actual nutritionally balanced food once in a while, so maybe her parents and Kousei's mom were close at one point?

I can understand how wishing your terminally ill mother to die as the last thing you ever say to her would fuck you up (along with the abuse). But I think the first step to recovery is Kousei admitting to himself that even though those were the last words out of his mouth, his mom probably still loved him deep somewhere in her heart. She probably had regrets on her death bed, too.
>> ARTICLE
I think his mother wasnt acting like that for no reason,i know there is no   excuse for child abuse 

I think she was being very strict and harsh to him because she knew   that she was dying and no cure for her and probably thought she should   teach him to perfect the piano as her parting gift to her son so that it   be a stepping stone for his future since no one else seems to be around   to take care of him and with little time she had,she couldnt afford to do   things slow
>> ARTICLE
Was anybody else getting really nervous when Kousei was about to play. Oh man my heart, that was an intense episode
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mind the flashbacks, it gave me chills.. the cliff hangers are pretty steep though.
I was so ready to wait this anime out till the end then watch it, but its just too good

>> ARTICLE
They would split it into two parts. I can't take it! One minute I'm happy and pumped and ready to hear him play, now I'm all sad and thinking about how awful his mother really was to him.
>> ARTICLE
That was way more depressing than I wanted it to be.  :/  I was like yay!  Kousei piano time! ... nope. 
>> ARTICLE
The first 5 minutes was review of the last episode plus a little more backstory. Right there and then I knew the whole episode was going to be flashbacks...
>> ARTICLE
Another goddamn cliffhanger.  
This episode reminds me of NGE.  
I can't wait for next week.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why so much people were complaining about the ep but that was one of the most emotional eps out so far I was crying manly tears for a while when his mom was being well his mom after the performance that was some emotional shit right there
>> ARTICLE
I was so frustrated, 'cause of course I wanted to see Kousei's performance, but the episode (as usual) was soooo good...the mother's flashbacks are just climbing up until...well...you know. Awesome episode, thanks A-1 Pictures!
>> ARTICLE
Kousei's mother is worse than ghost banri. Please leave him alone now.
>> ARTICLE
Damn... I cried so much during the flashback. So damn sad. I cannot wait for the next episode. 
>> ARTICLE
*Hears drums*
That's freaking cheating girl. It's bloody unfair, apologise to the other contestants! You can't beatbox while playing the piano!
>> ARTICLE
The blue balls this show is giving really makes me want to read the manga, but I think this is one of the rare times I feel that a show will surpass the source material, mainly due to the beauty of hearing and seeing the intensity with which they play their instruments. Still, I'm only so patient. >.>
>> ARTICLE
Ok this one made me cry, as soon as he throwed the score to her I knew what was coming, she was abussive towards him, but a ten year old is not going to really hate his mom even if he says so, and losing her like that is the worse that could happen to him, no one wants to lose their mom after telling her "I wish you would just die"

I don't think the feels train is ever going to stop on this show :[

Holy shit and here I thought ragyo was the worst mom in anime. Also my heart is beating like crazy, what an episode.

The wide range amount of emotions this show makes me feel in just 23 minutes it's fucking unbelievable. 
>> ARTICLE
Liked how mc was just casually playing the moonlight sonata movt 3 while building his harem at grade 3. 

That has to be the most OP thing i've seen in anime that probably has been obtained in real life. 
>> ARTICLE
More heavy-handedness (though I'm used to it by now), more stuff being dragged out... We do get to see Kousei's exact final conversation with his mom, but it's not exactly huge news. Kousei's mom turned into a real abusive piece of shit after she got sick.
>> ARTICLE
If he doesn't overcome his trauma after the next episode I'm dropping this shitty pos 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, the fact that you actually *see* his mother hitting him makes it so much worse. Even if it's just animated, actually having it like that as opposed to just mentioned in passing makes it so much more engaging. I truly felt bad for Kousei.

Also, Kaori, **you better not fucking die**. If Kaori has what Kousei's mother had... well, Kousei better play his heart out until she gets better. I swear, we're not even half way in and it's laready starting to become an angst fest.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not actually upset that Kousei didn't get to play this episode. Given that it's a 2-cour, I think it's to be expected, and having that divide between successfully playing and (possible) failure is a lot better spread over two episodes. It's fitting for such a series to be an emotional roller coaster, and  I enjoyed the episode.
>> ARTICLE
So I wasn't too big a fan of this series at the start, I felt the visuals were a little to in-your-face symbolic, and I found the dialogue a bit cheesy. I don't know what changed, but I have been loving episodes 6-9. 

Maybe it's because these episodes are really about putting yourself in the piece (something that really rings with me as a musician), and that piano solo from Emi was jaw dropping. The animation, which previously was rather inconsistent, has been holding up solidly and looking really fantastic so far, so I really don't have any complaints. 

If you wanted to show someone a good anime to make them realize anime isn't just a bunch of shounens and tentacle porn, I'd say this is a good one for those who aren't big fans of action/adventure (Cowboy Bebop).  

The dialogue still feels very poetic in it's style, (I'd say about 70-30 from poetic inner monologue to actual conversations, lol) but at least for now it hasn't been bothering me, though in the back of my head I do think from time to time how some of what they're saying doesn't seem by any means spontaneous. I can imagine that this style would flow much better in the manga though, which I think I may pick up if it gets localized.

This and Yuki Yuna have really been bringing it lately, and I am excitedly looking forward to the next episode. I was trying to wait until most of the shows were done to catch up, or catch up slowly, but I couldn't stop myself. 

[edit]: Almost forgot to mention his mothers abuse. Dang that scene where she hits him was jarring and unexpected. I think it's incredibly well presented, particularly how you can never see the look in her eyes. It's not unreasonable that he blames himself either, though I'm surprised that considering how his mom was publicly known to abuse her son that nobody called the police (though perhaps Japan's different, I don't know.)
>> ARTICLE
Seriously fuck Arimas mother. What a bitch.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how much the NFL is going to fine Kousei's mom.
>> ARTICLE
Suspended for life.


>> ARTICLE
I was all hyped up to see Arima play, and then a bunch of backstory. I was disappointed, but it felt satisfying Arima talking back against the whore.
>> ARTICLE
**Wild prediction:**

 Kousei's mother never died. Kousei saying "I wish you were dead" caused a change of heart. Then some sort of weird magical thing happened and his mother was reincarnated as Kaori. However, she still only has a short time to live and must take all these freaking meds to stay alive. His mother (now in Kaori form) still loves her son, but sees the mistake of her old ways and now wants Kousei to play music creatively. That's why Kaori (aka ghost of Kousei's mom who is trapped on Earth) is so desperate to hear Kousei play again before she disappears. 

What do you guys think?

Edit: I just realized that the manga readers probably think that I'm an idiot, but man, if I was right... wouldn't that be some shit? uggggghhhhhh Kaori is reaching best girl OTS for me status and I would rather see her as some sort of happy mom angel than a terminal feels bomb. Pls save Kaori :( 
>> ARTICLE
That would actually be pretty interesting and isn't *as crazy* as some people might think. However, the general direction of the show just doesn't feel that way. If it had any supernatural elements at all, it probably would've shown some by now.
>> ARTICLE
Felt like a buildup to the big finale. Kaori has her big surgery while Kousei performs in what will be his entrance exam to a Japanese high school.


I really wished there was a confession on the rooftop. I can understand why there wasn't, they both know she is on a timer and any feelings expressed now would only hurt the both of them. But I really wish one of them said it.


Seems like the last episode will be a miracle ending or a bittersweet one. There certainly isn't enough time for Kousei and Kaori to play together again, unless there is a timeskip. I wouldn't mind a copout miracle ending at this point, but I can understand why it would end with just Kousei alone.
>> ARTICLE
I would personally would love an asspull ending as long as it's a happy ending.
>> ARTICLE
All throughout the show I have been convinced that Kaori is going to die, but now, with this episode, I'm not so sure. 

Either she will and Kousei will find strength in his friends and rivals to move on and find happiness.....or

She will survive and we end with a miracle and she at least gets more time with him (I sort of doubt this but I can hope right?)


>> ARTICLE
Or we get a time skip to a tombstone of a longer than the anime but still short lived kaori.  Then they can milk both the "YES!  SHE LIVED!" emotions and the "OHGOD SHE DIED!" emotions.
>> ARTICLE
What they\'re doing is giving us death billboards every episode and then sprinkle in hope just before the end. Cruel assholes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it could really go with both ways. And honestly, I wouldn't think negatively of this show if she does come out surviving this ordeal. 

There's different ways they can handle this depending on what the anime staff ends up with. Either way, it's been a fun and dramatic ride to get here. That's what's important.
>> ARTICLE
If the series as a whole so far is any clue as to how the finale will be handled, I'm confident the finale is going to be great. 


This show has been very heavy sometimes, but it has a certain lighthearted air to it that brings the whole series up so that without it I would feel like doing a double suicide. 
>> ARTICLE
Even if Kaori dies, that doesn't mean Kousei will be alone. I feel like that's been a big theme of the show, especially in this last episode: There are so many people whose lives have been made fuller by Kousei's presence -- and vice versa. And Kaori helped him to make that happen, and to realize it was happening. That will be her legacy to him if/when she dies, and while he'll always have a place in his heart for her, I think he'll be able to move forward. Unlike when his mother died.

As much as I hope it doesn't happen, I think Kaori will die in the finale and Kousei will consider the impact she had on his life, and how it would all be for nothing if he reverted to post-mom's death mode. I could see Kousei getting together with Tsubaki in the OVA, if it's set after a timeskip.
>> ARTICLE
I feel that was the point of the sneeze scene, showing all the people he has and that he isn't actually alone. Watari and Tsubaki have always been there, he has Seto and all the rest from the music world as well, and that even if he loses Kaori there are always people he will have to lean on.
>> ARTICLE
I do get the feeling there's going to be a copout miracle.. it's as if the death flags for Kaori this season have been so obvious that having her not die in the end would be more surprising/impactful 


>> ARTICLE
I am all for the copout miracle, I will cry just as much but won't be so depressed after.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny that we are watching an Anime for 22 Episodes now, we've been with them following them and getting attached, many smiles and many tears, and here we are waiting for the big finale, for Kousei it doesn't matter if he plays good or not as long as she lives, the impact of either won't be as big as the impact of her life, so in a sense, we've been watching an Anime for months and only now go to see the real Heroes of the show, the ones everything relies on, the doctors in the operating room, pls do ur jobs * __ *
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. I think that she may get more time so that Kousei is able to get some closure, but from the overall tone of the show I do not think that they are going to shy away from her death right at the end. 
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it. There is still the spring special. She can easily recover. And then they can go on to play together in the special.
>> ARTICLE
> I can hope right?


>> ARTICLE
not really it was snowing.
>> ARTICLE
You're right, that is what I hope will happen. Not what I think is realistically going to happen. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say the scene on the roof was pretty much a reciprocal confession without words...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, her saying she wanted to know so much more about Kousei and how she was jealous of Tsubaki really felt like a confession to me.
>> ARTICLE
They're musicians. They speak with their music.

And despite her inability to play, she still managed to convey it to him with her 'air violin'. Beautiful.

Lots of nice little touches that add to this show. I definitely plan to re-watch the whole series in the future.

I love how she has been the one to add color to Kousei's world throughout. I love that they have kept that motif.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but at the expense of the color from her life...at least that's kind of what I take from it.  Not that he killed her, but that she knew her time was short and gave all the color she could into his life with everything she had left.

He is a leech!!!
>> ARTICLE
Funny how pseudo-bonds with fictional characters can get strong enough to make one feel more depressed than the real-life misery of others.
>> ARTICLE
Well to be fair, you don't normally get a private look into the lives of others like you can in this anime. We literally have god's perspective to these events and see all these personal moments and inner thoughts of characters.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's probably because in anime we get the 3rd-person omniscient point of view so we have a stronger connection to the characters.


IRL, we only know our own thoughts and cannot precisely understand another individual's thoughts or actions, so the connection is not as strong.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I always try and use stuff like this to remind myself how important it is to try and understand the pain real people experience. Somewhere out there, there's a boy like Kousei about to lose someone he loves to illness. 

So I don't want to get depressed about this show. I want to be impacted by it, and then remember how it made me feelso that when I meet someone like Kousei, I can understand, even a little bit more, what they're going through.

...eh, sorry that was a bit pedantic, but this is something I feel kind of strongly about \^_\^" I don't think it's any good to be emotionally impacted by art if we only let it be self-contained with that experience of art. It becomes truly valuable when we take it out into the world with us.

...wow, I tried to stop and then kept going...
>> ARTICLE
"Funny" may appear a bit misdirected without further context. I'm actually completely with you and what the others have written so far, and for that matter Shigatsu has become one of my very favorite anime  it's just the general curiosity how our capacity for empathy evolved to allow (force) us to both feel and engage with the sorrows and joys of unrelated others, real or not, and at the very same time brush just that aside when we felt no prior connection.

*edit:* forgot a word
>> ARTICLE
Today a lot of people around the world lost a person dear to them to an illness, and for me that man's name is Terry Pratchett, writer of the Discworld series which I read fanatically as a child and all the way up through my teens to my adult years. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's seven years ago, and passed away this afternoon. His daughter is a respected writer. She wrote the story for the most recent Tomb Raider game.

Part of the message of Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso, for me, is how you have to carry the feelings of those you lose. This sounds super cheesy, but even if it's painful, you have to try your best in what you do so that you won't betray their memory. It reminds me that even though Terry Pratchett died too soon, he reached many people in a way that probably changed their life for the better, and his daughter Rhianna will carry on doing her best so she doesn't betray his memory, as one writer, daughter and person to another.

Having said that, I hope Kousei doesn't have to go through losing another person without being able to be honest with them, or being able to say goodbye. That'd be the biggest betrayal the writer of this story could inflict upon me.

I think his revelation at the very end of this episode"Play. That's how I'm going to live my life."is exactly what you're taking about. Even if he doesn't physically say goodbye to Kaori, they were struggling together once again, just in different places this time.

It was indeed from After Story, but it was the Another World Kyou OVA.

Its the worst when you are trying not to cry, and it just kind of bottles up more and more as the episode progresses. Eventually you hit the tipping point and it is like a dam breaks and the tears spill out until something snaps you out of your crying fit.

I was super sad during the whole lead up to the operation, and then the tears came when her parents were standing outside of the operating room. Luckily it was Kosei's piano that brought me back from that salty ocean of sorrow.

This is one of the only anime where I'm actually hoping for an asspull miracle ending, even if not, there's still hope;

I only found out about this the other day, so I'm not sure if it's been posted before, if it has; sorry :(

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso are doing an official twitter event, where if they get 10,000 tweets with the hashtag, a picture of the anime and a sentence about the anime *something* good will happen.

I don't think it actually says what the reward for 10,000 tweets is, but hey, maybe it's an alternate ending, maybe it's an OVA, maybe it's a Kaori figurine. (There's already one, totally buying.)

You can check the progress here; http://www.kimiuso.jp/nodame/#

It's at around 7000 right now, if you want to take part, remember to use this hashtag:# along with a picture of the anime and a sentence (In any language!) about it.

Wow, more than 11,000 and counting now! I can't really read Japanese, but I sense it has something to do with Nodame Cantabile cameo on the show?

Wow, 10188 tweets atm. They did it.

We did it Reddit!

[Here's a playlist of the classical performances we've heard so far in the show. (Updated weekly!)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjsPM2a4m_9befrVeAoZgHBUZ1bNbw_D9)

---

## Episode 21 List of Classical Performances:

We got two pieces this episode, courtesy of the final round of the Eastern Japan Piano Competition.  The first was Scriabin's tude in D-sharp Minor (it's the same piece Emi played at some venue back in Episode 15; you can read the write up for it there), and the second piece was played by Kousei.

---

**Chopin: Ballade No. 1 in G Minor, Op 23** -- It's debated by some when Chopin wrote the first of his four Ballades.  The majority claim that it was sketched (along with the B-minor Scherzo) when he lived in Vienna and wasn't published until after he moved to Paris in 1836; others believed it was written shortly after he arrived in Paris.  Leaving this issue about the exact composition date aside, Chopin composed it during a time period when his homeland Poland was at war against the Russian Empire's oppression; it was a reflection about his loneliness in being in a city far away from his home in Poland.  To give you some context of what kind of despair Chopin was going through during this time, here's an excerpt of what he wrote in his notebook when he learned that [Warsaw fell to the Russians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1831\)) in 1831:

> Thus suburbs have been destroyed, burnt down.  Johnnie and William have surely perished on the ramparts.  I can see Marcel a prisoner. Sownski, that good lad, is in the hands of those villains!  Paszkiewicz, one of the dogs from Mohilev, seizes the capital of the first monarchs of Europe!  Moscow rules the world! Oh God, do You exist? You do, and yet You do not take vengeance.  Have You not had enough of these Musovite crimes or...or, are You Yourself a Russian!!!?... Father, Mother where are you? Perhaps corpses...

Not too long after this, Chopin had moved to Paris and he would live there until his death in 1849.

Robert Schumann commented on the Ballade, saying:

> I received a new ballade from Chopin.  It seems to be a work closest to his genius (although not the most ingenious) and I told him that I like it best of all his composition.  After quite a lengthy silence, he replied with emphasis, "I'm happy to hear this since I too like it the most and hold it dearest".

\- From a letter by Robert Schumann to Heinrich Dorn, Leipzig 14 Sept 1836.

Here's what Anh Tran had to say about the structure of the Ballade:

> Composed within several years, finished in 1835, published in 1836, and dedicated to Baron Stockhausen, the first ballade showed Chopin's initial attempt in his formulation of the musical form. It is widely agreed that this ballade was inspired from Mickiewicz's "Conrad Wallenrod". The ballade opens with the strange Largo section in 4/4 and questionable chord D G Eb, which suggests some irresolvable issues that promote the coming first narrative subject in D minor. The first subject is a subtle and simple conversation and long enough to bust in to a stormy and agitated section. After the stormy octaves on the right hand, the 'diminuendo' running arpeggio leads to a silent moment where the C and F seem to look forward to a coming calm and bright scene. So simple yet beautiful is the second subject in Eb major where the 'bel canto' in Chopin shows its best. The question from the first subject arises again but now in A major, suggesting a bigger controversy that the reprise of the second subject replies in its first variation. This variation is more complicated and grandeur with octaves that lead to a mysterious conversation and dance in higher pitch. The modulation through triplets and octaves, followed by the climax in F sharp minor, is still evocative and questionable until the running down of music reinforced by a 'forte' bass Bb. This begins another variation of the second subject, in lower octave and it recalls the previous moments, yet somewhat regretful. The first subject comes again the last time back in its original D minor and leads to the ending coda. The fast and brilliant coda, partly in sonata form, captures all possible dynamic and dramatic elements in music and seems to resolve all questions with the running down of notes to the bottom 'forte' G. Two glissando passages however lead to the climax where the cascading octaves really conclude all the possible doubts and resolutions. [(Source)](http://www.ourchopin.com/analysis/ballade.html)

Here's an interpretation of this work by [Krystian Zimerman](https://youtu.be/RR7eUSFsn28) and the legendary [Artur Rubinstein.](https://youtu.be/VbJ6f8J8E5I)

This week, Kousei was lost in despair because of all the shit that has happened to him (he even went as far to say how music had taken away the people he cared about), but he managed to visit Kaori again after what happened last episode (thanks to Watari delivering Kaori's message).  Their conversation on the roof was very emotional.  The way she was telling him how she wanted to know more about him made it seem as if she was confessing to him.  While he was in despair, Emi and Takeshi were making strides in their preparation for the Finals of the Eastern Japan Piano Competition.  Emi ended up playing the same piece she did in Episode 15 (Scriabin's tude in D-sharp Minor, Op. 8, No. 12), and Takeshi's piece wasn't heard (oh well).  When Kousei took the stage and sat down at the piano, it seemed as if events from 2 years prior were repeating itself.  Thanks to Tsubaki's sneeze, Kousei was brought back to reality and realized that everyone was waiting for him to play.  He wasn't going to let them down and started playing Chopin's Ballade No. 1 with a lot of feeling.  We're going to see the wonderful conclusion to his performance next week, [in which (**MAJOR (YES, MAJOR) Manga Finale Spoilers -- READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!**)](/s "a certain violinist appears on the stage and plays the final measures of the Ballade with Kousei...after which...?!?!?!?!")  

In short, this week had a lot of feels.  [BUT WAIT!! THERE'S MORE!! ~~Order now within the next week, and we'll double the amount of feels in Episode 22 for NO EXTRA CHARGE.~~](http://i.imgur.com/MLX5hJw.jpg)

Next week is the grand finale; since it wasn't mentioned at all in the series up to this point, it should be obvious by now that the *lie* that was told in April will finally be revealed.  All I'll say is if you needed one kleenex box this week, you may need 2-3 for next week's episode.  

^^^^^**Disclaimer**:&nbsp;I&nbsp;take&nbsp;no&nbsp;responsibility&nbsp;for&nbsp;you&nbsp;reading&nbsp;these&nbsp;spoilers...XD

Thanks again for taking the time to read my post this week! I hope you're looking forward to the feels-tastic grand finale as much as I am!   At that time, I will be announcing what I plan to do write-up wise for next season; all I'll say about it right now is that it will be an Anime-Manga comparison! :-)
>> ARTICLE
I quite liked this week's Chopin piece! Thanks again for your writeups :)
>> ARTICLE
As I scrolled I hovered slightly over the spoilers, revealing the text. I jerked my mouse right off my browser to the right (I had my browser to the left of my screen) and out of shock knocked a glass off my desk, haha. Worth it though, no spoilers have been read :p

Thanks for the write-up, looking forward to next week! :)


>> ARTICLE
Sorry about that! Hopefully your glass didn't break. XD
>> ARTICLE
**Get ready for /r/anime's greatest flood of the season.** Please prepare your tissues as well as your raincoats and boats as we set sail to the subreddit's final moments with the anime.

Anyway, tough episode here. Kaori's on surgery at the same day as Kousei's big day at the competition. Before that, she managed to encourage Kousei something. That's good, yeah. You need a friend to depend on...

I'm not ready for the final episode, in fact I wanted to hold back my tears on this episode. It was so powerful indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Tsubaki sneeze op (little Tsubaki sneezing at the beginning of last episode was sort of a teaser). Wakes up Kousei and makes him realize he's not alone. 

Also just wanted to mention that Kousei says the same thing Tsubaki said about music taking away the people s/he loves.  Also Kaori and Tsubaki being jealous/envious of each other in regards to Kousei. 

>> ARTICLE
Am I the only person cheering on Tsubaki...? 
>> ARTICLE
We're literally dozens. It's not that I don't like Kaori, she's amazing, but... I don't know, I always find myself cheering on Tsubaki.
>> ARTICLE
Love Kaori, but I've been rooting for Tsubaki to find happiness since the beginning :)
>> ARTICLE
Nah man this ship may be small, but it's steaming ahead. Tsubaki will lead us through the treacherous sea of feels to save Kousei.
>> ARTICLE
The only reasonTsubaki Ship is ahead because the other ship already on fire...
>> ARTICLE
Why do the MCs never care about the childhood friendsss?!?!?!?!?!?
>> ARTICLE
Kosei has a got-tier harem for a middle schooler. 
>> ARTICLE
He's a musician, it only makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
Haha I don't think so. I'm sure there are plenty of Tsubaki lovers. I definitely don't understand the Tsubaki haters. I think she is a great character. Then again I think all the female characters in this story are fantastic. 

I'm probably going to get a lot of hate for saying it, but I think Kousei and Kaori's relationship is a bit one dimensional.  It doesn't truly evolve into anything new. It's just the same repetition.  It's clear that their story doesn't need 22 episodes to tell so they added these amazing side characters.  And honestly as much as I love them they just distracted me from the main story line over and over again. I've already read the manga, but while I read it I kept wanting the story to make me feel like Kousei and Kaori are fated/meant to be etc., but honestly even at the end of it all I end up sympathizing with Tsubaki.  
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Out of the whole thing, I loved Nagi's arc the most, and by the end of this show, I find myself less interested in the main story and wish for the expansion on the side characters.
>> ARTICLE
1 more episode till the whole /r/anime will be flooded with tears. T.T
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding, I was holding back tears the whole time... Oh god, next week is gonna be bad..
>> ARTICLE
I was on the verge of tears this whole episode.  And a knot in my stomach the whole time Kousei was playing.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably already flooded with tears.

I thought I was ready for that rooftop scene after finishing the manga. Nope, it still got a few tears out of me.
>> ARTICLE
Mainly over the best guy contest. But, shuagatsu keeps pulling at my heart strings
>> ARTICLE
Man, that was a lovely episode. Graceful, emotional, controlled, deeply melancholic, yet somehow hopeful. Couldn't be happier with what they did here. Every scene had its place, every note was sounded perfectly in time, and the symmetry with the show up to this point was beautiful.

[0:44](http://i.imgur.com/XUBysZP.png)Just how deeply does Tsubaki understand Kousei? She immediately understands the devastation will have on Kousei.

[2:46](http://i.imgur.com/rTNZSKB.png)/[2:48](http://i.imgur.com/pAC7dRp.png)Tsubaki, you beautiful soul. She knows Kousei is in love with Kaori, she knows her affections for him will probably never be returned, but she still cant stop herself from diving into the world of music, from reaching out to the people who she believes can save Kousei. It takes a whole lot of humility and selflessness to admit you cant help someone and to entrust someone you love to someone else.

[3:07](http://i.imgur.com/ooMD7Y9.png)A familiar shot, over Hirokos shoulder looking at a crushed Kousei. When Kousei is hurt, he always assumes the same position he did as a child. Its the same pain all over again.

[3:31](http://i.imgur.com/QadRNHu.png)Before he even starts speaking, his hands drag along the floor. His hands, the place where he connects to the piano, are limp and lifeless. Before he says a word about being unable to go on, his body tell us.

[4:04](http://i.imgur.com/Ffmky9O.png)All I didwas fall in love Wow. A heartbreaking line that completely encapsulates Kouseis complex feelings about everything: his heavy guilt, his love, his helplessness. It twists my heart because, as hes saying, he did nothing wrong, nothing deserving of this.

[4:10](http://i.imgur.com/yu7Bfp2.png)Ugh, his falling tear paralleled with her falling hand. Beautiful and awful.

[4:20](http://i.imgur.com/zeqaRZc.png)An oppressively dark shot with the only light source hidden behind curtains.

[5:44](http://i.imgur.com/Fc3KbL5.png)And then this is great. A short sentence, but a spot of hope. A point of connection.

[5:49](http://i.imgur.com/Ikmv9j2.png)Weve seen this shot before, back in episode 1: Kousei at his desk, in greyscale, through the window. Just in case you missed that yes, for him, its the same thing all over again. She might as well have told him to study the score. Its a repeated track, the same thing with them all over again.

[6:16](http://i.imgur.com/oUhGpZs.png)I know shes been associated with grey for a while, but this shot is something else. Even the colors of her sweater and shirt are infected with the dullness.

[7:08](http://i.imgur.com/mIY2j7w.png)Who else has he carried on his back? Who has carried him on their back?

[7:34](http://i.imgur.com/T2M8pT4.png)Who else knows every little detail about the person they love?

[8:31](http://i.imgur.com/N3aZdFg.png)Who else hates music for taking the people they love away? Maybe its just because Im a Tsubaki fan, but I see her influence all over this seen. Even if Tsubaki isnt the person Kousei loves, you can be sure that she is the person who taught him how to love someone else. The person who showed him he had a soul. The person who reminded him its okay to value others. Tsubaki has her problems, but theres no denying the positive impact shes had on Kouseis life. And now, for a moment, Kousei turns to blame the same thing Tsubaki has all this time.

[8:42](http://i.imgur.com/JQ2agkR.png)Classic KimiUso imagery. Snow is the setting of the week, and so the solitary snowflake shatters, alone.

[8:46](http://i.imgur.com/86GCg67.png)The red flowers are back in the background. In this dull, colorless scene, the same flowers that flourished behind Kaori when Kousei gave her the courage to fight background her as she does the same for him.

[8:48](http://i.imgur.com/Pyo1jmt.png)Weve seen that face before. Its the one we get when the piano is staring him down, when the fight appears before him.

[9:24](http://i.imgur.com/lpWwAxb.png)And this, Im guessing, is as close to a confession of love as well get from Kaori.

[9:30](http://i.imgur.com/eo2evOH.png)Love this line. Its not just musicians. Its everyone. Everyone has to struggle in life. Maybe some people are just better at it because they do it all the time. Struggle with themselves. Struggle with the music. Struggle with the unfair hand life has dealt them.

[9:54](http://i.imgur.com/fBlmkWQ.png)Aww man, aww man, he said it. A miracle. For him to play?

[10:22](http://i.imgur.com/H6QvVeM.png)The colors that come in are still cool, but its color still.

[10:29](http://i.imgur.com/tlKN4Cn.png)And Kouseis bathed in light in yet another close-up, like the light is breaking into the tight frame.

[10:47](http://i.imgur.com/hdi0dEj.png)Theres your miracle, Kousei. Fantastic imagery, beautifully conceived.

[10:55](http://i.imgur.com/fdNbNcp.png)/[11:05](http://i.imgur.com/cTzdycI.png)And we see Kaori get all these open shots with the sky behind her: freedom. But there are still the reminders of the ground, the fence reminiscent of the limitations that have always been there for her. She breaks free even so.

[11:19](http://i.imgur.com/eTx43ll.png)You said it.

[12:08](http://i.imgur.com/rsr3Dun.png)As if the Tsubaki factor wasnt evident enough, now Kaori makes explicit reference to her.

[12:08](http://i.imgur.com/2Wg4Oc8.png)But shes the one dying! Shes the one whos leaving him alone! No, shes the one who he gave hope to, the one who is fighting on by herself. Shes begging him not to stop struggling alongside her, not to give up the music that unites them.

[12:33](http://i.imgur.com/oS9TlRC.png)Yes! Its not in any prettied up shot of her, but as shes collapsed on his lap in the snow that he says that. Hes seeing her beautiful as she is, not as he imagines her to be.

[13:24](http://i.imgur.com/UBYlW2F.png)So, the surgery begins with the competition music bridging the two places. Two battles.

[13:51](http://i.imgur.com/txvuYoZ.png)Ah, Nagis commentary on Emi is great. Nagis so articulate usually, and here her expression of being left speechless is powerful.

[14:03](http://i.imgur.com/QSZHOTI.png)Best Girl! (Im sad this is the last well see of you on stageit wasnt long enough!)

[14:54](http://i.imgur.com/EvMskU2.png)Right, this is Hirokos greatest fear because she was the one who really set Kousei on this path. She was the one who insisted Saki teach him piano. So if he can no longer be a pianist, what does he have left?

[15:02](http://i.imgur.com/Vhy5NlW.png)Remember, Hiroko chose to pick him back up, chose to help him and support him. Its not as if she was forced into it by anything other than her own sense of what was right to do. But she has nothing else she can give him now.

[15:26](http://i.imgur.com/KGtEvgL.png)/[15:29](http://i.imgur.com/etDmjEu.png)Editing these two shots consecutively makes clear exactly what playing means. It means to struggle, in whatever way you're given.

[16:15](http://i.imgur.com/e4r7ITY.png)Im a pianist. This is who I am. This is what I do. Kousei is about to try and deal with everything thats happened to him by defining his identity. Who Kousei is defines the way he fights. The dark shadows on his face seem to indicate his doubt that he can do this. Is he really a pianist? He has to decide that.

[17:21](http://i.imgur.com/oWGnvny.png)I get the callback to the cat, but this shot really threw me off because its not clear exactly what besides shock it relates to. Whatever, it was short. Lets move on.

[17:28](http://i.imgur.com/aVdTzDe.png)And there it is. Weve already seen Kousei relive his past again and again this episode, taking the same physical positions he did as a child. Whats different about you now, Kousei?

[17:46](http://i.imgur.com/kkCOsvu.png)Geez, Tsubaki is my freaking hero. How many times will she reach out to Kousei, lift him up in whatever trivial or meaningful way she can?

[18:07](http://i.imgur.com/8JG4YwL.png)Friggin Koharu-chan.

[19:49](http://i.imgur.com/lf4Pfjr.png)What a clich. Remember, Nagi says this all the time, but she specifically said it to him regarding his relationship with Kaori. Its not all bad, you know, Kousei replies here. Maybe the well-worn path is the path down which he can find the answers.

[19:58](http://i.imgur.com/3gfcrCL.png)Sorry, Tsubaki. If there was any doubt that shes on the outside looking in, its this. All youve done is play the piano! he hears her cry. Or maybe Kousei just hasnt yet realized that she understands him better than he thinks.

[20:43](http://i.imgur.com/n5hN0iu.png)So, Kousei, whats your answer? Are you a pianist or not? How will you live your life?

[20:46](http://i.imgur.com/RXRFGIX.png)/[20:47](http://i.imgur.com/s61YbKa.png)Can we doubt where his inspiration comes from?

[21:06](http://i.imgur.com/3qNODwi.png)Its a sad sort of color, but its still much better than feeling nothing at all.

I am pretty happy that I did not - even though it would have been great to rewatch/read it through your posts. 

Keep it up!
>> ARTICLE
Well, I didn't start writing posts on the show until episode 6 and this is actually the first time I've done a time-stamped write-up like this. Usually I tend to like essay style a little bit better.

I'll be back again next week for sure; not sure if it'll be in this format or not though.

Great breakdown, Thanks!

The way they use color in this anime is simply amazing.

Kaori breaking down on the rooftop broke me. T_T
>> ARTICLE
No... Please no... The surgery is gonna fail. It's gonna fail, i'm sure of it. I can't take this. Don't do this to me, please! I CAN'T TAKE IT.


I hope that she'll die. It wouldn't feel right to have this much buildup, and then just end it with a happy ending.


There's a war going on inside of me!

>> ARTICLE
The surgery won't save her though. It was only so she can get some more time for her to play. So only way she isn't dying is if they do some lame copout.

The doctor did say they was a possibility it could save her.

So if someone you loved was saved by surgery, it would be a "bullshit miracle"? That's how I watch these shows, from the perspective of the characters, not as a simple outside observer. How would I feel if she lived? I would be happy beyond words.

I've come out of every episode with the same thought. And that thought is 'Please don't fucking die.'

So beautiful yet so sad.. 

How am I supposed to wait a week for the final episode ? HOW

its going to be the last anime i ever watched

Its going to be the most painful wait yet, this is the biggest cliffhanger of the season I think.

i'm more concerned about what am i gonna do with my life after next week. i don't really have a plan yet

Thank god he played.! When he started crying I was practically screaming "NOOOOO please play" at my laptop.


>> ARTICLE
Guess what Kaori [says](http://i.imgur.com/hbSTInW.jpg) says here could infer that the rooftop scene could be seen as the "kiss goodbye" so in turn she was most likely saying [thanks](http://i.imgur.com/rJp8oY7.jpg) Kousei for that final moment together ;_;

"Marcie" isn't her thanking Kousei. She is quoting Marcie from Peanuts. She quoted other Peanuts characters in other episodes also.

If one thing's sure, next week there will be tears in /r/anime.   

Either tears of joy after the successful operation, or tears of sorrow that will come with her death.

I've prepared myself throughout the majority of this series expecting her to die yet I still can't get through an episode without tears ;.;

I'm a mess after an episode like this I can't imagine what next week is going to be like...^^^^help

Finally watched it. So beautiful...

[You were here](http://i.imgur.com/G90AJEY.gifv) but I was [at this level.](http://i.imgur.com/NavoGCc.gifv)

I'm expecting to be at [this level](http://i.imgur.com/hRPe4qT.gifv) during the final episode.

Madoka is too serious for me to watch anytime soon I think. Next episode of Shigatsu is going to tear me apart...
>> ARTICLE
>Madoka is too serious for me to watch anytime soon I think.

Be *extremely* careful of spoilers. They're everywhere. 

>Next episode of Shigatsu is going to tear me apart...

/r/anime's tears will create a flood that will drown the subreddit. It will be glorious! ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I've been wary of them haha I look away whenever it's mentioned!

I need to make sure I'm well prepared to deal with that amount of tears haha should be fun... :p
>> ARTICLE
>Yeah I've been wary of them haha I look away whenever it's mentioned!

I was able to manage at avoiding Clannad After Story spoilers for close to 2 years while I put off watching it. I'm so glad I was able to. I'm sure you'll feel the same way about Madoka. 

>I need to make sure I'm well prepared to deal with that amount of tears haha should be fun... :p

We can all console each other in the discussion thread on Thursday. It'll be a great bonding moment for /r/anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it'll be interesting to see what that thread is like...it's only a few days away!
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna try not to be a total wimp and this time watch the final episode on the same day it airs. I only watched this latest episode of Shigatsu after I had finished watching every new episode of all the currently airing shows I'm watching. Ugh...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I try to watch it as early as I can since I'm looking forward to it so much then question why I did so once the tears start flowing haha

Hopefully we're both in the thread at the same time!
>> ARTICLE
>Yeah I try to watch it as early as I can since I'm looking forward to it so much then question why I did so once the tears start flowing haha

I know why. If you want a long answer I can give it to you. The short answer is that it allows you to experience aspects of existence that you otherwise wouldn't experience. 

>Hopefully we're both in the thread at the same time!

Unfortunately Shigatsu airs after my lunch break so I'd usually have to watch it several hours later. I'm considering scheduling a "doctor's appointment" though so I can watch it as soon as it goes up on Crunchy. 
>> ARTICLE
Every week, tears. No other series I've ever seen has made me turn on the waterworks this frequently. Kind of dreading next week now.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah same here, I usually stay away from sad anime but this one wow it's great but wow do I ever tear up
>> ARTICLE
That episode hit me right in the feels.  
Edit: I watched the raw, why the downvotes?  

>> ARTICLE
> I watched the raw, why the downvotes?

Just bad timing, I think. I was around the thread when you first posted & a single sentence posted just minutes after the episode released on CR probably looks like scrounging for upvotes to people.

I know I don't think of raws, so I can definitely understand why people responded the way they did, even if it was unjustified in this case.

I think when she says Marcie she's refering to the peanuts comic strip. She has called Arima Charlie brown in the past and in the peanuts Marcie loved Charlie brown so I think she's somewhat confessing her love. Regardless I can't wait for next week. This has been one of the most moving anime I have watched. 
>> ARTICLE
So does that mean she doesn't know he is in love with her?
>> ARTICLE
Well. I don't know for sure but characters are pretty oblivious to the fact that someone likes them. For example Arima has no idea Tsubaki likes him.  
>> ARTICLE
I guess that makes tsubaki peppermint patty

It's a Peanuts reference for sure; the credits had a note about it.

All aboard the feel train.  
  
Snow is always foreshadowing something.

That death flag at the end, i hope it was a late April fools Lie.

I'm so happy that he was able to pull off a beautiful performance (so far). If he had messed up or started badly, it would have felt like we made no progress from the beginning. 
>> ARTICLE
I looked at the time of the episode 
17:20 (ish)  
My thoughts: They are not gonna show it. Fuck me, not again.  
But lucky i was wrong and it was really good.   
Bit sad it isn't 24 episodes cause then it would pretty much mean the last episode was "April fools day" and they can say her illness was a joke.
>> ARTICLE
Favorite quotes this episode: "You exist inside me, Arima Kousei" and "Kousei's performance is bursting with color. Bursting...with such mournful color."
>> ARTICLE
Now I  have to watch some K-ON to feel happy again
>> ARTICLE
If you think it is not enough, try Daily Lives of Highschool Boys. This is the show that saved me after watching these shows for too much feels: Kokoro Connect, Shinsekai Yori, Angel Beats, Tasogare Otome X Amnesia, and AnoHana. Yes, I did marathon them for several days.
>> ARTICLE
What is this ? Is this Clannad ? crying the whole fucking episode, damn it. I just hope she will be okay.............. 
>> ARTICLE
The moment when Kousei sat down at the piano and looked at his hands and it cut to his hands covered in blood gave me chills.  Goddamn.
>> ARTICLE
Tsubaki's sneeze allowed him to break out of his funk and play? Confirmed she's dying next episode.

Seriously though, my favorite group dynamic growth throughout the entire show has been between Kousei, Takeshi, and Igawa. They started the show as real rivals, but have gotten to the point where it is obvious they have a very very friendly rivalry.

Outside of Kaori's magical air violin this was a pretty strong episode. Here's to hoping the series can end on a strong *note* :*^*)

Your lie in April will the first anime that I watched and finished on a weekly basis. What a show to start on! I always wondered what it would have felt like to watch other tear jerking anime right when it came out like clannad or angel beats. I think I know what i would have felt like if i watched those "live". i will be incredibly sad when this ends next week, but it was a great experience watching this. Your lie in April will always be on my top anime list, but i don't know if i  can ever rewatch this because i don't know if i can go through the feels again!

So I think i speak for most of us when I say this but...

FUCK THIS GOD DAM AMAZING ANIME.

I'M DEPRESSED THOUGH THIS ENTIRE FUCKING EPISODE AND YOU STILL THOUGH IN A JOKE THAT GOT A LAUGH OUT OF ME THEN THROW ME BACK INTO THE POOL OF SADNESS.

I DIDN'T WANT TO LAUGH IN A SEA OF SADNESS. STOP GIVING MY EMOTIONS WHIPLASH. MAKING ME FUCKING CRY IS ENOUGH BASTARDS. ^^^^This ^^^^hits ^^^^to ^^^^hard.

Guys. Have I ever told you how much I love this anime? I fucking love this anime.

Best. Air violin. Ever.

I honestly thought Kousei was done for. He didn't look like he was ever touching a piano key again, much less ever leaving that room that his teacher tried to drag him out of. Never thought I'd see the day when someone was saved by a sneeze.

After I watched this episode I watched this inspiring TED talk (mentioned on Reddit front page a couple days ago) by Benjamin Zander.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9LCwI5iErE

His talk about Hamlet and Chopin I think is really relevant to the nature of this story.


>> ARTICLE
I'm not ready for it to end. I didn't even last a minute into the episode and the tears started...hell, writing this entry looks all watery to me. If I don't watch it, it can't end right?
>> ARTICLE
PLEASE DONT HAVE AN ASSPULL ENDING! As much as I want Kaori to live I feel like it will spoil on of the greatest series in like the last decade.
>> ARTICLE
I feel this way too! I will feel sad if Kaori dies but I'll feel INCREDIBLY cheated if Kaori lives. Sometimes a happy "everyone lives" ending isn't the best ending.
>> ARTICLE
So many emotions...jeez I don't know if I can handle it :(
>> ARTICLE
I am so glad that Kousei managed to pull it together!
>> ARTICLE
I think I ran out of tears, that was tough to watch but great as well.
>> ARTICLE
If she doesn't make it through the surgery I'll be so sad :(

Thank God he was able to play. Seriously this has been one rollercoaster trip of emotions. Next week is gonna be sad no matter what just b/c this series is ending.

Im going on my spring break to Spain and all I can think about are all the finales im missing
>> ARTICLE
Damnit. Was going to wait until next week and watch both for a longer feeling finale, but I just couldn't do it.

Chopin Ballade No. 1 in G Minor, op 32 was the perfect piece. I just wish the episode was 5 minutes longer so we could see more reactions from the audience: Tsubaki & Emi especially. Nagi's was what really brought the feels, especially as she says:

*"This is incredible Arima-Sensei." "Your life.. Your music.."*

I hope the next and final episode includes the end of it as either the first scene or a flashback (if there is a timeskip), since it's Kousei's saddest and greatest performance.
>> ARTICLE
I was actually hoping someone would play the Chopin ballade in this show...since it is probably the only "high level" piece I have ever played.
>> ARTICLE
What about that thing Kaori said: we all need someone to kiss us goodbye? Did something more happened on that rooftop than we know or is this just again Kaori making shit worse with her quotes.
>> ARTICLE
I originally thought...[](/s "blondie was gonna die, like everyone else. But since the last few episodes, especially how 21 unfolded, I guess the ending is going the "meeting him gave me the desire to live on" route. If they were going to let her die, I feel like she'd be dead by now, and we would have a few episodes on Kousei learning to go on. Another thing that spoiled it for me...I read on here last week that there was going to be an OVA. What could the OVA possibly be about if they killed her off?")
>> ARTICLE
The OVA doesn't necessarily have to be in the future.
>> ARTICLE
This anime has been one hell of a ride. All I ever cry out is "Why does this anime have to be so beautiful and hurt so bad!?" My body is torn between being ready and not being ready for next weeks finale. This episode was so beautiful, the music gave me goosebumps all the way through.
>> ARTICLE
I need some feels in my life to recover from my Saltiness from Best Guy contest.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so torn...all season I've been waiting for her to die so I can cry myself to sleep at noon, but I want her to live...now that her living is maybe an option...I feel I am due a life! I demand to see someone die in this anime. What would those tearful evenings with comfort ramen mean if she lives? Argh!
>> ARTICLE
Even though the manga is finished is the anime gonna cover the complete manga or are there a few chapters left?
>> ARTICLE
The last episode covers the last chapter or so of the manga. They will end on the same note. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay thanks for answering :D
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how closely this anime follows the manga.
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty accurate, I'd dare to say it's even better because you can hear the performances.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually the main reason I chose not to read it. Can't have an emotional-music-based-drama with no music. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, that was a rough watch. I was pretty much teary-eyed for the entire episode. 

Anything but a tragedy would be a cop-out at this point.
>> ARTICLE
first anime since clannad after story to make me cry.  its been a while
>> ARTICLE
I read the Manga, but the anime is hitting too hard. Maybe the music is doing its effects on the show. 
>> ARTICLE
plot twist : the lie is about the performance together because they missed the deadline 
>> ARTICLE
Bursting... with such a mournful color
>> ARTICLE
The way the show is leading it seems like kaori will live, but I wish the ahow would go on a bit long. I like to see more charcter development on kousei friends (rivals)
>> ARTICLE
I kinda wish they didn't cut off the panels from the manga where Aiza asks what is Arima's condition and when Kaori says "Sorry if I stink" in the piggyback scene.

But overall it's still faithful to the manga. Next week is the grand finale. I don't know if I am ready or not.
>> ARTICLE
I have never watched anything that has had this amount of feels. Please send help, I don't know what to do with all these feels I am having. I can't even imagine the amount of feels I am going to have when I marathon this instead of waiting a whole week in between episodes.......

Mom: Where did all the tissues go?

Me: sniffs...sorry..sniffs

>> ARTICLE
This series has made me more frustrated than any other I have watched, but this episode had me climbing the walls while trying to hold back tears. I want her to live, but then all of the build up will go to waste. I want kousei to play amazingly, but I have a feeling he is going to break down at some point near the end. This episode has me torn in half and I tell you I can't take a week of not knowing what is going to happen. 

This anime is one big cliffhanger. 
>> ARTICLE
My play by play of this episode:

*Hearing the opening theme*: 'No I don't want to hear this happy ass theme right now.'

Being Kousei is suffering

OH THANK GOD SHE'S ALIVE

Wow we finally hear her thoughts about Kousei and her situation. It makes her seem more on Kousei's level than someone higher up and harder to understand.

What. What. Okay...

Finally Arima's performance! I really hope that we get to see another one with him and Kaori again!

Well, this was an episode filled with hope. So much, that I feel like the final episode is going to crush it all. Please prove me wrong.
>> ARTICLE
it was all perfect, but the "you're looking down again" hit me so hard

Oh shit! Next week is the last episode?!

I cried the entire ep, my fucking feels. 

there's still hope for a happy ending, too. not sure if that's the best, or worst part. worst as in, there's so much power on their behalf to rip our hearts into shreds.
*but they hinted at miracles*

good ep though. arima's playing was beautiful. best yet (IMO)

Another powerful episode. Next week is gonna be intense, I can feel it. My body is **not** ready.

I liked how in Kousei's worst moment it was Tsubaki who (indirectly) reminded him he was not alone.

What hurts is reading the comments from the Reddit thread for the first episode and now. They have a completely different tone. In the beginning it was very happy and carefree, but now it's just a dam holding back the floodgates.

This episode was *so close* to making me cry, I don't know how I'll handle next episode.
>> ARTICLE
This is going to get a bunch of disagree downvotes, because that's what reddit & /r/anime does when people go against the grind.  But who cares!

I've been immensely dissatisfied with this show for a long while now, but I've had a hard time articulating/condensing my opinions.  But I'm going to give it a go anyways.

The central theme of this show is about how music can affect the bonds between people and transmit emotions.  The characters spend an inordinate amount of time monologueing to each other or talking in their own heads about this.  And yet, by doing so, they're betraying the central conceit of the show.  If this music is so inspiring and heart-touching, you shouldn't have to tell us - as viewers, we should feel it too.  We should only need an occasional reaction-shot to see audience members filled with emotions to get the idea that yes - your emotions reached the audience, Arima.  But instead of letting the music speak for itself, the show overlays and forces a bunch of dialog and visual metaphors on top - which is a gigantic distraction from the music itself.  It's the whole "show, don't tell" conundrum.  And instead of staying true to the show's own  themes, it hamfistedly undermines them with awkward and poorly written dialog.

Like, really.  Arima talks to himself about how he's not good with his words, and yet we - as the audience - hear him put together his ideas and thoughts into monologues that exactly portray his thoughts and emotions.  I hate that - just say what you're thinking, and all your problems stemming from misunderstandings will disappear!  Such awful writing.

Part of the problem here is that this is a manga adaptation - where all this exposition and dialog has to substitute for the fact that we, as readers, can't hear what the comic's characters hear.  But in the medium of anime, we CAN hear.  And instead of doing a competent and well written adaptation that takes that into account, the writers for the show faithfully but lazily do a 1:1 translation instead of reworking the same idea to take advantage of the medium's strengths.

Another problem I have with this show is that of perspective and narrative - which I find ill considered and problematic.  It often behooves a show to provide consistency with regards to how the story is told because it helps keep your story focused and your plot free of holes.  That's why usually in literature, who the story is being told from is focused on so intently.  Are you going to have an omniscient narrator?  Is this narrated from the perspective of a character?  Is there going to be any narration to begin with?  If you jump between too many different styles of narration, it creates problems of continuity and creates plot holes.  Here in this show, we get narration from and hear the thoughts of a dozen different characters.  Including Kaori's.  [Which creates a huge problem for the finale because](/s "...we finally learn the nature of the lie that the show is titled after.  This bombshell might have had more impact had it been one that was properly hidden and foreshadowed.  However, we've heard Kaori's thoughts and her perspective.  It's really dishonest that the show picks and chooses which thoughts of hers to portray, in order to keep this twist a secret.  It's bad writing, plain and simple.  And it creates a conclusion that feels forced and cheap rather than earned.")

Y'all welcome to disagree with this, but these are some of the problems I've been having with this show and has kept me from enjoying it.  It's frustrating to see a show attempt to try tackling some ambitious subject matter, and then fail to execute its ideas in such stunning levels of incompetence.
>> ARTICLE
After I watched episode 21 and some of the episodes prior, I'd started feeling exactly the same way, but I only just managed to figure out why it was I felt dissatisfied after watching ep21; these constant internal monologues have just become stale. Maybe its poetry is being lost in translation, but regardless, as you've said, the characters' feelings shouldn't have to be spoonfed to the viewer so often and through the same medium and fairly similar sounding discourse each time.

You've put it with much more articulation (and saved me the effort), but I thought I'd mention how I strongly agree with you since as you also said, you'll likely get downvoted for the opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone who thinks Kaori will die, just remember, there is still the OVA in May. She can easily recover in the last episode and they can play their final performance together in that.
>> ARTICLE
am i gettin raided by fkin onion ninjas? the feeels are strong today...i am glad he is playing, but will they be able to play one last time together?
>> ARTICLE
Yup, it finally happened. I cried.

It was the rooftop scene that did me in- when Kaori admitted she was scared and that there was so much more she wanted to do. When she started crying so did I.

This show is a masterpiece, at least to me. I'm sure many others can relate to its themes. I don't even want to speculate how it will end because I'll just start harboring my own expectations, but I have faith that next week won't disappoint. But I will say this much: this episode made me more optimistic in regards to its potential ending. I hope I'm not wrong.

Yeah the rooftop also gave me the maximum feels.. can't wait T_T

This is messed up but if Kaori magically lives, I'll be incredibly disappointed. My heart wants her to live but a part of me thinks it'll be so unsatisfactory if there's a miracle ending. As soon as the possibility of a cure all surgery was mentioned I felt that there was a strong chance of her living, despite all of the death flags.

Definitely not the only one. I seriously doubt the show's *not* going to go the clichd "she suddenly decides she wants to live, so she ends up perfectly fine" route.

**Wishlist for the Rest of the Show**

1. I wish Nagi would get more screentime, because she's become one of my very favorite characters in the show.
2. I wish for Tsubaki to have a nice, conclusive resolution to her personal arc.
3. I want to see Emi play again.
4. I want more of Koharu-chan goofing off.
5. I want more moments of Hiroko dealing with her own past failures and overcoming them to be a great teacher.
6. I want a little bit more about Watari.
7. I want Kousei to *convincingly* recover from Kaori's death.
8. (I don't really want Kaori to die.)

Also, wowzers the tone of this episode (and the plotting, too, really) was all over the place. Like, I know *KimiUso*'s always been a show where it's more about the big moments and has always been kind of spotty in-between, but they really need to chill out and focus here. 

It's my eternal battle with this show. I can't help loving it, but at the same time I can't help wishing it would pull itself together technically.
______________
**EDIT:** [~Full Episode Notes~](http://mageinabarrel.com/2015/02/12/your-lie-in-april-episode-17/) are now available!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it felt really awkward where we see that Kaori tells Kousei that it's "not looking good for her", and how it basically broke him, which is an extremely serious and sad moment, but then it pans over to some less serious moments a bit too quickly. It just felt a bit weirdly paced in that respect. 
>> ARTICLE
It being all about the big moments perfectly reflects musicians lol
>> ARTICLE
Summary: I want every episode of this show out now, and it would be great if it were like 30 episodes instead of only 24.
>> ARTICLE
It's only 22 episodes :'(
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was bad enough I had to wait a week.... 
>> ARTICLE
> I want Kousei to convincingly recover from Kaori's death.

*...!?*
>> ARTICLE
yea.
>> ARTICLE
She hasn't died yet, don't worry. Well, do worry, but don't worry so much that your eyes drown.
>> ARTICLE
I've now seen several people mention how jarring they find the tonal changes, specifically the attempts at humor. It's supposed to be jarring. They create dissonance in the tone and hold it just long enough to bring you back in to the heavy emotional stuff wanting more. If the show lacked those moments you would miss out on some of the impact the big scenes have. The humor lets you catch your breath for a minute and anticipate the resolution of the chord. It is contrast to the big emotional moments that makes each big moment feel incredibly powerful and beautiful, even if the notes are the same. 
>> ARTICLE
The attempts at humor only serve to irritate me and actively detract from the impact of the rest of the scene.  Rather than seeming like a breather between dour beats, they feel like someone harshly pumping the breaks, as if they don't trust the heavier stuff to stand on its own.  Moments of comic relief are good, necessary even, but Kimi no Uso randomly becomes a *completely* different show for five seconds here and there.  Too often, it's during a scene when it's at its most self-serious, and hence the extreme tonal whiplash.  *"We interrupt this scene to bring you the Tsubaki/Kousei Slapstick Minute.  Your regularly scheduled flashbacks, monologues, and intense stares will return momentarily."*

If it were done in a way that didn't feel like an interlude or interruption, it probably wouldn't bother me as much, if at all.  Comic relief is a great tool, after all.  It's just that, as /u/iblessall said, Kimi no Uso's execution of it is utterly terrible.  As you can probably guess, I have a few other issues with the show in general, but this in particular was the first major red flag right from episode 1.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I guess if that works for you, cool!

But I don't really agree. I think the best episode of the show, unquestionably, was episode 10and a lot of that was by virtue of the fact that it was extremely focused on a single dramatic thread and resisted the impulse to dive into comedy or break the tone of the moment.

I hear what you're saying about humor being jarring to leave you wanting more, but what I'm trying to say is that the tonal changes disrupt the experience of the more dramatic moments negatively. It's not a matter of having them in there at all, it's a matter of the timing. *KimiUso*'s timing with the tonal changes succckkkksss, even if the idea of having them in there is a good one.

tl;drthe execution is bad, not the concept.
>> ARTICLE
Nagi became my favourite character in the entire show quite soon after what's going to be next episode, and it's going to be even better with sound.

Oh yay, and since KimiUso usually nails the concert scenes, this should be amazing~!

I can't agree more. This was my favorite performance in the Manga.

I wonder if you get the same feeling reading a performance than watching it? I didn't want to read the manga because I don't think that you will get the same feeling, as watching with sounds etc.

I admit that it is a lot better actually being able to hear the performances, but personally I feel the manga does a good job at expressing the emotions of the characters to the point where you can see how much impact they have.

It forms a fantastic picture in your head which the anime then brings to life with color and sound.

For anyone interested, the Ravel that Kousei doesn't want to hear is, I think, Ravel's [Pavane pour une infante dfunte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavane_pour_une_infante_d%C3%A9funte) or "Pavane for a dead princess." And [here's](http://youtu.be/tn6_yT9SKpM) a recording of Ravel playing it.

This is a reference to ichigo doumei(the book kaori is reading where the "do you want to commit a double suicide with me?" Quote comes from) it is the main character's favorite piece.

Thanks! Technically that link is to a recording of Ravel on a piano roll being played back, which is kind of neat.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks to you for posting it and explaining that. It really is a beautiful piece and hearing it today made me want to listen again to some solo piano pieces from Ravel (the Forlane from Le tombeau de Couperin, Une barque sur l'ocan and Noctuelles from Miroirs,  la manire de Borodine, the Sonatine Modr, obviously Jeux d'eau and Ondine from Gaspard de la nuit which are both amazing). I would advise you to listen to them if you have not even though you probably already listened to them.

Gotta say, Watari is the best mother fucking friend that a man could have.

First, he straight up tells Kousei, "Kaori is totally not into me. She's into you, AND I'M TELLING YOU TO GO FOR IT."

Then, without even knowing what the fuck Kousei was planning, he's straight up like, "Bro, I got your back, no matter what."

Best friend 2015.

I've had a theory since episode 1 and I still think it's true.  Watari likes Tsubaki, all this time he's been trying to get Kousei and Kaori together so that Tsubaki would get over Kousei and look for other men.  Truly a genius, he's fooled almost everyone

Ah, so instead of best friend, he's the biggest asshole. HE'S GOING FOR THE LONG CON!!

> First, he straight up tells Kousei, "Kaori is totally not into me. She's into you, AND I'M TELLING YOU TO GO FOR IT."

Twist: Watari thinks/knows that Kaori is dying, and doesn't want the emotional baggage of being a dying girl's boyfriend, so he masks it by pushing Arima up to the bat. Worst friend 2015.

Considering how long these recitals take, its better to have this and let us fully bask in Takeshi's shock when Kousie comes on stage with his sister. That will probably have some flashbacks to go with it, then the rest of the episode will be one long duet, which will be awesome.

Yeah, I like the pacing personally. Whenever they devote a lot of time to a performance, it turns out amazing. The concerts have all been the best parts of the show so far!

This was a great episode. Nagi is fast proving a lovable character.

I agree and not only because she is a lens we can see the rest of the gang through, but because her own story is compelling. I love the way she and Kousei are helping each other as, without either of them really knowing it.

As a manga reader, I disliked her and her chapters initially, as it just felt like a needless distraction from the hard feels this series provides, but as I got farther along, I fell in love with her. After the next episode, I wouldn't be surprised if she becomes your favorite character.

I just watched episode 16 and 17 in a row. My heart is in shambles because of too many feels.

This is how I feel at the moment: just like you, I am starting to think that this series would benefit from a binge/marathon session. The emotions that carry this show are lost when watching on a week-week basis. I might just binge-watch it again at a later point and think of how this translates to my overall satisfaction with the show.
>> ARTICLE
It definitively does benefit from it. Maybe I picked two good episodes to watch in a row, because if I had stopped at episode 16 last week, the cliff-hanger at the end of that episode was so big, I couldn't have bared the wait 7 days for episode 17. Luckily, episode 17 kind of ended in a not-so-cliffhangerish situation as 16. Oh well...gonna be gone next week too, so in two weeks when I'm back I'll be able to watch two in a row again.

May I ask, where do you watch anime? It looks very HD.

>> ARTICLE
Kaori has repeatedly showed that she cares about Kousei's career i.e. forcing him to start playing, arguing with him when he started "waisting time" teaching Nagi. He tells Watari to transmit the festival to Kaori, so that she can see he is not going to give up music again (and also that teaching Nagi is not a waste of time, but that is probably only a bonus objective).
Also, he will be able to convey his feelings more easily when playing the piano (it is showed repeatedly that musicians pick that stuff up easily), compared to talking.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more than that.  He's been sulking the entire episode because he couldn't think of anything he could do for Kaori.  This *is* the one thing he can do.  He's going to play for her to not only to convey his feelings but because she no longer can.

Just like his mother literally beat him to try and give him the best shot at a career in music, Kaori screamed at Kousei because she longs to be on that stage.  She's living through him in that way.
>> ARTICLE
In my mind I take it one step further: he is showing her that she will live on in how he plays and he will pass on that gift to others, essentially immortalizing her.  
>> ARTICLE
You know what? I seriously think this show is a masterpiece.  You have fantastic backgrounds, the animation is stellar, the characters realistic and relatable, the soundtrack is not only well composed, but also used in a way that enhances the whole.  Every piece of this anime is extraordinarily well done, and the sum is far greater than its parts.

EDIT: Fuck, I'm crying.

>> ARTICLE
I'll agree with you with the exception of the pacing.  I think his inability to face his mother and inability to hear the piano notes was a bit drawn out.  Still a solid 9/10 for me so far.

I just marathoned this show from episode 1-17 over the course of two days and am so SO glad I did. It just might be my favorite ever and I don't know why I didn't pick this up when it started because I have been MISSING OUT. No other show has consistently drawn out emotions out of me like this. Not only that but it blends drama and comedy very well. Even though I'm late to the party I'm with you all to the very (hopefully happy :( Kaori) end.

Hey everyone!

There was really no new piece that I noticed this episode (we heard more of Ravel's *Pavane for a Dead Princess*), except for the subtle hints of what they're performing for the duet; hence, there will be no performances post this week. 

[The duet piece](/s "Rachmaninoff's arrangement of the Valse from Tchaikovsky's ballet *La Belle au Bois Dormant* (Sleeping Beauty)") will be the main subject of next week's performances write-up.  In case you want to read any of my previous write-ups, see the links below.

Am I the only one that thinks Kaori's had *too many* death flags to actually die?

I think she's had at least one in every episode, the writer is just clobbering us with all this foreshadowing. I think it would be a great inversion to just leave her fate vague, or have her survive through some drastic medical procedure. They could have the procedure at the same time as the big performance, then cut back and forth for the finale. 

I don't know, I just think that the author is making it too obvious she's going to die, which makes me suspect the author is going to pull the rug out from under us. ^^^God ^^^I ^^^hope ^^^so
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the exact same thing as you until the internet crushed my dreams
>> ARTICLE
I think the writer is making it obvious, but leaving us with a tiny bit of hope, so we can grasps at straws. It shows how truly ignorant and desperate we are as humans when it comes to death.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how that could be executed without being a massive copout so I think I'd prefer that doesn't happen.
>> ARTICLE
It could go both ways, I guess. I mean, it's not even trying to be subtle with those deathflags, but the more deathflags a popular character has, the more people want it not to die... which makes me think it'll go in another completely different and worse way. And by that, I mean the possible ^^^^Who ^^^^am ^^^^I ^^^^kidding? death will be the least cause of the shock of the finale.
>> ARTICLE
It's not about being surprised about her death anymore. At least, i don't think so. We were directly told "it's not looking too good" for her.  Basically it's like when someone is told they have a certain amount of time to live. I look at it as a show about a person coping with her unavoidable death
>> ARTICLE
Are they really even death flags?  We *know* she's going to die.  She said so herself in one of the episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I just binge watched all 16 episodes.....Idk how to feel anymore. seriously so many ups and downs in this show. I love it, and yet i know its heading towards something completely heart breaking :(.

yep.

I had the same thoughts. The part at around 1:16 this episode (around 52 seconds into the OP) sounds similar to [this (40 seconds in)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJcuDgVYjgI#t=40) part.

I think the main post should be updated to: 

**Episode duration**: 2 minutes and 5 seconds

Because the episodes in this show fly by. I am super stoked to see the duo perform. Also for a second i tought that Kaori was gonna show up in a wheelchair and be in the same spot Kousei mom usually was... that would've been a feels trainwreck.
>> ARTICLE
Kaoru's colors got even paler. Seeing her get progressively less vibrant even in color is depressing.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
The parallels between Nagi and Kousei in the early parts of the anime as so clear.

Nagi represents Kousei who was scared to play except Kousei put up mental blocks for himself. Even in this episode she was drawn always in the shadows.

Kousei now is Kaori in many ways. He helps inspire others, and he is the one who is colorful and radiant. In the early parts of the show he was always represented by the shadows, now he is in the light all the time.

If it wasn't clear before and if people are still calling them death flags, they can rest easy. Looks like Kaori won't make it. I was pretty sure last episode that was the case, but now it doesn't seem like Kousei can avoid this. He already showed cracks knowing Kaori would die. Yet he is able to put up a front for her and keep pushing on. It shows that he will be able to move on when she does pass, but how badly is it going to shake him when it happens I wonder. You don't bond with someone to the point of love and not have their death affect you in some way.

Tears will be shed.
>> ARTICLE
What was the name of the song that played when Kousei mentions "Ravel?"
>> ARTICLE
The ending song will make me cry if something sad happens. 
>> ARTICLE
Time for discussion. As in, a negative opinion. Sorry.

I kind of didn't like this episode. Or, actually, I've had problems with this show for over half it's run. It's pretty melodramatic, and that's okay, I know that. It's SUPER melodramatic. I didn't go past the opening few episodes not expecting that. Some parts were pretty well done, especially earlier on. 

It's kind of been building over the last few episodes, but I've really noticed how much I dislike the character interations. uysually I'm fun with the kind of philosophies that characters put up, but the resolution to the mom plot really rubbed me the wrong way. 

Seto's speech on how sadness was necessary and the blatant glossing-over of Kousei's mom's abuse when they got to the forgiveness scene? It made me a little angry, but I accepted it as both Kousei and Seto coming to terms with their past and Seto making amends for not stopping it.

But afterwards, I really noticed is how ridiculous the characters are. Tsubaki and Watari too. I get it's a drama, but holy fuck we don't need a petty romance plot to back up a tragedy. Tsubaki is an uneeded character. Nagi is shoehorned in to make for some extra emotional drama that doesn't need to be there.Watari doesn't have a character past a supportive best friend, but nobody expected otherwise.

In this episode, Kousei's friends are all extremely callous to him, especially considering the fact that they should all, especially Tsubaki know about his past and how the wound just recently healed. Sure, Kaori is not at fault for her outburst, she was just told that she's dying and is doing relatively well to hide that, but Watari chastising Kousei and telling him to go on obligation, because she'd done so many things for you (coincidently the same justification  that they used for Kousei's mom) and because he's a "man" left a bad taste in my mouth.

Speaking of that, this show is also overwhelmingly sexist. I mean, anime isn't the best with being NOT sexist, but Shigatsu is worse than what I usually see. Ignoring Tsubaki who is self-explanatory, the other female characters on this show aren't great either. Why does this show not have a harem genre tag again? Because this is a harem without a doubt at this point. Besides from Seto and sides, not one important female character has not been in love with Kousei. Nagi and Emi are quick to bite the bullet on this. Within a few scenes, this fact is established. The general talk about women and men in this show makes me cringe hard. I'd add more, but I don't want to spend that long on one comment.

That said, Shigatsu is above-average. The music is great, the music performances are my favorite part. I'm excited to see the one next week. The directing is pretty good, so's teh animation. But the characters and plot falls short, probably on the account of it being, basically, a soap drama. I just don't watch them, so the melodrama, somewhat pretentious dialogue, and sexism stick out to me way more than they should.
>> ARTICLE
I get the constant repetition of Arima's mom and Kaori's sickness but I'm growing tired of it tbh. Every episode from the second half has been nothing but to show how Kaori is dying every day, inserted with gags that ruins the mood. Then it's back with Arima's friends again to push him. Maybe this show is better when marathoned since I've ran out of feels to give.

I'm going to stick until the end since it's ending.
>> ARTICLE
Really liked how Kousei decided that he was going to perform this episode, and he's going to actually (hopefully...) perform next episode.  Usually we have to wait like 2-3 episodes in anticipation for a performance.
>> ARTICLE
I really love this more than I loved the manga. Just because I can get to hear the music.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I"m getting lolicon baited hard. Might start having to ship Kousei x Nagi to make super pianist child taught by both of them and granny Seto. 

It is next week yet?

I AM SO HYPE FOR NEXT WEEKS EPISODE!!! I have been waiting for this one for a while now! :) Will probably be my favorite musical episode save one.

Best episode of the series for me :) Can't wait to see Takashi's face when his sister and Arima walk out.

i feel like these episodes are going way too fast, this was like 3 manga chapters in one episode.

or maybe i just don't want it to end.. i don't know which one

What if Kaori died after Kousei perfectly completed his performance, destroying his feelings of satisfaction and sending him into a relapse?

I am out of coping mechanisms.

I can't play the piano or violin like I usually do.

How do I respond to this???
>> ARTICLE
This episode is truly sad.
>> ARTICLE
I'm real glad I started watching this show again today. Last episode I saw was with the firefly scene at the end of it. Damn, I was about to really cry while I was watching this one. It made me feel really sad for Kousei when he broke down crying to Watari.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn, the tone of this is all over the place, though it isn't nearly as bad as the last episode.
>> ARTICLE
A thought I've been having for a while looking at the title of the show

The english title is "your lie in april" but wouldn't the direct translation be "your lie IS april"?
>> ARTICLE
I was going to write a response but it got big because "wa" is hard to translate and titles are especially hard to translate.  Short answer: "Your lie in April" is right.

So for anyone looking for the song in which Arima was listening too is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn6_yT9SKpM. Its Ravel and its a beautiful piece.
>> ARTICLE
I love this show from the second I found Kousei played nothing but chopin and the fact that it hits you in the heart, but Im a real sucker for the romance and we get little of that in the show.

I know the show really just revolves around Kousei and the people around him but i kinda just want to see some real romance. We can inches of it by either the scenes of the girls flashing back into how they began to like Kousei or how awkward gets around Kousei gets with Kaori (I know the whole thing why) But i just want like a sudden spark or even a kiss. Sue me for being a sucker for Romantic stuff
>> ARTICLE
This episode should have been 45 minutes!!!!
>> ARTICLE
I can't take it anymore! At this rate I don't know if Kaori is going to be able to eat another canele!
>> ARTICLE
For anyone who wants to experience more soul-crushing feelings in a similar scenario to this show I recommend the short manga [Story of a Dying Girl](http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/onnanoko-ga-shinu-hanashi-r11481).  Just ready yourself going in...not a whole lot of light-hearted moments to be had from what I remember.
>> ARTICLE
This show is going to be the death of me.
>> ARTICLE
Someone knows the song when Nagi is on the bathroom crying and Seto is talking with her?
>> ARTICLE
so, Kaori is going to die and Kousei is going to end up with the loli-chan? Hope not, she's awesome, but not with Arima.
Plus, Ezreal would have a heart attack
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if my heart can take a grey haired dying Kaori. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Kaori has the same illness his mother had. In the beginning of the show they allude to it by showing the lower half of Kaori's face a lot, just like they showed his mother's. Now they're doing it directly with the scenes of her in the hospital bed. I'm not looking forward to watching Kaori end up wheelchair-bound and oxygen dependent before she dies. Part of me is hoping for a deus ex machina where everything ends up fine, but that would be completely uncharacteristic of the show so even that would be a disappointment. Just this show...I feel so bad for everyone.
>> ARTICLE
I've been looking forward to this ep for a long time. I really, really like Nagi, and the animated Hiroko Seto talk to Nagi got me teary.

I remember reading Picture of Dorian Gray and the painter refuses to show his work to the world for that reason. The younger me wouldn't get it since the point of doing so much is to show it. Adult me however, thinks differently.

It truly is unfair that a whole life of work can be measured in one small moment. This can be a performance, an interview, or a design presentation. No matter which one, it really sucks to lay your efforts to be judged by others. They wouldn't care about your effort, but only your result.

Although I already know the result of the performance, next week can't come fast enough. Shirobako is a bonus for Thursday as well.
>> ARTICLE
Nagi's face reminded me of a muppet at 4:18 lol...I'm really bummed that I wait to have 7 days to at least see her brothers reaction, I was like "aaaoaoo show his faaaace..credits?  NOOOOOOO I don't wanna waaaiiit" lol.
>> ARTICLE
oh God i love this anime so much.
>> ARTICLE
Knowing how this ends, this episode is really depressing. And Watari knowing that he isn't fit for Kaori is just saddening. 

I wish Watari could get his development some time soon. I barely know anything about the character.
>> ARTICLE
I so love this series; the emotional load the creators manage to instill into the story is impressive. One of my favorites these past two quarters and one that I genuinely have no idea how far they're willing to take it. I've avoided reading so I don't know any spoilers, and have no clue how it's going to conclude. It's frightening because I really don't want K to die. But... Maybe. Let's hope. And enjoy the music.

great ep. it felt lighter than the last one.
[spoiler 'everything'](/s " after regretting at first to spoiler myself by reading the manga, im glad i did, so i had some time to wrap my head around everything and can watch the anime easier, that wait would kill me and the fact of not knowing what will happen over the next 5 weeks (.... will prolly still cry in the end but atleast without deep depression following, i hope)")

don't you feel that this was a weak episode? or at least it was for me.

>> ARTICLE
There are so many crying scenes per episode that I just can't take this seriously anymore. Melodrama to the max.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, the crying is coming from:

* A very stressful performance that is coming up (something that gets a person very emotional).
* A girl dying (yeah... better be emotions here).
* A guy basically reliving his mother's dead through said girl (again, better be emotions).

Is there too much crying? Maybe, maybe not. But dammit there better be SOME tears.
>> ARTICLE
So Kaori's legs get paralyzed, so she'll be confined to a wheelchair, *just like Kousei's mother*.

Great.

Did Tsubaki's senpai really break up with her because he's in love with someone else, or did he just make it up because he understood her feelings for Arima?

He started to get visibly annoyed at the fact that she kept talking about him so he probably took the hint
>> ARTICLE
I think he was being a good guy and letting her go without hurting her.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe a little bit of both? We know that Tsubaki was talking about Kousei all the time to him, but we don't really know if he met someone he likes.
>> ARTICLE
You can think that way, we don't know whether he said the truth or not, or maybe both.
>> ARTICLE
Seemed pretty obvious he did it because he could tell she didn't love him, but he tried to make it seem like it was his decision so she wouldn't feel bad about it.
>> ARTICLE
Well Tsubaki obviously realized what he did. Why else would she go "Sorry. Sorry. Sorry....etc"? It's too bad that she realized her feelings way too late in the game.

All I was thinking of, since the first episode, was "Why the hell did you introduce him to this violinist? She's obviously gonna steal him away from you? Are you a moron?". Goddamned feels!!

>> ARTICLE
Not exactly a doctor, but as far as I can tell it's too early for a definitive diagnosis, even based off the manga (which is a little further along in the storyline). In any case, here's a run down of what we know:

Firstly, it seems that it is likely a chronic disease that's been affecting her since before we meet her (episode 5: "I see... So I passed out again."), which results in episodes of syncope (e.g. after the competition, before the gala concert) and acute onset lower limb weakness. 

The only other information that we have is that she's on some form of IV medication ("please resume the IV drip") and that she may not have a very good prognosis ("I don't have time to read all these [books]...").

The manga hasn't really revealed many other clues so far, besides how [mild spoilers](/s "some sort of risky surgery may help/buy time and physio/rehab potentially can help retain function").

All in all, if we're going down the lines of an incurable fatal chronic disease, I would be thinking would be some sort of cancer that's metastasised (i.e. metastatic spinal cord compression as a cause of leg weakness). This would be in keeping with most of the clues aside from the syncope, since I don't think even brain tumours cause people to randomly pass out. Same deal with motor neuron disease, although I would have thought it unlikely given her age/lack of other symptoms ([reference to earlier spoiler](/s "and the fact that surgery can potentially help")).

The only other differential I can think of is some sort of heart abnormality, since arrhythmias could account for the syncope. However, I can't really think of any cardiac conditions that wouldn't just be treated, and even aortic coarctation wouldn't cause leg weakness like that. 

>> ARTICLE
Thank you! This was very helpful :P I always enjoy finding these things out. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not ALS. It's definitely neurological, but ALS doesn't start or progress all of a sudden. It also never attacks two limbs at the same time.
>> ARTICLE
It's Lupus
>> ARTICLE
It's never Lupis.
>> ARTICLE
Except for that one time.
>> ARTICLE
ALS does indeed seem likely with the loss of motor function in her legs.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, she's *14.* That's a bit early for such severe symptoms to be manifesting. Even then, she would've lost fine motor control in her hands far earlier.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno if they're just taking artistic license, but if they're trying to be accurate ALS doesn't fit. If she had ALS, she would be limping for months once the disease set in. Within a few months it would start affecting her other foot and eventually she would just never be able to walk normally (and eventually stand up) again.

Basically, ALS is insidiously progressive, and once function is gone you're not going to get it back, unlike Kaori who is able to resume as if nothing happened once the "episode" has passed.
>> ARTICLE
Juvenile ALS is very rare, could be also Huntington's or any other incurable debilitating neurodegenerative disease, really.
>> ARTICLE
But it doesn't have any sudden onset of paralysis AFAIK.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, and I don't believe it causes you to suddenly pass out. This seems more like a made-up disease convenient for anime.
>> ARTICLE
It's not as dramatic to be sure. I think the show is trying to play off the sudden collapses as the onset of the paralysis. 
>> ARTICLE
Is it Deadly? Is she going to die!?

>> ARTICLE
If she has ALS, she will die. There is no cure, and the treatments for it extend life expectancy by a few months. I hope it's because it's a painful disease to see someone go through. 
>> ARTICLE
> ALS

Typically it is deadly, however, there are unusual cases where the person lives.  Stephen Hawkings is a prime example of an ALS survivor.

If this is what she has, she'll progressively lose movement in her limbs, the ability to swallow properly, and speaking will be difficult.  The survival time from onset is usually around 40 months for ALS, however, it seems that she has limb-onset ALS and is still very young which typically slows the progression.
>> ARTICLE
Its too soon to predict that its ALS because Hypokalaemia may fit the early symptoms but its still deadly tho.
>> ARTICLE
Hypokalemia generally causes disseminated muscle weakness and not localized, and unless she had some severe renal dysfunction or hyperaldosteronism it would generally be isolated and not chronic like that.
>> ARTICLE
English bro.
>> ARTICLE
> [disease/condition] generally  causes [wide/spread out] muscle weakness and not localized [isolated, one area], unless she had some severe [kidney failure] or [high production of a adrenal-steroid-horomone] it would generally be isolated [localized, one area] and not [long-term/reoccuring] like that.
>> ARTICLE
aw freaking heck. Well, at least we're getting a real disease instead of a made up one (probably). Dang, this hurts.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, what were all those buckets of ice water for then, if not to save the waifus? God damn it.
>> ARTICLE
There are some promising treatments in the work right now, and the research efforts are well funded for now.  Give it time!
>> ARTICLE
Quick, everyone who knows anything about medicine discover a cure so that we can guarantee a happy ending!
>> ARTICLE
Holly shit, there are no more Death Flags. That was a fucking Death Billboard.
>> ARTICLE
I guess you could say it was a..Death Parade! Hahaha that was terrible I'll leave..
>> ARTICLE
10/10 for effort.

LOLI-PIANIST DISTRACT ME PLEASSSSSEEEEE. MAKE ME SMILE ;_;

She will. I promise that she will.

[This.](http://i.imgur.com/uoua1wD.png?1) (from last episode)

I really like how Kousei just kept playing the piano until Tsubaki started screaming. That's the nicest thing he could do for her.
>> ARTICLE
"[What's getting things to go? Like burgers? Like potstickers?](http://i.imgur.com/goqSKjj.png)"

This child will be the death of me.
____________
On a more serious note, it seems my suspicions were right: despite everything Tsubaki has said about supporting Kousei, it's really her that needs *his* support in her life. At the very least, making the decision to take a step forward will help her be better able to accept whatever comes her way.

EDIT: [~Full Episode Notes~](http://mageinabarrel.com/2015/01/29/your-lie-in-april-episode-15/)
>> ARTICLE
> This child will be the death of me.

Now we have another, crafty little sh*t to enjoy. This is going to be fun .... I said ignoring the mountain of death flags piling up over there.
>> ARTICLE
She really does a good job keeping the gloom of this series away. 
>> ARTICLE
Also during an emotional scene when suddenly the animation changes and they throw in some slapstick comedy to lighten the mood
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, so it looks like Kousei's student is Takeshi's little sister? Huh. That's going to make things nice and interesting... As if this show wasn't already interesting enough. I can't get enough of it! Never ceases to impress me.
>> ARTICLE
Confirmed in the OP if you look closely. Also miss Piano teacher gave us a strong hint when she was looking at imoutos competition entry.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "Yep! It's his little sister. But we don't know this yet.")
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, I must have missed that that was his sister...
>> ARTICLE
They haven't directly confirmed it yet but check out the OP (the bit where two kids run up a hill) and in tonights episode when Hirako Sensei was sitting looking at a picture of Imouto-chan.
>> ARTICLE
Haha well, I don't know for certain, but it definitely seems that way based off of Seto's reaction and the preview for the next episode. Guess we'll see!
>> ARTICLE
I mean, they have the same hair color...
>> ARTICLE
Well she introduced herself as Aiza Nagi and Takeshi's surname was Aiza iirc
>> ARTICLE
She introduced herself as Aiza**to** Nagi.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Checked and this is true! Good on you, my friend.
>> ARTICLE
I have a theory that Kaori has the same disease that Arima's Mother had, Arima's mother couldn't walk and she was in a wheelchair, meaning it's possible that's what Kaori has, and the disease will progress over time, plus when Arami entered and saw Kaori sitting on the bed, he saw her mother http://puu.sh/fcFKX/5690819e15.jpg

then it switched to Kaori, which might be hinting something
http://puu.sh/fcFUd/5d185b88bf.jpg
>> ARTICLE
You can interpret it as kaori literally having the same disease as his mom, but that wasn't really the point of the scene. The point was to show that kousei now believes kaori is dying, which is one of the reasons he couldn't force himself to see her this episode. 

I don't think it really matters if the disease is the same as his mom's, she just has to die from something similar, whether it be als, cancer, or whatever. As long as whatever kills her is slow, inevitable, and progressively gets worse, it'll have the same impact. I'd rather have them die from 2 separate things because if she dies from the same thing kousei would have something to blame for both deaths, which I don't like.
>> ARTICLE
Woah woah woah...calm down there Satan!  I'm hoping for some Dues Ex Machina type cure like "KOUSEIS PIANO CURED MY LIFE ENDING DISEASE YAY!"    
>> ARTICLE
It's not like I want her to die.... Ok that's a lie. I like it when characters die and bittersweet/tragic endings are my favorite.

Although, the author hasn't finished the manga, so there's still hope for the optimistic.
>> ARTICLE
* Tsubaki's friends measuring how far she went was hilarious. Congrats for beating a school record, Tsubaki!

* *Being Tsubaki is suffering.*

* That last scene... No... Her time is coming... ^^^^^^NO! ^^^^^^:(

* Fuck that scream. No... [It's raining today.](http://i.imgur.com/vPD5S87.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
It's raining here in my office. Don't know how that happened. (and no, I have no work to do, so while I SHOULD be working and would love to be working, I am not working)
>> ARTICLE
Why is this happening, I just want Kaori to smile again ;_; 
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, she is having one of the worst times ever. Dumped, rejected, losing in love to the walking(or not walking) death flag. Tsubaki certainly knows suffering. 
>> ARTICLE
I honestly feel so bad for every character in this show. This has got to be the most unlucky bunch of people ever. It's like a train wreck of misfortune and suffering.
>> ARTICLE
She's not dying of illness though, so she's got that going for her. 
>> ARTICLE
> the walking(or not walking) 

Dat harsh joke :'(
>> ARTICLE
It was a little funny how Kousei didn't stop playing the piano the whole time she cried until she screamed at him to stop.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, somebody's gotta put in that soundtrack for the emotional scene!
>> ARTICLE
OP MC now comes with built in soundtrack. What's next? 
>> ARTICLE
He finds the cure for some disease we have no name for still.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably ALS
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, with every episode ending on such a sad cliffhanger, I think a happy ending is entirely possible. Despite the feels, this show is still inspirational and uplifting, rather than just depressing. If done right, a happy ending could be the most impactful ending done, for me at least. I feel like this show would lose some charm/magic if it ended how we all expect it to.
>> ARTICLE
Happy ending would show that how harsh and fucked up the situation is, there is always a chance. I hope Kaori survived, because I'm no asshole, just like probably everyone here thinks she should survive.
>> ARTICLE
Watari wingman skills are clearly on point. When Kousei says that he never gave her his number, it would only mean one person could have given it to her. I don't think Tsubaki is likely to be the one who gave it. Watari is helping Kousei's case more than he would ever think.
>> ARTICLE
While Watari is shown as a womanizer, I think he actually likes Tsubaki, but he knows that she likes Kousei and doesn't stand a chance. Does anyone else feel the same?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure he likes Tsubaki more than as a friend, but he's definitely pushing Kawori towards Kousei. Such a bro.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how these episodes seem to pass by in 5 minutes but they do.  That ending makes me want the next episode so bad.
>> ARTICLE
IMO I think it's more likely that Kaori will end up disabled. Probably unable to play music ever again, I doubt she's actually going to die though.

It would make for a more bittersweet ending. Her being unable to play herself so she relies on Kousei to play for her. This is all 100% guessing obviously. Her dying just seems too painfully obvious at this point that it'd be very disappointing.

Either that or she ends up doing full recovery in the very end, wouldn't surprise me to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
and then she commits suicide because she doesn't want to go on living a life where she is unable to create her own music.  

that's the level this show is going right?
>> ARTICLE
Nah kousei will meet the black cat who is actually from Space. He'll be granted one wish on the condition that he becomes a magical girl. Then kaori will end up cured and dating watari 
>> ARTICLE
Building on what you said, maybe a couple of episodes ago when Kaori got sick and didn't show up for the competition leaving Kousei to play alone is foreshadowing for the end of the show :(  

This can be further backed up by that judge making the (harsh) assessment that Kousei needs tragedy in his life to fuel his playing. From this I see a possible ending of Kaori dying and Kousei going on to do great things in the music world all in the name of his mom and Kaori. 
>> ARTICLE

Oh man. Even with no audio that just killed me .
>> ARTICLE
The fact that they chose Clair De Lune as the song to play while Tsubaki was breaking down, sitting at the piano next to Arima as he silently listens to her grievances, was very poignant. It's a very warm, homely song. For some reason it always reminds me of being in my parents' cosy household sitting on the couch wrapped in a duvet. Maybe it was on some advertisement a long time ago while I was doing just this, but I'd like to think if it was used in that way it was because it has that effect on people.

The strange juxtaposition of her venting her grief to him while he plays these warm notes seemed to be his way of comforting her. Rather than try to reassure her using empty-sounding words, he uses music to soothe her pain in some way, which she ironically tells herself she hates. You might disagree with whether or not this was his intention, but I'd like to think that it fits his character perfectly.

To demonstrate how effective this piece of music is at conveying that feeling, [here's an incredibly relevant advertisement that was recently running over here in Ireland during Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE2MBHmn-Rw&x-yt-cl=85027636&feature=player_detailpage&x-yt-ts=1422503916#t=26).

## Episode 15 List of Classical Performances:

In addition to Clair de Lune this week (you can find the write up for it in last week's post), the other performance we got was Emi's performance at another piano competition.

---

**Scriabin: tude in D-sharp Minor, Op. 8, No. 12** - "The *perpetuum mobile* character of the finale of Scriabin's Sonata No. 2 is suggestive of the Romantic piano etude, and the genre itself was to become a significant part of the composer's output. Scriabin penned 26 etudes throughout his career, and, like his sonatas, they reveal significant stylistic development. The 12 installments of Op. 8 are firmly rooted in his early post-conservatory period and likely modeled after Chopin's two 12-etude sets (Op. 10 and Op. 25). Unequivocally tonal, Op. 8 nevertheless exhibits the rhythmic complexity and fervor that would come to define Scriabin's style. He had not yet devoted himself to mysticism, but a certain ecstasy and mania are already present in these early etudesqualities perhaps brought on by his nervous fits and excessive consumption of alcohol; Scriabin's teacher Vasily Safonov once remarked that his former student drank so much in his post-conservatory years that he was "inebriated for the rest of his life.""

With regards to the Etude No. 12: "The *patetico* heading recalls Beethoven's sonata and Tchaikovsky's then-recent symphony, but the brash and resplendent character of this piece set it far apart from these predecessors and more in line with Chopin's "Revolutionary" Etude (also No. 12 in its own collection, Op. 10). A perennial favorite for encores, its technical demands-which include constant large leaps in the left hand and single-hand stretches up to nearly an octave and a half-often proved too severe for Scriabin himself." [(Source)](http://www.carnegiehall.org/Event.aspx?id=10737421547&pn=10737421546)

Here's an interpretation of the work by the great [Vladimir Horowitz.](http://youtu.be/7ClDFmFmr0k)

(In fact, this tude was a favorite encore piece of Horowitz.)

---

The feels are intensifying, folks!  The first half of the episode was more on Tsubaki and the ~~drama~~ development she was going through.  Even though she was going through a lot, I was glad that she finally realized her true feelings and also realized that while Watari, Kousei, and everyone else she saw around her was advancing, she was the only one that wasn't advancing.  She has quite the desire to have time start moving for her again, and we'll be seeing more of that soon, [especially when (Manga Spoiler)](/s "she, in essence, confesses to Kousei....haaaah?!?!")  We also have a new character this week in *Aiza*to Nagi (it shouldn't be too hard to figure out who she really is, especially after next week's episode), and after successfully sneaking into the lives of Seto and Kousei, we have Seto turning the tables on Nagi by appointing Kousei as her teacher, much to his surprise.  [It will be fun the next couple episodes seeing](/s "how Nagi makes her hatred for Kousei more apparent, which leads Seto-san to tell her that "if you mean to cause Kousei any harm, I'll crush you".  In addition to this, we also see Nagi and Kousei start bonding a little more as he teaches her, which then leads him to asking her to allow him to perform with her at her school's festival. I won't spoil the reason as to why he does so, but I'll at least say his motivation is related to Kaori. The piece that will be the focus of the school festival is Rachmaninoff's transcription of the Waltz from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty.") In addition to the new ~~intruder~~ character, we have more intense feels and Kaori death flags....great.  If you're crying for her every episode...just make sure that you have some tears in reserve because I don't want to see you guys crying blood by the time this show is over.

Thanks again for taking the time to read my post this week! I hope you're looking forward to next week's episode as much as I am! :-)
>> ARTICLE
With the direction [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/OUG5RgV.jpg) was going with Subaki's thoughts added, I seriously thought for a few moments there that we could have seen her confess.

[Imouto-chan](http://i.imgur.com/IQswBuI.jpg) is pretty legit. I thought she would have been a cute character who was all about her brother, but the fact that she's a pianist and devious is great.

Finally we get to see some of the effects of whatever Kaori's problem is.  I can't think of anything worse then from out of the blue your [legs quit working](http://i.imgur.com/EVI0kJP.jpg) and you have to [crawl](http://i.imgur.com/tsNbwtL.jpg) across the floor.

No idea what she has, but I hope it's revealed soon enough.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just trying to imagine what hospital doesn't have night nurses within visibility of a hall near her room.  
>> ARTICLE
i'm pretty sure she has death.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, that last scene was so much more painful to watch animated than reading it in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
There is one specific scene in the manga that I am especially looking forward to, fully knowing that seeing it animated will break me for weeks.
>> ARTICLE
I already caught the feels while reading it in the manga, but damn. Seeing it animated? They did it justice, & wow was it hard to watch. That scream. So haunting :(
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Kaori pounding on her own legs was just heart wrenching. I'm really, really pleased with this anime adaptation so far, it's one of the few adaptations I don't have to tune in just to hope that it delivers (because it obviously will).
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Before I was just pleased w/ hearing all the classical music interpretations animated & fleshed out. Now I'm still coming back for that, but additionally for the beautifully animated rollercoaster of highs & unbearable lows like some sort of sick masochist hahah
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's not "Your Death in April" maybe it's "You're Lame in April"
>> ARTICLE
Oh man your fucking heartless ^^^^have ^^^^an ^^^^upvote
>> ARTICLE
This may just be a theory, but i think Kaori has Schilder's Disease, a variation of MS. 


>As the disease progresses, larger and larger patches of demyelination occur, interfering with motor movement, speech, personality, hearing and vision, ultimately affecting the vital functions of respiration, heart rate, blood pressure.

I really hope this isnt true though... :( ^^^^^please ^^^^^be ^^^^^wrong...


Edit: apparently having MS would explain the sudden "attack" of symptoms shown in the show (e.g. sudden fainting, sudden loss of leg function).
>> ARTICLE
When I was watching that scene, I thought it looked like a variation of MS as well. Would also explain why she faints sometimes. Came here to see if anyone else thought so, but most people think it's ALS. I guess we'll see!
>> ARTICLE
I love the new character introduction. I don't know why she attacked Kousei in the first place, but I think she is going to be a source of real growth for him.
>> ARTICLE
I made it through the whole episode without crying! That hasn't happened in awhile, step up your game Tsubaki. 
>> ARTICLE
did you... did you watch the end? ;_;
>> ARTICLE
I did, but it wasn't quite enough to get me leaking, surprisingly. I'm sure it'll be back to the water works next episode.
>> ARTICLE
so kao chan cannot walk now like kousie's mother, great episode especially tsubaki addressing her feelings towards kousie, she knows kousie is unreachable for her so she wants time to start, to move on.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus H. Christ. That ending. I'm not even going to start, it feels like it hasn't even sunk in yet.

Being Tsubaki is suffering. Kousei remains completely oblivious, Senpai dumped her, and she feels like everybody's moving on and leaving her behind. 

This show continues to be incredible and dramatic (that ending!) and beautiful, although there were a few awkward moments when it comes to animation I think. However, it is still gorgeous, it probably just set the bar a little high for itself. I'm interested in seeing how this new character and these new developments *(Kaori.)* are going to play out.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus H. Christ


What does the H. stands for?
>> ARTICLE
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_H._Christ#Etymology
>> ARTICLE
I'm not quite sure. I use it as a figure of speech, but I think the origin was it standing for Holy. I quite like the thought of Jesus's middle name being Hubert, myself :P
>> ARTICLE
So what if Kaori can be cured but the operation can't be afforded by her parents, so Kousei has to win some kind of competition with a lot of price money, before its to late?
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone tell me what song Kousei was playing while Tsubaki was sitting next to him?
>> ARTICLE
Claire de lune
>> ARTICLE
Searching for it may also bring you to [this song by Flight Facilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcu1AHaTchM), which is amazing. They have an album that came out recently which is particularly amazing. This is somewhat off-topic, but the topic is kind of related to music so I think it stands.
>> ARTICLE
Which seems to be popping up in all sorts of anime for some reason. 
>> ARTICLE
It was also playing during the walk on the beach scene last episode
>> ARTICLE
It's a popular piece in general so it'll definitely be used in all sorts of shows and stuffs
>> ARTICLE
by Claude Debussy
>> ARTICLE
The background music is just amazing. I could fell asleep by just listening to it.

The last scene was too painful to watch...and the ending doesn't help....T_T
>> ARTICLE
So Kousei will be surrounded by girls that like him while he chases after a girl that has no future? 

Guess he will be a true artist when he loses Kaori.
>> ARTICLE
This show does whatever the fuck it wants to me.    
    If she dies I don't even fucking know what I will do
>> ARTICLE
I KNEW SHE WASN'T GOING TO DIE! ALL THOSE DEATHFLAGS WERE FAKE! I CALLED IT!!!  
We got Kousei female version now, she's really funny despite her short appearance.  
About the rest of the episode: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK :'( *i cri erytiem :'(*
>> ARTICLE
We have 7 more episodes for her to live through. I'm afraid it isn't over yet ;_;
>> ARTICLE
I think this was supposed to be the "climax" when it comes to Kaori's health state but I can't tell since I don't read manga ;_; Hopefully she lives through, it was already sad enough to see this scene.
>> ARTICLE
Kaori is going to live right? Her legs just fell asleep....yeah
>> ARTICLE
She is actually just a huge masochist, she was running around the hospital with rope bindings under her cloth, but some of the knot stop the blood circulation to her legs and they fell asleep. Which also explains why she was sweating so much, she have been jumping around being horny for a while... but this unexpected turn off events has her panicked, she has to quickly get to her room to take off these ropes before anyone notices her fetish, she might be ruined for life if not( for marriage). 


>> ARTICLE
Thought this was gonna be a good week. I was perfectly fine, up until the last few min. [Why does this have to happen?](http://media0.giphy.com/media/4NuAILyDbmD16/giphy.gif) 
>> ARTICLE
It's not "Your lie in April", it's "Your lie-in April". 

Kaori is just going to relax in bed for a month. That's all.
>> ARTICLE
The death flags are only becoming more and more obvious. 

edit: you know what would be the most shocking twist the show could do? have her live and be fine after all these death flags
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else get reminded of 'One Litre of Tears' by that ending?
>> ARTICLE
And now Kaori is going to have to use a wheelchair, which will remind Kousei even more of his mother's physical state before she died, thus causing even more emotional conflict within him.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck Kaori's screams of despair broke me.
>> ARTICLE
Not since I watched Angel Beats have I wanted to stop watching an anime so bad. For good reasons. So god damn emotional. BUT SO GOOD.

FUckkkk
>> ARTICLE
This weeks episode brought to you by the word: FUCK!
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, Kaori can't even stand up anymore. That last scene made me tear up. At this point I can't even see an ending where she isn't going to die. 
>> ARTICLE
Everytime I see Takeshi's hair I can't help but think how ridiculous it is. 2edgy4me. I'm a little surprised the judges don't think much of it since it looks totally unprofessional, imo.

Tsubaki, it sucks that Kousei is moving, but you had to know this was coming, right? Or would you rather he be miserable forever? Still, I liked you more than Kaori because you got more character development. ;_;7 I'm hoping we get some Kaori character development soon.

As a side note, I looked up what a canel is, and while not difficult to make it seems like getting the molds for it will be quite the set back. :( Most recipes seem to recommend using the copper molds, and those can cost $20/mold. There goes my dream of making my own.

Crazy hair shows his artist spirit. Or his Saiyan heritage, at times I'm not sure which.
>> ARTICLE
Woah, that last scene was fucking heavy.
>> ARTICLE
god damn it...
>> ARTICLE
I know many people are talking about all the so called deathflags being thrown around, but at this moment I think it would be more interesting if Kaori actually lives, as that will require the story to pull out all the stops to invalidate all the deathflags in a satisfying way.

By this point the progression of the story we as viewers have created this expectation that she is going to die and I think a twist would definitely pay off from this setup.

Ive really appreciated the series so far and loved following the score progression on MAL (400ish to now 62), which feels like a good build up without being overhyped. I understand why Kaori has to die for the sake of the story and symbolism but the atmosphere of the show is more often than not lighthearted and positive which makes me hope for the best. The ending will be interesting no matter what happens!

I feel like there are going to be no winners at the end of this anime.  Only suffering.

"Oh yeah I remember episode 15 is named Liar from the preview last week. Wait 'liar', isn't this show called Your ~~Deathflag~~ Lie in April? Oh my god I think I'm gonna die this episode, this better not show some more heartbreaking stuff, more than usual that is."

*12 mins in* this aint half bad, more of Tsubaki's emotional drifts, we saw Takeshi's little sister, it hasn't been much of an emotional rollercoaster as I expected it would be...

*22 mins* WELP episode 15 entitled 'Liar' really lived up to my fucking expections. [This is me after the episode](http://i.imgur.com/7lYx3eO.jpg?1)  RIP my emotions

My one regret this season is not waiting until this series end before I start.  Now every week seems like an eternity.  And damn you Kousei for not visiting Kaori sooner!!!  Pussy!

Anyone else bothered by the way the kids measured what looks like long jump at the start, she clearly stepped in the pit than fell. 

This show really throws comedy in at the wrong times imo, always in the middle of something serious.

Tsubaki still has it rough. I wouldn't even mind the childhood friend winning, but they always seem destined to lose.

We still don't know what exactly is wrong with Kaori. Whatever she has is now progressing to the point where she's lost the use of her legs. 

So I binged what's currently out with the manga. To me the series is far better than the manga. The manga has a bit more story, but the series does what the manga can't, music. Both are amazing, but you can't beat hearing the characters play.

Current suspicions are Motor Neurone Disease, I suppose it explains how she wants to do quite a fast motion activist before she... Goes...

I gotta shamefully admit that I never really cared for Kaori at all. Found her annoying through the entire series. Tsubaki though, dem feels, although she is being a retard on some levels aswell.

Oh gosh... that ending it happening isn't it?

The more I watch this the more I don't think she's "dying" but suffering from a degenerative disease like ALS which of course would mean she's dying as all those disease end up being fatal but they are generally slow deaths where she has years left to live.

Holy macaroni. I don't know whether Kaori or Tsubaki suffers more. The ending was a bit intense for me.

This week, in *Shigatsu wa Kimi no Feels/Your Feels in April*:

Aiza Nagi... I think that's Takeshi's sister. It's going to be interesting.

Kousei is really intent on going to a music-oriented high school. Good for him, bad for Tsubaki.

Oh, Tsubaki, I still have hope for you to find happiness. Alas, Kaori entered the competition at the top of her game, and she's already swept Kousei off his feet.

Dem feels... Dem deathflags...

Can you guys feel it? It's the end. That last scene marked the beginning of the end. The time is coming for our mettle to be put to the test. My body is not ready.
>> ARTICLE
Well fuck... glad that ended on a high note =/

I just want one episode where everyone is happy and only good things happen...

Or more Emi, I'd settle for that

I would have loved to see Eimi play all of Scriabin's Etude (Op.8 No.12 for those that are interested ).

God damn those deathflags are getting worse each week.

So, this episode is called "Liar". Who do you guys think its talking about? Is it Tsubaki cause she's hiding her true feelings. Is it that junior high pianist? Something seems fishy, she's obviously up to some scheming. Or is it Kaori for lying about her condition?

It's titled "liar" because kosei says that he will stay by tsubaki's side but he is going away.

Woah, the hospital scene with kaori was much more affecting than the same scene in the manga

I originally didnt like the little sister, but why the end of the arc, i totally changed my mind.
>> ARTICLE
I'm late to the party but I feel like the show did things differently this week, it may be glaringly obvious but bear with me.

In earlier episodes, anytime we are shown evidence of Kaori's illness it has been in a familiarly vague fashion we're used to seeing in other anime. By that, I mean a sudden collapse followed by her waking up in the hospital all smiles and no worries because it's "nothing serious". Certainly we've seen anime featuring the female protagonist faint in a moment of weakness "from anemia"or other reasons, so that in itself isn't so unique to this show, its an all too familiar trope. 

What is unique, I feel, in this episode is we don't just fade to black once things go wrong. We watch an agonizing four minutes of panic setting in for Kaori whom was happily singing moments earlier. To faint and wake up in a hospital bed is one thing, the character is spared some of their dignity at least. Dragging your lifeless legs across the floor in a state of panic and screaming as the gravity of the situation sets in, not so much.

We were able to see a new face on Kaori today, fear. Very different from her usual confident smile we're used to. This may be all too obvious to most of you, but I thought it was unique. However I'm very scared for the future of this show.
>> ARTICLE
Melodrama for days. I'm glad that guy Tsubaki was pretending to be in a relationship with finally broke up with her, because clearly she didn't have the courage to do it. Even now, she's just telling the universe to "start time flowing again" for her instead of really taking initiative herself.

Meanwhile, Kaori collapses in the middle of a hospital hallway, yells at her legs, and eventually screams, yet nobody responds. What is this, a horror movie?

This "Aizato Nagi" girl seems interesting. Even if someone hadn't spoiled her identity in last week's discussion thread, I'm pretty sure I'd be able to guess who she was...

EDIT: Also, disappointed in the numerous still shots of her "playing" the piano. Apparently she's not important enough for the show to actually animate her playing.
>> ARTICLE
Being Tsubaki is suffering

Holy shit I got hit super hard by Kaori pounding her own legs, good god my waifu can't be treated like this :c

Can we say that Kaori has zero death flags up because what appears to be death flags is *normal* for her? Like, if we got a 'everything is going to be daijobu' flag, then we should be worried. Right?

In all honesty, this show has become one that I could watch over and over again and still enjoy it. 

I spoiled it a little for myself and read the most recent raws, so I'm just waiting for the rest of the series to pan out until then.

>Obligatory "is she dead yet"?
>Actually ... I want to get home to watch this because childhood friend might actually make some progress for the first time in a long while in anime. 

 Even if Kaori does end up meeting her inevitable demise I don't really see Kousei and Tsubaki having any sort of significant relationship. Actually, if Kaori dies the likelihood of Kousei developing a relationship with another girl sort of just goes down the can. Especially when considering the fact that Kousei has such strong feelings for Kaori and has already dealt with the sorrow of losing a person close to him. As it is I see this anime running along the route to tragedy so I don't really see there being a happy ending , that is, unless Kousei decides to move on with his musical career as an homage to Kaori (which imo would be kind of lame.)  
Having said it is probably just wishful thinking to believe that any serious developments will occur (in a romantic fashion) between Tsubaki and Kousei. But hey, at least in the end everyone can end up unhappy together 



>> ARTICLE
Referencing earlier episode, he needs tragedy to evolve. So it's not a question of if but when.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, as you pointed out, there will be tragedy. Otherwise, the show wouldn't be very interesting. However, what what we do not know is the severity of whatever calamity is to occur. Leading theory, as I've stated before, Kaori dies. But maybe something misfortunate happens that isn't as significant as Kaori's death? Now I'm thinking rather wishfully, but I'd just hate to see things pan out the way I think they will; i.e. Kaori on her deathbed saying her sentimental farewells but still wants Kousei to live on etc.. I like this series for being different which is exactly why I don't want end in such a cliche fashion. Sure tragedy is needed but I believe there are other ways to go about tying this series up. Just my two cents :3
>> ARTICLE
I just wish for an ending where Kaori's terrible illness becomes stable and both Kaori and Kousei starts dating and makes it in Europe, is that so much to ask for? ;c
>> ARTICLE
If only that could happen :c Although chances are a Clannad is likely to be pulled. Though I'm not opposed to the idea of an unexpected plot twist where the two end up in a happy relationship.
(^^)
>> ARTICLE
Next episode is going to be sooo nice, we will finally get to see the rivals playing, Takeshi will play Chopin's Etude Op. 10 No. 4 and we will probably even be able to see Emi play one of my favorite piece of Chopin's Etudes (Op. 25 No. 11).
>> ARTICLE
One of the OST got released. My brother listened to them and said at least one of the violin pieces is played by Sarah Chang, at least extremely similar in style, so the album is far from bad (though I'm not sure if this is merely just A-1 slapping together a bunch of songs from different albums or they actually recorded specially for this show). 
>> ARTICLE
Chopin's tudes are so great to listen to! I prefer Op. 10 No. 4 to Op. 25 No. 11 personally but I absolutely love Op. 10 No. 5! 

I'm glad that this show is somewhat opening up classical music to more people. People seem to really be enjoying all of the pieces used so I'm hoping more and more people will listen. I also like that they show how nervous the musicians are before they go on. Even if it was a concert instead of a competition and it was just put on for the school or for the band members families I would still end up that nervous before.


If you consider what the songs sound like a spoiler, don't watch these next videos.

Here are the pieces /u/Slyuse and I mentioned!

If you have some time on your hands I'd recommend going through all of Chopin's tude's and listening!

It's hard not to adore Chopin, he was absolutely brilliant!

Hey, I know Op. 10 No. 5! My knowledge of classical music is pretty much 0, but I remember it was played every now and then by Kazusa in WA2, when they weren't practicing a song and she just played something herself. I like it a lot.


>> ARTICLE
I'm not very knowledgeable of Piano pieces. I played clarinet and didn't pay to much attention to other instruments. Op. 10 No. 5 is also called the Black Key tude.

That's good that you liked it! I have no idea if you will like this but it's one of my favorite, if not my actual favorite of all time, it's very fun to listen to! [Solo de concours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSIDbFX8XVk)
>> ARTICLE
Listening to it right now, it sounds great! I played guitar myself and never really got into genres such as this. It was since recently when I finished Shinsekai Yori that I got interested in the [New World Symphony (2nd movement)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCydQm83cJQ) by Antonin Dvorak. I didn't really know where to go from there, apart from browsing Youtube a bit, but I got to quite enjoy music like this. 

So if you've got any more, feel free to share them :)

I love the New World Symphony, I played trombone in high school and our part was a lot of fun. We played a couple different arrangements for competition, and I they were all great.

I just click on the related videos and it's a night of new music every night I do it!

I was pretty hyped when I saw everyone was playing Chopin's Etudes.

Although I would have had a heart attack and died from excitement if they played Chopin's Ballades.

[Chopin Ballade Op. 23 No.1](http://youtu.be/yt2Dmg4ebh8) My personal favorite.

[Chopin Ballade Op 38 No. 2](http://youtu.be/gzPKTlc-Aa8) Turn this one down; Kissin gets a little...fired up around 2:40.

[Chopin Ballade Op. 52 No. 4](http://youtu.be/7tmQSWuYwrI)

Although, now that I'm listening to them I can see why they weren't put in the anime; they usually have slow starts a lot longer on average than the etudes.

Oh, and hello fellow Chopin fans! It's an honor to meet you.

Oah, you're right!! They would be great as background music.

Oah, I don't know if I've ever heard anyone play Etude Op.25 No.6 live.  

Winter Wind was the set piece for a competition in San Francisco I was at (didn't play) a number of years ago (6 I think?).  

But yea, I totally get why they used the etudes for the show and they're great, so I don't really have much room to complain lol.  Chopin is Chopin, I'm just happy to be able to watch a show where his work is even played.

WATARI CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!!! That made me so happy. They're a great group, I want to see some more in-depth dynamics between the four of them (so far Watari has been a little left out of things, I feel).

I really like the two rivals - I like how they seem more "anime"-esque in look and attitude in comparison to the main four, and I really like the dynamic they have going between the two of them ^I ^may ^^already ^^^ship ^^^them

Excited to see more of them and how they interact with Kousei!

> WATARI CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!!! That made me so happy. They're a great group, I want to see some more in-depth dynamics between the four of them (so far Watari has been a little left out of things, I feel).

Totally agree. Honestly, his character probably interests me the most, just because the character arcs of the others seem pretty predictable.

> I may already ship them

I was wondering "are they dating or something?" during the episode because I just found it weird that two high-level competitors would be spending so much time together before the competition talking about Kousei.
>> ARTICLE
I think adding him in a serious capacity to the mix of the other three will shake things up in a good way - we still don't know how he really feels about Kaori, since he acts the same towards most girls, and nothing's been shown about how he feels about her hanging out with Kousei, unlike Tsubaki. Hope that's a plan for the season.

I like the idea that the other two kids are "performance kids", and have just spent so much time together that they are kinda-sorta friends, in a lonely at the top way. 
>> ARTICLE
> I like the idea that the other two kids are "performance kids", and have just spent so much time together that they are kinda-sorta friends, in a lonely at the top way. 

Yeah, I'm not sure of their backgrounds or their characters (beyond their "rivalry" with Kousei), so I'm still wondering about them. Hopefully they get more characterization.

[I want to protect this smile with all my heart. :3](http://imgur.com/2W90isG)

[They are "fired" up!](http://imgur.com/luVYKLu)

Kousei's rivals are set to take the stage, and both are looking to take him out. What's interesting here is that, after all this time, they have this burning desire to beat him. Without really understanding what he's gone through, both physically and mentally, they just automatically assume he's the same kid he was years ago. Obviously that isn't the case.

Am I expecting Kousei to win this competition? Honestly, I'm not sure. My gut tells me he won't. He probably beats one of them (the guy), and comes close to winning, but just misses out. Perhaps because I feel the show is looking to go for the better message; winning isn't everything, but having fun and trying your hardest with no regrets. I would *like* him to win, but it's a bit to early for that I think.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair Arima seems to be oblivous to the pain he inflicted on his Rivals just as his Rivals are oblivious to the pain he is/has gone through.

Out of everything, I'm honestly happy they kept Tsubaki's leg bandaged because that last scene from Ep 6 was breathtaking... Is that weird? Am I wrong for saying that?

Yea, same here. I don't think he is going to win. It just doesn't fit with the story. However, if it works out, but without a prize, it will still be a victory over himself.
>> ARTICLE
Their probably gonna have Kousei play the piano but it's different from how it was 2 years ago. It'll have more emotion in it, much like how Kaori plays the violin.
>> ARTICLE
Im pretty sure thats exactly whats going to happen. They were saying something along the lines of him always playing the score perfectly as the score intended. Atleast thats how he was when he was a kid and its what they are expecting him to do now. Im actually hoping he takes influence from Kaori and proves that he has changed.

And as such he won't win, but the crowd will love him.  That's my hope.

That or he will be terrible and his rivals will be so horrified about it and demand to know what happened.

Finally we got some Kousei internal character development that wasn't just pushed onto him by the other characters.

My prediction: Kousei's rivals will win the competition but will not get the victory they wanted either because

1. Kousei stops hearing, panics, and disqualifies himself. His rivals are unsatisfied with this and explain their feelings to him afterwards further developing Kousei's character

2. Kousei starts playing out of the box and judges don't like it because that's not what the competition is for. So his rivals finally hear him do something original
>> ARTICLE
My guess was number two. Hoping that last minute he "finds himself" in Chopin and goes off like she did in the violin contest.
>> ARTICLE
Im thinking number 2.
>> ARTICLE
I fervently hope it is #2. In his conversation with the cat/his inner monologue, it seemed like he was finally ready to play music for himself, to find himself within Chopin. So he will, in all probability lose the competition, but take an important step in moving past his traumatic past. 
>> ARTICLE
He has nothing at stake in this conversation. As a plot piece there isn't much reward to him winning the competition, whereas if he loses he might get motivation for the next one or something.

Side Note: His "rivals" aren't really... his rivals... he doesn't even know who they are. Maybe at a later date they will be but right now not really.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you. Its like the saying,"winning is a trophy, but losing is a lesson." In this case Kousei doesn't need a victory, he needs motivation to keep going. Which is why I think he will not win, but he will give a performance that gives him the confidence to keep going, rather than having another breakdown.
>> ARTICLE
Wining now would be too easy.  There is more hard work and setbacks ahead.

## Episode 07 List of Classical Performances:

This week we have a couple new pieces, courtesy of the piano competition.

---

### Information on the Piano Competition Piece Selections

In the manga, the participants in the upcoming piano competition were required to play two pieces; one of their pieces must be a Chopin tude, and the other piece must come from J.S. Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier."  [Based on this image in the anime,](http://i.imgur.com/TLk2h2N.jpg) I originally thought that they would deviate from what the manga did; however, after this week's episode, I'm glad to find out that some of the competitors are playing some of the Prelude and Fuges in Bach's WTC.

## Chopin: tudes - Opus 10 and Opus 25

Chopin wrote three sets of *tudes* (French for *studies*); the most popular tudes are the Opus 10 and Opus 25 studies where each one consists of 12 different studies, and the third set consists of three tudes with no Opus number.  These studies presented a new way to play piano, and they were radical and revolutionary when they first appeared.  They are also some of the most challenging and evocative pieces in classical repertoire, and this is one of the reasons why they're still popular to this day (I'm glad to say I know how to play a couple of them! XD).  

The Opus 10 tudes were composed between 1829 and 1832, and were published in 1833 when he was 23 years old.  He dedicated the Opus 10 set to his good friend Franz Liszt (another famous composer).  The Opus 25 tudes were composed at various times between 1832 and 1836, and were published in 1837. The final three tudes, part of a series called "*Mthode des mthodes de piano*" compiled by Moscheles and Ftis, were composed in 1839, without an assigned opus number.

Out of the Opus 10 and 25 tudes Chopin wrote, the more popular ones have been given nicknames; some examples include:

* Opus 10, No. 3: nicknamed "**Tristesse**" (meaning Sadness) or "**L'Adieu**" (meaning Farewell) 
* Opus 10, No. 5: nicknamed "**Black Keys**" since the right hand is only played with the black keys of the piano, except for only **one** white key [(yes, only **one** key (the only white key plays the note in red)).](http://i.imgur.com/pWNSIuI.png)
* Opus 10, No. 12: nicknamed "**Revolutionary**" due to it's powerful and strong melody.
* Opus 25, No. 9: nicknamed "**Butterfly**" due to light and bouncy nature of the right hand.
* Opus 25, No. 11: nicknamed "**Winter Wind**"; listen to it and you'll understand why this name is perfect.
* Opus 25, No. 12: nicknamed "**Ocean**" due to the stormy sound of the arpeggios.

Although no nicknames are of Chopin's original creation, they create interesting pretext and encourage the imagination to fabricate epic works embodied by these studies.

## Bach: The Well-Tempered Clavier (Book I: BMV 846 - 869; Book II: BMV 870 - 893)

The Well-Tempered Clavier is a collection of solo keyboard music composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. He gave the title to a book of preludes and fugues in all 24 major and minor keys, dated 1722, composed "for the profit and use of musical youth desirous of learning, and especially for the pastime of those already skilled in this study". Bach later compiled a second book of the same kind, dated 1742, with the title *Twenty-four Preludes and Fugues*. The two works are now considered to make up a single work, *The Well-Tempered Clavier*, or "the 48", and are referred to as The Well-Tempered Clavier Book I and The Well-Tempered Clavier Book II respectively. This collection is generally regarded as being among the most influential works in the history of Western classical music.

Each of Book I and Book II contain twenty-four pairs of preludes and fugues. The first pair is in C major, the second in C minor, the third in C-sharp major, the fourth in C-sharp minor, and so on. The rising chromatic pattern continues until every key has been represented, finishing with a B-minor fugue.

Bach's title suggests that he had written for a (12-note) well-tempered tuning system in which all keys sounded in tune (also known as "circular temperament"). The opposing system in Bach's day was meantone temperament in which keys with many accidentals sound out of tune.  It is sometimes assumed that Bach intended equal temperament, the standard modern keyboard tuning which became popular after Bach's death, but modern scholars suggest instead a form of well temperament. There is debate whether Bach meant a range of similar temperaments, perhaps even altered slightly in practice from piece to piece, or a single specific "well-tempered" solution for all purposes.

---

The first new piece we heard this episode was from Book II of the WTC.

---

**Bach: Prelude and Fuge in C Major, BMV 870 (from WTC Book II)** - "The C-major Prelude that begins Book II has a majestic quality with its resounding opening C octave pedal in the bass that seems to announce the opening of this new project. The Prelude also modulates through an astounding number of keys given its two-minutes length. In view of Bachs penchant for musical rhetoric and symbolism, this too seems to sum up the nature of the rest of Book II, which contains preludes and fugues in all the major and minor keys. The three-voiced fugue does not take up the symbolism, but rather proceeds stolidly in a definitive C major." [(Source)](http://www.thegilmore.org/wpgil/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/notes_uchida_apr_13_2013.pdf)

[Here's an interpretation of this work by Sviatoslav Richter.](http://youtu.be/tkNzx7hXu_U)

---

Many thanks to /u/pianist_for_kicks and /u/buakaw for their comments that revealed to me identity of the second piece.

---

**Schubert: Piano Sonata in A Minor, D. 845** - "The A minor Sonata, D. 845 is the second of the three sonatas which Schubert worked on in the spring and summer of 1825. It was completed by the end of May and published the following year with a dedication to Beethovens great patron, Archduke Rudolph.

Schubert declares the A minor Sonatas tragic nature at the start, with a unison phrase which also occurs in his song *Totengrbers Heimwe* (The Gravediggers Homesickness) at the words "Abandoned by all, cousin only to death, I linger at the edge, a cross in my hand, and stare with yearning down into the deep, deep grave!" The other important element is the crisp, stark little march figure, with its stabbing repeated notes, which follows a little later. The first of these ideas dominates the later stages of the movement, with the second emerging from time to time as a powerful, even somewhat sinister, presence, often in the bass.

The C major second movement is a set of five variations on a gentle, dance-like theme. The atmosphere is predominantly light and playful, except for the third variation, in C minor, which interrupts the mood with its darker, more strenuous tone. The delicate triplet figures of the fifth variation continue into the coda which draws the movement quietly to a close.  Off-beat accents and a sense of rhythmic waywardness enhance the scherzos driving energy, contrasted with a quieter, slightly slower trio section.  

The finale returns to something of the first movements somber character, but an unremitting drive suggests a determination to face down its tragic implications. Occasionally the music is colored by some characteristically Schubertian hesitations between major and minor, while the final few moments, in which the music gets both faster and quieter, sets up expectations which are bluntly contradicted by two loud final chords."

This week we finally get to learn more about Kousei's "rivals" from the past.  I liked how they portrayed their frustration when they were younger (with fire and lasers, of course).  We also get kuroneko-san's warning to Kousei about "the other person" who's going to visit him soon.  [Anyway, during this competition, we're going to see](/s "Takeshi and Emi putting all their emotions into their pieces, which in turn reach and inspire Kousei. Kousei recognizes them as pianists (because he wasn't paying attention to them back then due to him focusing on winning competition after competition in hopes that it will help his mom overcome her illness) at which point their rivalry becomes more friendly.")  Based on the preview we got for next week's episode, it seems to me that we won't be hearing Kousei perform until Episode 09! It will be quite the episode...I guarantee it.  [I'm especially looking forward to seeing](/s "Kousei's transformation during his performance...as well as SUNFLOWERS (yes, that's right...Sunflowers...because reasons)!!") :O

Thanks again for taking the time to read a much longer post this week! I hope you're looking forward to next week's episode as much as I am! :-)

Man, that Schubert piece is long.

I'm guessing that Chopin section in your post is the same as last week?

Yea, it's the same; it will be there for the length of the piano competition.

Ah, okay. You might want to note that it's the same in future posts so that those of us who've read it before can scroll past it to the rest of your post. Just a suggestion :)

Thank you for the playlist!

Friend A, you gotta take care of yourself. And they just let that cat cross your path. Hope nothing gets worse. 

I was thinking they'd link fingers. Guess not. 

When his friend was walking in the aisle, all I could think of was all the room he had to walk normally. 

You're a star, Friend A, so grit your teeth!

It feels like a let down not seeing the actual showdown, but when I thought about it a bit more, there was a lot of important development for kousei here and should set the stage for an even more awesome showdown.

I really wanted to hear them play. Now I have to wait a week :c
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about other people, but I am a very poor judge of when classical music is played well or not. Without seeing the characters reaction, audience reaction, or change in artwork, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a "bad" performance and a "good" one. The way the judges grade things feels totally arbitrary to me as well. 

Does the manga move beyond just having contests to gauge how Kousei is improving himself? Because this formula might get old. It's not like a baseball anime where it is very clear what it takes to win.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually a pretty good judge of classical music, and this series confuses me all the time because things that sound perfectly correct are represented as "bad".
>> ARTICLE
Don't feel all too bad about that. It takes musical training and/or some time of actively listening to classical music to be able to judge accurately whether or not music is being played well (as in, in tune and in tempo, etc.) and it takes familiarity with the piece itself to be able to judge whether or not it's being played accurately, and whether the player is injecting their own inherent style and flair to the performance.

The anime does make it easier to tell the difference though. For example in Episode 2 when they're all playing the Kreutzer they deliberately make the early performances softer and slower with less flair and aggressiveness while Kaori's preformance (Probably based off of [Francescatti's rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgFIe6ax7j4)) is  louder, has more screen time, and is audibly different from the rest of the entries. 

Also the classical music world that Kaori and Kousei are in revolves heavily around conservatories, competitions and recitals so it's just a reflection of how the modern music world works. It's a bit hard for non initiates to tell who's "winning" or "better" but it's difficult to make an anime about aspiring soloists without touching upon how they actually put themselves out there; it would be like having a basketball anime where they enter chess competitions and only practice basketball. It wouldn't make much sense. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree in some sense, but I think shows like Nodame Cantabile were able to move beyond just competitions and really show characters develop and have their music improve.
>> ARTICLE
Nodame still circled around auditions and concerts though so it's not like they managed to completely move away from it. The early parts of Nodame were a bit similar to how this is set up honestly. 
>> ARTICLE
I meant moving away from competitions like these where you are just graded on how accurate your playing is. Not concerts etc. in general (that wouldn't make any sense).

Edit: I should write that I mean to say that competitions that grade on accuracy are hard for most people to judge, whereas more creatively free competitions are easier IMO.
>> ARTICLE
I would like to say that there are competitions like that in the real world that they can use as a basis but there really isn't. 

One of the really good things about the anime is that it points out that flaw in the current world of classical music. There's too much of a focus on accuracy and score perfect readings that can be measured in numbers rather than focusing on artistic interpretation. 

Nodame touches on it as well actually. One of the reasons why she's not considered one of the "best" is because she hates playing by the score and adds in various little flourishes that would hamper her score in competitions. They can move out of it in Nodame though because they're a school orchestra that doesn't need to enter competitions regularly; it gives them more creative control over how they interpret the music. 

Soloists have it a bit different. No one is going to hold a concert for two middle schoolers even if one of them is a famous pianist. So the narrative is forced into entering them into competitions and recitals. 
>> ARTICLE
The anime is actually catching up to the manga really quickly, especially since the translation for the manga are so slow. As for how it is, [spoiler](/s "So far there are no more official contests after this one but there is another performance that they work towards, but those are almost never the sole focus of the manga. It's more about Kousei's emotional struggle with dealing with his past and the now.")
>> ARTICLE
> I am a very poor judge of when classical music is played well or not.

Nothing made this more clear to me than last episode with Opus 25, No. 5. When Arima first played it, I agreed with him that it sounded like complete shit. And then Kaori said she submitted the recording, and I couldn't understand why anyone with ears would think he even knew how to play a piano.

And then I heard the piece [done by a professional,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkdgFfKIWbA) and realized that it was pretty much supposed to sound like that, and the presence of "wrong notes" is important.
>> ARTICLE
I came in this thread looking for Super Saiyan Jokes, what I got was even better, that Chopin's tudes sounded great.
>> ARTICLE
I love the OST when Aiza gets on stage. Gives me chill everytime.  
Oh well, the whole Soundtrack is amazing.  
This Anime is my favourite already.

would you happen to know the title of that piece you're talking about?

Sadly, no.

>> ARTICLE
I don't believe any Schubert is standard competition repertoire. They're generally not very flashy or technically difficult. At least, I never played or heard any Schubert in the old days... perhaps the meta-game has changed.
>> ARTICLE
I only recognized it because of Nodame.

For anyone wondering it's the piece at 17:54 mark.

This anime is so inspiring. If only I could get into music. 
>> ARTICLE
Never too late to pick up an instrument!
>> ARTICLE
Pick an instrument based on the sound and accessibility, then get on it. Nothing google can't solve, it's only a couple click away, and I promise you it's true. Most instruments are virtually buyable through the net and self-teachable.

The only instruments I know of that aren't self-teachable are in the string family (violin, viola, cello, double base) and even then, once you get the basics down (unfortunately which will take a long while), it's just practice practice practice.
>> ARTICLE
Its never too late. It really is more about effort than when you start. 
>> ARTICLE
Next episode HYYPPPEEE!

So far with Watari and Tsubaki losing, I feel like it's setting up for Kousei losing too. If he does, I imagine it'd give him a bit of character development and Kaori will light a fire under his ass again. 

I find it interesting how Kaori is basically Kousei's muse, though I wonder if the feelings are mutual.
>> ARTICLE
honestly, I dont like when they are seriously talking and suddenly scene of akari angry with a bit of comedy. fucks up the scene... ,    
but still best anime of the season for me!

btw, how the fuck did they grow up like that in 2  years lol

The difference between a twelve-year-old and the fourteen-year-old is vast.

it looks like they went from 8 or so to like 16-18 ish, I keep telling myself that their actually older then the show says because half the stuff they do isnt something a 14 year old would do. I mean, I was not this serious about anything when I was 14.

Oh man, I forgot how bad the animation in Bleach was.

Music's still great, though.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if they'll conclude the contest in the next episode. The rivals' performances were all given great focus in the manga (especially the girl's iirc) but Kousei's performance even more so (understandably so) and all of them have quite a few flashbacks as well. 
>> ARTICLE
I ***knew*** it. They coudn't have possibly started playing this episode. Half an episode left? No no, let's bump some minutes with tension building. It's enjoyable though.
>> ARTICLE
I really feel/hope that he's going to start hearing the music again in the competition and he's going to go more freeflow like the girl plays, and he won't win but it'll shake everyone up.

If he just does badly in every way, it won't even be interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Depends on how they do it if he does poorly in every aspect. However not doing everything poorly will be better
>> ARTICLE
So Saori Hayami is apparently voicing that female foil, Emi Igawa. After her recent performance on Inou-Battle, I've got to say that I'm quite a bit excited to see if we'll get anything of that caliber again.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like the rivals appear. Of course Kousei never paid any attention to them. I'm sure they've improved drastically over Kousei however.

I doubt Kousei will win. It has been too long, he can't hear the notes. There are too many things riding against him. But I wouldn't be surprised if he wowed the audience with a style that is unlike the human metronome he is well known for.

EDIT: Now that I've actually listened to it, that mashup worked much better than I expected.
>> ARTICLE
What is even better is the description:

> Charles Barkley was a child prodigy at basketball. Anybody with him on their team would automatically win. He was just that good. After his mother, who was also his coach, died, he had a mental breakdown and refused to join a team ever again.
> 
> Two years later, Barkley still hasn't come to terms with his mother's loss. Every time he tries to make a shot, he can no longer see where the basket is. He's resigned himself from ever playing basketball again, and enjoys his life spending time with Russell Wilson and Peyton Manning, as they enjoy their favorite sports.
> 
> That is, until Michael Jordan comes along. Jordan's a free-spirited basketball player, and he sparks Barkley into trying to learn how to play again. He teaches him that basketball isn't just about making the shot: it's about enjoying the thrill of the game.
>> ARTICLE
Another fantastic episode! 
We got to see more of his Mother's abuse and the effect it is still having on poor Kousei; poor poor Chelsea.

Can't wait for next week with the competition finally starting!
>> ARTICLE
Is it Chelsea that he talks to?

>> ARTICLE
I guess this has to wait. Just finished with revision (it's freaking 0341), shall watch this on the way to school in a few hours time.

*sighs*

But I'm pretty hyped from looking at the comments. But I must sleep(or at least take a 1-2 hour nap)

Edit:since I can't sleep, i watched it. 0522 now. Good buildup episode. Can't wait for next week. It's gonna be epic.
>> ARTICLE
I am consistently amazed and pleasantly surprised at how deep this anime is. I was definitely not expecting as much internal character development as we have gotten so far. But I love this! I am really enjoying the balance between the music and character dynamics/relationships. I think this has the potential to be a really well presented coming-of-age story. 
>> ARTICLE
Just starting the episode but wanted to say, the OP to this anime is so great. I really like that they don't JUST use a female voice and actually have a male voice (or masculine? not sure who the artist(s) are)

Flows so nicely, anyway just wanted to have my moment of appreciation... back to the episode I go!

Other than that, great episode as always.

I have a theory that by the end or when Kousei finds inner peace, that cat's eyes will turn from green to blue, just like the cat in the OP. I feel like it being green means he's still hasn't found that yet.
>> ARTICLE
Every week man...  Look forward to this show every week.  That anxiety that they portrayed right before the advent of the competition; gawd I love that shit.  
>> ARTICLE
Damn, the OST of this show is amazing. Any info if they are going to release an album with the actual soundtrack (not the classical one)?
>> ARTICLE
only anime that gets me twisted about shipping, i dont know if kousei/tsubaki or kousei/kaori is better, i mean i like tsubaki and her reasoning for loving him is just natural but when kaori talks to him im always just mindblown , she really has a way with words, but not sometimes, always, she always says the words that really hit
>> ARTICLE
Damn cliffhangers, lol.  Now the 7 day wait commences again.  This show is never disappointing in the slightest, it ALWAYS has my full attention and I'm super bummed when the episode is over.  I don't think our MC is going to win, in fact I think it would be ideal progression to have this competition be a loss.  It would be way too big of a jump and out-of-nowhere for him to win, he still has some growing to do.  I would like to see him do well enough to show his growth but it shouldn't be a win.  I would love to see his rivals see from his point of view though, I think if they saw how tough he had it and how his rough home life took away the love he had for piano they would try to be friendly to him; as well he would try to talk to them.  At least there's a guarantee of competition awesome-ness next episode!
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoy this show a lot, but the dialogue is terrible. If they just spoke normally I'd be able to enjoy it so much more.  

But next episode is going to be great. Hopefully no drama and just music.
>> ARTICLE
Truth. Literally every character launches off into a monologue given half a second of focus.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how many times this has been said, but I'm really happy that A-1 is doing a pretty faithful adaptation. The only thing I'm worried about is the source material. [Manga](/s "We're quickly catching up with the manga and I'm not sure if it's going to have an alternate ending despite being 2-cour. As of right now we're at chatper 12/25 in the manga. I heard that the manga should be ending around the same time of the anime, so hopefully they won't overlap.")

[Episode 8](/s "Takeshi's and Emi's performance next episode. HYPEEEE!")
>> ARTICLE
I heard somewhere that the manga and anime would finish at the same point in time, so the entire manga will be adapted, but we'll all be going into the ending blind.
>> ARTICLE
It's not really caught up to the manga, though. I'm pretty sure the manga is at over 40 chapters released in Japan now, the scanlators are just being super slow with the series here. Horrible Subs lit a fire under Easy Going Scans' butts by releasing a few chapters themselves (before that, the series was getting a chapter scanlated every couple months or so, even though readers REALLY wanted the series translated), so hopefully it will continue to pick up.

That being said, I'm really excited for this next episode, there's a LOT of character development awaiting for everyone.

>> ARTICLE
Yes. In Chinese.
>> ARTICLE

It's at Chapter 42. The manga will end on chapter 44. Assuming your chapter count for today's episode is correct (I am too lazy to go back and check for myself), we are at 27.27%(12/42) in terms of manga, and we are at 29.2 % assuming there's 24 episodes (7/24). While this probably means there's no particular emphasis on any part more so than the manga, it also means it's on pace to finish exactly where it's suppose to finish.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, next episode will be intense!
>> ARTICLE
I am loving the two new antagonists. They feel so human and relatable, to the point where even though they're in the way of Arima-kun, I can't help but feel bad for them and in a way, root for them. Great episode, can't wait for the next.

Every one of them failed/gonna fail in their competition. Author confirmed sadist

Hopefully we get to see the rivals and Kousei perform in the next episode!  I'm really excited to see everyone play! 
>> ARTICLE
While there are some portions that a semi-noticeable dip in quality is present, the art style for this show is just amazing. Whoever is doing the landscapes, city design, and tone deserves a freaking medal.

At first I thought the cut glasses would annoy me, but that animation, or more precisely lack thereof, is absolutely essential. The eyes convey so much in this show.

I am so glad this is a 2 cour show. Thanksgiving is gonna be awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, can anyone convince me to watch this show? I'm hearing a lot about it but I generally don't know if i'll be able to handle it because I heard it's a bit on the emotional side (looking at what you did to me, Clannad). 
>> ARTICLE
Music's good, lots of overdramatic monologues, somewhat weak supporting characters (in my opinion)... But the music alone makes it worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, It's not like Clannad, at least so far. It's much more upbeat and the drama is much less heart-wrenching. The show is amazing though, the OST is fantastic and the characters are all well-done. The only caveat as people will complain is that the dialogue and the characters soliloquies can get ridiculously long, wordy and super serious and since these characters are in Middle School, it makes people unhappy. 

Doesn't bother me though. But I think the show is AOTS. :)

## Episode 18 List of Classical Performances:

This weeks main performance is courtesy of Kouseis and Nagis performance at the school festival.

---

**Tchaikovsky: La Belle au Bois Dormant (Sleeping Beauty), Op 66 - Rose Adagio and Valse** - "Tchaikovsky wrote the second and longest of his ballets *Sleeping Beauty* (Spyashchaya krasavitsa) for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, where it was premiered at the Mariinsky Theatre in January 1890. Like Tchaikovskys other two ballets, *Swan Lake* (1876) and *The Nutcracker* (1892), *Sleeping Beauty* was not an immediate success; but it caught on more quickly than the other two, and in short order came to be considered among the greatest nineteenth-century ballets.  Although its length (4 hours with intermissions) has prevented it from being mounted as frequently as Tchaikovskys other ballets, much of its music is among the composers best known and loved.

The *Sleeping Beauty* ballet enacts the ancient fairy tale as re-told by the brothers Grimm in 1812 and adapted for the stage by the intendant of the Russian Imperial Theatres, Ivan Vsevolozhsky (1835-1909), who also designed the costumes for the ballets wildly extravagant original production. Many Great Russian artists, including choreographer George Balanchine (1904-83), prima ballerina Anna Pavlova (1881-1931), and composer Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971), claim that a childhood encounter with *Sleeping Beauty* was decisive in determining their artistic path.

In Vsevolozhskys version, Princess Aurora is cursed on the day of her christening by the evil fairy Carabosse, who instead of bestowing a blessing casts a pall on the proceedings with the declaration that Aurora will prick her finger on a spindle and die on her sixteenth birthday. The powerful and good Lilac Fairy cannot completely undo Carabosses curse, but modifies it such that Aurora will not die, but merely fall asleep to be awakened after 100 years by the kiss of a handsome prince. The first and second acts depict the story proper, while the third act, sometimes performed separately, shows Auroras elaborate wedding, which, like the second act of *The Nutcracker*, is an excuse for a great number of *divertissements*, that is, dances meant to entertain rather than further the plot. Again, as in the *Nutcracker*, many of these are character dances, here whimsically involving characters from other fairy talesincluding Puss in Boots, Tom Thumb, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Beauty and the Beast.

Movement 1 of the Suite (Introduction) opens with a brilliant and noisy *Allegro vivace* depicting the evil fairy Carabosse. This music comes to an abrupt halt, and a much gentler *Andantino* ensues in which the harp, often a signal of passing into a different world, introduces a melody in the English horn associated with the Lilac Fairy. This music builds to a powerful climax and then gradually recedes, ending with quiet tremolos in the high strings and whispered chords in the harp.

Movement 2, a dramatic pantomime, features one of Tchaikovskys most Romantic melodic outpourings, music that accompanies each of four suitors dancing with Princess Aurora in a *pas de cinq* called The Rose Adagio. The harp again plays an introductory and transitory role with an impressive solo that leads to the first statement of the melody in the violins.

Movement 3, a character dance depicting Puss in Boots and the White Cat is a humorous divertissement from act 3 of the ballet in which Tchaikovsky uses the oboe and bassoons in a particularly feline manner. The gliding music of Movement 4 (Panorama) is taken from act 2 where it accompanies the magical boat ride of Prince Charming (Prince Dsir) to the palace covered with overgrown vines in which Princess Aurora sleeps. The suite ends with the ballets best-known number, the grand waltz at Auroras 16th birthday party from act 1." [(Source)](http://www.pvsoc.org/concerts-events/program-notes/)

Here's an interpretation of the [Rose Adagio by the Robson Piano Duo](http://youtu.be/nP2FrwHDy8Y) and an interpretation of the [Valse by the Aurora Duo.](http://youtu.be/FJzYwLKp3ZU) 

---

In this week's episode, it was performance time! I'm very glad that they adhered to how things were done in the manga by having Kousei and Nagi perform **both** of Rachmaninoff's four-hand arrangements for the Rose Adagio and the Valse from Tchaikovsky's *Sleeping Beauty*.  I also liked how they remained faithful to the manga in steadily increasing the tempo of the Valse as they neared the end of their performance.  The consequences of the performance were also good.  Kousei knocked some sense back into Kaori, while also kicking Takeshi into action.  

We also get Kousei's and Kaori's conversation on the roof of the hospital.  After hearing that performance, she doesn't really want to forget what it's like to perform.  Kousei asks to play with her on stage again.  We'll see where things go from here with that, [especially with (**Major Manga Spoiler -- READ AT YOUR OWN RISK**)](/s "Kaori deciding to have surgery in order to have a shot at playing with Kousei on a stage again, and the subsequent consequences that come with her decision.")

At this time, I would recommend that everyone should fasten their seat belts; the feels trip Arakawa-sensei will be taking us on these last four episodes is going to be a loooooooong one.

Also, the piano competition that Takeshi mentioned is going to be in full swing in about 2 episodes, so at least you won't have to wait *too* long for that.  I can't wait to hear [all of the](/s "Chopin") ([and possibly](/s "Bach")), [especially the](/s "Revolutionary tude (Op 10, No. 12), courtesy of Takeshi") [and the](/s "Ballade No. 1 (Op. 23), courtesy of Kousei.")

http://i.imgur.com/BCNqjzc.png
>> ARTICLE
after all this; if she doesn't die I will be pissed. 
>> ARTICLE
That might be something they can lead into. Both ways would be great character development for Kousei. Either she dies, and Kousei learns to look past her death and remember the light hearted emotions that he can then project onto his piano pieces. Or she lives, and Kousei learns that despite being in a situation so close to death (like his mom), hope is much more powerful than despair.
>> ARTICLE
If she doesn't die there's no way I can see it not being massive copout with the amount of death flags we've seen.
>> ARTICLE
That's literally what I've been trying to explain how it could work. The writers lead the audience to believe that Kaori will die. It's inevitable, and the death flags are too obvious. Kaori will fall to the same fate as Kousei's mother etc. It's great because it connects the reader to Kousei's own emotions, as he feels the same emotional despair knowing that Kaori will die just like his mom and that's why he broke down at school. 

But wouldn't it be great if she didn't die? Like, Kaori becomes the contrasting symbol of his mother, and instead of symbolizing death and despair (again), she becomes a symbol of hope. That death isn't always inevitable. 

I could be wrong and they could just kill her off like Kousei's mother but that feels like a copout to me as well. Everyone in the audience will be like "I knew it! She was gonna die the whole time!" because the death flags are so painfully obvious and you'd be stupid not to see it. However, they can turn everything around, they save Kaori by some miracle and the show becomes way more light hearted instead of yet another arc of despair again.

Kousei has already had his fair share of death. His mom died and he already escaped from being at the "bottom of the sea." Recovering from one major death was an amazing feat for Kousei and it drastically inproved his piano ability. Recovering from two? I mean, he's already experienced those emotions so it'd feel a little redundant. The audience will be forced to see him go under the ocean yet again. We've already seen that, for me it'd be better storywise to not kill Kaori.

I feel like this week's episode might be setting up a miracle to save Kaori. Kousei's line at the last scene are important. Instead of falling to the pit of despair yet again, Kousei decides not to "commit double suicide" I don't know if you remember the symbolic literature speak Kaori was saying but Kousei was literally instilling hope into Kaori. It's another (parallel/contrast? Can't remember the literary term) to when Kaori instilled hope into Kousei atop that high school and again through her violin playing. During her monologue, Kaori was basically done. She had accepted her life, believed that she achieved her dream of playing the violin, and was completely ready to die. But Kousei gave her hope, a reason to live again, just like on that high school roof Kousei was given a reason to play piano yet again. And yes, I totally went back to that scene just for this post. Her line "Yet here you are, watering this withered heart again" completely supports my interpretation above. 

I'm just sitting here dreaming, and wrote up a long interpretation of how it's possible that she won't die cause she's become best girl in the show for me and I just want to save myself from the heartache. Sorry for the long post D:

That performance was incredible. Even I shuddered when Arima changed his playstyle. 

Kaori playing air violin in her hospital room, really puts into perspective how little time she has left. Will she and Kousei ever play together again?

It really shows how much of Kaori passed onto Kousei. She's the one in the dark, hes in the light. Kousei prays to the piano greats before his performance like Kaori did. Kousei helps to push Nagi like Kaori helped to push Kousei.

It makes it seem like even when Kaori dies, she lives on in Kousei.

I just want them to play together at least one more time. I don't fucking care if she dies right at the end of it, let me have that, please...

With only four episodes left are you worried at all about pacing issues? I felt the manga was rushed a bit towards the end.  Either way I am excited to see how they pull it off.  
>> ARTICLE
It definitely felt rushed during the last chapters. But maybe the author meant that to happen, I dunno. All I know is that it probably wasn't axed. (If anyone can find out if it was axed, please provide a source!)

And no, I'm not worried about pacing. A-1 has done a wonderful job until now, I doubt they would suddenly screw us over in the end. This isn't Gainax's P&S w/ Garterbelt, y'know?

Gonna go ahead and copy what I said after the manga chapter that went with this episode:

> And now Arima has come full circle, from the one being rescued, to the one rescuing. He's essentially become Nagi's Kaori (though without Nagi falling in love with him).

And to anyone who was told Nagi would be their new favorite character after this episode, I'm pretty sure you understand why after this. It was even more beautiful/amazing having actual music and animation along with this performance, as it's probably one of my favorites (if not my favorite) from the manga.

She is totally crushing on him though :P (at least in my head cannon!) But not in love like with our protag like you said.
>> ARTICLE
She is, but it's more like how she yelled at Miike about him being Arima-sensei, and not just Arima Kousei, sans honorifics; she more just completely respects and looks up to him as a person/senior/teacher, and still has her huge brother complex.

Kousei and Kaori reminding us every episode "Do you think you'll be able to forget?" like if they wanted to say to us: "Do you think that after the end the show you will be able to live a normal life without always remembering all the sad things in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and not cry yourself to death?".

Really, guys, do you think you will be able to forget?
>> ARTICLE
I'll never forget that shigatsu...
>> ARTICLE
I'll never forget how nerve wracking a piano play can be.
>> ARTICLE
This will be like Katawa Shoujo.

You ***don't*** forget it. You don't forget ***any*** of it. It's a scalpel, and it cuts its way into your soul. When all is said and done, a part of you died, but it was replaced by something even greater. It will change you and mold you into a different person. Everything you do in the future will be changed because you watched this. And as you lie there, on your death bed, you'll remember something. You'll see the image of a broken and lost pianist beside a powerful and guiding violinist. You'll be reminded of a piano playing in the spring as cherry blossoms float through the room, with the sound of someone asleep, breathing softly in the background. A final sentence will echo: 'Will you forget...?' and the world will go white and empty. That will be the end of your story.

Now that you've imagined that in your head, *do you think you'll be able to forget?*

Jesus Christ watching the performances in this show gives me knots in my stomach.

And watching Kaori miming playing along with them while in the hospital... my heart can't take it.
>> ARTICLE
Kaori air-violing was fucking amazing. The part with her at the end... I can't even find words for that scene
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I've ever been as anxious watching a show as I am during these performances. They're beautiful and terrifying at the same time.

It's almost like the show is portraying how the characters feel.

...oh god, i was first trombone. had the band solo in a large auditorium for phantom of the opera. i don't know how the hell they can internalize everything and think so much. hell, even when i'm playing music i'm thinking about the song and the tempo and how the stage light is fucking hot. 

but that feeling when you step on stage, they get that right. usually it's a great performance when by the end of when you kinda focus-blank-out look up and the applause comes...god i miss being on stage

Has [Kaori](http://i.imgur.com/yXW8Yvb.jpg) gotten [paler](http://i.imgur.com/S8WHKUq.jpg) or is it just me?

[Nagi](http://i.imgur.com/mccd60S.jpg) has become my [favorite character](http://i.imgur.com/OQl2W7z.jpg) in the show. I said this last week but her [relationship](http://i.imgur.com/iLDG7bg.jpg) with [Kousei](http://i.imgur.com/zaaag02.jpg) has to be one of my [absolute](http://i.imgur.com/OUEqrUE.jpg) favorite things about this show.

I'm feeling nervous though with the closure of the show being 4 episodes away. Not because of Kaori's [](/s "most likely death") but due to the fact that I don't want this ending, whatever it may be, to be rushed.
>> ARTICLE
don't worry, I can assure you they won't rush the ending.
>> ARTICLE
It's mostly that her hair has gone from blonde to gray, I think. Which makes the case of her illness even weirder. What kind of disease instantly turns your hair gray?
>> ARTICLE
You know how when people get sick and they just look like they aren't as vibrant and they are pale and *just look sick*? I think that's this anime's way of showing it.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's just looking too much into it and its something the artists are doing to show how much her illness is affecting her.

Nagi practically purring made that episode for me.

Anyone else notice they changed up the op a bit this episode?

Yup. They definitely changed it this time around. Added a whole new verse and a few more shots of Takeshi, then Tsubaki, Watari and  what's-her-face. 

Not entirely sure if there's some sort of significance to it, or if they just had a little more budget left over. 
>> ARTICLE
So what's-her-face really doesn't have a name?  She seems like the smartest person on the show.

There's a commentary of how normal, talentless people are more emotionally balanced somewhere.

This show is really something special. "Do you think you'll be able to forget?" No. I don't think I will be able to forget that scene on the roof. In a show full of great moments, many of which in this episode, this might be my favorite.  [end of episode spoilers](/s "Such a cruel boy, telling me to dream again.

This way BY FAR my favourite episode of the series, I loved Nagi's whole arc and development in the manga so I was looking forward to this and they did it wonderfully!
Roll on next week :)

I am in total agreement. As far as adaptations go Shigatsu is first class. My weekly dose of feel inducing anime aside from rewatches.

That was an amazing episode. Huge character development for Nagi, Takeshi and Kousei all at the same episode. The performance was animated very well and sounded amazing. Oh, and... no cliffhanger this time. Yay!

This very well have been the best episode of the show so far.

>> ARTICLE
Kaori is at the same lvl as most DBZ villians now. Taking so many eps to die.
>> ARTICLE
Watching this show is emotionally exhausting, and I love it for that.

- Excellent performances by Kousei and Nagi, Kousei threw down the gauntlet and Nagi answered back loud and clear. Like Kousei and his mother during last performance, Nagi sort of symbolically broke away from her brother's shadow this time around

- I let out whispers of GAMBATTE seeing Kaori go through the entire motions of her violin during the performance. I want to see her shine on stage again so bad

- Hmm, I wonder if Takeshi is crying because he was being protective of his imouto or is really just jealous that she's grown close to his idol lol maybe both

- Either way, in Nagi's eyes it seems Takeshi has gotten that spark again that he's been missing ever since Kousei left 

- DON'T DROP THE HONORIFICS, Nagi sure is protective of her former-enemy Kousei-senpai now

- Kousei is slowly becoming the celebrity that he once was. There was Emi and Takeshi but now even that Miike kid holds him in high regard and is jealous that he took Nagi under his wing lol

- Kaori and Kousei's scene is just perfect. The writers make their interactions romantic without being cheesy. I almost shed a tear, you can actually feel the love

- We WILL see another Kaori and Kousei performance before all is said and done. This makes me so happy, but I think I hear the feels train coming...
>> ARTICLE
[Hahaha.](http://i.imgur.com/Imx3KQs.jpg) Well, as a big brother myself I can understand this. 

The shot of Takeshi getting the spring back in his step was really powerful though, I really liked that.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or did the lyrics of the opening changed ?
>> ARTICLE
It did.
>> ARTICLE
And what does it say ?
>> ARTICLE
No idea, I just listened the op frequent enough to notice the difference moments before the chorus.
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't help smiling at the end :-D
>> ARTICLE
Did the intro change this episode? The part with seagulls and blue sky changed into a night sky full of stars.
>> ARTICLE
If the show has been hitting 10's in terms of emotional/character development, this episode was 11/10. It's been tiptoeing on repetitiveness but this was such a nice change of pace and Kousei didn't fuck up Nagi's performance like he did Kaori's. 
>> ARTICLE
Great episode for Kousei, Nagi, and Takeshi. Nagi has developed so much in the little we have seen her. In Nagi's growth, we see how Kousei has changed so much, and in the effect it had on Takeshi, we see how Kousei also moved him with his music, albeit indirectly. Of course, that friend of his laying down truth also deserves some merit. In other words, Takeshi should just look at himself to answer his own question about Kousei's music.

Oh man, it doesn't feel like there are only 4 episodes left. So many things being mentioned, like the competition in December, Kousei wanting to play with Kaori again, and Kousei leaving for a music-oriented high school... all of this, and I can only think about how feel-inducing these next episodes, going by the show up 'til now, will be.

Are they giving us hope?! Last minute hope?!
1/1000000 deathflags toppled?!

That was everything I hoped that it would be. Maybe it is all the Eureka 7 I have been watching but I shed tears multiple times over the course of the episode. Nagi stole the show (as well she should) this episode, I really enjoyed reading her arc in the manga as well and this is like having my cake and eating it too.

Such a great episode, I watched it without subs though.. was quite intriguing, gonna watch it once more with subs and see if I made any major misses.

Still though that performance was amazing! Looking forward to the next concur now, if they'll have that in the series, at the very least I hope the performance of Kaori and Kousei is gonna be interesting.

[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Nope.  She's trying, but the author's trying to stir up more feels by having her fight for life (before she dies).

There's also a subplot that's growing with Arima and his new student.  So, the show's drifted slightly away from being 110% about deathflag-chan accruing more flags.

Each episode i watch i love this show more and more.

The little kids in this show are awesome, the best comic relief they could think of imo

What was the name of the song they performed in this episode? Man I really need to pay more attention.
>> ARTICLE
it's the sleeping beauty waltz by tchaikovsky
>> ARTICLE
I begin to see where everything is going and that makes me fear for the ending. [I will keep my speculations is spolier](/s "I fear this going into a tearjerker ending, and I will hate it for it. I will be happy with a happy ending or a tragic 'sudden death' ending, but not tearjerker. It seems that Kaori is losing energy the happier and more confident Kousei becomes so if he does win some competition or duel in the end I can see Kaori dies right after. This is 100% my own speculation as somebody that can read it in the show itself, but if this really happens, I will be disappointed only from a tearjerker ending. Tearjerker is emotional for the characters in the show, sudden tragic is emotional for the viewer. I will prefer the latter if we will not have a happy ending.")
>> ARTICLE
This episode felt way to short, it was over before I even knew it. So so good.

Was this the first time that they've played through a whole song without messing up once? I really love how powerful this show is, seeing the audience and all the character sit around in awe is amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
There was so many emotions during the first half, that i was expecting the episode to end when the halfway point marker came up. I would've even been happy with that. To me it felt like two episodes in one!

I'm actually starting to root for the super sayan guy, who i can't for the life of me remember the name of! I'm so torn on whether to root for him or for Kousei to win.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm going to burst out crying if Kousei and Kaori play together one last time.
>> ARTICLE
I love how Kousei just can't concentrate anymore when he still hearst he sound he is playing.  
Man is that ending giving us hope that Kaori might not die?!?!
>> ARTICLE
How she will play with him if she can't use her fingers .... Damn it Kousei 

Fantastic performance and episode. 
>> ARTICLE
so.. next episode is "Goodbye Hero"
I guess little kid is getting sick too or something?
>> ARTICLE
I think kousei already unerstood what will happen to kaori , and try to fight it as best as he can.
In this episode we get to see arima getting away from kaori's shoulders. 
As much as i dislike , i think this anime will end really badly ....
>> ARTICLE
I felt like I was experiencing their nervousness when the episode started. My heart just started beating and my eyes were glued to the screen the entire time during the performance. A really great episode.

>> ARTICLE
I lol'd at Takeshi freaking out over Kousei giving Nagi 'Experiences'. That bit was great.  

But one thing I love about this show is that it isn't just the sad parts that make me go teary-eyed. The duet scene was so beautiful and I'm sure many of you shared the barrage of feels I felt.  

Just A++ anime right here. This show is amazing. I can already tell I'll be giving this a 10 on MAL. 
>> ARTICLE
I might have been imagining it, and it may just be being extremely hopeful, but I swear to god that Kaori's hair looked slightly brighter in that last scene.
>> ARTICLE
What is the song used when there are those touching moments of giving another chance and hope

from 19:12 - onwards :)
>> ARTICLE
Watched this episode with my mom, she said it was weird and crazy (granted that was right after Nagi's conversation with Detective Conan)
>> ARTICLE
This was one of my favorite episodes of any anime in recent history. The performance episodes of SwKnU have all been pretty spectacular, and in that regard this one was no less. The melodious music with interspersed thoughts and comments from the players and listeners is a great way of presenting the emotion behind the piece.

But what made this episode stand out more than usual was the *character growth* on display here, in multiple facets. Nagi's growth as she comes into her own as a pianist, both in terms of ability and reasoning to continue. Takeshi's growth, as he gets a spring back in his step when he realizes he should have been the one to be helping his sister, thus once again falling behind Arima. 

And then of course, Arima's growth. He's finally coming to the point where he's not just being spurred on someone, whether that was his mother or Kaori. His experience in training Nagi and watching her grow and succeed gave him the insight that he needed to forge ahead on his own, for himself. And given Kaori's situation and her depression, it allowed him to flip the tables on her and challenge her to overcome her obstacles because of him. Instead of being the one helped and led he's now trying to do the leading, and I'm ecstatic to see that growth given how we witnessed it come about.

This show doesn't always hit the most entertaining or interesting notes from week to week, but it certainly has some of the most powerful episodes when it does fire on all cylinders.
>> ARTICLE
[Major/Minor spoiler depending on how dense like Kousei you are](/s "Damn it, I know it's going to happen, a lot of people know it's going to happen, just get it over it and slam me with the feels train already so I can suffer Post-After Story depression like you wanted.")

What another amazing episode. When Kousei got serious and hit that note it startled me lol. Takeshi's reaction was the perfect. Best thing about this ep is it ended on a really happy note.

No one really noticed Takeshi this episode. I think inside he was really happy for his sister but couldn't find the way to express it. We can also see how he has more motivation to go against Arima.

Yupp. That's what I thought of. Although, wouldn't be a terrible twist if Kousei gets hit by a truck and it's Kaori performing alone before they both die in the same hospital?

Wouldn't it be *even worse* if Tsubaki gets eaten by a shark and Watari gets struck by lightning? Man I hope that doesn't happen, it'd be such a bummer.

>> ARTICLE
I read Berserk so that's for granted.
>> ARTICLE
;__; Seriously though, I hope we do find out what the "lie in April" specifically was by the time this is all over, maybe with an epic title drop leading into the final credits. 

Popular theory is that Kaori using Tsubaki to get with Watari was the lie, and that her goal from the beginning was to bring Kousei out of his shell and back to playing the piano again. It's already been determined that she knew of him and his accomplishments prior to their meeting, and she's admitted that her parents were big fans. Plus it was just set up perfectly, with the "double-date" being to watch her perform onstage. If she had perhaps been more direct with her motives from the beginning, Kousei would have been even more hesitant.
>> ARTICLE
You will find out, it's pretty twisted.
>> ARTICLE
I read the raw version and trust me you'll find out and it is pretty gut-wrenching, so many ninjas with onions came to my house that night, I seriously can't stop thinking about the ending.

Can you pm me what happens?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah sorry for late reply I hate work will  PM you what happens 
>> ARTICLE
Are you sure you want to know? It's a pretty big spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
Based off this episode it seems like the lie was the promise that they would perform together again
>> ARTICLE
The lie itself was revealed in the final chapter of the manga, so you'll find out what it is in the last episode.  Just keep an eye out for those pesky onion ninjas, though.
>> ARTICLE
holy fuck, thats worst than a spoiler, now i want to know and i dont want to know
>> ARTICLE
In the first episode when Tsubaki is talking to Kaori on the phone, it is shown that Kaori asked for Kousei to come aswell. And those times where Kousei is a "Substitute" it is obvious this is who she wanted to meet all along.
>> ARTICLE
I actually think that her dream was to play on stage with Arima Kousei. The way her parents were portrayed there's also the possibility they only heard about Arima through their daughter. Her speech about she being unseemly and also she "abandoning" her dreams reinforce this idea, as she just realized her dream before getting worse. She wasn't giving up but she thought she was satisfied with that.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, based on how she's acted thus far, I'm pretty certain her actually wanting to get with Watari was a lie as well.

[Here's a playlist of the classical performances we've heard so far in the show. (Updated weekly!)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjsPM2a4m_9befrVeAoZgHBUZ1bNbw_D9)

## Episode 19 List of Classical Performances:

We got a couple new pieces this episode, courtesy of preparations for the finals of the Eastern Japan Piano Competition.

---

**Bach: Prelude and Fugue No 14 in F# Minor, BMV 883 (*Well-Tempered Clavier*, Book II)** -- "A feeling of sad tenderness pervades the beautiful Prelude No. 14 in F-sharp minor, beginning with the opening two notes of the melody. Bach makes that falling fourth the most expressive feature of the piece, especially noticeable in bar 34 where the Neapolitan sixth (the first inversion of the major triad built on the flattened second degree of the scale  in this case G Major) is used to magical effect. The long, singing phrases are similar to those in Variation 13 of the Goldberg, and should be free within a steady pulse. The Fugue is the only real triple fugue (one with three subjects) in the whole Well-Tempered Clavier. Perhaps for this reason it is often compared to the monumental C-sharp minor Fugue of Book I (some analysts also consider it a triple fugue  others a fugue with two very important countersubjects). In my opinion the similarities end there. True, the third subject here is similar to the first countersubject of the C-sharp minor, but the mood is completely different. The fugue subject itself is well-suited to a lively articulation, as is the second subject introduced in bar 20 (although the whole piece is often played with no articulation whatsoever). The big danger is to speed up when the third subject slithers in at bar 36. It adds momentum and propels us to the final unison F-sharp, but should not hurry. Beginning in bar 55, Bach combines the three subjects in three different permutations." [(Source)](http://s30329.gridserver.com/recital/0708/documents/hewitt_program-toweb.pdf)

For those of you who know music theory, here's a link to an [in-depth analysis of this prelude and fugue.](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~siglind/wtc-ii-14.htm)

Here's an interpretation of this work by [Sviatoslav Richter.](http://youtu.be/HZMDhZRf9FA)

---

**Chopin: tude in C Minor ("Revolutionary"), Op. 10, No. 12** -- "The Revolutionary Etude holds its place as one of the most eminent and well recognized of all of Chopins compositions. Beginning with the first dramatic chord all the way to the impassioned conclusion, this piece is an outpouring of emotion. It is immediately apparent that most of the technical difficulty is in the left hand, with rapid runs and frequent turns. However, this difficulty is perhaps easier to resolve than those in many other etudes, as finding a comfortable fingering wins half the battle with this piece. (If, by any chance, one wishes to seek a greater challenge with this etude, perhaps one could do what Alexander Dreyschock did  learn to play the left hand in octaves, without losing any tempo!) Other difficulties include polyrhythms and cross-rhythms that are used more and more to convey a sense of conflict and struggle towards the end of the piece. After the problem of knowing the notes is resolved, one must inevitably move on to the problem of interpretation, which is always important  but especially so in such a famous piece. At a young age, Chopins first music teacher taught him to respect the works of the old artists  namely, Bach, Mozart, and Haydn, among others. Chopin had a particular distaste for most of Beethovens work, yet it is impossible to imagine that he was not familiar with it. Many of Beethovens stormiest compositions, such as his Pathtique sonata, are written in C minor. Surely Chopin knew that C minor was the stormiest key of them all in Beethoven, and  perhaps unconsciously  he expressed this in the Revolutionary Etude. The piece reportedly emerged after Chopin heard of Polands failure in its rebellion against Russia. Chopin was unable to participate due to his poor health, and when he heard that the rebellion failed, he cried, All this has caused me so much pain. Who could have foreseen it! During this time period, he produced some of his darkest and most passionate works, such as the Scherzo No. 2 and this etude.

In the beginning, after a strong chord rings out, the left hand runs relentlessly and the melody is further developed in the right hand. Given the context of the piece, one could liken the opening chord to a gunshot. The ensuing tumultuous left hand and impassioned right hand could then be interpreted as a hero fighting a battle in a war. After a hard struggle, the piece ends quite as chaotically and dramatically as it began, yet in C major, leaving us with a sense of ambiguity  we are not sure if our hero prevailed or perished, but we do know that he fought bravely with both body and spirit."

Here's an interpretation of this study by [Maurizio Pollini.](http://youtu.be/w2vLEQno9Ks)

---

This week, we see Kaori facing her illness head on and decides to have surgery to improve her chances of getting better, even though the surgery itself could be risky.  It was good to see her parents again, but at the same time, it was bittersweet seeing them thanking Kousei for giving Kaori hope after she had given up.  It was also fun seeing the childhood ~~friends~~ rivals interacting (and consuming egg sandwiches) during the qualifiers for the final round at the Eastern Japan Piano Competition.  Takeshi's performance of Chopin's Revolutionary tude was fantastic, and all I'll say is that it will set the *tone* ~~(haha...I love unintentional play on words)~~ quality wise for the rest of the competition.  I can't wait to see what Emi plays (since it's not specifically mentioned in the manga what piece she plays), but the true (twinkling) star will be Kousei and [his performance of](/s "Chopin's Ballade No. 1.")  

If you don't have your seat belts fastened on the feels bus...well...fasten them now.  These last three episodes will take you for the feels ride of your life. Things are going to take an interesting turn next week (based off of the preview), [especially when **(Major Manga Spoiler: READ AT YOUR OWN RISK)**](/s "Tsubaki, in essence, "confesses" to Kousei")......?!?!?!?!?!?! [**(Major Spoiler: Again, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK)**](/s "DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE CHILDHOOD FRIEND HAS A CHANCE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!")

What didn't you look like a 5 year old til you were fifteen and then suddenly become an almost adult?
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I remember that in highschool that people just a year or two younger than myself would look like children in comparison. Though I went to highschool in Australia so the age range was 12 to 18, but I remember thinking this as early as year 9 in comparison to the year 7's.

I was just 14 myself and felt like those aged 12 were like small children. It felt like a similar gap to when I was 12 years old in primary school compared to the 6 year old year 1's.

You do age a lot in those years.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I suppose thats true, but when I think back I don't really remember the kids around me or myself as ever looking smaller, just the ones actually younger than me. I like to think that the artistic direction that they chose is one that shows how small little kids can seem looking back on them, but it honestly makes it feel like there was an entire decade or so where Kousei wasn't playing piano, not two years. It blew my mind once I realized the timeline of the show, especially because they made it seem (IMO) like he'd spend his whole life unable to play after being cursed by his mothers death, not just like, a few semesters in school.

Pretty sure Crunchyroll had a translation error.  This was the translation from the manga chapter:  
http://i.imgur.com/BV0DdIP.jpg

CR had those lines translated like Kaori was talking about herself (ex. "I cried and puked").
>> ARTICLE
God, Kaori looks even worse in the manga. I don't think I could handle reading that. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
I didn't watch the show with subtitles but I went and had a look with them turned on and yeah, that manga page is translated more correct. However, I can understand the translator since if he were just translating line-by-line as we usually do, it would have been easy to miss since (due to the way the Japanese language works) she doesn't specifically refer to Arima there, and just implies that -someone- cried and vomited (until a couple of lines later when it becomes clearer). Also, sometimes when I'm translating, I usually just listen to the audio only and turn off the video display. Even when I do have the video display turned on, most of the time I'll only use the audio track anyway, so it didn't help that her speech was ambiguous.

Of course, if he were to then go back and listen to that whole scene again, it may be clearer that she was referring to Arima, but if it made sense at the time, I don't blame them for not going back to it. After all, the translation checker should have picked that one up. If their editor hadn't read the manga, they wouldn't have picked up that mistake either unless they knew Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was really good, how the three of them are tightly knitted together even now after the two year break and watching Takeshi growing as a person was really nice to see.
[Also Emi is fucking cute as a kid](http://i.imgur.com/Dwa8oih.png)
>> ARTICLE
Seriously what a beautiful ending to an episode. I love that even the side characters have real depth in this show. 
>> ARTICLE
It really is rare in a series to give growth and depth to the side characters, to not just have the rival be "I'll squash you in the finals!". 
>> ARTICLE
When Kaori's mom teared up I couldn't hold it in anymore either. :*(
>> ARTICLE
I broke slightly before that.  This show isn't fair ;-;
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who thinks that there is no way she will die? it's like.... they just can't do this to us man, after reading Fuuka I don't know if I can handle seeing another cheerful fighter go away.... and I'm a Berserk widow too, but this is too much.
>> ARTICLE
I love this show, but the amount of tears that I have been produced could fill an Olympic sized pool. It is especially hard when they have these glimmers of hope, but this overarching sense of dread that is expertly crafted is just lingering after every scene. [Simply put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg3NrdLVDVc)....

*edited for grammar*
>> ARTICLE
> Struggle like there's no tomorrow

That's an ironic phrasing of the translation. 

Also, what's up with the "surgery" and the "disease." Give us some detail on that for once please :P

EDIT: All hail the almighty egg sandwich!
>> ARTICLE
They don't need logic. Cute girl is dying so it's sad.
>> ARTICLE
She's being killed by ambiguity and vagueness.  
it's a slow acting disease which slowly removes vital information from her life until eventually she has no name or facial features.  
the first sign is dying from 'something'.

Others die of the "off-screen syndrome," like the parents of most Shounen shows.

TV TROPES WARNING

Damn, it clicked on it an hour go. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, it was Takeshi's performance and his slightly reluctant, slightly relieved parting from his long-time hero that really hit me hardest. 

Compared to most of the other characters, Takeshi's probably been one of the least sympathetic, but he's still worked hard for a really long time and I, for one, am glad to see him growing up and moving forward.

Yes, but since I value my sanity I've given her up as a bad case.

As OVA, kaori suddenly comes back to life and starts playing undead violin. She wrecks all competition, steals Kousei from everyone and ends dead again since zombies dont exist.
>> ARTICLE
10/10 would buy zombie kaori merchandise.
>> ARTICLE
I feel bad for poor Tsubaki. She has to compete against both ~~the walking death flag~~ Kaori as well as music. I sort of want the show to throw her a bone and let the childhood friend win for once. 
>> ARTICLE
I can almost imagine Kaori being like, "You can have him after I'm done."
>> ARTICLE
if she actually said that she would move to the top of my favorite female characters list. 
>> ARTICLE
Just saying she had her chance to make her move. Not to mention her best friend trying to force the issue over and over again. 

Not to mention she wasn't exactly single either. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a basic law of anime. Childhood friends never win.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you can call her a walking death flag if she can't walk.

Good point! 
Correction: rolling death flag.

Seriously, though, I have no idea who I should be rooting for. Every character is so good and so developed that I want them all to be happy in the end. :(

[You should be rooting for best girl](http://i.imgur.com/g90CgGy.png)

Personally, I just avoid thinking about it. I'm sort of a simple person who normally just enjoys the (obviously intended) main character romance but in this case it's reeeeeaaalllly hard. Can I just root for everybody instead? :P

HAREM ENDING INCOMING

Nah, Emi FTW
>> ARTICLE
Or Nagi! I mean, they're only one year apart...
>> ARTICLE
Emi is love, Emi is life.
>> ARTICLE
Best bro Kashiwagi dropping knowledge every episode on Tsubaki.


>> ARTICLE
This show is actually a manual on how to be an awesome bro.  Kashiwagi and Watari representin'
>> ARTICLE
Seriously though, I wish we could learn more about these two. Side story of Watari and Kashiwagi shenanigans! 
>> ARTICLE
They're probably my favorite characters in the show. Maybe in an OVA?
>> ARTICLE
I think they've been secretly conspiring.
>> ARTICLE
I like the idea that they've been going-out this entire time and we've never seen it, because lately the only view we get of either is through Tsubaki, and she's never not fixated on Arima -- she doesn't even know. That'd be a fun reveal.
>> ARTICLE
Now I really want an [egg salad sandwich](http://i.imgur.com/OPBpAzv.gifv) :D

I really like the competition scenes I can't wait for the next time Kousei goes up on stage.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the gif. :)
>> ARTICLE
So the surgery only gives her some more time to live if I understood correctly. Are we now 100% sure that she is going to die in the near future? With only 3 episodes left it is possible to see her play one last time with kousei before she dies if the finals are as short as this concert. Hope they both can play one last time together before she dies since their last concert had some problems and I just wanna see a flawless perfomance from them before she dies.
>> ARTICLE
As I understand it, you are correct. This will give her enough time and strength to finish her goals, and in the process reduce all of us to tears, I'm sure.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, if she dies after exiting the stage on her last performance, I'll break down.
>> ARTICLE
Folks would drown in their own tears
>> ARTICLE
If we get a sad ending I'll be heartbroken, that's an absolute fact. If we get happy ending might we feel... cheated? What a terrible conflict. It's hard to believe that there's only 3 episodes remaining, there's still so much I want to see.

Every time "one more time" was said in this episode my heart broke. Then Kaori comes out with the "even if it buys me a little more time"... is everyone accepting her fate or something? ;__;

Kaori's parents really appreciate Kousei for everything he's done for their daughter. I'm sure they think he would make a wonderful son-in-law... ;__;

I JUST WANT TO SEE KAORI AND KOUSEI PERFORM ONSTAGE AGAIN, so please, don't let this be a lie! Regardless, Kaori is a fighter. Speaking from experience, learning to walk again after even just a prolonged period in a hospital bed is serious business. Your legs feel like jelly. Plus whatever disease Kaori has seems to directly affect muscle control.
>> ARTICLE
> If we get a sad ending ... If we get happy ending

I think we will get both. This show is so good, that I think it will have a good ending without "cheating".
>> ARTICLE
At the end of the episode:
Goku: what a gloomy bunch!
Emi: I'm next to Arima-kun!
Kousei: I like Egg sandwiches. And who are these people
it was really cute
>> ARTICLE
I'm really glad that they're taking the time to rap up Takeshi and Emi's character arcs before the end, its very satisfying to see things get resolved like this.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I understand that Nodame is in the same realm as Shigatsu (music anime), but do they share any other connection since we're seeing more references in the later episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Here is my ending prediction:

On the last episode Koari miraculously makes a full recovery. As the gang walks out of the hospital, Tsubaki is hit a bus. On impact, it immediately cuts to the final credit roll with the first OP playing over it. 
>> ARTICLE
Again such a serious moment before the very happy opening :/

As soon as the mom broke down in tears so did I...this anime every time...

Emi! :) Love seeing the interactions between those 3!

Rain episode next? Those are totally never sad... ;.;
>> ARTICLE
Since a few people asked for interpretations of the title "goodbye hero" I want to give mine. I think takeshi saying goodbye to Arima is basically him saying thank you for giving me something to work towards and that he doesn't need his shadow over him anymore. Because takeshi idolized Arima and lost to him which is something that never happened before. Therefore he's saying goodbye my hero I don't need you to be strong anymore. 
>> ARTICLE
I really like the theme they've had, and that they're focusing on now, of heroes and idolizing others. The three lines "Welcome back, my hero," (Nagi) "See ya, my hero," (Takeshi), and "Farewell, my hero," (Next episode's title) left a very strong resonance of that theme that was clear, strong, and had no intention of being subtle, while not feeling like it was harping too much on the theme. Takeshi realizing that Kousei isn't some embodiment of unattainable perfection is a really cool moment for his character, and the scene with Kousei, Emi, and Takeshi eating together really drives home the fact that they have realized they're all the same. Meanwhile, Kaori's dilly on the side is slowly losing my interest, and at this point there are two possible outcomes, each of which I think the writer will flub:

[Option 1](/s "She dies, which is what I expect. While it would certainly be interesting (because of anime's usual complete unwillingness to kill off any major established character), they've played it up enough that they would really need to do something spectacular with her death to make it a valuable part of the characters' development instead of just grasping at tears.")

[Option 2](/s "In a miraculous twist of fate, she lives, Kousei sorts out all his personal problems, and everything is happily ever after because god forbid there's ever anything except a perfectly happy ending in an anime. Do I sound bitter and jaded? It's because I am.")

I look forward to seeing how they progress with Kousei, Emi, and Takeshi's arcs, because the way I see it, they are the characters worth caring about (Takeshi and Emi more than anyone else). At this point, for me, Kaori and Tsubaki have been completely left in the dust, and this show is about those three's development and their individual struggles with themselves and the other two.

Meanwhile, Emi continues in her eternal battle with Nagi for the position of best girl.

Inaho and Kousei are realeted obiviously i mean their deep passionate love for eggs are just undeniable

Next episode's title is "Holding Hands".

Tsubaki...


>> ARTICLE
I may have missed it, don't think I have. Have they even said what's wrong with Kaori yet? Guessing here but if its effecting her legs and surgery is involved it could be a tumor on her spine.  Another possibility is Segmental spinal muscular atrophy which is a form of MND. The surgery could be transferring tendons from her right upper extremity which according to this document I'm reading could improve function for 2 years. That maybe the extra time Kaori was talking about.  
>> ARTICLE
Yet another beautiful episode. Why must it come to an end. Loved seeing the three of them interacting more.
>> ARTICLE
yes trees interacting are always great.
>> ARTICLE
Man I love those 3 hanging out together. Idk why but I loved this part the most. If they made a side show of them hanging out I would watch all of it. I would think it would be amazing!
>> ARTICLE
This show has been absolutely astounding. Seeing it so close to its end is somewhat heartbreaking but bittersweet as well. I love its characters, its story, its poetic touch, the drama, the love, the way it can bring you to tears one moment and plaster a smile on your face the next. It'll be interesting to see how its ending is handled, but regardless, its been one hell of a journey and that's commendable in and of itself. Up to this point, is it a masterpiece? I don't know. At the very least its been undoubtedly amazing if not emotionally impactful and moving.

No real feels this week. That means they're storing them up....

I tried not to cry in this episode.... I failed

That episode was full of such joyful feels.  I love the scenes with the three of 'em together!

I love Chopin (since playing Eternal Sonata) and Takeshi's song in particular. Probably one of my favorite piano pieces.

Great to see Takeshi beasting it, HERO KENZAN!

Did Tsubaki overperform on her exam in order to get into a high school close to Kousei?

Did I miss that part? When was it?
>> ARTICLE
I feel sorry for Tsubaki, truly.
>> ARTICLE
Finally got to see Takeshi play the Etude after reading ahead. Now I'm hyped for Arima's piece.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the moment when Kousei, Emi and Takeshi were eating sandwiches. It was really cute and shows that they can be good friends as well :)
>> ARTICLE
Just wondering, why was Takeshi saying good bye to Kousei as if they were not gonna see each other again. Is Takeshi going somewhere? What was the reason for the goodbyes?
>> ARTICLE
I interpreted it as goodbye to his unrealistic imagination of who Arima is. 

It is also true that at the moment he is trying to surpass his rivals and move on to bigger things.
>> ARTICLE
Two episodes in a row with no Death Flags!!!

I'm curious on how the pacing of this will be since there are only 3 episodes left. It seems like this contest will take at most an episode. I wonder if the last two are going to be about Kaori learning to walk again and play with Kousei.
>> ARTICLE
Why would you even need Death Flags at this point? I think it's pretty clear that she is going to die. Thing is right now if she will be able to keep her promise and perform with Kousei one last time.
>> ARTICLE
She's taking surgery! She's going to reeducation!

They better not give me hope to crush me harder later I swear to God...

Finally an episode that didn't end on a downer.
>> ARTICLE
3 more episodes. I just want to see the ending already. 
>> ARTICLE
That was a beautiful episode

Next episode will be intense!
>> ARTICLE
It began the buildup to the finish, 4 episodes of buildup, holy shit, the ending better use this momentum.
>> ARTICLE
for those wondering what the next episode was titled, it's "hand to hand"
>> ARTICLE
Is the song when Kaori is practicing how to walk in the OST? If so, can someone tell me its name?
>> ARTICLE
For some reason I'm not liking the sound of the surgery.  For some reason I'm just expecting Arima to be performing while she is in surgery and as he finishes his piece she starts to code.  And the last episode is simply dealing with the aftermath.  
>> ARTICLE
I like that kaori is showing feels for kousei, we they were there but she she was expressing them. we're down to the last three

Aight boys. Few more episodes and we're back to Clannad: After Story! Get the tissue box ready!

Way more cheerful, positively nostalgic episode. Still a bit tear jerking, but in more positive way than some of earlier ones.
>> ARTICLE
Kousei should've been with Emi chan!! 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like this episode. Maybe it was just because I don't really understand Takeshi and what all of that meant and was trying to say?
>> ARTICLE
This show is just perfect. I love all the characters and everything about this show. I can't believe it's about to end. I neeeeed a gfycat Tsubaki's OHOHOHO. It was so cute. ;w;
>> ARTICLE
A rather upbeat episode compared to the stuff we've been getting recently. Kaori can walk and play violin again, though it looks like she'll still be dying soon. And it also looks like the musician trio are becoming good friends! That's honestly really cute.

    ...please ;_;

So far no one has mentioned the next episode's title - "Goodbye Hero". Any interpretations? As far as I know the only people portrayed as heroes in the series are Kousei and Takeshi. I don't see how Kousei or Takeshi could "leave" or what "leaving" would actually entail. 
>> ARTICLE
It's titled "Goodbye, Hero" as sort of a moving on theme. All of Takeshi's piano career was driven by his goal to reach and defeat Kousei because he idolized him as a hero. Realizing he was tunnel-visioned and kind of lost his way after watching Kousei perform with his sister, he decided to stop putting Kousei up on a pedestal and forge ahead driven by himself and not his desire to beat Kousei.
>> ARTICLE
Kousei was Takeshi's hero. He played piano chasing after his image of him as that undefeatable, robot-like symbol of perfect play. While he saw him as his rival he was also something far far out of reach, not a person, but a hero. This episode depicted him saying goodbye to the hero of his childhood, their relationship changed. The hero who shares samdwiches with you is not out of reach anymore, he is a human, is a comrade. The changes Kousei underwent forced Takeshi to reevaluate what he sees in him, what his own ambitions are, it made him change as well, it made him grow up into a person who was able to say goodbye to the hero of his childhood and move on.

The symbolism of a robot and hero makes me think of Ping Pong.

Just this one season.

According to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2x9fl0/spoilers_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_episode_19/coyogk9) by /u/Mathemagician2TheMax, it was Chopin's tude in C Minor ("Revolutionary"), Op. 10, No. 12.

>> ARTICLE
arguably the best show of this season and here you are.
>> ARTICLE
I understand why some people would feel this way but to me, it felt the show was trying way too hard at everything. Trying too hard too tug at your heartstrings. Trying too hard at being funny. Trying to hard to be deep when it's anything but. I mean these are fucking 14yos! And then when you really think about it, there's really not much story to tell either. We all knew how this was gonna end right from the moment it started. So yeah, you're entitled to your opinion but so am I. Just wanted to know if she's finally dead or are they still dragging it out for maximum feels in the finale episode? A simple yes or no would have sufficed. 
>> ARTICLE
The story backpaddeled and now there's suddenly a very, very risky surgery with the chance of helping her. And Kousei was the one who gave her back her will to fight and struggle after she had given up all hope. When it was that she gave up struggling at some point I don't know, we were just outright told that she did.
>> ARTICLE
In that case no, she's still alive.
>> ARTICLE
Watch the show and you shall see

If Clannad's taught me anything, it's that best girl lives in a bakery with best mom and best dad every time.

She's even wearing a similar pink outfit...

That last scene where Arima says his mom is gonna watch him today. Oh god the feels are coming back :'(

Couldn't have ended the OVA on a good note. It had to end with tragedy.
>> ARTICLE
[](#manly-tears)
>> ARTICLE
Where are my Emi x Arima shippers? She really tried to put the moves on Kousei during that competition, and her teddy bear reaction faces were great.

I wouldn't call this OVA spectacular or anything like that (in fact it felt really broken up and choppy), but seeing their interactions as younger kids was fun and interesting and made it a worthwhile watch.
>> ARTICLE
Emi and Arima shipper here, late to the party!
>> ARTICLE
Ahoy, welcome aboard the Emiship!

I feel so bad for Emi, she struggled so hard from the very beginning! And the fanbase doesn't seem to notice she hits the best girl notes perfectly :(

>> ARTICLE
OH GOD THE FIRST COUR'S OP AND ED ARE IN THIS AAAAAA

TIME TO GET WHISKED BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THIS ANIME
>> ARTICLE
I was so glad they used the first cour ED or else the feels couldn't have been contained.
>> ARTICLE
My exact reaction!!
>> ARTICLE
So I guess this OVA was supposed to add more depth to the two 'rivals' of Kousei.  Though it kinda just turned into "I wonder if Arima Kousei will notice me?"  I would've preferred something like an epilogue to the ending of the TV series. 
>> ARTICLE
I was hoping for an alternative ending to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck ya, Clannad style.  Need different endings!  I want a Kaori lives and an Emi ending!
>> ARTICLE
>Emi ending! 

didn't know I wanted that
>> ARTICLE
I remember back when it was airing, there was a tweet saying how if it gets a certain amount of retweets, there will be a "miracle," a lot of people, myself included, thought it would be an alternative ending, when the anime ending turned out to be the same as the manga, a lot of people thought the OVA will be the miracle

I am still here waiting for that miracle :(
>> ARTICLE
Some say he is still waiting...
>> ARTICLE
"But it's called a miracle because it doesn't happen." :(
>> ARTICLE
As much as I would have loved it too. It was an appropriate ending.

[Spoiler](/s "Considering that the surgery was only going to extend the inevitable only by a couple years... maybe.")
>> ARTICLE
if its only gonna add a couple of years i think that will only add more salt, Gunpowder, Alcohol and dirt to our wound 
>> ARTICLE
I at least wanted them to play one last time together :(
>> ARTICLE
if your wishing for a alternate ending you should maximize it not only wishing for few more years ..lets say kaori gets well and she ended up living on the same house as kousei and they begin to make a big family haha
>> ARTICLE
Oh I'm fine with the show concluding with Kaori's death but I just wished we had seen one more performance from her before she died.
 
(btw I wasn't the original guy you replied to) 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much my thought. My heart barely handled going through that meat grinder as it was. 
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, I thought Shigatsu's ending was good.  I personally don't think happy endings are always better endings, narrative wise.  Why would you prefer an alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Because I like happy endings.
>> ARTICLE
Now here's a man that knows what he wants.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, can't really argue with that.
>> ARTICLE
I was hoping for a prequel episode, but one that went more into how Kaori fell in love with Kousei a long time ago as she revealed to him at the end of the show. This...was pretty disappointing to be honest.  A lot of stuff we already knew and scenes we'd already seen spread throughout the show.
>> ARTICLE
Watching this made me realize how much I missed this anime. 


It's nice to have a bit more backstory and how Kousei's music affected everyone who heard it. His first performance really did leave a profound impact.
>> ARTICLE
I am just wanting to find out if Emi and Takeshi still think Kousei is "amazing" for being able to play perfectly for so long after they find out he gets beaten.  
And i seems to be next episode where they find out as his mother is coming to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Will there be more? 

... Please be more.
>> ARTICLE
>Manga is finished.  
>Story is complete.

I highly doubt that you'll get anything beside this OVA which was bundled with the last manga volume.
>> ARTICLE
There's another ongoing manga series "Coda" which is also a prequel. #HOPE
>> ARTICLE
will it be animated though?
>> ARTICLE
If it's popular it's more likely to have bundled DVD OVA with certain volumes releases if anything. Doubt they'll make a season just for a prequel.
>> ARTICLE
>Coda

>Prequel

wut
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing the mangaka meant for it to be an afterword even if it was a prequel. Even with music, sometimes the coda could be part of the main theme of the beginning of the song.
>> ARTICLE
> wut

"wut", what?  
Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso: Coda is set on the characters' childhood, thus making it a prequel. Am I mistaking something?
>> ARTICLE
A coda is a final movement -- a closing, as it were -- of a song or symphony. I get that they mean it's a last little addition to the whole story, but it strikes as a bit odd being a prequel.
>> ARTICLE
He's commenting that it's weird to have a prequel called coda because in music a 'coda' is an ending. It literally translates as 'tail'.
>> ARTICLE
> He's commenting that it's weird to have a prequel called coda because in music a 'coda' is an ending. It literally translates as 'tail'.

TIL.  
I apologize for my douchy answer, /u/Cedstick .
>> ARTICLE
Got the feels again...

Personally, I loved it. It gives more depth to Emi and Takeshi and their feelings towards Kousei. lol'd Takeshi sneaking into Tsubaki's house's yard to listen Kousei practicing. Emi trying to choose a piece Kousei would play in the hopes that they'll end up with the same was really endearing.

I liked that the beginning is his first public performance, which inspired Emi to play piano and bewitched Kaori, and the ending is right before the performance before he quit and his mother died.
>> ARTICLE
Just when I managed to keep the feels at bay... They throw that last sentence.
>> ARTICLE
Even though this is 396p, thank you a ton for subbing this Mori.

[And now we know how that picture came to be](http://i.imgur.com/jFoHGzh.png)  
[Yep...](http://i.imgur.com/AjhNwxS.jpg)  
[Ah, being ignored](http://i.imgur.com/AATYUFD.png)  

I personally enjoyed this OVA, wish it had showed more Kaori. It was interesting to see how the rivalry all started.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, I was grinning ear to ear the entire time. Can't believe how much I missed these characters. Even if it wasn't an epilogue or "the miracle" we expected, it was a perfect reminder why I loved this show.
>> ARTICLE
What I found confusing about this show sometimes was how unrealistic the characters represented their ages. I mean of course that's most of the cases in anime, but like when they're young they seem like children in kindergarten, but they're actually 6th graders..like wtf. And then there's a drastic change only after 2 years.
>> ARTICLE
Same with the difference between Arima and Aiza. They're only 1 year apart, yet Nagi looks like a little kid compared to Kousei.
>> ARTICLE
It's a slightly alternate universe where the entirety of puberty happens in the summer between middle school and high school.
>> ARTICLE
The amount of worth I got from the hype going in.. They better throw in like 2 more OVAs to rectify this.
>> ARTICLE
Aaaah, my heart... This episode made me smile so much, but damn, I still haven't recovered from this anime.
>> ARTICLE
Opening with them as kids and revealing how she got the picture then that godly first OP...feels like I'm right back in the same mood when I was watching it

Emi is adorable...and wow just seeing baby Kaori got me teary. I really hope there's more...I wanted a timeskip epilogue ;.; this was still better then nothing though! 

That ED...the memories...maybe it's best if this is the last of the series...
>> ARTICLE
i wonder why they didnt animate any piano scene :( if they are out of budget then they shouldnt be making extras anyway :( slightly disappointed im not getting more piano scene
>> ARTICLE
So were they just teasing us with the miracle? I enjoyed this OVA but it wasn't something that I thought it would be. It was good regardless but not enough Kaori in it. :/
>> ARTICLE
>396p

Damn...
>> ARTICLE
Only RAW available that's not hardsubbed with Chinese :(
>> ARTICLE
I understood that, but naturally Shigetsu is quite the nice looking show so it's a shame :/
>> ARTICLE
Better than nothing.
>> ARTICLE
It was nice to watch a new episode of Shigatsu again, even if it was a prequel. Kind of like meeting an old friend after being apart for so long (2 months lol but man, it was THAT good). Seeing Kaori just made me nostalgically sad though :(
>> ARTICLE
As I watch the opening I felt tears was about to come out. Never thought this anime would leave a huge impact like this to me.
>> ARTICLE
Still wondering what that whole miracle business was about. 
>> ARTICLE
When I heard the opening song after so many weeks... The feels, man just came pouring back into me. 

I was hoping for an epilogue, though... Really want to see how Kaori changed Kousei's entire life
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this was okay. Not great or anything. It was interesting to see more developments from the rivals but I was just bored watching. It was pretty much stuff we already knew from the main show. 
>> ARTICLE
guys are we getting only one OVA ???
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting to see how Emi and Takeshi are essentially the embodiments of the two sides of Kousei in his piano playing and are chasing after the two different sides in their piano playing despite it being the same person. Nice OVA. 
>> ARTICLE
Where is my Rage of Bahamut to make myself happier? For goodness sake, 1st cour Shirobako was also in that season too. God damn it, stupid 1st ED and OP. 

I'm glad this season matches last year's Fall in term of quality though.
>> ARTICLE
Is there no way to watch this in HD? Is the episode supposed to be in 360p?
>> ARTICLE
Was hoping for something after story-ish... But oh well, this was decent at least...
>> ARTICLE
So I tried watching this after the last Fate episode. Was going HNNNNGGGGG since they ended with the VN soundtrack. Now here they start with "Are You Going to Forget" soundtrack and then Kaori's picture.

I had to stop.
>> ARTICLE
Someone please tell me if more Shigatsu will be made!!!!!
(`)(`)(`)
>> ARTICLE
Is it worth watching?
>> ARTICLE
It gives a bit more insight on their past (Arima, Emi and Takeshi) although the most important parts were already told in the TV series. You could watch it if you really liked the characters but otherwise it's not really worth it over most other episodes you're currently wanting to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed this OVA, but I can't be the only one who wanted to watch an epilogue instead.
>> ARTICLE
Emi best girl, why does no one else see it?!

Anyway, an ok OVA, nothing really special here. I could use an epilogue, I really want to know what happens after the story.

And more Emi, for Christ's sake.
>> ARTICLE
So, I dropped this series after the first time we saw the main girl in the hospital, cause I don't really like tearjerkers.

Is that what this show ended up being? If so, I'll probably not watch it, unless someone can convince me it's worthwhile.

EDIT: Downvotes? For a recommendation? lol
>> ARTICLE
Why would you come to an OVA discussion of a show that you stopped watching?

Yes, the show has a very sad ending. I don't cry much when it comes to stuff like t.v. shows or movies. But this had tears coming down my cheeks.

Yes, this show is fucking worth with. Not only is it a well crafted anime that tells a good story. But the music is godly. 
>> ARTICLE
I came here to ask the question I asked. I didn't read any of the other comments, just asked and have read responses.
>> ARTICLE
Well like I said before. This is a nice show that will jerk your tears. If you don't like those shows, then I advise not to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I'm planning on it. Shows where MCs die are not my cup of tea.
>> ARTICLE
The ending is pretty sad, but it's very worth watching to the end.
>> ARTICLE
Does the main girl die? That's pretty much a dealbreaker for me in sad shows, so I don't care if you spoil me on that one.

If she doesn't die, I'll watch it.
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Looks like you're not watching it")
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. Guess so.
>> ARTICLE
Not trying to be an ass, but dude... what's the point of watching more than half a series only to drop it 'cause the story took a sudden turn of events? Even going as far as to ask to be spoiled!  
It's just... so sad :( I mean, how can you actually enjoy any series if you're spoiling yourself to ensure you everything is "going to be fine"?

Answering your question: If you actually cared for the characters, the story, or even the romantic subplot- you **should** watch it to the end. You don't have many chapters left, and the last ones are arguably the better ones! [](/s "Even though Kaori does die, it doesn't happen till the very end, and it's coupled with one of the most emotional and beautiful scenes I've seen in recent anime and one of the most important pieces of backstory needed to set everything in place").
>> ARTICLE
Bro, I dropped it after like 3 or 4 episodes iirc, not "halfway through". And, I dropped it because I wasn't in the mood for a tearjerker (that, and I was only so-so impressed by the show so far).

Are you gonna tell me that I'm not allowed to censor what **I** watch *myself* or something, lol?

Oh, and as for spoilers, spoilers don't affect my enjoyment of a series. I don't typically go out of my way to spoil myself, but I've never once been bothered affer getting accidentally spoiled, nor does it affect my enjoyment of a series.
>> ARTICLE
I am the same about spoilers. But even with all the risen flags on the series, it was all about the ride.  
Shigatsu has proven to be an amazing tale, and for me it's a shame I can't convince you to watch it, even when the anime turned out to be even better than -at least, myself- expected.

You're absolutely right, and I'm sorry for imposing my opinion on you. I just hope that, in the future, whenever you end up having some spare time, you could give the series a second chance. :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, I don't want to do this, I really don't want to do this.

This episode was already pretty sad. By the sound of things, I guess it will only get worse :o

On the bright side, I absolutely loved the ending to this episode with the ED music transition.

I forgot how gorgeous this show looks. Shigatsu is one of my favorite anime ever and I absolutely adore this first episode. It's been over a year now and now's a good time to finally rewatch it, should be tons of fun!
>> ARTICLE
It's really interesting we don't see her face at all during this scene until she starts crying. The visuals are very powerful.

Kaori plays "Hato to shounen"(Laputa soundtrack) here by Joe Hisaishi if anyone is interested.

Holy fuck that's what that was? This is one of my favorite scenes and Laputa is my favorite ghibli movie yet I didn't notice.
>> ARTICLE
I first watched this show last month, after about a year's worth of prodding from my friend. I started at around dinner and before I knew it it was 4 am and I'd finished all 22 episodes. Safe to say KimiUso is one of my top three shows and I look forward to rewatching it with everyone with the gaps between episodes as it was intended to be seen xD

[Hint for first time watchers. Don't read this if you want to come into the show completely spoiler-free!](/s "The titular lie in April is mentioned in this episode. Can you guess what it is?")

Rewatchers, if you haven't yet, please read chapter 5 of the Coda side manga! It brings the entire story around full circle, and answered the question that inspired me to start this rewatch [minor spoiler](/s "why was Kaori crying when she first met Kousei?")

Personal notes:

* It took me until my second viewing to notice that Tsubaki was talking to Kaori on the phone. [tiny not-even-sure-if-spoiler-but-better-safe-than-sorry](/s "You think she was talking about Watari or Kousei?")
* [holy-shit-definitely-all-series-spoiler](/s "oh my god just look at that last scene between Kaori and Kousei it's so obvious that they love each other why did I ever doubt them")
* I found the fact that they animated lips and a little gap in Kousei's glasses when we focus on his eyes a little off-putting at first, but I got used to it. Mostly.
* I absolutely love the original soundtrack to this anime, and the last track especially is one of my favorites. Most of the soundtrack titles are pulled straight from lines in the anime, so I've been trying to translate all of them. I could use a hand though!

OST tracks in this episode (that I caught)

1. Kimi wa Wasurerareru no (Will you forget?)
2. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April)
3. Shikai ga Akai!? (I'm seeing red!?)

I also just finished my first watch through but mine was last week. I'm unsure if I will join in on watching all of the episodes again but I will probably tune into some discussions here and there.

Hey, it happens. Just looking out for everyone.

I just broke into tears reading this

Yeah, I just noticed that too, and this is my 3rd watch.  [tiny spoiler](/s "I'm pretty sure she was talking about Watari though.")

[all series spoiler](/s "I thought it was just the beginning of an adventure for Kousei, since Kaori will change his life from this point on, and I think his line was perfect for that moment.  On his fourteenth spring, he takes off with her.")

I first watched this show about a month ago too, but I watched it 2 days, not one night.  Then I rewatched it with my wife in dubbed, which was not as good.  I'm looking forward to rewatching it this time around in subbed again.

Holy crap, now I gotta read that manga.  I've always wanted to know why!

Also, thanks for clarifying that Miwa stuff, it's not the only time she mentioned it in the Anime, and it has always confused me.

edit: i just read coda chap5, thanks for telling me about it.  [tiny spoiler](/s "I kinda figured that's why she was crying, but it's great to finally know for sure.  i enjoyed reading it and will definitely read the other 4 chapters")
>> ARTICLE
I thought about watchin it dubbed, its no good? What was your wife impression (as a firsttimer getting dub)?
>> ARTICLE
The dub is not as good as the sub. With that said, it is quite nice to pay attention to the visuals and not the bottom of the screen since you notice more things. I personally think the voice acting is better in the dub. I watch other shows in dub so I'm not just hating on dub.
>> ARTICLE
It's OK, just not as good as the sub.  She thought it was good.
>> ARTICLE
Don't listen to anyone saying the dub is bad. It's just the usual sub snobbery. The dub is every bit as good as the sub, and I've watched both multiple times.

Yeah, it'll take an episode or two to adjust to the new voices if you're accustomed to the sub, but a lot of lines that seemed really clunky in the subbed version are tweaked in the dub and flow quite a bit better. Plus you catch so much more of the amazing visuals that you miss out on when your eyes are glued to subtitles at the bottom of the screen.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks K1. Much appreciated.

[re:2nd point](/s "Likely true; Kousei had literally just met Kaori, after all. At the very least, Kaori literally reaching out to Kousei and taking him along was a lot more motivated than this episode let on.")

I never really liked the violent "humor" thing this show has to be honest. It doesn't help Kousei's story of abuse at all.
>> ARTICLE
It's not like Kaori knew about that. Could also be a Tribute to Nodame.
>> ARTICLE
No. It is how the colours and mood surrounding the event, when she does it, is the most disturbing about it. Of course she can do it, but tone the song down at least. This is why I find the manga superior. Its small jabs and such are very short and not presented in the same way. 
>> ARTICLE
I personally never had an issue separating the slapstick violence from the real violence, but I definitely understand how that turned some people off. In fairness [Minor Spoilers](/s "it was less the physical abuse and more the lack of compassion and crushing guilt that left Kousei like he is. Getting beaten hurt him less than wishing death on his mother.")

The first one could be misinterpreted when out of context.

My god, is the soundtrack for this entire anime freaking amazing. I just love the music, so so much. It really adds to the show

>> ARTICLE
Well the day has finally come!

**Some personal background**

To be frank, I rewatch parts of this show almost every month so I'd be lying if I said I'm not prepared see it again. However, even though I've probably seen it like 10 times over I still get that feeling like I did when I first saw it. No, on second thought, I'd say it's even stronger and more intricate now.

I have to admit that I'm a huge sucker for this kind of romance. My other favourite romances are [5cm per Second](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/Byousoku_5_Centimeter), [Garden of Words](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16782/Kotonoha_no_Niwa), [Lost in Translation (2003)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/), [Her (2013)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/), [Nana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/877/Nana), [What Dreams May Come (1998)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889/), [Dirty Dancing (1987)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092890/?ref_=nv_sr_1), [Casablanca (1942)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/) to name but a few. I think you can easily discern my taste from that sample.

I am proud to say that Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has had a substantial positive influence in my life! I hope I'm not hyping the show up too much for first time viewers, but I have difficulty putting down into words how close to my heart this show really is.

Now, I've been grappling with the issue of how to approach this rewatch. I would really love to do a full blown scene-by-scene analysis but that would take a ridiculously long time to write. If anyone is interested in having such a discussion I would love to talk to you through voice chat. For the time being, however, I think I'll have to settle for a few scenes that both first-time viewers and rewatchers can think about. **Before reading my thoughts always form your own opinion first so that we can have a more fun and fruitful discussion.**

But I digress, let's start the journey:

**First scene**

The sakura trees are in full bloom. A blond-haired school girl is walking down the street under a blanket of falling flower petals. The girl is cheerfully eating a delicious looking chocolate canel in her left and she appears to be carrying a pink violin case in her right hand. She sees a blue-eyed kitten with dark fur cleaning itself in a side-alley. The kitten gets spooked by the girl and runs away. The violinist girl starts chasing the kitten around trying to catch it. After a long chase the kitten stops and [the girl manages to calmly approach it and offer it her canel.](http://imgur.com/nzXBxAw)

Question to the first time viewers: what do you make of this scene?
[To the rewatchers:](/s "This scene is basically the whole plot of the show. Throughout the story we are always shown that the blue-eyed cat symbolizes Kousei and his crippling insecurity. I mean it even has his eye-colour. With that in mind, it's interesting to analyze each shot of this scene. The dark backyard is the first place the Kousei-kitten runs to when spooked. Then it slowly calms down and accepts Kaori's presence. In the intimate close-up meeting shot the Kousei-kitten wags its ears when Kaori approaches him, clearly showing his excitement.")

**Scene #2**

11 year old Kousei is flawlessly playing Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. To be able to play such a technically difficult piece takes some musicians decades of experience. Food for thought

**Scene 3**

[After school.](http://imgur.com/lSeer2L) The visual message here isn't even subtle. This scene comes right after two shots with random couples in the school and one of them are even holding hands.

Any other interesting things you guys noticed? Please share your thoughts :)
>> ARTICLE
Wait what? A rewatch? Nope. Nope Nope Nope Nope Nope Nope Nope.

I'll see you guys on the other side but this is still to soon for me!
>> ARTICLE
Same, just finished it in Feburary the second time. I'm not ready for it again.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it as it was released. Still too soon for me. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher here, and I really don't think I can stick to just one episode a day for this. I'm already 5 episodes in after starting yesterday and I just want to keep going.

I probably shouldn't comment on plot too much since I already know more than the first episode alone reveals (not a lot more, but still), but I find the whole premise super interesting. I studied music a lot growing up, and while I was nothing like Kousei, I can definitely relate to some of what they're dealing with. Music competitions can be super intense, even if you don't have much riding on them, and having a mom like his sure wouldn't help.

Also, parents like his are way too common, and this is just an example of how it can go horribly wrong. :( Moms and dads who want to live vicariously through their children, are super obsessed with accomplishing with they're convinced their kids want, and so on. I've seen several other stories that deal with this theme, and so far it's looking like this will be one of the better portrayals out there. [Maybe spoilers for the next few episodes](/s "I love the idea of Kousei hopefully being able to finally have someone else to influence his music rather than the dark shadow of his mom, and Kaori so far seems perfect for him!")

Beyond that, it's got great music and some gorgeous art, and I'm loving some of the visual symbolism and such they're playing with. I'm expecting to keep running through this show because I'm loving it so far, but hopefully I'll be able to rejoin later.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, this is a thing. I forgot this rewatch was happening. Well, The Eccentric Family rewatch ends tomorrow, so I think I'll be able to pick this one up. Looking forward to seeing what all the fuss is about!

edit: Okay, that was a fun first episode. A few things annoyed me, like the blood on MC-kun's face disappearing from one shot to the next or him claiming his eyes don't sparkle because they're dark brown when they are *very clearly blue.* Overall though, it was great and not at all what I was expecting. The art is beautiful, and Kaori is a friggin' cutiepie. The show does a fantastic job of introducing and characterizing four people within a single episode. I can already tell that there's a lot of depth to each of them, and can't wait to start unpacking it.
>> ARTICLE
We're doing a rewatch? 

Im only 4 episodes in, see you guys on the 21st.
>> ARTICLE
Good luck guys.   A great anime with great music.   I really can't think of anything bad in this one.   The opening is also one of my favorite out of all the Anime I've seen.   I'd watch it again,  but already seen it twice in the past few months.  First time watchers are in for a treat though. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe I'm considering doing this to myself again..
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait to read all these comments! Especially later on! 
>> ARTICLE
Good luck to everyone doing the rewatch! I'm excited for these comments later on in the series.
>> ARTICLE
Oh shoot, there's a rewatch?

I've only seen episode 1.  Frick.  Looks like i'll be joining in with you all. #RIPMyOtherShows #RIPMyHeart
>> ARTICLE
So with this re-watch I'm kinda coming at it from an analytical standpoint in terms of writing, and cinematic choices. Safe to say YLA's first episode is extremely well executed.

From the writing, it was paced well start to finish as the episode starts with showing the melancholy of Kosei's current state, and really how "dull" his life is. You'll obviously notice the repetition of the "so and so brings color to my world", but it gets tied in to that comment Tsubaki makes about the "sparkling eyes". Something I noticed that I didn't in my first watch was that Tsubaki's eyes are shining when she watches Kosei's performance as a kid. [Spoiler] (/s "It really ties in to the end where Tsubaki dragged Kosei to come along in the first episode because she wants him to get over his trauma and have the piano in his life again, because ultimately the Kosei that loves music is the Kosei that makes her world bright. This scene helps really build on the love hate relationship with the piano Tsubaki's gonna have later on because ultimately she hates it for taking Kosei away from her but she loves it becuase it gives Kosei purpose and 'color' ") There's also obviously tons of implication from the get go but those aren't really important. I think the biggest credit to this little "motif" for a lack of better words, is at the end of the episode when Kaori's eyes are sparkling when she grabs Kosei's hand. The lighting had obviously changed in the episode when Kosei saw Kaori, hence everything becoming blindingly bright, but it's also a brilliant choice on the part of the director to add in that sparkling of Kaori's eyes and keep the lighting the same for spoilery reasons. I could ramble on about how the last scene how Kaori and Kosei come in the hall together [Spoiler] (/s "They come in together but by the end of the anime Kosei comes out alone symbolism") but I'm just going to leave it at it was a really good tie in to the end.
>> ARTICLE
[re:last point](/s "I didn't notice a shot of Kousei leaving the hall alone in the last episode, but the symbolism is definitely there.")
>> ARTICLE
No it's not in there, yeah I'm talking from a symbolic standpoint.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, cool! This show is on my PTW, so I decided to join in. I'm liking it so far. Although some of the comments here have me a bit worried...
>> ARTICLE
Might break your heart but it's worth it.
>> ARTICLE
What do people think about subs, Horriblesubs or Commie?
>> ARTICLE
THORA hasn't completed it but you can get their eps done so far in their IRC channel
>> ARTICLE
I think they're both fine. Although I used Commie in my original watch because it has OP/ED karaoke, typesetted signs
>> ARTICLE
I'm going with LNS/Tsundere. They're working on the series at a good pace right now - currently at 20 so they'll be done way before we get to the end.
>> ARTICLE
I think either should be fine.  I'm pretty sure I've watched more horriblesubs than commie though, but no complaints on either.
>> ARTICLE
this is one of my favorite anime, so emotional. Any first timers will be pleased. It's been a few months since i watched it, super excited to discuss it with people. My friends never got around to watching it.
>> ARTICLE
I was already in the middle of watching this when I found out about the re-watch. Going to keep going and maybe come back around once I've finished to take part. (Or, if work isn't too busy this week I'll make an earnest attempt to go back and pick up with you guys ahead of time.)

Otherwise, I'll keep an eye on the comments here. Looking forward to a good one, everyone!
>> ARTICLE
Ahh yay! and guhhhhhhh after finishing this show for the first time last night it cripples me knowing I'm literally about to start watching this all over again. Thank you for setting this up! I'll be reading all of these and then hopefully contributing tomorrow when I get my wits about me. 
also, thanks for mentioning the coda, that was a nice little touch of rounding it all together. 
my favorite part of the first episode is probably the first moment they see each other- there's something about that scene that really sets the tone for what's to come and it's hilarious to see how fast their relationship devolves with his improbable picture timing. 
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time watching this show, and from this episode alone I'm already in love with this series. From the visuals to the amazing OST, this was a beautiful first episode. 
>> ARTICLE
So, does Kousei genuinely enjoy playing the piano? Or did he only do it because he was forced to? He was apparently studying the piano earlier in the episode, but why? He said he doesn't want to play the piano anymore because it brings back bad memories.
>> ARTICLE
[very minor spoilers](/s "he hates/fears it as you will find out later, but to an extent its a part of his being and character, something that he can't let go. Piano is such a large part of his life that running away from it is a failed endeavor" )
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! That makes sense. When you devoted so much of your life on something, it's hard to let go of it.
>> ARTICLE
also, he wasn't studying the piano earlier in the episode, he was saying that he's doing it as a part time job, transcribing the songs notes by ear.  try to remember the scene with him and tsubaki in the classroom.
>> ARTICLE
I want to start this but then again I get the impression its gonna be overly sad. I can't handle sadness well. I usually get into a depressive state not being able to stop thinking about the anime for weeks to come.
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie. It left me feeling hollow for a solid week after finishing it, to the point where I had to force myself to eat because my appetite totally disappeared. You get over it though, and it's really an amazingly-crafted story.
>> ARTICLE
HELL NO!!!This anime literally broke my heart into a million pieces.
>> ARTICLE
As a first time watcher, I wouldn't have guessed that this anime would get very sad if it weren't for all the comments and my irl friends. It's so colorful and bright.

The jokes hit their mark for me. Also the faces our main characters were making xD
>> ARTICLE
This show gets me.
>> ARTICLE
I won't be in the discussion until episode 6 since I've rewatched the first five. Hope the first timers are enjoying the beauty of this show!

>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one not latched onto this show? Like I've heard so much about it, but it just doesn't seem to interest me for some reason
>> ARTICLE
I figure that the people who aren't as into would typically just drop the show and not comment.

The first episode establishes a lot of the personality and tone of the story going forward. Aside from the addition of more (melo)drama, I don't think the rest of the show will be a stark departure from what we've already seen, so make of that what you will.

First time watcher here, and luckily i'm able to go into this show completely blind,I literally know nothing about this show apart from this episode. Now I understand where all the hype for this show comes from. now I just have to read through these threads without accidentally scrolling over a spoiler.

Not again man.. ahh shit. I just rewatched it last month but guess I have to do it again.

So who here is watching subbed, and who's watching the dub?

Sigh why am I doing this. So not a good idea... 
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy. I wish I could tewatch it but I dont think I could handle it at all. Had a hard time watching it last month n jumped off a rewatch.

>> ARTICLE
I'm quite busy today so no comments but I'm going to stick to this rewatch like peanut butter does to the top of a dog's mouth!! Especially for those sweet sweet first-timer reactions...

I downloaded the first episode a while back onto a USB, but it was the only one I managed to get before I had to travel somewhere without internet. That led to me watching this first episode quite a few times, and while I do think this first episode is slow and not a stellar first impression (for me at least in my first time), it does a lot of foundation setting in hindsight and I've come to really love reliving the colours, sounds and pacing of it all.
>> ARTICLE
Dem "black,no sparkling eyes" though 
>> ARTICLE
I only just finished watching this the other day and don't know anyone who has seen it so I've been a mess not able to discuss it with anyone for past few days. Honestly don't think I've been this emotionally involved in fiction since like rereading Harry Potter. Anyway I thought that since I've only just seen it I can read this and remember what you all are talking about but it only made me want to watch it again to see all the references and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.
>> ARTICLE
WHYYYYYY NOW NOOOOO I'M BUSY
>> ARTICLE
It's April
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen this series yet. This seems like it's going to be an emotional roller coaster.

It's kind of interesting, the treatment our MC got from his mother, and whatever happened to him that caused him to not being able to play piano anymore are very tragic things that happened to him; but at the end when he was going to refuse the chance to see her play the violin was the part that looks like it hurt the most. It seems to me like he really wanted to see and hear her play, but he wound up choosing not to because he thought him being present for it would cause a problem. 
>> ARTICLE
So this is what we're gonna do? We're gonna be depressed again?

OK.
>> ARTICLE
Darn it, I just watched this a month ago so I don't think I'll do the rewatch just yet. However as a piano player who learned quite a few of these songs over the last couple of years, they gave chills down my spine. Wasn't too emotional though.
>> ARTICLE
Okay first time watcher here, I heard about this anime alot and too many good recommendations about it. Just saw first episode and actually didn't get into it though. But I guess I will give it another try and go along with you guys.

Also it's April now I just realized.

I just finished rewatch ep 3 so i'll join in ep 4.

Just bought a new TV and the BD verison is gorgerous.

I'm showing this to my mom who was a writer and musician. She doesn't really seem to be very focus though >.< 
>> ARTICLE
I can sympathize. I tried to get my mother to watch it, figuring that a more serious drama without too many "anime-isms" might be a nice intro to anime for her and be something we could share for a change. Zero interest. She'd rather sit and watch reruns of British sitcoms from 40 years ago every night.

In the immortal words of Fresh Prince, "Parents just don't understand."
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that's sad... Well for me if my family can't understand what i like i'll just move on, people from different ages like different things, I won't blame them for that. At least there're still people on internet, reddit and facebook that share the same interest with me.

My case isn't that bad. My mother does watch it, she just often leave the screen to do something else and miss out some scenes that kind of make me feel uncomfortable. I'm still trying to get her hooked though.
>> ARTICLE
This whole anime is beautiful. For the first time in many years I was brought to an emotional brink from a show. It started with the first episode and kept me hooked till the last. 
>> ARTICLE
I've already seen it recently so i will still comment.

I love every character design of Your Lie in April, I love how beautiful they look, how beautiful the backgrounds are. It's one of the anime that left me impressed (alongside Nagi No Asukara). I fucking love the opening.

I guess you could sum up what I said by saying that I love everything about Your Lie In April and you would be right.
>> ARTICLE
Oh come on I just finished watching this a couple of weeks ago. Let me recover first. :(
>> ARTICLE
Ahh late to the party but time to relive this story. Heard good things about the dub so gonna give that a shot this time around.
>> ARTICLE
Y u do dis rewatch? Y? U want to die of dehydration, after flooding your house away with all your tears at the end of this? This anime will rip out your heart like that one Indiana Jones movie, wring out your tears like you're an old rag, chop off your limbs, and implode your removed heart. 

And all of that, will happen *after* Kousei and Kaori become your family, part of your very being. It just makes the emotion a million times more real, more sad.

P.S. Regardless of what I've said here, *Shigatsu Kimi no Uso* is great, I love it, 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
I thought watching this finally first time by following this rewatch might be good occasion, but seeing people talking about 'feels' here is kinda spoilerlish already so I might better not to reading any discussions and only post impressions. Or I hope someone will create DMZ comment tree like some recent rewatchs. 

Anyway the first episode, I already loved dynamics between Tsubaki and Kosei. When Watari after school is there Tsubaki and Kosei don't walk side by side. But after Watari left, the two walk like they are really close friend.

And I somehow felt that the author or anime director would have strong leg fetish even this is not an ecchi show... their skirts' cloth physics is REALLY something. 
>> ARTICLE
The dub was okay... Not amazing but not bad. But what hit me was when the osts started playing. Damn i knew the osts were good (i use em to study), but hearing them again in the actual anime keeps sending me shivers and goosebumps....

I watched the dub on my 2nd watch, was not impressed.  I'm rewatching with subs this time.

I was expecting a good romance, and I'm getting it. What I didn't expect was the best depiction of child abuse I have ever seen. This show is absolutely unbelievable. I've been tearing up every time I watched it since episode 2, and nothing sad has even happened yet! This is the kind of anime that feels like a privilege to be able to experience.
>> ARTICLE
> I was expecting a good romance, and I'm getting it. What I didn't expect was the best depiction of child abuse I have ever seen.

Even after BokuMachi?
>> ARTICLE
I think that was a terrible depiction, because Kayo had no personality traits to speak of aside from "sad little girl." Erased never showed us how abuse affected somebody on any deeper level than not wanting to be abused anymore. There was one really great scene where Satoru's mother reached out to Kayo and she flinched away, but that was the only time I felt that their depiction of abuse was more than one dimensional. Erased played for cheap feels by showing a cute little girl being hit, and didn't even attempt to explore the subject in any depth.

Kousei and [](/s "Oikura Sodachi") from Owarimonogatari are by far the two best depictions I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Some anime you just know it's something special from the first scene and keeps reminding you you're in for a ride
>> ARTICLE
The first scene in ep1 with the sakura trees already blew me away. Either the entire budget was going to be blown on the 1st episode OR it was going to be something spectacular. The latter is definitely true, and so rare too. 
>> ARTICLE
> I've been tearing up every time I watched it...

Well you're in for one hell of a ride.
>> ARTICLE
Hoooo boy. First of all, I'd like to say that the art in this show is incredibly well done, particularly during the performance piece. We see a nice [contrast between Kousei and Kaori](https://49.media.tumblr.com/7b6e18a35d3fbcdf97862c3fdb24257a/tumblr_no0d2dlJ3c1tgx5s7o1_500.gif) as Kousei channels his mother into an almost robotic "human metronome" trance. Meanwhile, Kaori absolutely glows like a star on the stage. 

Also, as a second time watcher, I feel that the moment they hault their piece and Kaori turns to Kousei and says, ["Again"](http://i.imgur.com/VPKdQXg.png) is an absolutely pivotal point in the series. It's as if she's not only telling him to start up the piece again, but also to start playing the piano again and to *learn* how to play it again. He clearly struggles with the shadow of his mother while he performs, appearing to drown in it. He is a broken metronome. But in comes Kaori and her "play the piece as you feel" style, which is quite the opposite of the perfection his mother demanded. Now Kaori wants him to look at her. If he does that, he can see piano in a whole new light. He can to learn to play again.

Also, the name of the track that plays in the background during this scene is called [Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKeI8eYtWyQ). Fancy that.

Didn't think of the "again" like that.

And I also like how she says Again in English.

**Episode 4: The Journey**

Oh boy, we're in for a doozy today. This episode has what I would consider one of if not THE highest points in the series, followed essentially immediately by an absolute gut punch that takes the wind out of you and leaves you on the floor. That's something this series does quite often, and better than anything else I've seen.

* ["Springtime, it's right around the corner."](http://i.imgur.com/rIOa0wx.png) All that ice Kousei has been frozen in for the last 2 years is finally starting to thaw. Too bad this is kind of a case of 'be careful what you wish for' for poor Tsubaki.

* ["I should've been running this piece *night and day*..."](http://i.imgur.com/lIa6BSj.png) Yeah, if only you hadn't spent all week dodging Kaori like a jackass. That would've been great. I may be a little bitter still.

* [Kaori smash puny Kousei!](http://i.imgur.com/uyUlf66.png) This is what happens when a girl asks you [what you think of her new dress](http://i.imgur.com/Lt89Jw7.png) and you totally ignore her. Dating 101, man...

* ["You've always got your head down. You're stuck in that score like it's quicksand... The song is *in you.*"](http://i.imgur.com/xVL6CTN.png) There's a fairly obvious double-meaning in what Kaori says to Kousei here. Not only does she mean that Kousei has memorized the sheet music after it 'plastered his world' for the last week, but that the music itself is inside him and where he should draw from, not from the notes on the page. Like her, he should play the way *he* wants to and express himself through the music. This is obviously in stark contrast to the way his mother taught him.

* ["She *is* the journey, with no clear destination in sight. It's like you're freedom itself."](http://i.imgur.com/sFN2RWd.png)

* ["No, I'm not. Freedom is what we find out there."](http://i.imgur.com/7WUwXF3.png) It's hard to express how much I love this whole sequence. It's just beautifully put together, from the lighting to the animation to the music to the dialog. This was the moment during my first viewing that I knew the series was a step above and, like Kousei, I was completely in awe of Kaori.

* ["We don't want to keep Saint Saens waiting."](http://i.imgur.com/VFKtCvT.png) That slight pause before Kaori takes the first step out on stage. You can almost feel the mix of emotions the two of them are experiencing.

* [A face of uncertainty,](http://i.imgur.com/CsiwLb6.png) and [a face of reassurance.](http://i.imgur.com/kvrV7sL.png)

* And here comes [mommy dearest](http://i.imgur.com/bZ4ZllC.png) to screw it all up.

* [And](http://i.imgur.com/1NVrCRq.png) [it](http://i.imgur.com/vOM6POF.png) [happens...](http://i.imgur.com/UwcU7ph.png) Incidentally, I love how Kaori's playing immediately turns from energetic to slow and mournful when Kousei stops. An expression of her inner feelings.

* ["Again?"](http://i.imgur.com/h4zLFSi.png) Time to dig deep, Kousei.

* [Beautiful.](http://i.imgur.com/e04aoiM.png)

* ["Start hitting the keys, you idiot! If you leave her hanging, I'm *so* kicking your ass."](http://i.imgur.com/IOSFQ6W.png) You said what we're all thinking, Watari.

* Even though he's still off tempo and out of rhythm, the fact that Kousei has started playing again [instantly puts a smile on Kaori's face.](http://i.imgur.com/AuOMrUx.png)

* Kousei is so focused that [his eyes are burning holes in the camera.](http://i.imgur.com/G9qorR8.png)

* [That moment when you suddenly realize](http://i.imgur.com/XSuiyni.png) that [the guy you didn't know you liked](http://i.imgur.com/N5xHECA.png) just [experienced an intimate connection with another girl in a way that you'll never be able to with him,](http://i.imgur.com/nmJGB5L.png) and you've now become the third member of a duet. Poor Tsubaki. :(

* [The happiest moment of Kousei's life](http://i.imgur.com/nxugU51.png) and [the highest emotional point of the episode](http://i.imgur.com/rLGyzX8.png) followed immediately by...

* [Fuck.](http://i.imgur.com/SLBnvTp.png) There's that gut punch. [The feels train is now departing the station.](http://i.imgur.com/7xAoM2p.png) If you've been paying attention, this is the moment for new watchers when it should be sinking it that this isn't necessarily going to be a happy story. [spoiler](/s "This is the second death flag of the series, with Kousei ominously casting a shadow over Kaori like a tombstone.")

I really like your comment on Kaori's music instantly turning sorrowful when he stops. I didn't notice that and it definitely speaks volumes. Also tsubaki's expression is very emotional. All this time she has just been thinking of kousei and helping him get back to something that he loves, but in this moment she realizes it was someone else who really got him to start playing again and it really hits home.
>> ARTICLE
wow, didnt notice that effect with kousei's eyes.

3rd from the bottom bullet:  i just noticed this on my 3rd watch tonight.

last bullet:  i did not notice the shadow, excellent observation.

you are correct
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "Yes, sadly, it's their only actual performance together on stage in the whole series, and Kaori's last time being on stage ever again unless you count her appearance in the final episode. Part of what makes this episode so sad for me.")

Huge spoilers

[Also where the title of the show comes from](/s "1. The lie is the promise between Kousei and Kaori "Let's play again together" the other lie is that Kaori lied that she said she liked Watari at the beginning of the series")

>> ARTICLE
[re:yours](/s "I disagree that the 'Let's play again together' was a lie. She fully intended to go through with it twice but her health didn't agree. Her liking Watari is explicitly stated in ep22 to be the one and only lie in the title.")
>> ARTICLE
One very interesting thing about this episode for me that you didn't mention is that, in the end, it wasn't Kaori who made Kousei able to hear the music again. It was his mother. 
>> ARTICLE
Well it's hard to explain it without going into future episodes. But it's safe to say that Kaori pushes him out of his comfort zone.
>> ARTICLE
More than anything, Koari is the one physically changing him. However, what's changing inside of Kousei is the internal conflict he has with his mother dying. So you're both right.
>> ARTICLE
Pssst. Hey. You're [doing the thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4f4z8e/what_about_anime_do_you_hate/d25y442) It applies to rewatches just as much as source material readers.

Thanks, yeah, I figured she would push him out of his comfort zone, given how that's the entire premise of the show. I find it interesting though that, at least so far, she hasn't really been able to do that. Even though Kaori is the one who dragged him on stage, Kousei isn't doing this for her. He's still playing because his mother wanted him to play, and her instructions are the only thing that could break through to him even in the thrall of the anxiety that her overbearing expectations gave birth to. It's a very powerful detail to make note of, I think. It really shows just how much Kousei is consumed by her memory.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I'm really doing the thing here. It's all there in this episode for an attentive viewer to catch. It's also difficult because the show does the same by itself. It's how it hooks people in.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps. I think though that it was sort of a case of him banishing the spectre of his mother by recalling a happier memory of her, but he did so on behalf of Kaori because he didn't want to let her down. As he says, "I'm still looking for any excuse, but this time it's for a reason to say yes." His mother was the excuse, but Kaori was the reason.

[spoiler](/s "During Kousei's solo performance later on, I recall that as he's struggling for a reason to play, he thinks back to this performance with Kaori and decides that he's going to play for her.")
>> ARTICLE
wow nice!  i missed that 3 times!  i just watched that scene again and you're absolutely right.
>> ARTICLE
God that slow realization in Tsubaki's eyes. I think she was having flashbacks to the first episode:

* Tsubaki: "We're gonna hang out tomorrow, you wanna come with?"

* Kousei: "What and be the third wheel?"

* Tsubaki: "If this girl and Watari hit it off, *I'm* gonna be the third wheel!"



Poor Tsubaki. How the hell did this turn on her so fast...
>> ARTICLE
Watching that range of emotions sweep across her face is heartbreaking. Like I said, "be careful what you wish for." She wished for things to change, and they are, but now she's the one being left behind.

This anime broke me, I hope everyone who is watching it for the first time is enjoying it!

Anyway I seem to have fixed it now.

This was such a fantastic episode. I honestly didn't expect to enjoy this series so much, but man, this is quite the experience and we're only 3 episodes in.
>> ARTICLE
Image fifteen, top left corner. Anyone know what this is?

Cute brunette girl with a... monkey?
>> ARTICLE
That's "Kamisama Hajimemashita"

A quite cute love comedy.

Nanami's father looses their house gambling and runs away. While she is brooding she sees a man chased by a dog and scares it away.

The man gives her his house in return, only catch is that he is a god and lives in a temple, so along with the temple she becomes a god.

Now she must learn to be a god while she deals with her feeling for the fox spirit that acts as the temple caretaker.

And yes, that's a monkey, won't appear until season 2.


That's a series I have quite fond memories of, also since it was running when I managed to travel to Japan. First thing I do stepping off from the Narita train is walk into a Family Mart for some snacks, just at that moment the series OP starts playing on the loudspeaker.. for a moment there almost started singing along.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa I have this on my PTW. Thanks!! I'm going to start it asap, really pumped for it.

And that's really awesome. It's a pretty popular series in the far east then?
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea how popular it was, probably just a random coincidence from a commercial for the single. I didn't see all that much publicity or merchandise for it (even in Akiba) so who knows.

Another coincidence: just found out the manga is ending in a couple of weeks.


>> ARTICLE
Is the anime adaptation going to finish with the manga? or did they just do 2 seasons?

Just 2 seasons (and a couple of OVAs)

Well I know what I'm watching.

I know it's late for this completely pointless question but its been bothering me too much, where the heck does the soccer ball that  Watari kicks in the OP go? It doesn't seem to bounce off the wall, but why would he miss the wall on purpose? 
>> ARTICLE
If you watch the OP in slow-mo, even then it's hard to see. It either ricochets off the post and flies off the left of the screen or he hooks it really bad. Either way, it goes off the left of the screen (you can see his gaze follow it as well).
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed the visual and sound effects used to convey Kousei's predicament. it was very interesting to note that while he (and by extension us) couldn't hear his playing, we could still hear Kaori's playing quite easily, so it's kinda like Kaori is leading him through this difficult moment and I just really thought that was very well done. 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely one of my favorite episodes pre OP 2. I'm just sitting on the edge of my seat for [Super Major Spoilers](/s "People's reaction to Kaori's explanation of 'Her single lie.' ")
>> ARTICLE
How they depict what Kousei is going through is amazing. The heavy use of monologue and repeated lines/thoughts was a little annoying in the first few episodes, until this episode where they finally click in. It really lets you feel Kousei's struggle against this 'disease', you keep reasoning with yourself, this shouldn't happen, but you just can't help it. 

I think it very relatable for most people who experienced something like stage sickness, all the preparation, prep talk, 'getting in the mood' does next to nothing. Kousei has something much worse, much deeper, I wonder if there is an actual name for that though?
>> ARTICLE
I started watching this with the rewatch since I'd heard good things about it and I wanted to branch out a little bit in genres. Here are some thoughts.

-I'm really liking the soundtrack. Even when they're not playing classical the music going on in the background is nice.

-I'm liking the story too, for the most part. Some of the symbolism seems a bit forced (eg Tsubaki's spring is coming lines), but overall it creates a nice feel so I don't mind it too much.

-Despite this not being my usual genre of anime, it's managing to draw me in, which is always a good sign. 

That being said, (DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY WATCHED THE SHOW) [Your Lie in April](/s "I'm not sure I want to keep watching. I'm about 90% sure Kaori is going to die. I hear everyone say that this show breaks their heart into little pieces, and the only way I can think of that happening is a death. Kaori going to the hospital and randomly passing out basically confirmed that for me. Some spoilers I accidentally moused over also seemed to support that, but at that point it wasn't a surprise anymore. I don't want to look it up to confirm, but I'd be surprised if she didn't. I think knowing this gives the show a lot of beauty and gives a lot more meaning to things, which is beautiful in its own way, but watching 24 episodes just for Kaori to die kind of feels like walking 8 hours down a train track only to get hit by a train you know is coming in the other direction. Can someone convince me to stick with it?")


>> ARTICLE
delifresh: trust me, you arent 'spoiled.' Even if your hunch is correct (which I wont say one way of the other, and I would argue the show doesnt have a true 'twist' ending like many believe), [YLIA not really a spoiler but being safe](/s "the show telegraphs the ending because it isnt meant to be a surprise. It doesnt need to shock or surprise you to have a powerful impact, honestly that would have just cheapened the show to have had to rely on base shock value cheap shots."). As someone else already said, this show is about the journeys of its characters- and because its characters and their relationships are so powerful and evocative, surprise doesnt even enter the top 10 reasons why the ending is considered strongly emotional. 

I know I am about to finish college and leave many of my friends behind, and I've known this all along- its not as if Im going to be kidnapped from my dorm in the middle of the night and forced to get a job. But that doesnt make the experience any less sad to me, because I've formed strong relationships with people and will be genuinely sad to not see them every day. Your Lie in April builds that same emotional bond with me- I empathize so deeply with the characters that even though I saw the ending coming a mile away, it was still very emotional for me because I feel like they're my friends, and I dont want to see any of them get hurt. 
>> ARTICLE
Be advised that I'm about to essentially spoil the whole ending for you, so if you truly don't want to know what happens then do not read the text below. That said, if it's a matter of knowing what happens or giving up on the series because of your suspicions, it might be better to have it spoiled...

[Total Ending Spoiler](/s "Yes, Kaori is terminally ill and has been for some time. You can already see it coming by episode 4 and it only becomes more apparent as the series goes on until it's practically hitting you over the head with her death flags by the half-way point. It's really not trying to hide it, because Kaori's fate isn't really the point. The point is the journey. It puts you in Kousei's shoes. He's been here before. He watched his mother wither away and die only a few years earlier. He knows what's coming. But even knowing, he clings to a hopeless hopefulness that things will somehow work out. The series is about his struggle to deal with watching someone else he loves wither away, and you struggle along with him. In a way, were the ending to actually be a surprise, I honestly think it would have *less* impact than it does.")

I would recommend sticking with it. Like you, I had a pretty good idea of where it was going even on my first viewing. The ending was still beautiful, and I would really be kicking myself if I had missed out on the series because the ending wasn't a total surprise. That's not to say there aren't surprises ahead either. You still don't know what the titular "lie" is, after all, and that revelation tinges and changes how you'll view almost every episode in the series leading up to it.
>> ARTICLE
After reading the non-spoiler parts of your message I decided not to read the spoiler and to continue watching. I think that's exactly what I needed to hear. Thanks man!
>> ARTICLE
Grats man. You won't be disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
It's a shame that so many people won't stop raving about the handful of tearjerker scenes, because not only does it make new viewers expect tragedy, but it also undermines the rest of the show. The message is about moving forward, about all the beautiful moments that make up life, and how you miss them by feeling sorry for yourself. Just this episode we had Kaori say it straight to Kousei: "Look up at me. You're always looking down." Don't fret so much over possibilities to the point that you freeze in place, because that is literally what Kousei is doing. Just as Kaori said, the show is a journey. Don't worry about the destination, just enjoy getting there.
>> ARTICLE
Your comment made me burst into tears
>> ARTICLE
I'm convinced. I'll stick with it. Thanks man.

Damn man. Well said.
>> ARTICLE
indeed.  i spoiled the ending early on during my first watch as well, and it did not ruin it at all.  in fact, it just made me want to binge watch it.
>> ARTICLE
This episode is just perfect in my mind. Kaori literally takes Kousei by the hand and takes him on a journey. To be frank, it's really straightforward in its visual department. There isn't a lot of visual subtext that needs analysis. Even so, I found several extremely powerful images.

* [Look up at me](http://imgur.com/Nsdy5ag) - [Look up at me! (Show spoilers)](/s ""I know you're scared, believe me I'm more scared than you right now. You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this moment. For Kousei Arima to play the piano for me! This may be my last chance, so I have no choice but to take it. I know it's hard, but you must steel yourself. You are a musician after all. You have me, and we are together in this."")
* [Decisive moment](http://imgur.com/Oz51Qt9)

* [Again!](http://imgur.com/AaM5c3I) - We may be terrible, we may be disqualified; But that doesn't matter now. We have the stage. When the going gets tough we grit our teeth and push through. That's why we are musicians.

[Kaori](/s "Sigh. "I guess we have to do it the hard way. Listen, Kousei: I don't care about this competition. I'm playing for you, will you play for me?"")

* [I'm going on a journey!](http://imgur.com/QwaiTXB) - Basking in the spring warmth and sakura petals everywhere *hint hint*

[Kousei:](/s ""Yes, Kaori. I will play for you. I feel like I'm at the bottom of the sea, and I can't hear anything. But I can hear you. You're here close where nobody else has been. I want to go on this journey with you."")

That's how I imagine them talking as musicians. Fuck I'm tearing up writing this.

I'm musically illiterate, so I use [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2kt3tl/spoilers_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_episode_4/clopa7q) for reference.

* It's natural that Kaori would choose this classical piece. The violin is the leader in this dance of instruments while the piano is the supportive, uplifting pillar.

* Kousei is hitting the keys too hard. It's clear that the piano shouldn't surpass the violin in volume and intensity. He starts rushing the tempo.

* In the final sequence both the violin and piano are going out of their way to surpass the other in intensity and volume.

* A person falling to the ground. An unmistakable, gut-wrenching sound. I remember when I first saw this episode I felt like my legs were cut and a shiver ran through my whole body. The situation is all too real for me.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome interpretation my friend
>> ARTICLE
This episode probably has the best background music out of anything i've ever watched. especially that bit when kaori was talking to kousei right before they go on stage. gaaaah the music is freaking amazing in this show
>> ARTICLE
This episode was beautiful yet, really cringey for me. Or perhaps awkward? That feeling where it's just hard to watch and you just wanna walk away for a while (which I did).

So, this kid's obviously deeply wounded and they kinda keep dredging up all his pain. He says no then they actually abuse him to get him to do it LOL. It felt selfish on her part to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
1. No one knows why he doesn't play. We just hear his internal blabbering 

2. It's not selfish, I'd say it was selfless. She blew her competition in order to start helping Kousei. 

3. First time watcher, eh? 
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty obvious she doesn't care about the competition, just the stage. So, yeah she might believe in him but she has her own motivations here. 
>> ARTICLE
> but she has her own motivations here.

You're right, but not in the way you may think- I think
>> ARTICLE
The flying away of the music notes and the seemingly drowning sound was a creative way to demonstrate how he couldn't hear the music. Digging this anime so far
>> ARTICLE
So, my fav performance. 

Points I took this time: 
First scene, Kousei's mother is speaking as a metronome. If you listen to how she repeats certain words, they are exactly in accordance to what the metronome was ticking. 

KimiUso is just perfect in terms of getting that tune for the episode. Introduction and Rondo, as explained in the episode, is an exclamation of a a virtuoso violinist. Well, let's rearrange the roles here. Kaori exclamates Kousei's skill? Picking this to show off? Just a thought. 

It's funny how this episode reminded me how I learn to play the piano. By putting those sheets everywhere around and having that one specific song on a repeat mode for a week or so. However, as Kaori pointed out, one could get stuck in the sheet music cage. When 'Music is freedom', it shouldn't enslave you. 

As in my previous comment yesterday. 'Twinkle, twinkle' used again as starting melody, a melody to learn how to play (again). I love how they use it. 

Even though I'm on the KaorixKousei ship, it was sad to see, how Tsubaki suddenly realised she will never have that kind of connection with Kousei as Kaori has. There's that one moment, when she looks with realisation on the stage. I noticed that expression only because of the rewatch. 


One last thing. Am I wrong or the sakura blossoming/hanami season starts in May? Which is why spring is so important throughout the series? Like, we are waiting for Kousei's skill to blossom? (I won't spoiler the second part of my theory now)
>> ARTICLE
I believe that the cherry blossoms start in the beginning of spring, so late April/early May would be about the tail end of the blooming season.

Do you happen to remember in what month their duet takes place? I haven't been able to catch if it's still April in-story.
>> ARTICLE
It's somewhere in May. Watari even says to Tsubaki that it's the end of May when she says that spring is coming. 

That's why I'm trying to understand why everyone is talking about spring and April, and the coming of these two.... 
>> ARTICLE
It's actually the end of April in this episode, not quite May yet.

Tsubaki saying that springtime is coming and Watari commenting about her not noticing the cherry blossoms is her referring to Kousei finally coming out of his shell and picking the piano back up again. He's been trapped in "winter" for the last 2 years, and his internal "springtime" is finally coming.

EDIT: Numerous spelling errors. I need to not post comments first thing in the morning.

I envy all of the first time watchers, I would love to experience it again.

I actually think watching it a second time has just as much merit as the first. You pick up on so many little things that you missed the first time, and see everything in a whole new light.

But you don't enjoy the ride as much unfortunately. I'm gonna wait until I forget important things about it.

Yes sure but you don't get to discover the characters like you did the first time, you don't try to predict what is happening next. That's what I enjoy the most (and that's the reason I use to start A LOT of anime at the same time) and you can't have it on a second watching.

First time watcher reporting in.

I missed yesterday's ep but I really liked it if you're looking for that xD I liked the immediate gag after that emotional scene.

That first scene damn. So he's fine with his life being like that? Your life bro.

This is truly a romance anime.

I don't know much about classical music but it truly is beautiful.

Damn. That's scary. Always seeing your mom like that. In that creepy wheelchair bound form.

Whoa! That contrasting, warm and kind image of his mom is heartwrenching.

This truly is. A romance anime.

Edit: Also. Two people on a bike is forbidden by law.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a first time watcher and oh man... what am I getting myself into?

I really like Watari, he's a great bro. Poor Tsubaki, that look on her face when she realized the connection Kaori and Kousei have... how hurt or sad she must have felt! I also understand that Tsubaki and Watari are trying to help, but I don't think forcing your friend who doesn't / can't play piano anymore to suddenly play piano in public (at place with a bad memory no less!) would be helping much... I'm excited to see where this anime goes. As Kousei said, "I'm going on a journey!"

I didn't really realize the gravity of Tsubaki's look there my first time through. So props to you!

>> ARTICLE
She literally kicks Kousei's ass at least once an episode.
>> ARTICLE
Holy moly, what a rollercoaster. This show goes from lighthearted romance comedy to depressing reality really quick. Also Kousei's mom was once a nice good mom! Weird how sick people change. Forcing her own failure or her son, pretty heavy stuff!

Now we also know what Kaori was doing at the hospital. She's sick. That or she was that tired? I think she's going to have a parrelel to Kousei's mom maybe. This is all speculation ofcourse.
>> ARTICLE
This is my 4th time watching this series, and after this episode I'm reallllly tempted to just watch ahead of the episode threads. I like this series way too much.

so does Kousei saying that no one understands his mother like sympathizing with an abuser, or was his experience with her a lot more like the gentle times, like her singing twinkle twinkle little star to him near the end of this episode, than it was her harsh teachings we saw before?

Kaori does look cute in her dress.  Their playing was incredible. I don't know what I liked better, the start of the performance where Kousei was able to hear the music, or the second part where he was imagining and they were "brawling" with their playing. 

And i just realized: all those kids were riding those bicycles without helmets on!

> so does Kousei saying that no one understands his mother like sympathizing with an abuser,

You could certainly make an argument for it. The series goes a ways to explaining why she behaved as she did later on, but a lot of watchers view it as being inexcusable regardless. At the end of the day though, Kousei still loved his mother and she still loved him; even if she had a terrible way of showing it.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, good, I'm glad they still had a loving relationship. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm one episode behind the rewatch, but i discovered an interesting bit of trivia in the dialogue i that missed on previous watches.

In the cat scene in eposode 3, where kousei explains his disability, kaori suggests to play with a stick between his teeth, like beethoven. Beethoven suffered severe hearing loss in the later parts of his life. It is said that beethoven played with a stick between his teeth so he could feel the vibrations. Although these tales appear to be mostly imaginary, according to some random internet source...

Later in the same episode, the black cat narrates that he has found an excuse to never appear on stage again. "you're no beethoven after all". Beethoven left the stage because his hearling loss made it impossible to act as the conductor, Kousei left because he was scared (according to EP3 dialogue).

**Episode 2: Friend A**

Kaori makes her triumphant debut on stage. This is one of my favorite episodes in the series. We get to see Kaori perform and *OMG is she cute up there!*

* [Tsubaki's face when she sees Kousei hesitating.](http://i.imgur.com/w3DHFK5.png) Hard to tell what she's thinking, but I just love the look she gives him.

* [What's a Guarneri? And who's Paganini?](http://i.imgur.com/sqKYfT1.png)

* I love Tsubaki's face when Kaori starts playing. [She's like a chipmunk!](http://i.imgur.com/ip4fN0S.png) So adorkable. :3

* Speaking of adorkable, [I can't handle Kaori right now.](http://i.imgur.com/fqxe0ph.png)

* I love that Kaori seems to be completely calm leading up to and during the competition. [It isn't until she asks Kousei for his opinion on her performance that we see her hands shaking and a flicker of uncertainty.](http://i.imgur.com/znEYECx.png) It goes to show how absolutely important his approval was for her. She wasn't out there playing for the judges and couldn't care less what her score was. She was playing to impress Kousei. [spoiler](/s "This had been a moment she had been waiting for for years. Everything afterwards hinged on her music moving Kousei.")

* [Kaori in the early evening cherry blossoms makes my heart go all aflutter.](http://i.imgur.com/h5rEc1K.png)

* Kousei covering for Watari while he "cheats" on Kaori. (Is it cheating; are they officially a couple yet?) "Bros before hoes." I can respect that, but you're still an idiot. The number of times Kousei sabotages himself in this series is depressing. Kaori sabotages herself pretty often too, but at least she has a good excuse: [spoiler](/s "Not wanting to come between Tsubaki and Kousei and leave a mess knowing that she's just 'passing through' their lives.")

I don't think Watari is cheating on anyone except Keiko.

Poor Keiko, actually. We never even get to see what she looks like.

[series spoiler](/s "Is it still sabotage if Kousei had no idea what was going on in the first place? And that, despite everything, he had the girl before the series even started anyway.")
>> ARTICLE
I would say yes. He knows how he feels about her, but continually refuses to act on it because he doesn't want to come between Kaori and Watari, or because he thinks he doesn't stand a chance compared to Watari. Him lying about Watari still being in practice rather than admitting the truth to Kaori - that Watari is walking Keiko home - is a perfect example of him sabotaging his own best interests for the sake of his friend.

True. [spoiler](/s "I kinda wonder why Kousei was so reluctant to admit to himself that he felt genuine love for Kaori. To pretty much any outside observer, they'd seem like they were made for each other.")

[Spoiler](/s "Kousei still doesn't know what he's feeling at this point. It's his first love, and he can't really explain to himself why this girl has a special aura about her. The ending of episode 3 further develops this")

At the end of the day we have to remember that they are only 14 year olds and there are a lot of strange new feelings at that age. Weren't we all like that at some point in our teen years?
>> ARTICLE
I think it's because it would be easier for him to not love her since she supposedly likes Watari once he admits that he has feelings for her it makes it all the more difficult for him to watch her be with somebody else. Also [big fuckin spoiler] (/s "it seems to me like he suspects early on that something is wrong with her. He asks her if this is the first time she's collapsed and also we see him thinking to himself something along the lines of: please let her be fine etc. If he thought something was going to happen to her he may not have wanted to get attached")
>> ARTICLE
[follow up to yours](/s "That and the collapsing combined with the performance reminds him immensely of his dead mother")

Ah yeah that's true I didn't think about that. One of the scenes that shows this really well is when [] (/s "he visits her in the hospital and he walks into her room and you see a kinda static like effect and it cuts to his mom in the hospital. It cuts back and forth a few times with his mom and the bed overplayed exactly over Kaori.")
>> ARTICLE
The best thing is that she was waiting for him not Watari. She perfectly knew where Watari was and all of that talk about going to the practice was teasing and sort of testing what kind of person Kousei is (would you lie/do anything for your bmf? )
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure that Kaori knew Watari was walking someone else home. I don't see how she possibly could since Watari had only decided to do so a moment before Kousei left, unless maybe Watari had the decency to call/text her and let her know he wasn't coming.

I think Kaori only knew enough to know that Kousei was covering for something because he was such a terrible liar, and that's why she decided to toy with him a bit.
>> ARTICLE
that makes more sense

how does she know what watari was doing?

If you listen to the Japanese VA, you'll hear that playful and teasing tone she has. She clearly was waiting for Kousei not Watari. Also, you don't go on a date with a substitute if you didn't like the substitute.

**Episode 2**

Alright, here's a first-time watcher joining in.  I had seen episode 1 and put it off far too long so I'm popping in now w/ some thoughts!  (Since it just came out, I'll be watching the dub, so don't attack me sub-master race!  Gonna give it a shot w/out having anything to compare it to!)

-First off, [**the OP**](http://openings.moe/?video=Opening1-ShigatsuWaKimiNoUso.webm)....wow.  Incredible intro to the show and how I found out about it in the first place so...yeah.  
Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said (and I have a feeling I'm gonna like it even more over time).

-Man, these first 2 episodes and already I have a ton of feelz.  This is going to get so much worse, won't it?

-Love the whole "strict" vs. "free" counter-vibes going on.  And while you somehow KNOW what Kaori's gonna do, doesn't make it any less magical of a moment, nor the little kids coming up to her afterwards.

-"She's beautiful"--a (mostly) non-clueless MC?  Nice.

-Dude--getting turned into a [substitute](http://rentafriend.com/media/images/nivo/3.jpg) is rough, buddy.  Been there.

-The colors in this show are [LITERALLY GORGEOUS](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--xFIU0jBo--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/audhad6mxmfiede2h5xt.jpg)

And of course this [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIC7BbmaHfI) is AMAZING.  Wow.

So yeah, so far I just want nothing more than to keep on watching!  Having to wait 24 hours is gonna be rough.  My only thing so far has been how much monologuing has been going on....but the language.

Oh that language (the script in the dub makes really good use of it, [good job Patrick Seitz!](http://img1.joyreactor.cc/pics/comment/Anime-art-Vocaloid-Hatsune-Miku-165317.jpeg) )

It's reminiscent of a novel in how it's being told.  But yeah, so far can't wait for tomorrow's ep!
>> ARTICLE
i agree with you on the OP and ED.  They were both so amazing, and the OP played a huge role in my falling in love with the series.  For ending was just as beautiful.  
For the rewatchers or people who don't mind spoilers, there's a great analysis of the first opening somewhere on youtube.

>> ARTICLE
> -"She's beautiful"--a (mostly) non-clueless MC? Nice.

What I especially love about it is how and when Kousei monologues that she's beautiful. Whereas Watari was instantly smitten with her at first sight and head over heels at how cute she was, we don't see Kousei falling for Kaori (sparkling eyes and everything) until he hears her play. Her beauty to him is as much if not more about her free approach to music than it is about her physical appearance.
>> ARTICLE
Well I guess you could also interpret it as [Major YLiA Spoilers](/s "Watari just playing the part he was given. Rewatching this makes me realize just what horrific actors the two are.")
>> ARTICLE
"Holy shit she's cute good job Tsubaki!"

[re:yours](/s "acting in an internal monologue?")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers duh](/s "He must have already met her before to work out their plan. I'd say that's more of an continuity error, put in to throw off the viewer. Kaori even says 'OH HOW IS IT WE'VE NEVER MET BEFORE?' in a really obvious way.")

hmm, that seems unlikely

It made it more like a "see the beauty inside" rather than just seeing the external beauty moment, I agree.

Personal notes:

* I have no idea who that judge is commenting on Kaori's performance is, but he shows up again later to explain stuff in a difference performance. I think he's just the way of explaining what he intended his characters' performances to be like to the audience (us), especially considering how the original work was a manga with no sound.
* [Based on a comment from the original reddit thread about the technical details of the violin performances this episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2jfz6n/spoilers_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_episode_2/clbht7e) by /u/Flamerare, it seems like the less you know about classical music the more you might enjoy the series.
* Kaori seems oddly motivated in that last scene. Kousei is such a bro, trying to cover for Watari's womanizing. [Thought continued, all series spoilers](/s "Poor/lucky Kousei didn't realize that he just got asked out on his first date. I do find it sad how Kaori didn't feel like she could ask Kousei out directly.") 
* On a different level, the light cast by the sunset is absolutely beautiful.
* On the other hand, we've also got some [less good animation](http://i.imgur.com/Bip6Mdd.jpg) this episode. I didn't particularly mind when I was watching KimiUso for the first time, but I wouldn't fault anyone for taking issue.

OST tracks in this episode (that I caught)

9. Kanojo wa Utsukushii (An overwhelming personality)
10. Kyou no Koto wa Wasurerarenai yo (It must've been an unforgettable day)
11. Haru no Kaori (Spring's Kaori?)
12. Kimi wa Haru no Naka ni Iru (You exist inside spring)

> On the other hand, we've also got some less good animation this episode. I didn't particularly mind when I was watching KimiUso for the first time, but I wouldn't fault anyone for taking issue.

I certainly don't want to give the impression that I'm crapping on the art, because in motion everything looks gorgeous, but there are certainly places when going through for screencaps where you realize just how wonky it can sometimes be.

For example, [check out Kaori's freakish mutant hand.](http://i.imgur.com/dXj2vxq.png)

Yeah, on this rewatch I wonder if when she said [spoilers](/s "you're gonna be his substitute, if she primarily meant you're the sub in for who I like or just you're the one I'm hanging out with")

Also, I could be wrong as I've only recently started picking up Japanese, but doesn't #1 translate into "She is beautiful"? 

Lastly, I must apologize as I am falling to the marathon bug, even on a rewatch. If there's still anything left of me once I finish, I'll try and join in and rewatch the daily episode as well after. Wish me luck...
>> ARTICLE
Marathon bug? You'll be able to comment on the rewatch from the same side we are then x]

As for song translations, thanks for helping me out there. I don't actually know Japanese so I've just been listening for track titles as lines in the anime and pulling them straight from my subtitles, so they might not be correct translations there.
>> ARTICLE
Haha sorry, I'm already rewatching this. Every scene is just much more meaningful and emotional now... rip my tear glands
>> ARTICLE
I don't know much about japanese yet (I'm still learning) but your translations for the soundtrack pieces are sort of wrong. Maybe those are the official english names but the translations (the way I understand them) are:

1. "She's beautiful"

2. "I won't forget about today"

3. "Spring's scent" (it's a japanese pun)

4. "You're inside spring" (these one is kind of tricky for me, since english is not my first language, but your translations is pretty much right in this one)

Sorry for pointing out these titles, they just caught my attention

Edit: aparently, I forgot how to format.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the help! I've been sort of haphazardly pulling them from Commie's translation of the actual dialogue since I don't actually know Japanese, so I'm not surprised that some of it might be completely off base.

First Time Watcher here

Watari such a bro
Kousei such a bro
They're such bros

The art style is something very new to me. I'm still not used to it but it'll grow.

I wonder who played that piece for Kaori. I mean the artist who played it for her in the scene.

It seems that he was only pushed to play by his mom, so he never really wanted to? That's how it seems to me.

The comedy parts that are drawn in chibi form is amazing.

Don't torture me if I say anything wrong. I'll say it again! First time watcher here!

Okay this episode made me a fan of the show.Last thread I said that I'm a sucker for classical music and this show is combining all the elements I like into something beautiful.As a first time watcher I'd like to express my thoughts on the scene of Kaori's performance.Basically Arima is still a well known musician in the town as the youngest winner of the competition.Even though he stopped competing, after hearing all the competitors playing,he's judging their performances ,knowing where they made mistakes,which means that he's still got the talent for music.Kaori's performance was superb.It wasnt Beethoven's piece that she played,she made it her own,carving the sounds into the audience to remember her incredible play.The judges and Arima were astounded by her breaking the musical piece,changing it to something new but still good to listen to,not following the rules that the music has.Everything Arima has been taught of music by his mother,Kaori did the opposite.I guess this is how she will change Arima.She will help him break the cuffs he's chained with.

I was about to complain about how every shot of the performers was just a still panning frame, until I realized they saved all the budget for Kaori's performance. I really liked this episode, you got to look into Kaori and how she really differs from Arima in how they approach their music. 

The only thing that is really putting me off from the show is how it flips from super serious emotional moments to gag comedy really fast. The jokes are funny, but I just don't find myself laughing because they feel so out of place. Maybe they'll remedy this as it moves on but even if not I'm sticking along for the whole ride.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately that does not solve itself as the show progresses. It has a nasty habit of breaking tension in the middle of a very serious moment, and then returning right back to the serious tone. It's made some intensely emotional moments feel... abruptly cut off. 

One of my complaints about a show that I otherwise loved from start to finish.
>> ARTICLE
Brace yourself for more mood whiplash, because this series has a habit of going from melodramatic emotional moment to gag joke in the next second and vice versa throughout the series.

I didn't mind myself, but to each their own.

Hey all. If you want to know more about how I intend to structure my comments you may read my [opening post in the episode 01 thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4f9hsq/rewatch_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_your_lie_in_april/d27c8ln) which was buried because of the massive timezone difference (I'm in UTC+2 so it's like 4am here at the time of posting). Tl;dr I'll be analyzing segments from each episode, trying to stimulate discussion suitable for first-time viewers and rewatchers alike.

[**During a serious competition!**](http://imgur.com/iX7i16W)

Yes, Mr. Kazama, that just happened on your watch. To give some context, musical competitions for youth are usually split into two types: one is below ~18 years of age where the contestants are scored based on how accurately they can reproduce the originals; And the second type is above 18 where contestants have to artistically transform the originals and be able to compose their own pieces. This is important to remember going into this show. Kousei sort-of explains it himself to Tsubaki but if you're unfamiliar with art competitions in general it may easily fly over your head.

Now then, it is totally understandable that this elderly by-the-book judge is outraged at the spectacle before him. 14 year old Kaori took Beethoven's Violin Sonata and changed it on a whim!

**After the competition**

Kaori is running toward her companions, clutching in her arms a bundle of flowers she was gifted by two little girls who had heard her song. My question to the first time viewers is what do you make of this scene?

[And for the rewatchers (potential show spoilers)](/s "Notice how Kaori greets Watari cheerfully but it seems she is only doing it out of politeness. She then immediately goes to Kousei and asks him for his opinion. Her cheerful stance drops and her left hand shivers when she asks the question. After he compliments her, Kaori sighs for a short moment, appearing relieved by his words. This is shown with the camera from Kousei's eye perspective which tells us that what he is seeing and interpreting in that moment is also what we are seeing.")

"I've never seen anyone get flowers after the prelims. Not only that, but you don't even know them, right? They couldn't have know to bring them, so for those girls... hearing your performance, then rushing out to buy flowers to give to you... It must've been an unforgettable day. I think it was that kind of performance." - Based Kousei. I don't know how accurate the translation is, but in any case it seems Kousei is a really suave smooth talker.

Well, let me know what you think. And anything else you have noticed and wish to discuss. I really need to get some sleep now so expect my reply in about 4 hours when I hopefully wake up

[](#garlock)

Edit: I also noticed the sakura petals drifting into the music room after school. [I have a theory that](/s "they represent Kaori's presence. They enter Kousei's private sanctum - the music room (his inner self) and make him think. (We see Kousei lying on the ground next to the music sheets for the Violin Sonata.) Later on outside the school, the sakura petals start falling when Kousei sees Kaori (and they start drifting from her direction as well)")
>> ARTICLE
Another thing that confirms that Kaori was waiting for Kousei's opinion is the fact that when he was thinking about his answer, her hand was trembling. Like, come on, you're trembling, you're nervous like hell - he's important to you. 

How could I've been so blind during the first watch of the series. 
>> ARTICLE
good observation there in your edit theory.  that makes a lot of sense.
>> ARTICLE
Serial re-watcher here. The flowers scene is really one of the most powerful parts of this episode. I didn't really catch it my first time through, but on subsequent viewings it became obvious that [spoiler](/s "the entire reason that Kaori had set up the "double date" in the first place had been so Kousei could see her play. The only thing that mattered to her in the whole competition was that her music was able to reach him, which was everything she had been working towards for almost a decade. While she couldn't have cared less for her score from the judges, Kousei's opinion of her performance was what caused her hands to tremble, and having him praise her must have made her so relieved.")

The English dub changes the lines a bit in that scene and I'm not sure how I feel about it. The gist of it is the same with Kousei commenting about how those girls didn't even know her and yet were so moved by her performance that they had to rush out to buy flowers, and he'd never seen that before, but his final line rather than "I think it was that kind of performance" becomes "So yeah, I think you did pretty good." Not quite as smooth, I think.

EDIT: In regards to your edit, that's an interesting point and something I hadn't really thought much about. [spoiler](/s "I suppose the symbolism is obvious since Kaori is sort of meant to be a representation of springtime for Kousei, both in the literal sense and in the sense of his own personal springtime thawing him from the winter of his previous years as Tsubaki alludes to in a couple episodes.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the actual content of Kousei's speech even matters. What matters is [spoiler](/s "his approach to life/romance. This interaction is the first between the pair which shows that Kaori is looking for something more than a summer fling. She even admits at the end that Watari is a really cool guy, but he simply lacks the emotional depth that she's looking for. Watari never had a chance, and he knows it. Watari is a very emotionally intelligent guy, that's why he's a womanizer but also Kousei's best wingman throughout the show.")
>> ARTICLE
[reply, with reference to minor manga-exclusive scene](/s "Why don't you think Watari ever straight up told Kousei that Kaori was only interested in him and to just go for it? He made plenty of suggestions but wasn't upfront. There's also a scene in the manga where Watari does a spit take when Kaori says explicitly that she likes Kousei (before blowing it off as her liking everyone).")
>> ARTICLE
[Slight future spoilers](/s "Like Tsubaki, Watari wants Kousei to grow out of his current rut. But also like Tsubaki, he doesn't really know how to approach the subject. I think that's why he's doing his best to support Kousei in figuring out the answer by himself.")
>> ARTICLE
yep, i dont like how some of the lines were changed just to make the animation of the mouth movements line up with the dialogue.  but there was a funny line in one of the later episodes that i liked a bit better than the sub.  ill point it out when we get to that episode.
>> ARTICLE
Same. There are places in the dub that I feel are delivered poorly compared to the sub, but there are just as many places where I feel the dub actually made an improvement on the sub translation. For example, I remember thinking that [spoiler](/s "Tsubaki's love confession to Kousei later in the series") was handled much better in the dub than in the sub.

I've watched both versions, and I'd say the dub is actually my preferred method of watching now.
>> ARTICLE
ah yeah i remember that did end up being better.

I'd forgotten how truly beautiful the artwork in this anime is.

I'm new to this anime! The comment section is kinda scary though. My thoughts on the first 2 episodes:

- I like the look of the anime, but sometimes the characters look like frog-people. I hope I get used to that.

- The story is interesting. Romances are hit or miss for me.

- Liking the characters of the cast. Especially the MC. I hope he finds love and stuff.

- The music is amazing, I love classical music. The mix with pop style music is somehow really good.

Don't be scared by all the long comments. There are just a few of us who are so passionate about this anime that we have to overthink everything.

Oh what the heck, I literally just watched this show last week and now there's a rewatch going on? I feel like Okabe from Steins;Gate looking back on his younger self. "You're about to begin the most important two weeks of your life." OK, so maybe that's a stretch, but suffice it to say a week later I'm still not recovered from this show and I've had Orange (the second ed) running on loop ever since.

You all are in for quite the ride.

So this is my second time watching the show and since I'm a classical musician, I've decided it would be a good idea to try to transcribe and play a few of the songs from the OST when I have the time over the summer. I'm looking for two more songs since I've already decided that I would begin with Hikaru Nara (the opening song). Any suggestions as to which others I should try to pick up and learn? I don't particularly care of the difficulty of the song, just looking for something that sounds good :)

>> ARTICLE
Check TheIshter and Animez on YouTube. They both did some of the transcriptions :) 

>> ARTICLE
You should do [Spring's Melody](http://youtu.be/fcSDY_XAtXU). I honestly view that as kind of the "main theme" of the show since it (or variations) are played so frequently.
>> ARTICLE
Precisely what devoted me to the show.  Episode 1 was interesting and showed promise, but Kaori's performance is what made me madly proselytize the show to everyone I knew would be receptive to it, and Kousei's comments following her performance were what made me believe it would remain strong throughout.

And it managed to blow well past my highly encouraged expectations, to.
>> ARTICLE
I think it helps to enjoy the show, or episodes like this one in particular, if one is also a musician, since I was able to understand most of what they were talking about. I'm not familiar with the pieces they may play, but I understand the reasoning and the methods they use to an extent. Also, I had my suspicions yesterday, but today really has me thinking that Kaori really isn't into Watari and is only there for Kousei since he was/is a well known musician. Tis just a theory though. 

Also the whole Friend A theme kinda reminds me of the Red Ogre and Blue Ogre story from Ore Monogatari! 
>> ARTICLE
Dang I just finished the series yesterday and didn't know there's going to be a rewatch. Looks like I'm going to watch it again.  Still one of me favorite anime after letting the hype settle down. There are some flaws but I think there're greatly overshadowed by the message and emotion this show conveyed and brought out of me.

Sometimes the best way of getting over it is diving right back in.

How are you still alive?
>> ARTICLE
Didn't realize there was a rewatch, but I rewatched the first to episodes so I could join in on the fun.  I did not remember the show having this strong a start, it was hard not to watch ahead.  THe interactions between Watari and Kaori are a bit strange for a second time watcher.  I decided to watch the dub, which is pretty solid so far, I like the job Watari's VA is doing a lot.  Looking forward to continuing to rewatch this one.
>> ARTICLE
I missed the thread yesterday, so I'll just watch two episodes today.

..I really don't want to do this again but at least I get to hear Hikaru Nara again.
Also trying the dub since I originally watched subbed.
>> ARTICLE
I love how each time I see a thread about Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso(well since the rewatch started a few days ago) I feel this pain in my chest like when I finished watching the series. This has got to be one of, if not THE, anime that had the biggest emotional impact on me since I started watching anime. I'll just have to continue being a masochist and read all the other threads in the future I guess. 
>> ARTICLE
Mr. Kazama is a great guy, not ignoring the flaws but appreciating the great parts is a good way to appreciate an artist. 

Oh, woops, nevermind, not anymore based on that reaction to Kaori's playing. The tempo and dynamics were definitely completely different, but why does he think she was ignoring the pianist? To me it sounded a lot more like she was playing off of the piano accompaniment rather than just doing her part while the pianist did hers. But the changes she made, it really wasn't the 9th at all anymore the way she was playing it. 

He told her that Watari was at practice when he knew Watari was skipping practice! That's another lie! There's gonna be a lie in every episode isn't there?!

I feel like this "I'm just friend A" thing is having a negative impact on his psyche. 
>> ARTICLE
I've heard from various people that while being a musician can give you an additional level of appreciation for the series, it can also have a negative impact because you can kinda understand that it takes a "tell, don't show" approach to depicting their performances. So you'll have 14 year olds playing at a professional level while a third party narrates what they're supposedly doing right/wrong. The layman will just nod along and think, "Well, they must know what they're talking about even though it sounds great to me..."
>> ARTICLE
Well the premise of the show works *because* they are 14 year olds who can play at a professional level. Kousei is widely known in the classical world as a child prodigy, not your average kid. Same applies to the others but we'll get to that in later episodes.

Expect low sales personally, Japan when it comes down to anime like this might break under the 2,999 line. But personally I really think there just trying to skyrocket manga sales for the final chapter coming out soon. 

But this is speculation and merely on the looks on quite a competitive season so take it as hear-say and wait for the actual results.

The sales posts on /r/anime are mostly handled by me and I usually don't post them if there isn't anything interesting like the last 2 weeks where the only thing worth noting was the Garo sales.

It's got everything in it that you hear in the anime. Ofc the tracks are TV soundtrack length, ie. between 1:30 and 3:00, but thankfully more towards the latter. (Except for ENA's four full-length songs.)

Aka great desktop backgrounds.

OP1 for Shigatsu is really my favorite OP of all time. I love the song and the pastel watercolor look. I'm a sucker for pastel watercolor. And as far as I'm concerned the show itself is a masterpiece at this point.
>> ARTICLE
I watch this show for the music and the art, but sometimes the comedic breaks and the /r/im14andthisisdeep dialogue make it quite hard. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd be so happy if this show had ended up as a melodramatic, edgy depression + identity thru music show rather than the silly comedy that annoys me much more than it makes me laugh. It offers so much only to throw it away with every one of those dump slapstick stints. 
>> ARTICLE
The comedic breaks make me cringe at how horribly they're thrown in. it's like the writers were afraid of causing dem feelz so they suddenly interrupt with a completely different art style, music, and tones of voices for 5 seconds and go back to dem feelz. And everyone cries. Like, come on. Crying is to be saved for very few scenes where the characters truly break down or just let it all out. Stop going back and forth between crying and lame slapstick comedy. We want dem feelz this April, so goddamnit it give it to us!
>> ARTICLE
I dunno...  I found it very realistic for that reason.   [Spoiler] (/s "People who are actually coping with things like dying of an illness tend to have their moods swing quite dramatically, especially with humor.")  And it's not like 14 year old are emotionally stable to begin with.

It may not be "dramatically appropriate", but I've found Kaori's reactions to be so close to my own when in that situation that the series is actually very difficult for me to watch.  But I still do.  Because it's fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's the way the mangaka doesn't want things to remain too dour for a story about middle school kids. As people have mentioned, they aren't even in high school yet. It worked out better in the manga where characters don't yell on top of their lungs like in the anime though. But I don't consider it to be a fatal flaw. Though as for other dramatic music shows go, I think Nodame Cantabile had a smoother transition between comedy and drama. Then again, Nodame wasn't centered around a terminal illness.


>> ARTICLE
> It worked out better in the manga where characters don't yell on top of their lungs like in the anime though.

This style of humor also works far better in manga because of the way manga reads. The way it's sense of time is different and how you control the pacing. You can have short gag lines and panels inbetween serious moments without really affecting the emotion of the scene, but it doesn't work very well in anime. 
>> ARTICLE
>and the /r/im14andthisisdeep dialogue make it quite hard

examples? I'm watching the show and I don't feel this way at all. I think they actually have real problems that could happen in real life to real people, even though they are highschoolers; and the dialogue is quite normal, I never find myself saying "holy shit that was cheesy" or something similar.
>> ARTICLE
Well they're in middle school so. I don't think the post above discredits their problems and dismisses them. It's probably just the sub translations that make a lot of the dialogue seem melodramatic. Plus every episode someone cries. I know they have problems and they have every right to but the show does it too much meaning the emotional impact wouldn't be as hard in the final episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Idk, I remember my sister in middle school crying damn near every day. Hormones are a bitch. 
>> ARTICLE
Blue Spring Ride did something similar too.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking about watching that anime. Is it worth the tiem of someone who likes more emotional romances without a crapton of comedy or fanservice?
>> ARTICLE
Great show, actual good moments between the main couple without the "sudden interruptions", ending could have been better. Had fun watching, also I still listen to the OP now and then.
>> ARTICLE
I think you will especially enjoy it if you don't want out-of-place comedy nor fan service. It tells a gentle story, and sometimes that's all I need.
>> ARTICLE
A gentle story... That sounds soo nice right now. I've had it sitting on my HDD for a fwe months just waiting. I think I'll pause One Week Friends and watch it.
>> ARTICLE
One Week Friends is pretty sweet too. I think I watched those two immediately one after the other.
>> ARTICLE
I loved it. It's a truly gorgeous show. There's a fair bit of comedy, but the romance is at the center. What's unfortunate is that it definitely feels like there's more to tell (as evidenced by the number of chapters the manga has and by how many have been adapted), but who knows if there will be more episodes of  the anime. The soundtrack is excellent too.
>> ARTICLE
There's certainly more to tell, and for some it may have ended without some closure. I don't think they will make a season 2, but the manga just ended and it was beautiful.

Offtopic:  is gfycat loading like crap for anyone else? Stuff used to load near instantaneously for me since the site existed, now it's like I'm waiting for a regular gif on imgur to load.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it makes sense that it has been loading slower and slower for you. It's possible that their connection to you may be slower but let me put out an alternate theory:

In the beginning, people just uploaded their existing gifs to gfycat. No one had been making 30MB gifs, since those would take too long for people to load. So they uploaded their 2-6MB gifs to the site and got 300k-1MB gfys in return.

Now, people use gfycat with the size reduction in mind. So they will upload large gifs, or videos, with the goal of getting a 2MB-10MB gfycat. I uploaded an 88MB gif this morning.

This sort of reminds me of the minus.com situation back before imgur raised their gif max size above 2MB. People would put their 10MB gifs on minus and, soon enough, everyone complained about how slow Minus was. Well, no shit, the gifs were 5 times bigger.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic gif. I just wished that there could have been music with it...

Yaaay great to see soemone loving them as much as I do ! 

I first noticed that kind of artowrks during Gin no Saji's ending a few seasons ago:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtSvn2cSIw8

Both anime are done by A1-Pictures so i'm pretty sure the same person in behind them and I looooove it !
Also both the Gin no Saji and Shigatsu songs are done by Goose House, nice little coincidence.

And talking of A1-Picture, take a look at the latest ending of Aldnoah Zero :

>> ARTICLE
Actually, the comedy is only placed between the less heavy scenes and never interrupts the real drama. Without the balance of comedy, the entire show would be a little too melodramatic in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
One of the complaints about the show that I was unwilling to really accept was Kaori's behavior being "erratic." [She knew](/s "that her time was limited and she couldn't afford to take it easy on him"). It's especially easier to see the second time around.

This show doesn't get as much credit as it should for rewatch value.
>> ARTICLE
That's why she attacked him in first episode? Nah, don't try to rationalize it like that, it's just the cliched violent tsundere behavior because "people like that, right?", nothing more.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody mentioned it, so I'll be the first one. 

I love how they picked Twinkle Twinkle to be tune for this episode. It's the first time we see adolescent Kousei playing the piano and it's one of the first melodies I was tought when I started to play the piano. From what I know, it's one of the first melodies everyone is being tought. Shows how Kaori will teach Kousei the piano again, so to speak. 

Also, Kousei, you're at a waffles place, of course it's a date.... 

Edit: I bet Kaori knew the piano inside was not a prop. That's why she picked that place. 
End of edit. 


Yesterday someone mentioned a theory of sakura petals being a metaphor for Kaori's influence on Kousei's life. I guess, this episodes really confirms that. Any moment connected with Kaori had petals in it and when he starts to think about taking up piano again, they appear again. Aaaaaaall the time. Well spotted Sir (whoever you are)
>> ARTICLE
Wow, good point.  She probably picked the place on purpose.
>> ARTICLE
Hey it's so nice to read a musician's input. My hobby is photography so that's why I am obsessed with the visuals and a lot of the other subtext just flies over my head.

I imagine playing Twinkle Twinkle would totally take Kousei back to his roots.
>> ARTICLE
Hah, photog here as well :D 

To compare the whole situation to photography, I'd say it's.... 

Your first camera, the moment you moved from Auto to Shutter mode or Aperture mode and had new possibilities (not M yet, that's too difficult). :D 


>> ARTICLE
Heh my first camera was a superzoom Canon PowerShot SX150. It had a really shitty Auto and Av exposure modes. On the flip side, the M mode only had Shutter speed, Aperture and ISO as variable settings. I just naturally started using M mode to get what I want. I guess you can say I learned to swim in the deep end of the pool. When I first laid my hands on a DSLR it really felt like cheating.
>> ARTICLE
So, you jumped to the second variation (that moment when everyone suddenly started to listen to Kousei).

Also, hello fellow Canon user :D

I've been keeping up with these discussions. Im sorry guys. I can't bring myself to watch this amazing show again. It literally stuck with me for a month after I watched it through the first time. However I will always be here lurking.

**Episode 3: Inside Spring**

I love, love, LOVE this episode. The first half with their "substitute date" is one of my favorite moments from the entire series.

* It's interesting to see their differing views of the cafe piano representing their personalities, with Kaori seeing a happy piano because it's decorated with love while Kousei takes a more cold and clinical approach, criticizing it for not being maintained correctly. This can be seen as one of many examples of Kousei's emotional repression.

* [Angry-face Kaori isn't letting Kousei wallow in self pity.](http://i.imgur.com/KyYswT5.png) Some people need a good kick in the rear to get them out of a rut, and you're never going to grow if you stay inside your comfort zone.

* Some people have mentioned that they believe Kaori knew about Kousei's "tone deafness" prior to meeting him [spoiler](/s "and her plan from the beginning had been to help Kousei through it,") but I feel like she exhibits [genuine surprise](http://i.imgur.com/MaXY5AI.png) at his inability to play in [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/BB4PgRI.png).

* [Kitty! Twelve o'clock!](http://i.imgur.com/xMYKY3p.png) :3

* ["Life is a series of moments, and you love them all."](http://i.imgur.com/yvLqBKZ.png) The lighting in this scene is *magical*.

* ["You exist within springtime. A flourish of life, unlike anything I've ever known."](http://i.imgur.com/fMSq5jo.png)

* [Who throws a shoe, honestly!?](http://i.imgur.com/CAESHwg.png)

* [Home Ec Tsubaki looking adorable as usual.](http://i.imgur.com/geP7wzX.png) The holes in her goggles kinda made it look like she had freckles, and that made me realize that I don't think I've ever seen an anime girl who had freckles. Huh.

* [Our first glimpse of Lil' Tsubaki being even more adorable.](http://i.imgur.com/A41vcU5.png)

* It's obvious that Tsubaki cares a great deal about Kousei and wants to help him move on, but not being a musician herself, she hasn't been able to be there for him in the way he needs, and that eats her up. [As a result, her life has been on hold as much as Kousei's has.](http://i.imgur.com/zo5bHMD.png)

* [Attention all passengers, welcome aboard the feels train. We'll be departing momentarily.](http://i.imgur.com/0jrhefJ.png) [spoilers](/s "Here we have our first death flag of the series. Watchers of the subbed version may miss it if they aren't quick readers, but after Tsubaki gets off the bus, Kaori signals for it to stop at the hospital.") :(

* Dammit Kousei, you butt! Making Kaori chase you all week and then forcing her to run all around the school looking for you on the day of the competition... [spoiler](/s "I know it's jokingly alluded to in episode 5, but it's entirely probable that her visible exhaustion caused her collapse after the concert and she wouldn't have passed out otherwise. This is one of my many 'What if Kousei hadn't been such an idiot' moments.")

* [Kaori uses Crane Style. It's super effective!](http://i.imgur.com/iivD4cK.png)

* ["You don't know how close I am right now to just losing heart!"](http://i.imgur.com/bPBkmlN.png) This scene really hits me. [spoiler](/s "On my first viewing, I simply thought Kaori was talking about her nerves and needed Kousei's support. In truth, everything Kaori has lived for for the last 9 years, everything she's done, has been to play beside Kousei on stage. This is her one and - in all likelihood, as far as she suspects - ONLY chance to make that dream a reality before she dies, and Kousei is refusing to do it after avoiding her all week. Being that playing beside Kousei has been what she's clung to in order to go on every day, she's literally on the verge of losing heart and simply collapsing into fear and depression.") This is also the first of few times that we see Kaori's upbeat facade slip and she shows genuine vulnerability.

* I love the symbolism of Kousei [stepping out of the shadows and joining Kaori in the light.](http://i.imgur.com/I5bsUYA.png)

* It's time for MAXIMUM EFFORT, Kousei! [The lady is counting on you.](http://i.imgur.com/7wJ4dHP.png)

Good point. It's pretty apparent that strenuous activity really takes a toll on her.

Ha, you've been sitting on this comment since yesterday, haven't you?

I have to say, I much prefer home ec Kaori to home ec Tsubaki, especially the way she plays with her spatula.

What viewer are you using with the black bars in each screenshot?

[re:3rd to last bullet](/s "Excellent observation on Kaori's request.")
>> ARTICLE
agreed, excellent point.  i havent thought of that even on my 3rd watch.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, just for a couple hours. I watch the episode about 2 hours early, taking screencaps and jotting down notes as I go, then throw it all together and format it properly so I can get it posted soon after the thread goes up.

I'm just using Netflix on an iPad for the screencaps. If I was less lazy, I'd launch it on my PS4 so it wouldn't get the black bars, but then I'd have the extra step of having to transfer everything to a USB stick and move it to a laptop for upload.

Since you wrote up a nice summary of most of my points I'll continue off your post.

* [I am getting very indulged by all of the close-up shots in this anime.](http://imgur.com/a/m8YlP) 

From a cinematographic standpoint, these kinds of shots invoke a deep sense of intimacy and closeness. Because the scenes in the sweets locale are done in first person they give me the vibe that I'm actually there behind Kousei's and Kaori's eyes. In my opinion this is one of the many artistic tricks used often in this show to bring out ***the feels.***

* [Kousei is a cat person :)](http://imgur.com/IbCPlCg)

This is the same cat mentioned [in my Ep01 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4f9hsq/rewatch_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_your_lie_in_april/d27c8ln). [This shot](http://imgur.com/451xxDq) seems to hint at the possible nature of the cat in the overall narrative.

[The interplay between their words](http://imgur.com/AGwOG8I), [and what's happening onscreen](http://imgur.com/MY2bR2t) [is so obvious when rewatching](http://imgur.com/Cg4UONe), but the directing is so good that even if you're a first time viewer you will unconsciously connect the dots.

[Spoilers](/s "This kitten is a symbol of Kousei's crippling insecurity in the visual storytelling throughout the whole show. In this episode, we see how Kousei "is feeding his depression." After his misshap with the piano he literally goes out and feeds the cat. Notice then, how Kaori literally picks up and tightly clutches the kitten. It directly implies that she's doing the same thing with Kousei's depression.")

* [Kaori's looking a bit nervous about this](http://imgur.com/zhCztQ6)

Notice the cat badge. See how that ties in with my previous point.
>> ARTICLE
wow, nice job deciphering the symbolism.  it seems to be deeper than i thought
>> ARTICLE
Rewatching this, I'm starting to see that cat everywhere.

* In Episode 1, in the cold opening as you already pointed out

* In the OP, the cat is plainly seen lying on a piano and standing in front of some sheet notes [YLiA Spoilers](/s "Symbolizing how his insecurities and regret are preventing him from playing."), and is plainly seen again on the beach surrounded by fireflies. [Bigass Spoilers](/s "The cat here is intended to represent Kousei, and the footprints representing Kaori briefly passing through his life").

* In the OP, Kaori has a cat keychain on her bag

* Also in the OP, Young-Tsubaki has a cat on her shirt

* In Episode 1: Kaori's violin case has a sticker of a cat, and another that reads "POPCATS"

* At the end of Episode 2 we get a better look at the cat keychain on Kaori's bag. It has a small heart on it.

* In Episode 3: The cat appears to Kousei, but this one has green eyes and speaks to him.

On an unrelated note: While skimming through these first episodes I noticed Tsubaki's shirt reads I <3 <fish>. I don't think there is any symbolic meaning there, but it would be pretty damn hilarious if we could find some.
>> ARTICLE
> On an unrelated note: While skimming through these first episodes I noticed Tsubaki's shirt reads I <3 <fish>. I don't think there is any symbolic meaning there, but it would be pretty damn hilarious if we could find some.

Maybe she's just a gay fish?
>> ARTICLE
Nice analysis man. I hadn't considered the symbolism of the cat and Kaori. I just saw it as [spoiler](/s "a reminder of Kousei's regret for not standing up to his mother and his perception of himself as a puppet of hers.")

And dang, I gotta switch up my screencap method and get rid of those black bars. Each frame of this show could practically be a wallpaper on its own.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I just want to say that episode 3 and 4 are two of my favorite episodes. I want to point out a few things that make them so:

* The way Koari touches Kousei's heart at the end of this.. is absolutely incredible. It really syncs with me because of some past experiences that allow me to relate to Kousei.

* The park scene is absolutely beautiful.

* The symbolism of the black cat. I won't go into detail about this because I want to get your guys' opinions and ideas before I throw mine out there. 
>> ARTICLE
Huh, something I've noticed this episode that I hadn't previously is that the hands when playing piano are computer generated. Normally I hate seeing characters animated with CG in otherwise 2D shows, but I'm surprised how well it blends in here. I wonder if they used motion capture to make it appear so smooth and lifelike. I only noticed it slip when Kousei recoils from the piano.
>> ARTICLE
You'd be surprised by how much CG imagery there is in shows these days. Most of the time it blends so well with the hand drawn objects we don't even notice. [In this example from The Garden of Words](http://imgur.com/SC1XkFm) the buildings in the foreground are completely CG. In this specific example I think studio Comix Wave made them CG so they can make a seamless camera motion. To go into more detail is spoilers for the movie but you can see my point. Great studios these days can do miracles using both 2D and 3D.
>> ARTICLE
I think they used rotoscoping instead of CGI. They probably filmed a pianist's hands and animated that.
>> ARTICLE
I figured it was either mocap or that. I've tried researching but can't seem to find anything on it. I imagine it was done more for budget reasons than artistic ones, since animating intricate hand movements frame-by-frame would be exhausting and expensive.

EDIT: Still haven't found anything solid but the consensus seems to be rotoscoping. Which is expensive as hell. So A-1 were really shooting for quality here.
>> ARTICLE
Personal notes

* Minor continuity error/for comedic effect: Kousei's piano room has been [covered in dust and scores everywhere in the first episode](http://i.imgur.com/21pUhGJ.jpg), but is [immaculate in this episode](http://i.imgur.com/qD5o9ve.jpg). Now we might be able to chalk this up to Tsubaki cleaning his room for him, but in a few episodes it goes right back to [looking like it hasn't been touched in years (minor ep6 spoiler in this screenshot).](http://i.imgur.com/KajTsPc.jpg) This discontinuity is also present in the manga.
* Kaori went very quickly from drop kicking Kousei to confidently asserting her reason for existence to begging him to play piano with him in tears. [All series / Coda chapter 5 spoilers](/s "Coda chapter 5 (and I think either ep22 or the OVA but I can't find the scene) confirms that Kaori has wanted Kousei to play the piano with her violin ever since she was 5 years old. Seeing Kousei's first competitive performance is what convinced Kaori to take up the violin, all for the sake of having a duet together with him.") No, really, go read Coda if you've finished the series. It gives so much closure on the story.
* As soon as Kousei agrees, Tsubaki and Watari comedic relief the entire place up by bursting through the door. These rapid tonal shifts will continue as the series goes on, so don't be too surprised going forward.
* The music track at the end of the episode (Boku no Sunde...) is tied with the one that ended the first episode (Watashi, Violinist na no) as my favorite in the series. Expect the track that came before the commercial break (Yuujin A-kun wo...) to appear more often during emotionally critical scenes as well.
* [All spoilers](/s "Reading the old discussion threads, it's all death-flag this, death-flag that. In my opinion, it's not a death flag so much as foreshadowing, so viewers aren't completely blindsided by Kaori having a terminal illness. How else would the author introduce the central conflict of the latter half of the series?")

I totally noticed that too though. :p

EDIT: In regards to your last bullet, I honesly feel that this series is one where knowing the "twist" (if you can even call it that) doesn't really affect the emotional impact. I'll still spoiler warning it just because but [spoiler](/s "knowing that Kaori is probably going to die well ahead of the actual ending in a way puts the viewer in Kousei's shoes. He's not an idiot. He's seen all this before with his mother. Kousei spends the entire second half of the series in a depression because he knows what's coming. At the same time, he's desperately clinging to the faint hope that she'll pull through and everything will work out. Just like the viewer. If anything, I think that slow burn of dread mixed with anticipation and hope gives it even more impact.")
>> ARTICLE
I personally really liked how Kaori decided to go formal about asking Kousei to do the accompaniment. I think that instead of forcing him to go along like she usually does/would, seriously asking would be a much better choice. 

Also, I know this show is sad and now I can see where it's going. she got off the bus at the hospital.
>> ARTICLE
spoilers bro spoilers
>> ARTICLE
Is it spoilers? I personally don't really think so. If you say that it is then I'll mark it but I haven't seen the series. All of that was just in the episode.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, i guess it really isnt
>> ARTICLE
Yeah if anything, somebody calling "spoilers" on a purely speculative comment by someone who hasn't seen the series only confirms it, making them the spoilee. 
>> ARTICLE
yep, i just realized that when he replied
>> ARTICLE
This episode we are shown a glimpse of how Kaori has fears and insecurities of her own. I've seen some people compare Kaori with Kanima, but this is where they are fundamentally different, Kaori overcomes her fears while Kanima is fearless.
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher here. Through these first episodes, I can't help but get this feeling that this seems a bit more like your typical above average romance anime. Conventional seeming plot and all. Am very hyped for watching more though. I've heard great things.
>> ARTICLE
TBH I'm just expecting tragedy. He starts off traumatized and he's already gradually getting better, gotta knock him down for good TV.
>> ARTICLE
The song that plays during the rooftop scene towards the end is called [Watashi no Uso](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kPvJ3ThA6ZI) and is one of my favorite tracks off the OST. 

Edit: Turns out it's a different but very similar track. I still like Watashi though. 
>> ARTICLE
agreed.  great track.
>> ARTICLE
Are you sure it's not [Kujikesou ni Naru Watashi wo Sasaete Kudasai?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ultDedZdUD0)
>> ARTICLE
they sound similar, but I think this is the correct one
>> ARTICLE
Eh, not sure honestly. I listened to both and they sound very similar and they use the exact same melody in certain instances. 

Edit: Just checked and it is indeed the one you linked. 
>> ARTICLE
First timer:

I like the rooftop / crocodile tears scene. Very interested to see if they'll kill it!
>> ARTICLE
Crocodile tears? mmmmm maybe not
>> ARTICLE
They maybe weren't fake but I don't know where the tears came from.
>> ARTICLE
Without spoiling too much, it was very, very important to Kaori that Kousei be her accompanist and his continual refusal to do so was seriously f-ing with her emotional stability. Those tears were essentially Kousei's first glimpse of the *real* Kaori.
>> ARTICLE
first timer, you'll understand later.
>> ARTICLE
Something I noticed about this show. The use of weather and lighting is really good. Everytime Kousei sees Kaorin, there are flower pellets EVERYWHERE. Thus, in his eyes, she lives in spring. And when the going gets rough it rains. They really got the weird feeling of first love. This episode was great.

The hospital was a bit foreboding. I'm thinking Kaori has someone in that hospital. Also, is Kousei going deaf? That would suck.
>> ARTICLE
> Also, is Kousei going deaf?

The problem isn't in his ears. It's in his head, stemming from a past emotional trauma. I'm not sure if saying any more would be getting into spoiler territory, but you'll get an idea of what's going on there within an episode or two.
>> ARTICLE
I know that it's his trauma. But it's kinda omnious. I can't help but think something is off.
>> ARTICLE
This has a rewatch?..... Fuck thanks Reddit now I'm gonna get feels....... AGAIN

Hello darkness, my old friend...
>> ARTICLE
I just wanted to point out that having the names of future episodes may very well be a spoiler in itself.

Doesn't take someone with a sharp eye too much effort to guess what's coming next.
>> ARTICLE
I'd disagree. Some have positive connotations, some have negative connotations, but they're evenly distributed and none of them say exactly what's happening. A first-timer wouldn't be able to glean much about the trajectory of the series from them.
>> ARTICLE
Aww, he's getting back into piano! He's going to play for her! 

I feel like suddenly having to stop playing like what happened to him would be traumatizing. I can't play any instrument very well, and I don't like that but I imagine being great and suddenly losing it has to destructive. 

I wish I could have something to eat like that caramel waffles with apples and nuts. 
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people rated it highly probably because they were able to relate to some part of the show or it made them very emotional. I don't think it will be remembered for a long time to come but hey, guess time will tell.
>> ARTICLE
Or because the end had so much impact it made them forget about how it dragged on around the early middle where kosei wouldn't stop forgetting how music sounds while his mom does her evil laugh in the background. The ending was amazing and I enjoyed it a lot, but the 'forgetting how music sounds' thing got old after the first time it happened. 
>> ARTICLE
My take is that it will go down in history similar to Honey Clover not everyone's cup of tea, but it will go down a bit underrated as time goes on. Right now it's getting a little bit too much "hype"
>> ARTICLE
ehh... i mean based on the genre its competing in it's quite excellent. But, I wasn't exactly moved by the scenes compared to many other animes. Barakamon is something that's underrated with almost no hype and I'd rate it above shigatsu.
>> ARTICLE
Barakamon was one of my favourite animes that aired in 2014. I'm surprised it's not as popular as some of the other ones. It even had a kickass OP like Shigatsu.
>> ARTICLE
lol while barakamon was airing everyone was hyping it up like crazy 
>> ARTICLE
That's a good point. I haven't seen Barakamon but I read only good things. I've been there though there is a good chunk of anime that I know is unappreciated.

Heh, after reading this I checked out MAL's top listings, Gintama 2015 is already 30 and hasn't aired yet. (Love Gintama though).

It was sitting in the top 15 at one point a few weeks ago, believe it or not.
>> ARTICLE
pffft.
>> ARTICLE
Ha, what do you expect from something that holds 4 out of the top 10 spots.
>> ARTICLE
8/10 for me
 
the rating jumping up so highly was the biggest knee-jerk reaction I've seen in a while. 
My biggest gripe was how the side characters became irrelevant after their arcs were over.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say they weren't completely ignored. Although they are *side characters* Arima does acknowledge them for their support in the end, and without them he wouldn't be who he's proud to be. 
>> ARTICLE
I gave the show a 9/10. While the finale is why the show is so highly rated at the moment, it's important to realize that a lot of people rate shows based on how well these shows manipulate their emotions.

I consider myself a stoic and unemotional person, especially when it comes to consuming works of fiction. But even I teared up a bit at Shigatsu's ending, something that hasn't really happened to me before. That is a testament to how well directed the entire show was, **that it was able to make people invested in a character's struggle against her disease and feel emotional about her death. That is the show's greatest triumph, and why I believe that it deserves a high score and all of the accolades that have been dumped on it thus far.**

You can criticize it all you want, and yes, Shigatsu was flawed here and there. But you can't deny that it moved people. Can you remember the last time a show moved you? Personally, I can't. I think Shigatsu is the first show/movie that moved me to the point that I cried. And this is coming from someone who laughs at the idea of crying about fictional characters. I didn't care about Clannad, Anohana, or whatever tearjerky anime people have mentioned in the past as shows that can make grown men cry. But for some reason, Shigatsu had something those other shows didn't have.

Furthermore, it's not like Kaori's death is something out of the ordinary or something ridiculous. Many people have lost a loved one to disease, and perhaps Kaori's death resonated with them as well. Kaori is not just a mere character, she is a symbol of how people can live life to the fullest, even in the face of impending death. And she did. Those sorts of ideas resonate very well with people, make them emotional, and ultimately allow them to give shows that deal with death in such a dignified manner a high score. 

But I don't care about how people feel about Shigatsu. People are entitled to their opinions.
>> ARTICLE
i felt like the foreshadowing of kaori's death was too blatant, obvious and in your face, so when she died i felt nothing, the ending was great regardless though
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, her death still had the impact for me. I disliked the blatant hints, though. I wish they did some of the story from Kaori's perspective, and had her admit the terminal nature of her disease earlier. It would have made her death even more impactful. 
>> ARTICLE
I often cry at fictional stuff, but Shigatsu never did that for me. I teared up a bit at times but that was it. In terms of emotional impact. i think the most recent episode of Shirobako did it much better.
>> ARTICLE
I just can't tear up or cry when I watch anime, which can be frustrating sometimes, but I still agree with this one--episode 23 (the latest) of Shirobako *was* moving, I think, because we have seen this one character struggle and struggle throughout the series finally getting a break, and the catharsis of the [director](/s "storming through the publishing company's building and Mr. "Funny Story" getting his comeuppance") and Miyamori moved to tears--well, it's one of the best episodes of the whole show.

Shigatsu had too many death flags for me to really get invested in Kaori. Plus, the anime was so obviously in love with Kaori as a character that I was kind of put off from really truly loving her character. (Not to mention I had issues with her as a part MPDG). 
>> ARTICLE
Different strokes for different folks. There's nothing wrong with you if you didn't cry about Kaori's death. 

I didn't cry out loud myself, but I did definitely tear up. 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm maybe I'm a weirdo or something because while the show was sad, I definitely wasn't moved to tears. But when I watched [Dennou Coil I cried like a baby over](/s "Densuke.") [Kino no Tabi's](/s "last episode came out of no where and hit me like a god damn truck.") There are plenty of other shows that moved me much more like Beck, Kids on the slope, and Nana if we're going to focus on music shows. But I guess they're all much older shows that I just happened to watch recently. A big problem for me was Shigatsu kept TELLING me rather than showing me, which I found really irritating. Also I just personally didn't think Kaori got enough screen time for me to fall for her. She was still a great character but I wish she had more focus. I loved Tsubaki and Kashiwagi though.  I guess in the end of the day we all have different preferences. Still enjoyed the show but yeah I have it more in the high 7 - low 8 score range. 
>> ARTICLE
I do agree that they could have fleshed out Kaori's character a bit more. I suppose I am stickler for those characters who "live their lives to the fullest in spite of impending death". 

Like I said, it's the show's theme and the overall presentation that clinched it for me. Could it have been better? Of course. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel yea. Not trying to argue or anything. I was really just responding with my own personal list of shows that moved me quite a bit cause I can think of a lot of shows (if you include western shows) that moved me more than Shigatsu. But I understand the appeal of living life to the fullest in spite of death.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand how you could dislike something about a show to the point of finding it straight up irritating and still rate it as highly as a 7 or 8...
>> ARTICLE
I expect the MAL rating will drop with time. It's just post-anime hype that skyrockets the ranking. The same thing happened with No Game No Life last year. I think it peaked around #15 after it ended, and is now sitting at #56.

It moved me enough to buy this N3DS XL decal of it >_>

>> ARTICLE
It was one of 3 animes that I gave a 10. 

However, I'm quite biased and I tend to rate some of the emotional roller coasters really high.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to be giving it either an 8 or a 7. I haven't decided yet. If I do give it an 8 it'll be because of the music side of the story.
>> ARTICLE
Why do so many people hate on it for being so high up in rank? Saying it doesn't deserve to be there is like saying opinions are facts lol
>> ARTICLE
Not an instant classic, but still well above average. 

KimiUso is a fantastic series when it isnt busy shooting itself in the foot with awkward direction & overdone (and outright repetitive) monologues,but i feel like a lot of people are going to harp on about those and give it the SAO treatment. 

So i guess like a 7-8/10? i havent seen the last 2 eps though so maybe it ended horribly.
>> ARTICLE
The ending is one of the strongest points of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
would definitely recommend you watch the finale. it's very well done.
>> ARTICLE
I gave it an 8. I really, really enjoyed it, but there were a lot of parts that I didn't like. I didn't like how the mother was such an abusive parent only to be turned into a heroine all of the sudden with just a scene where she cries and says she is doing it as a favor for the kid. Sorry but that didn't sit well with me, abuse is abuse, no matter the circumstances. I was glad to see Kousei finally get over the trauma, I just didn't like how it was accomplished by trying to excuse his Mother's shitty fucking parenting.

I liked the art a lot, but I wasn't crazy about the lips. It made all the characters just look really weird. That's pretty much the only thing I didn't like about the art in the show, everything else was gorgeous.

I would have liked if the characters were a little older. Maybe I'm just an old fart but seeing kids in Junior High being so mature and having so much drama makes it hard for me to take serious a little. But that's just my personal view on that, others I'm sure will disagree. A lot of times I just keep thinking "That's not how a 14 year old acts"
>> ARTICLE
I keep reading in threads how people think it's only rated high because it "manipulates emotion". I'm sorry but isn't that what TV is supposed to do> illicit some emotional reaction? That's what makes Anime so much better than real TV for the most part, the emotions and connections you get with a lot of characters, even in a fantasy world.

This anime did just about everything right. You laughed, cried, cheered throughout most of it. It kept you coming back for more because you got so emotionally invested in at least 1 character. You felt that this show could relate to a part of you and your life in some way.

Yea, there may have been some flaws, but as with anything created by flawed beings, there will always be flaws. I think to expect perfection in every aspect is naive and stupid, considering you don't expect the person creating it to be perfect.

This anime easily goes into my top 5. 10/10 for me because the flaws are not big enough flaws worth losing the point over.

In a nutshell: too melodramatic to the extent of feeling forced, no subtlety: death flags by the dozen since ep1, cringeworthy dialogues: im 14 and this is deep, horrible character development, bad pacing. Only redeeming thing imo was art.

I rated it a 10/10 too...lynch me now!
>> ARTICLE
Well there's nothing fundamentally wrong with that, but it would be nice to know why you think the show deserves a perfect score. 
>> ARTICLE
I rate on an enjoyment level, personally. If I enjoy every aspect of a show it's a 10/10, even if people mention things that they think were bad about it. 

I rated shows a 10/10 that most people probably wouldn't just because I really enjoyed them. K-ON for example.
>> ARTICLE
That's the best and only way to judge entertainment. I believe ratings should be based on one's emotional response and not some intellectual criteria. If all that was needed to rate a perfect response from the audience was to tick off the items on a checklist then every show would be identical. Besides, numerical scores are generally a rubbish way to judge anything anyway so I generally just ignore them.

Personally I didn't think the series was perfect since I realised from episode 1 or 2 how it would end which felt a little manipulative, but I looked forward to it each week and still teared up at the end, so I consider it an excellent series. If I absolutely had to give it a score it would be 9/10.
>> ARTICLE
You and me both.

We aren't critics, we don't adhere to the same rating scale as them. We're the consumers in this equation, it only makes sense to rate on enjoyment as opposed to being super critical in our rating.

It's not like we took notes while watching to give a critical review of it anyways.
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion, people over think these things. When it comes time for me to rate a show, I just go with my gut. I think about how much I enjoyed the show overall, how much I looked forward to watching the next episode, and how I believe it affected me. Then I just say "eh, that felt like a (insert score) I guess."  

I'm the only one who really cares how I rate a show, anyway. Numbered scoring systems for art are flawed as it is, so I'm not about to pretend I'm a professional critic with some long-winded pseudo-intellectual analysis to defend a score. 

I gave it a 10, despite its flaws, because "Eh, it felt like a ten." Nothing is truly perfect, anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, I loved it. Loved every episode. 

The music part for me was amazing, didn't mind the monologues, I actually liked them. 

The animation is 10/10, every background was beautiful with a meaning. 

The characters Kousei, Nagi and Kaori were fantastic, especially Kaorii in the last two episodes hit me too hard cause I could relate. 

Yea I know the show has some stuff some people don't like like they didn't care about Watari or the comedic stuff that break the series moments, but these stuff didn't affect me at all. 

Everyone have different tastes, likes. 
If we all are the same everything would be boring. 

Cheers.

The background art was definitely pretty, but the animation was sub par a lot of the time. Cardboard cutouts being moved up and down with little to no actual animation, QUALITY character art on a still that lasts way longer than necesary, etc. 

It might've looked pretty overall, but the *animation* part definitely wasn't good. Some nice moments here and there though.

I gave the show a 10, but I completely agree with your verdict on the poor animation.

7/10. Solid, but not great. Outstanding for its genre, kinda overwritten, playing with interesting aesthetics. Several redundant, underused characters. 

MAL's top rankings are basically just a punchline to me, I don't really care about how high or low the show is. 
>> ARTICLE
I went with this, but I would have rated it a 6.5 if we did halfs. I agree with you on most of those points, but I don't see the 'redundant' characters (underused yes, slightly annoying, also yes).

My biggest dislike was not so much the characters as the continually repeated monologue and lengthy monologue during the piano scenes. 

"Hibike, Hibike, Hibike" all the characters say, talking over the piano.

'Shut the hell up and let me listen to the music' I say. 

That is just one example- probably the first one that really bothered me in the show. I don't mind them talking over the piano a little to say what the characters are thinking since it is a story-telling show rather than just animated music, but when they all repeat the same thing over and over or talk for more than a sentence or two in 30 seconds I get a bit annoyed.
>> ARTICLE
> but I don't see the 'redundant' characters

Nagi was basically a weird amalgamation Kousei and Tsubaki; While I think she actually ended up surprisingly well-articulated, I also think you could have cut her out of the show entirely with no problem. Same thing goes for Tsubaki's friend from school, who probably could have been replaced with Watari to actually give him something relevant to do. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll agree with the Watari/Tsubaki's friend thing (although I think this might be to keep us from thinking that Watari likes Tsubaki- i.e. keep the relationships separate), but Nagi is important because she is his student- She helps him keep playing piano when [Violin girl who's name I cant remember at the moment] cannot play with him (although I agree she could have been written a little more distinctively).

I think that /u/__U_WOT_M8__ [was pretty spot on in his criticism on the show](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2zsygs/spoilers_a_slightly_salty_review_of_shigatsu_wa/), even if I feel that he was a bit harsh on it.

Point is, the show never lets up in aggressively making you *feel* and it is not even remotely subtle about it. A lot of people fall for that and lose their objective eye. 

The show also suffers from inconsistent characterisation, lack of focus and some bad exposition. 

Counter to that, it has a great OST, boosted by wonderful classical music and there is also some stunning imagery. 

Ultimately, I feel it's a slightly better and slightly more subtle version of AnoHana, but with music. 

I'd give it a 8/10 because I'm a sucker for music anime, but it'll probably get lowered to 7/10 over time: the true score I feel lies somewhere in between.

> I feel it's a slightly better and slightly more subtle version of AnoHana

I'd disagree because Anohana succeeded in it's objective to make me feel; KimiUso not so much.
>> ARTICLE
Anohana explored the story and characters better and more in-depth than KimiUso. 

You can say they both had inevitable endings, but Anohana paced the story to that point where it was incredibly bittersweet. KimiUso felt rushed in that regard and I just felt a little sad if anything.
>> ARTICLE
Also I don't understand how KimiUso is more subtle than Anohana when they've been waving Kaori's death flag since episode 5-6 ish over and over and over and over again. 

If Anohana isn't subtle for having the main characters just let go of their past and have a bawling session, KimiUso isn't that much better with its blatant "omg prepur 4 feelz" death flag shenanigans. 
>> ARTICLE
They hadn't been waving any death flags for a long time; she was dying, it was part of the plot. I feel like calling them death flags implies something that wasn't there. The only reason it wouldn't be very apparent she was going to die is if you tried to get too meta about it and didn't accept what was in front of you.

It was a plot point that was worked around for a large portion of the show.
>> ARTICLE
AnoHana was about as subtle as a brick wall. That ending scene where they cried for what felt like 15 minutes straight did nothing but make me cringe. Well... that's not exactly true, it managed to ruin Secret Base for me, I song I loved before that. 

I feel KimiUso succeeded slightly better at using the potential of the show. 

AnoHana had a great premise, but butchered it. I mean, you have 5 people who are all grieving a loss. They could have made the show great by diversifying characters' way of dealing with that loss (guilt, acceptation, love, hollowness, etc.) and make it a heartfelt examination of what it means to lose someone close to you and how tough it is to move on from that. 

Instead, they made four of the five all fall in love with eachother and the dead girl, and the only one who didn't, the most interesting character, got the least amount of screentime. It was a total waste and the show became a mess. 

KimiUso at least had some thematic weight in its imagery, AnoHana was just blatant manipulation in a mess of a plot. 

Of course, this is all opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I didn't mean to imply Anohana was more subtle. Nor do I think it needed to be, because as I said, it succeeded in making me feel something where KimiUso did not.

Just saying I disagree that KimiUso did it better is all, based on my experiences with the two.
>> ARTICLE
It's a funny thing, isn't it? Sometimes it works on us, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes we recognize the quality of a show and don't feel anything, sometimes we fall for the cheapest tricks in the book.

It's why I try to factor how much I like a show as less as I can when deciding on a score. My feelings are unreliable, but my mind isn't. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, for me, since anime is an entertainment medium I generally score based on my feelings and later use my mind to try and justify that score. 
>> ARTICLE
It's fine too, rating something high just because you enjoyed it a lot. Being methodical and trying to rate everything "properly" isn't the only way to go.
>> ARTICLE
For me, that's too conflicting. In the end, I'll be more generous with awarding points to anime I like anyway, so it balances itself out somewhat. 

Then again, my way of coming up with a score is probably way too complicated :P
>> ARTICLE
> A lot of people fall for that and lose their objective eye.

I don't really think this is fair. If the show is engaging to the point that it causes you to lose a real sense of objectivity consistently, is it not succeeding? You can say objectively that things like animation quality aren't good or there's a bad ratio of dialogue to actual plot progression. Regardless for that if the show can succeed in the goal of making you feel something or relate to it's message aren't those things largely irrelevant? Was Ping Pong the animation bad because it's animation wasn't as clean as Attack on Titan?

Being a critic for the sake of being a critic is something I see virtually no merit in. That's what your statement felt like to me. Not to imply the show is without flaws, but it's not like there's some rubric the writers of the show had to adhere to when it was made. There are many different ways to present a story and ultimately I think what should be important is the end results.
>> ARTICLE
You're kinda missing the point I'm trying to make. 

Let me put it this way: suppose one isn't grabbed emotionally by the show. What's left to keep them interested? Not hooked, interested. Furthermore, does the playing on the heartstrings backfire when it doesn't have the intended effect?

Kimi no Uso set up its attempt at emotional engagement so aggressively and bluntly that it became grating for those who weren't wholly invested in it. Aside from that, there wasn't really that good of a ground work to fall back on in case it didn't succeed. 
The show was really actively trying to get you to *feel* along with it and if you didn't fall for that, the show had too little to offer. 

In other words, Kimi no Uso was a full-on attack, a Hail Mary play, if you will: aggressive, full-on assault with no subtlety. It hedged all its bets on making you feel, but should it fail there, there was a defence full of holes in the back. A great, solid team shouldn't have to make plays like that. A great, solid team wins the match by being good on all fronts. 

Likewise, a great, solid show wins you over by meticulously crafting rounded characters, by writing consistent and engaging dialogue and by perfectly pacing and constructing a plot with highs and lows, 'fasts and slows'.

A great, solid show shines everywhere, from the quiet moments, to the crying moments. Kimi no Uso did not. It's lacking for all those who were not swept up in the emotions and that's where it fails as a show. 
>> ARTICLE
No, I wasn't missing your point, I was telling you your point was wrong. And to be fair, I was correct, this argument isn't the same as the one you previously made. I think this is probably what you intended to convey, but you didn't articulate it well enough to be understood.

Nonetheless, even after you've rewritten it I don't agree with you. What you've described is a large list of means, I'm concerned with ends. You're detailing things that someone writes about in an essay or when being critical, which for the most part is what we're doing here to try and describe a show. However my point here has been that your description of what makes a show good is flawed. Your explanation was self contradictory.

If I watch a show that aggressively makes me feel, it's probably a fantastic show because to make me feel it has to impact me. Which is great, so long as that feeling is not disdain. Happiness, sadness, laughter etc. there are myriad emotions that I would be delighted
 to have impressed upon me by a series. 

You said:

> never lets up in aggressively making you feel and it is not even remotely subtle about it

That's immensely huge praise in every conceivable way. Subtlety is not intrinsically good, it can be used in great ways, but it is not in and of itself a positive thing. It's like saying the plot doesn't have an anti-hero. It doesn't by itself make the plot better or worse. I will point out that Nichijou is generally extremely well received i.e. many people agree it's a great show. It does so without a majority of the conditions you've implied are necessary. Anime is simply a medium, there's no checklist for how stories can be told. If anything, I'd say you've failed as much as a viewer as it has as a show. By expecting the show to be handled in specific ways you've boxed yourself out of a story that a majority of responding viewers enjoyed greatly.

> I think this is probably what you intended to convey, but you didn't articulate it well enough to be understood.

Fair enough, I see I could have put it better. 

> However my point here has been that your description of what makes a show good is flawed. Your explanation was self contradictory.

How so? Is it inherently flawed, or flawed as in different from how other people might describe it? Because those are two very different things.

> If I watch a show that aggressively makes me feel, it's probably a fantastic show because to make me feel it has to impact me. Which is great, so long as that feeling is not disdain. Happiness, sadness, laughter etc. there are myriad emotions that I would be delighted to have impressed upon me by a series.

And that's where you lose me. It's great that *you* feel something by watching the show, but that is in your case. The show **tries** very hard to make you feel stuff, but whether or not it succeeds depends on the person watching. 

If it succeeds, like with you, then it's understandable to give a higher rating. But if the show fails at that, like it did with me to a certain extent, then the show's approach backfires. The monologues start to grate, the inconsistent characters start to frustrate, the repetition grows stale. 

So ultimately, the show lives or dies by that emotional response of the viewer. It goes for broke, it's all-or-nothing. And I feel that a really good show does not need that, because it can elicit that emotional response in ways that are less likely to backfire and can even hold its own without it: thus the show will have a higher succes rate of people liking it. That is the benefit of subtlety and why it is a virtue for a show. 

Kimi no Uso 'chose' the more heavyhanded approach: that is, indeed, a choice for telling a story and whether it was right or wrong is ultimately determined by the response of the viewer. But it *does* mean that it will lose points, respect, appreciation, whatever you want to call it, in my book, simply because it is by far the easier choice.   

To round out your last lines of the paragraph:

> I will point out that Nichijou is generally extremely well received i.e. many people agree it's a great show.

I've never seen it and therefore can't judge, but:

> It does so without a majority of the conditions you've implied are necessary. Anime is simply a medium, there's no checklist for how stories can be told.

You're taking that line way too far. It was just an example of things I look for in a show like Kimi no Uso. Different genres depend on other things for success and therefore should have different criteria for judgement. 

> If anything, I'd say you've failed as much as a viewer as it has as a show. By expecting the show to be handled in specific ways you've boxed yourself out of a story that a majority of responding viewers enjoyed greatly.

This whole part is frankly ridiculous. Me not making an emotional connection with the show means I failed as a viewer? What kind of logic is that? 

Aside from that, where did you get the idea I didn't enjoy the show at all? I did enjoy it to an extent, even emotionally, but that does not exempt it from criticism. Just because I feel for the characters to an extent, doesn't mean I feel the response is earned, or that I don't feel manipulated. 

I'd say you're way out of line by implying I 'watched it wrong'. How the hell can you judge something like that for me?
>> ARTICLE
It is inherently flawed from when you said:
>A lot of people fall for that and lose their objective eye.

This is garbage. Very few stories are written with the goal of being objectively good. At least insofar as we're talking about here, stories are written to be entertaining. There are plenty of ways that can be accomplished and at this point you could destroy virtually any story as being objectively no more than a series of tropes. The only time this is a relevant statement is when someone is being a critic for the sake of being a critic.

> show **tries** very hard to

It's nice that you've emphasized this already, because it's a drastically different statement than what you previously made. That being said, I think we both understand this is what you were going for from the get go. What I do find interesting is this:

>And I feel that a really good show does not need that  

>But it does mean that it will lose points, respect, appreciation, whatever you want to call it, in my book, simply because it is by far the easier choice.

I have a hard time with this, because you begin by trying to frame this as objective criticism. You specifically said the heavy-handedness of the show caused people to lose their objective focus but this statement is obviously not objective. It's not up to you how the show is framed or the narrative written; it's the choice of the author, and how he wants his story to feel. Which essentially you stated, but I think it bears repeating. 

For you to respect the show less because of it is completely reasonable, but to say that the show is objectively worse because of it is a step too far. There's a huge difference between saying "I didn't like x because" and "x is bad because" which is very relevant here. There's nothing wrong with using yourself as an anecdotal example of the show failing to succeed in its methods, but there is something wrong with implying that means the show has failed.

What's ridiculous about thinking the viewer can fail? Is there no value in making a story that requires something from the viewer? 

>Just because I feel for the characters to an extent, doesn't mean I feel the response is earned, or that I don't feel manipulated.

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

I don't really know how to respond to this. I can't read this and think it's anything other than ridiculous. It's just so insanely arbitrary, it may be the best example of being a critic for the sake of being a critic I've seen in quite some time. I can't even begin to fathom what there is to gain from feeling an emotional response to a show and then trying to brush it off for being forced. It's absolute nonsense.

It's not that I think you didn't enjoy it at all, I simply don't find merit in your reasons for evaluating the show. I don't think you're wrong to feel the show wasn't perfect, I certainly don't. I do however think you're wrong for trying to phrase your criticisms as being objective. Which is where my comment on you failing as a viewer stems from. I didn't imply that you watched it wrong, I said you failed as a viewer, as much as the show failed on it's own.

I say this because much of your criticism, to me, seems like you receiving the intent of the show and then deciding it wasn't done in the correct method to make you happy. If the end goal is the same, why are you complaining about how we got their? If 2 stories ultimately leave you with the same feeling, but took a more complex method to get there, isn't that simply wasted effort?
>> ARTICLE
I think the term you're taking the most offence to, is 'objective eye', as you feel I'm trying to pass of my criticisms as objective. 

Objective eye was a poor way of putting it. Sharper look or critical eye would have been better terms (I almost never use this as a disclaimer and I don't intend to use it as such here, but English is not my native tongue, so while I'm confident in my grammar, I'm still working in a foreign vocabulary). 

Note that I don't pass it off as wrong in and of itself: it's just the observation that people tend to brush aside flaws or shortcomings more easily when a story manages to spur their emotions, whether it's Kimi no Uso, or Code Geass, or any other show.

Moreover, of course my criticisms aren't objective! No critism is. I try to judge a show on criteria that are able to be objectively determined to some extent. It's easier to determine whether a show is well written as opposed to emotionally engaging: the former has structure, while the latter varies immensely through all kinds of circumstances.

But in the end, it's still an opinion. There are no ticks to cross off that automatically culminate into a good show for everyone, but there are a few concepts which do contribute a lot. 

> There's a huge difference between saying "I didn't like x because" and "x is bad because" which is very relevant here. There's nothing wrong with using yourself as an anecdotal example of the show failing to succeed in its methods, but there is something wrong with implying that means the show has failed.

That's where this comes in: I never state it like 'I didn't like it because', since me stating criticism already implies my interpretation. 

> I don't really know how to respond to this. I can't read this and think it's anything other than ridiculous. It's just so insanely arbitrary, it may be the best example of being a critic for the sake of being a critic I've seen in quite some time. I can't even begin to fathom what there is to gain from feeling an emotional response to a show and then trying to brush it off for being forced. It's absolute nonsense.
 
There are so many cheap ways to elicit an emotional response from an audience. Killing off a character (not related to Kimi no Uso) is an example, OST's are experts at it with sweeping violins and minor piano chords, preferably with a character crying at the same time.  

For example: I liked Nagi and I cheered for her performance, but when it was over and [this piece of the OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CllT2SIw83Q) started playing and she burst out crying, I exclaimed a little 'aww'. But it was because of the image itself, not because I felt that Nagi had reached such a cathartic conclusion, otherwise I would have a different response.

That's what I mean: it felt forced, manipulative, like I was force-fed her emotions, not because I was feeling her elation. The imagery and the soundtrack got a response out of me, not the characters. They didn't 'earn' the moment. Two seconds later, the feeling turned into something halfway between annoyance and whincing. 

So to me, at those times I received the intent of the show at surface level, but in the end it didn't feel genuine. It left me kind of indifferent, which led me to wonder why it did that: the end result of which is everything I have already conveyed to you up to this point.

*A quick note: I don't consider grades to be any implication of how others should think or feel about a show. They're not objective. There are some people whose tastes I entirely respect, whom may have some significantly contrary opinions about a show. That is the way all art is consumed. A show is often better described by its variance than by its average (compare MAL's variance of HxH to Monster).*

I rarely give a show 10/10. I gave Monster a 10/10, I gave HunterxHunter a 10/10 and I will also give one to Shigatsu. No anime is perfect and I believe that 10s are often not merely subjective, but also very personal. In the vein of art and beauty there will always be great disagreement. 

In my humble opinion the overall art style, score, voice acting, and story in this show are all superb. Did I roll my eyes at some points? Were some internal monologues exhausting? Was the pacing imperfect? Was the animation sometimes lacking? Yes. However Shigatsu does a number of things *much better* than the vast majority of shows. Those things it does well synergize, with the result being an awing achievement. This show's ability to create viewer attachment *even with the minor characters* in so little time is what truly sets it apart.

Shigatsu developed a degree of attachment that, for me, is only mirrored by the Chimera Arc, which had the advantages of previous character development. To do that in such few episodes and to envelop that story in such punishing aesthetic and aural beauty is what makes this show a 10.
>> ARTICLE
I rated the show a 10/10 because I absolutely loved the characters, their interactions with each other, and of course, it made me emotionally involved with the characters!

With that being said, I do NOT think it deserves to be #13 on MAL as far as ratings go. I don't believe it has what it takes to be thought of as so high. I feel like because of its genre, it automatically limits its audience and who can watch it and REALLY get that level of enjoyment out of it. (In other words, if you aren't a fan of romance shows, odds are, this show won't be CLOSE to a 10.) Let's take fma brotherhood as an example. The #1 rated show on MAL. I truthfully feel that it deserves its spot. It attracts all audiences regardless of age/gender/preference (except it is a bit shounen in the end) and is a super solid show.

TL;DR Personally a 10/10, but doesn't cater to every audience so it doesn't deserve a rank #13 on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the premise. As a classical musician, I could relate to how they felt. I wanted the drama to take over, but the comedic moments ruined it for me, and I ended up dropping partway through. Does the comedy disappear partway through? If it had stuck with pure drama, I feel like it would be an easy 10/10. If anyone can tell me if it disappears, that'd be great. 

Some people seem to have an issue with the way the characters monologued; I had no problem with it. Just the damn comedic moments. I overthought and was afraid of social situations in middle school way more than they monologue about classical music. Middle school was an awkward time.
>> ARTICLE
The comedy is always there. I guess it's a little less prevalent in the last few episodes and I don't remember any out of place stuff in the finale (thank god). 
>> ARTICLE
That's good. I might pick it up again then, if the finale has none of it.
>> ARTICLE
I think the ending was the thing that made it so good, at least for me. The letter was put in just the right place for all the feels to explode. 
>> ARTICLE
I gave it a 9/10 but i could easily see why it would be ranked so highly on MAL, because of the great ending as well the way the show took you on a roller coaster of emotion the last few episodes. Personally for me i wish they went a little more deeply into the rivalry with Aiza and watari and the effects that the piano competition had on Arima's future. 
>> ARTICLE
With influence of musical in dramatical settings, I still rate Sakamichi no Apollon and Nana above Shigatsu, 

In my opinion, Nana still have the better romance and drama than shigatsu and Sakamichi no Apollon has a better concert animation and general OST that works really really well with the series. Or maybe I'm just more into jazz than classic. 
>> ARTICLE
While the romance part was much more realistic in Nana, I literally despised the female lead. She was not only naive (which could be forgiven), but also materialistic, self-centered and had totally no drive or ambition to go anywhere and achieve anything. I understand that was intentional, but still if a show doesn't make me like its characters, then I won't enjoy it. Shigatsu, while not being very realistic when it comes to romance, has the female lead being the exact opposite of Nana, with all good that comes with it.

And SnA having better concert animation? Sorry but I need to ask - where exactly?
>> ARTICLE
I think this is more of the difference approach of romance that Nana has in its story. Nana focuses its romance in a more adult-like sense, it produced a character like Hachi  which in case might not be liked by others (I too not liking the character) but more relatable to common people. The flaw she has is what most of girl have in that kind of age. I even have a friend that has similar problem with her. However, I think more towards liking Hachi, the author seems leading the viewers toward liking Nana than Hachi, by using Hachi as somewhat a dynamic contrast to Nana is. 

For me, Sentaro and Kaoru duo in Bungakusai and their last performance on the church comes to mind. 
Edit : The Jazz Bar one was also good, if that gaijin do not interrupt the performance. 
>> ARTICLE
I understand that was intentional, and I liked the show a lot, but more because of the friendship of both female characters, where you could actually see the chemistry. Perhaps it's just me, but the romantic relationships of each of them were far behind their own, platonic one.
>> ARTICLE
I mean the show is a shonen, but instead of battle monologue we had music monologue.

My friends and I joked about how in shonen you get the...

"THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL FORM" and in Uso we got...

"THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL PIECE"

I think the people that didn't like the show at a 10/10 don't like the shonen elements, but liked the romance. I even think there are some that are the other way around and liked the shonen, but not the romance stuff.

Anyway with all the discussion I see, there is no doubt that this show is very polarizing, more so than a lot of recent shows, and if that doesn't make it somewhat of a classic, I don't know what will.


I rated it 10/10 for being a great mix of shonen and romance, and resonating with me in a  way that I don't know if I was ready for.
>> ARTICLE
This show dragged on like a mother fucker in the middle with its stagnant MC, pointless side-characters (Nagi), melodramatic monologues, constant change of attitudes... Oh and not to mention the eye-rolling REPETITION. Ask yourself: How many times was there a childhood flashback to evoke emotion that provided no story development? How many times did this MC say "I'm just friend A?" Or mother's "It's your punishment" or "He's his mother's puppet." Very neat ideas and well-done, but lazy and of poor taste once repeated numerous times EVERY episode.

This is a prime example of poorly delivered style over substance: A piece that excessively uses melodrama and its (great) OST to force and elicit emotional response within the viewers, despite having no concrete substance or action in writing for the majority of the show. Yes, we care about the characters because of the great beginning and lovable (angelic) character designs, but there's comes a point where you're just milking the remaining merit.

That being said, the beginning and end were absolutely beautiful, but due to the tedious, poorly organized middle, by the time the show ended with a fantastic bang, a great amount of transcendence has already been lost.

Could have been a masterpiece if all the inconsistent and melodramatic, lazy production was focused on making this show 12 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
It's nowhere near #13 in my view. I liked the music a lot and the story was decent, and they didn't shit on the ending so that gets them some bonus points.

The 8 I gave it would be the maximum I would give, I'd almost consider lowering it depending on how I feel about it later on.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the show, because it had elements from one of my favorite animes [Nodame Cantabile](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1698/Nodame_Cantabile), especially the musical journey. Ending could have been better (lots of things happened too fast).
>> ARTICLE
I personally think that the reason that so many people are rating it 10/10 is due to the way that they are able to relate to Kosei. Also I personally love the development of Kosei and how he goes from a miserable guy to a loving friend. Death impacts people in many ways and I think that this anime captured that perfectly.  I don't believe that the anime itself is perfect but it is still in my top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Either a very low 8 or a very high 7, but I'm not sure which. The monologuing got tiring and ended up sounding faux-philosophical to me, the comedic bits made it feel nconsistent in tone, and I thought the side characters didn't get quite as much development as they should've. On the other hand, it has a beautiful score, I really enjoyed how the relationship between Kaori and Kousei progressed, the side characters were really interesting, it had some great performances, and the last episode actually managed to make me tear up a bit, especially when we find out what her lie actually was.

Could someone spoil the lie to me please? I dropped the show early on and don't plan on picking it back up, but I'm interested.

nope. watch it, lazy guy.

The cake Kaori ate

Its basically the lie was that kaori likes Watari and wants to go out with him but in reality she really likes Kousei

Gave it a 8/10. There are some flaws that others have repeatedly mentioned. Still the first half of it was really better when they didn't constantly remind you of Kaori's sickness. I really had high hopes of it.

The ending made me teary-eyed. The monologue of Kaori reading the letter was touching. It was expected so no surprises there.


>> ARTICLE
In many ways it reminded me of One Week Friends, and just like with One Week Friends I rated it 10. Both shows are very melodramatic, slow, kind of bittersweet with humor elements here and there. Both shows are also not really revolutionary in any way. They are just really good at what they do. They enthrall you with their premise, attract you with their incredible visuals, entertain you with their colorful, but really simple cast, and then they deliver their emotional punch that is amplified by the build-up and by how it affects other characters. 

I don't know it's gonna be remembered as an all time classic and I don't really care. Isshuukan Friends is scored 7.79 and ranked #827 and it's not worse for it. Both shows left their emotional impact on me and it's gonna take awhile for me to ever forget them.
>> ARTICLE
8/10, maybe 9/10. When I rate something I first look at how much I enjoyed it, how well it entertained me and kept my attention. This show kept me watching, laughing, and feeling all throughout. The very early deathflag for Kaori (her 'never forget me' attitude and ringing the bus to stop at a hospital) really threw me out of my engagement.

The monologues were ok, and I really enjoyed watching the different characters express themselves through their music. 

I didn't cry until the letter at the end, and was balling right through it all. This is weird, because I cry at the drop of a hat when it comes to watching/reading/playing, and I never got more than misty-eyed until that final episode.

Tsubaki was one of my favourite characters, and learning about her was nice. Her development as she realized her love for Kousei, his love for Kaori, and Kaori's situation was wonderful. Kousei was a fine enough character, and it was a pleasure watching him grow up. Kaori, on the other hand, was pretty boring to me. 

The story was cliched, and moderately well done. The comedy was often ill-timed or paced. All around, looking at the anime as objectively as I can I feel it is good (7/10) but my enjoyment of it boosts it up to the 8 or 9 range.
>> ARTICLE
I was really amazed by first half of this show, but then I got dissapointed. Too overdramatized and most of supporting characters arcs were rushed (I am looking at you Nagi) or they were underdeveloped/just here for sake of developing main character (I am looking at you Kashiwagi). I have yet to watch last episode, but I would give it overall 8.5/10 score.
>> ARTICLE
In my hype just about the ending i got a friend to start Shigatsu and his opinion really helped me ranking it.

The last 6-8 episodes made me completly forget how godawful annoying the scenes with his mother were. I do realise that those were necessary in order to show Kouseis problems with his past, but it totally ruined the wonderful music he played. In addition, what i personly didnt even realise, the animation quality in the comedic scenes had sharp drops and they overdid it with some comedy tropes when faces look like smileys and not faces anymore.

I only listed those to (bad) points because the rest is already said, and while the thing with his mother really bugged me i still gave it a 10. I probably will put it down to 9 after a while, but it definitly wont go any worse than that because it really, really was a great anime.

I feel like I need to rewatch it to accurately rate it, as the final wound inflicted on my psyche by that show really hasn't healed whatsoever.
>> ARTICLE
I marathoned it in one sitting after the last episode aired and I thought it was good. It's a show that has it high highs (like Nagi and Kousei duet) and low lows (anything with violin girl), but even if I found the plot to be dull during some parts the visuals and sounds were always top notch.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was really great, but i don't think it deserves #13 on MAL. Right now it's above the likes of Cowboy Bebop, Wolf Children, Mushishi, Monster, and the Disappearance of Hharuhi Suzumiya.
>> ARTICLE
If it hadn't been for the random comedic moments that came out of nowhere during a dramatic scene, particularly accompanied by a drastic change in character art, it would have been a clear 10/10 for me. (One that I didn't have a problem with was during Ep. 21 when Tsubaki gave Kousei a good kicking. That one was just right.) As it stood, it still reached a 9/10 due in part to the very well written drama and that final episode. 

I, however, had no trouble with the internal monologues. I've been a performer on-stage before, although not in quite this kind of arena, and I've done internal monologues as a way to keep my mind busy as my body went through the dance choreography for the 3000th time. I knew gymnasts that did the same thing during their floor routines. I knew cyclists that would do the same thing during their rides. I even still know a drummer that does this exact thing during a planned drum solo while gauging the audience. The internal monologues feel absolutely right to me.

And I also don't have a problem with the characters "not sounding like their age". I've seen it a lot around this sub recently. People will complain that a 14-year-old doesn't actually talk like that... And that's crap. Maybe average 14-year-old USians don't talk like this, but it does not follow that an intelligent and artistic 14-year-old Japanese student would not talk like these characters do. Just because we ourselves spent our entire 14th year of life doing stupid shit for no reason and sounding like socially-inept orangutans with Tourette's doesn't mean that the same standard should be applied to a fictional character.
>> ARTICLE
Gave it 10/10 it deserves a 9 (objectively)

Would give 7.75 everything as a "Critic"

Its a fact that "Shigy" has flaws. But people on mal don't rate individual parts such as animation quality and sound design, they rate it objectively on what its supposed to do, which the show is supposed to move you. And it moved alot of people. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes and no. Is it timeless or will live on as long as Evangelion? None of us can predict that. Also, not everyone will like it because it's art, and art's reception will vary from person to person, either by where they are in life, or where their current views on the subject matter lie. 

But in short, for me Shingatsu is special. It's special because it could've been just another slice of life where the boy gets the girl and they kiss and then _credits_ with some finely chosen music. But it wasn't. It chose to be more. It chose to tell us more, and it stuck to its guns with unflinching determination.

The entire series used music and art in such a way as to convey emotions to the audience and draw out complex philosophical concepts that it knew we could uniquely experience in a visual and auditory medium. Ideas like whether or not we live on in the memories of others ("will you forget?"). Other ideas like living without regret and embracing the end as means for happiness. Or embracing the end in fear and then subjugating our demons onto others. More is then brought to the forefront like perfection versus obsession, love versus distancing one's self. The writers then contrasted the darkness of death with the MC's mother, versus the vibrancy of light with fatally ill Kaori. These ideas danced and swung on pendulums to enrich the complexity of our human experience. The mother was not a villain, no more than Kaori was a saintly heroine. They were people. And they made an impact on us the viewer, as well as Kousei.

Nothing is perfect. But the final episode hit me. It hit me in a way I'll never forget. Not just the 'feels' but in that special appreciation of life. It told me we as people can carry on. That losing someone close doesn't have to be dark, it can be bittersweet because our lives are much brighter for knowing them.

When Kousei has his final duet, and she erupts in a spectrum of color before his eyes... I will, for as long as I live, remember that moment as one of the most beautiful and sad experiences I've ever had. I wasn't ready to say goodbye. Knowing, too, that Kaori didn't want to die... that she underwent the surgery as way to keep fighting... one last rebellion before she was pulled into that final good night. This has even more impact if one takes into account the end credits with her crying in the water before being lifted into death. She loved life above all else.

God damn.

And when she told him "I love you" in the letter, it gave the narrative its final shape and left us all feeling, I imagine, just like Kousei did. It had been him all along. Sure, we all knew on some level, but he was a part of her short life. She chose him above the rest so they could make music together. She wanted to be close to him, even though it wouldn't be for very long. She was selfish and it didn't matter to her. She was just passing through...

It isn't often I can walk away from any story, anime or otherwise, feeling richer as a person for experiencing it. 
>> ARTICLE
With regard to its amazing visuals, soundtrack, story and brilliant execution, I stand firmly by my 10/10 rating. To me, a 10/10 simply places it above all the others ***I*** have rated 9 or lower - with no intent of hawking KimiUso as 'perfection'. I don't see through the same lens as someone who has seen everything, but I have seen enough to know what I like.

Coming back after a long hiatus from watching anime, I'm glad that this series was the first I picked up. During the middle of last year I left thinking that I had outgrown anime, but I'm so glad to realise that the anime industry still has a heartbeat underneath the seasonal onslaught of high school cute-girl themed shows that got me to leave in the first place. 

I will be watching Shirobako next with high expectations. Hope it doesn't disappoint!
>> ARTICLE
Honestly? A 6 due to its story is quite meh for the genre. I bump it up to 7-8 for the execution of visuals and tension. Ending was average. Beautiful on some part, yet average. If I haven't seen any Asian soap drama/romance/novels, sure I can see myself giving it a 9 or so. But with background of the said mediums, Shigatsu is hilariously average and mediocre to the point I already feel that this is being written by someone who is quite wishy-washy and still very juvenile in the genre. Animation is a bit too static here and there but at least the art was alright. In the end, I give it a 7, since we do need something new for the musical genre, albeit Shigatsu still failed in bringing anything "new", if at all.
>> ARTICLE
The unnecessary comedic relief and how they made dramatic scenes pop out of nowhere really annoyed me at times.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone has their own opinions and can think what they want, but most people including me give anime scores based on how much they enjoy them, not analyzing the tar out of it and only giving 9s and 10s to anime that somehow "are perfect in every way". There will never be a perfect anime, but that doesn't mean a series can't get a 10. 10s don't necessarily mean absolutely perfect, they just mean people enjoyed it that much and it's probably one of their favorites. (I've had it at a 10 the whole time I watched it because I relate SO much and am a musician and have been in Kousei's position, beside the death and sickness parts. It's now my favorite show because I enjoyed it more than any other anime I've seen, but that's just MY opinion)
>> ARTICLE
Shigatsu was probably one of the only anime shows that I truly got goosebumps and cried for.  I think one of the standouts of this show is that they put so much emphasis on the performances to make them beautiful and sounds simply amazing.  The score for this anime, while all people don't like classical music, is completely original to this piece due to all the improvisations Kaori and Kousei had (the prime example being the Kreutzer that Kaori played in an early episode.)  In addition, I didn't know that anime performances could look so great.  The way the pianist's fingers moved on the keyboard coupled with shots of the piano's inside create an illusion that enhances the aesthetic of the performance.

I stopped halfway through and it was a 6/10 for me. 

Didn't like the animation or style, didn't care for the music, and the story itself while alright, wasn't told very well IMO. No subtly, and it had a tone that constantly changed throughout the episode, and a few other smaller details. 
>> ARTICLE
Anime with feels = please give me more.

Hilarious to think that the people who complain the most about its rating are the vocal minority. Lurkers and the silent majority who are listening to this crap over and over again about lowering its rating shouldn't feel pressured to change it or do anything at all. It's what it made you feel that day and in that moment that counts.
>> ARTICLE
5/10 incessant, "poetic" monologues, badly handled melodrama and faulty presentation ruined all its potential, despite having the right principles in mind. I just can't get over it, each episode was grating me more and more because it never let on.

Nowhere near a memorable watch, will forget it in a week, because it wanted to be such a big burden, which I'm dropping now.

Will be forgotten immediately due to Jun Maeda's project next season.
>> ARTICLE
I was nice and gave it a 7. More like a 6.5 if I could.

My full review is on my MAL page but I'll post the paragraph that covers the core problem:

*"A combination of some dreadfully unfunny and poorly timed comedic breaks, repetitive dialogue, slow progression and also exposition overload with the duo always kept me frustrated as a viewer. A lot has been said about the lengthy amount of philosophical ramblings of the characters, and it must be said that the problem with them doesnt come with the words being spouted from a 14-year-olds mouth. Instead, the problem comes in that such monologues are in stark contrast to the wacky comedic moments. The show really has no idea what kind of tone its going for because of this conflict. The show could have done without both the philosophical and comedic moments and struck a friendly middle ground that could still have produced a concentrated script."*

EDIT: In regards to that MAL rating, being \#13 is an insult to the medium. Ignore it.
>> ARTICLE
5/10. While I liked the general idea, I always hate the kind of pretentious monologues they throw around in the show. Almost all the characters, save Kousei and somewhat Kaori, go nowhere. It takes itself too seriously. It's horrible at showing rather than telling. The symbolism is way too in your face. The OST isn't anything special either. The romance was pretty stupid, considering it basically turned into a harem for no good reason. Kousei is a ton of steps above the average harem lead, but nothing that merits having more than two characters fall for him, and that's from someone who already dislikes love triangles as it is.

Despite disliking it in general, many scenes were done well. The emotional parts, unbound by the rest of the show because I could frankly not give a damn about Tsubaki or Kaori, did get me emotional. Kousei's mom, and the meaning surrounding it that I definitely didn't agree with in the conclusion of it, was a plot that I loved. I always love character's getting over trauma. The performances were entertaining for the most part, and the animation was on-point when it actually mattered, rest be damned. 

It's not bad show. It's just average. It's certainly enjoyable for whoever likes the sort of soap-opera-esque drama that the show has.It's better than many, but nothing special or outstanding. In my experience, Nodame Cantabile did a much better job at being a musical romantic drama. There's plenty of better romance shows that aren't so inconsistent as Shigatsu was.
>> ARTICLE
I cried more at Shirobako. Kaori has been dieing for such a long time that the only question was how will the rest of the cast move on.

I loved the fact that Tsubaki ended up with a chance, it's a rare thing to have the "third wheel" best girl win the love triangle. Still, I think I would like some more closure for the other characters.

For me, the alternate ending, however happy for Kaori, will be less than desirable, since it will leave Tsubaki alone and unhappy.
>> ARTICLE
Stuff like this is why i ignore mal ratings. I liked the music and animation as well, and that's the only reason i watched it. Story wise the manga is the basis so the adaptation more or less exactly took most of the scenes and dialogues. I think if it would have been shorter (1 cour) and the characters a bit older it would have turned out great
>> ARTICLE
"It made me cry so it's a 10/10!"

Oh, wait, never mind. I am a rational human being with the capability of examining the actual quality of the show and not basing its score based solely on how delicate my own emotions are.

The elitism on this sub reddit is absolutely ridiculous. The whole point of people rating an anime is it is their opinion and rating. Because you think it's not perfect doesn't mean it isn't to someone else. Maybe this anime hit's home hard for some people. Maybe some people enjoy the melodrama. Don't try to act like you know everything and everyone has to follow the same rating.

There's the anti-circlejerk and the anti-circlejerk counter circle jerk that kinda illegitimizes any one person's thoughts on an anime, whether the reasoning for their rating is based on objective value, enjoyment, mob mentality, or just straight hipster-ism.

Also, calling people out for liking certain things is not very characteristic of a community

Consider it my way of cluing those kids into reality. They need to learn one way or another how deal with opposing viewpoints. I was like that once, and I never would have grown the fuck up if people just "ignored" me. You have to call them out on their bullshit or they never learn
>> ARTICLE
There is merit to seeing another opinion, that is definitely true.

A lot of what people take offense to is not what you say, but the constant 'superiority complex' people take on when critiquing. It takes very little effort to critique, but there's more of a reward if you can critique whilst still maintaining their attention. Otherwise, they ignore you once you say 'blah blah is bad'. If you actually want them to listen to you, make an effort to not lose their attention. It's like being a teacher, if you wanna think that way.

There will always be exceptions and kids that won't learn.
>> ARTICLE
> The whole point of people rating an anime is it is their opinion and rating. Because you think it's not perfect doesn't mean it isn't to someone else.

What I would call it in cases like this is them rating their experience watching the anime instead of the anime itself. You can consider it perfect all you want, ignore the flaws and enjoy it but there's no denying that some of them are flaws no matter what.
>> ARTICLE
though, i find it a shame that people sometimes cannot differentiate between what constitutes an actual flaw and an interpretive flaw.

and i personally think that when discussing the merits and faults of an anime, both the viewer's experience and the detachment from the anime itself should be considered, and the exclusion of one from the other is a very unfair and unhealthy approach

i mean, in many forms of literature or media, emotional investment exists, and the attempt to invoke such in a viewer, is a very real and important factor for the creator of said literature. and since different people have different emotional backgrounds, it would be silly to think there is a universal standard for how something impacts an individual's emotion, and it would be very unreasonable to think the experience of an individual should not be considered when "rating" an anime


>> ARTICLE
A majority believing that a certain characteristic is a flaw doesn't validate that flaw's objectivity (it does provide more credence to the validity of that flaw, however). Nevertheless, all flaws are subjective. Your lie in april could have been a masterpiece for one person and at the same time it could have been a disaster for another.

I think 5/10 is a little harsh if you're looking at it objectively. Sure it had monologues, forced melodrama between middle schoolers and the awkward transitions from comedic to emotional parts. ~~But I think it handled MC's condition very well~~, and the last concert was well done imo (the only monologue I didn't mind, if you even consider it one). The other scenes where they were actual playing were beautiful. And the letter at the end felt like a satisfying way to end it.

I'd consider it a 7-8/10 but it's impossible to completely rate something objectively so I can understand why you might rate it a 5.
>> ARTICLE
> But I think it handled MC's condition very well,

No it didn't, it completely beat you over the head with it by never shutting the fuck up and repeating itself a dozen times per episode.

You mean the trauma involving the almost one and only closest family member he had before he ended up living alone for 2 years(?) that was then somehow cured by his 3 week old crush that was forcing him to fight it against his will?

It then keeps on forcing those flashbacks whenever it cans to almost Naruto Shippuden-levels so that you can get sick of them.

I think the author is taking a trauma like that a bit too lightly.

I wasn't talking about that, I was talking about the fact that he couldn't hear the notes. It sounded like a bunch of bs and it was really annoying having it happen every time he played, but when he was able to play for the first time it was really satisfying.

You're right.

And here I am sitting on my 6/10 with no bad feelings about it.
>> ARTICLE
A large complaint about the show was the pacing and the amount of monologues, which I completely agreed with for the first half of the show when I was watching it weekly as it aired. However, for the second half I got rather busy and I let it finish before binge watching the last 11 episodes. The pacing seemed MUCH better and episodes seemed to flow together when I didn't have to wait a whole week to watch another episode. 

While it has its flaws, I think that it is a success because of how it made its viewers so invested in its two main characters. People can criticize the character development of side characters, but this show was always about Kaori and Kousei. 8.5/10
>> ARTICLE
Ehh if it's solely going to be about Kaori and Kousei why have the other characters in the first place then. 

Enormous stretch here but shows like FMA:B or Steins; Gate are rated so highly because EVERY character in that show becomes relevant regardless of whether they're side characters or not. They serve purpose. KimiUso's cast of side characters are more of, 'cool they had x relationship with Kousei when they looked like toddlers and now they think y of him', and that's it. They don't serve any purpose past their individual performance arcs which is a pretty sore thumb in an otherwise well made story. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's actually bad to have side characters for the sake of adding fluff to enhance the main two characters. They served a purpose, and did no more. Had they expanded more on the other characters, the main arc would have lost focus and the impact of it would have been diluted. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel its incredible art and music along with great voiceacting overshadowed the mediocre plot.

It wasn't bad, just not great either.

Unrealistic setting, and Kaori's verbally/physically abusive personality pissed me off more than it should have.

Many of the characters showed a 'notice me, Senpai', kind of character.


The more enjoyable part, in my opinion, was the part with his mother; that scene really hit home for me.

7/10.

Beautiful art, beautiful music, and the execution for Arima's struggles were all great, especially how they visually showed his struggle to hear music.

However, anything that wasn't related to Arima was subpar. The whole romantic subplot with Tsubaki was just there. She said that she loved him, but nothing came out of it. Watari, other than saying a couple of occasional meaningful lines to Arima (which again is tied to Arima) fell flat and was nothing more than comedic relief.

A lot of the show felt like it was dragging things out too long to, the show didn't need to be 22 episodes, it could've been shorter.

My biggest gripe was with Kaori as we really knew nothing about her until literally the last 10 minutes of the show where it became a massive information dump AFTER she died. It was the worst way to end the anime and left an awful taste in my mouth, because Kaori's development could've been handled far better, there's nothing which justifies how they revealed her past.

I loved the performances, I loved Arima's struggles, and I loved his connections with other characters, but the side characters as themselves failed. They weren't developed, the entire case was used to support Arima, but each character individually wasn't fleshed out enough, it was all about Arima, and I don't like that.

That is why I give it a 7/10.

I understand some parts of it were unnecessarily comical, but overall my life hasnt been all too different. in that sense I connect directly to that kind of classical training culture pressure while trying to attain something that pleases me all on my own.

I really liked it but I doubt it will be remembered as a classic because most things people remember are actions and/or Haruhi and K-on.  I also do not think it deserves a 10/10 because nothing does.

10/10 is masterpiece, it doesn't have to be 100 % perfect. For me a 10/10 is something so good that I am willing to overlook the few flaws it has.

 I don't think Shigatsu deserves near a 10/10 either btw.

Ok, I know a lot of people make 10/10s that aren't perfect.  Also I would personally give it a 8/10 at best, the comedy was always out of place for me, which kept we from calling it greatness.

It's not 13th best all time for me, but let me give some points. 1. Don't go off MAL rankings it tends to fluctuate with the "fads" 2. It's most probably going to be one of top anime of 2015.
>> ARTICLE
7/10. The art and music are amazing, and how some of the themes are touched is great, the story had a good progression and pacing, they didn't go for the bullshit miracle ending. All of these help a lot in making this interesting enough to keep the viewer hooked. But...

First, the characters are too mature, it's not like we're watching middle schoolers at all but more like watching at least people ending the third year of high school/college and this is a problem that happens with all of the cast. While the immersion suffers a lot from this, I still like most of the characters in the end, just saying this story would make much more sense in a setting with older characters.

Lastly, I couldn't empathize with Kawori, and that letter in the end just sounds like hardcore stalker material with some yandere tones. God, that shit is really creep if you're not looking from the perspective of someone in love... anyways hat wasn't the part where I started not liking her too much, some things she did in through the series were just not very nice (she was practically a bully towards Arima at the beginning) but she could get away in the eyes of many because she is a cute anime girl after all.
>> ARTICLE
I'd personally give it a 7-8 out of 10.  I really liked the first half of the show with Kaori helping Arima overcome his fear of the piano, but I do think many of the side characters were unnecessary, and the monologues felt overdone.  However, I thought Arima was a great character, and his development over the course of the story was really well done.  Also, the ending was fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
It was a solid 8.90/10. Don't know which position it deserves though.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Shigatsu on the understanding that there would be classical music (that was also (one of) the reason(s) I started Nodame Cantibile), to give you an idea of what my mindset was going into the show. Now, I also watched it on a site where people could comment on each episode, so I got a pretty good idea of how people were reacting to developments as the show progressed.

Every episode, there would be multiple people expressing the same sentiments, over and over. Some of these sentiments included:

 *"wow so many deathflags deathflags everywhere,"*

*"OMG the feels I am not ready plz plz Kaori don't die this is a masterpiece THIS this is the Mona Lisa of anime i am going 2 b a sobbing mess by the time this is over prayer circle for Kaori guys let's do this I do believe in fairies I do I do omg 10/10 everything is so deep and emotional"*

*"Are you sure these kids are middle schoolers and not college students because I cannot tell I mean half the time they are kicking the shit out of each other and crying and the other time they're acting incredibly mature and philosophical"*

And so on.

Clearly, this show had an impact on a lot of viewers, and for that reason alone I don't think even the most cynical reviewer can dismiss the show outright without at least recognizing that lots of people think this show is a 10/10. 

I admit that I personally could not be as caught up in the story or characters as so many other were. The deathflags were so great in number that I just could not be as invested in Kaori as I might have been otherwise. The pacing had many issues in the first half, what with all the flashbacks. Perhaps with Shigatsu it's more about the journey than the end but--I guess really whether or not you're really involved and invested in the ending depends on whether or not you like and care about Kaori, and...

...yeah. I can see why people like her. I really can. But the show was so obviously in love with her, so blatantly adoring, that it was hard for me to love her on her own merits, especially when she is very reminiscent of a MPDG. At least for the first half of the series. 

My God does she come across as a MPDG. When she first appears, and for many of the subsequent episodes after, she is very clearly the female character that will bring Arima out of his funk, she is the shining colorful wondersparkleprincess that changes his world, etc, blah. 

Still, many have pointed out that she's not entirely stuck to the trope, as she gets the chance to express her own fears about death and dying, especially towards the end. By that point, though, I was too desensitized to her character to be impressed.  Some people absolutely worship her character, so I obviously don't speak for everyone.

As for the other characters...well, Watari fits the "pervy best friend of the MC" trope to a T, and while he gets a few, tiny scenes that hint that he's not quite as shallow as he really is, and that he has more depth than a puddle, most of said scenes are undermined by his final 'big' scene in the show, when he's slapped by yet another girl, and after checks his phone, which, surprise, has a picture of him and Kaori as its background. I wanted to like Watari, I really did, and in those few scenes in which he's a decent guy he was good. But this last scene essentially tells us that "he's as ignoble and piggish as before when it comes to women, and you're asking me to forgive that because he has a picture of Kaori on his phone?"

Tsubaki...she's probably the character that seems most like an actual middle schooler, I guess. Frankly I was a bit bored and frustrated with the show deciding that she too should be romantically interested in Arima. Yawn. Hooray for unrequited love sob stories. It's been done before. I would have liked to see her support Arima without all the jealousy and romantic fluff. The fact that she only bothered to buckle down and care about her grades so that she could be close to Arima was also irritating.

I was interested in Emi and Izai, admittedly, although Emi did not seem like a middle schooler in any way, shape or form.

Also why on earth did Arima's father not get brought up ever. Was he just away on business for the entire year? He could have been a very interesting midway point between Arima and Arima's mother and literally he was never talked about. 

Still, for all that, as a performer what I did get involved with were the performances (though as said by others, no matter even if Arima is a prodigy Chopin's piano pieces are amazingly difficult and the show stretched believability on certain musical points), from the backstage scenes to the rehearsing to the concerts themselves. Those were what were compelling to me. 

I'm not saying I was completely devoid of interest when it came to Arima and Kaori's relationship and plot, but it was ultimately predictable where the story was going and how it would end. And I was tired of the whimsy of Kaori's character, of the sweetness and the ultra-violence and everything else. 

I don't think it deserves to be remembered as a classic, nor do I think it will be. All-time greats? I'm not so sure about that. I think it was beloved enough that it will still be talked about a few years on.  

In the meantime, I'll go back to Nodame Cantibile. Classical music, characters who are adults and not weird hybrids of middle schoolers and adults, and good humor and an interesting storyline.

It felt so forced on most scenarios to be honest. 
>> ARTICLE
I have wondered if it was just my cynicism/me in general that kept me from truly getting into the various subplots/scenarios that popped up or if there was something more to it. 

Honestly, I think the reason that you and I and others look at Shigatsu and have words like 'forced' come to mind is that the whole show is *designed* to pull at the heart strings. It is clearly a show that intends you to *feel* something, dammit, and I think those of us who not only recognize that fact but don't choose to ignore it can't get as caught up in the magic as others have. 

So many of the scenes are incredibly cloying, a word that I think is quite apt when it comes to talking about Shigatsu. The scene where Kaori and Arima sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, the scenes where Kaori is absolutely living up to the MPDG trope and being a magicalfairysnowflake--

(look at the *beautiful girl* playing the melodica for the children on top of the dome in the playground. Isn't is *marvelous* look how *lovely* she is * cue cherry blossom petals falling, vibrant background and shared glance between MCs before comedic ultra-violence *)

--and other scenes, like how about most of the flashbacks.  Everything is supposed to get a reaction from you, and when you have everything as poignant than it results in an overload and it fails. 

I dunno, sometimes I'm not very good at articulating how I feel about these things. Did anything I just wrote make sense? 
>> ARTICLE
It did bro, if it's fine once every 4 episode it feels vibrant and important, but this series took itself to seriously and tried to pull the feels at least 4 every "arc" if we could call them in that fashion. 

I keep my original stand point this just feels like a movie trying to win an Oscar, by a director that want certain scenes to be a topic of conversation and not like an anime selling us a story.

How good? I would say really really good.

I a gripe with how the show's finale was done. Was he hallucinating or what? And if he played like he was in a duet, wouldn't that mean his performance would suck since he doesn't have a violinist? Couldn't thins have been done with his thoughts and expressions without the violin to drill in the sadness that he really won't be playing with her anymore? That and what the heck killed her anyway? and why didn't she confess despite all those times they were alone, together, with the perfect atmosphere?

Those minor things aside, everything else this show did was amazing. It gave the characters great depth and a lot of thought. The relationships between them also appeared organic and natural. The way Kousei came to resolve his issues with his mother's death was also great. Speaking of which, they didn't dwell on his mother's death as a plot device for too long as the show actually moved on from there. All of that balanced with some really funny scenes made this show a great ride with enough stops to rest.

Next we come to the technical side. This show was beautiful. The animation was beautiful, some of the best this season. The art was beautiful. The character design was expressive and perfect for a story like that. The show also didn't shy from silly art for comedic effect. With we also, of course, have the music. It's great and hits the spot every time.

For the time being, this show is going to be on my recommendation lest for anyone really, especially those who like drama.
>> ARTICLE
> Was he hallucinating or what? And if he played like he was in a duet, wouldn't that mean his performance would suck since he doesn't have a violinist?

Don't take it so literally. That scene was a visualization of his thoughts and emotions, and I thought it was beautifully done, but that's just my opinion.

> Couldn't thins have been done with his thoughts and expressions without the violin to drill in the sadness that he really won't be playing with her anymore?

The sadness that he couldn't play music with her anymore was part of it, but I thought of the duet as more of a metaphor for the two of them being perfectly connected in that moment, even though they were apart.

> That and what the heck killed her anyway?

No idea. Some unnamed medical condition. Does it really matter though?

> and why didn't she confess despite all those times they were alone, together, with the perfect atmosphere?

Isn't it obvious? She said it herself in the letter she wrote him. She only wanted to pass through. She knew she was going to die, and she didn't want to steal him from Tsubaki just to break his heart. Admittedly, she did confess to him in the letter, but... how could she not? By that point, she was tired of lying to Kousei.

Just wanted to give my take on a couple of your questions. I think the finale was the best episode of the series. I agree with most of your other points.
>> ARTICLE
it made me care for the romance between the main character in an instant. Toradora only appealed to me in my second rewatch. Maybe not an instant classic to people,but I enjoyed and loved every moment of it. The theme and struggle of the characters are also quite real. Only a bit disappointed in the lack of solid resolution of other side characters. Well at least they didn't mess up the mcs so that is good enough in my book.

10/10 never forget
>> ARTICLE
In my humble opinion, if I'm allowed to have one, this was a shitfest, some folks might like the finale but I kinda regret watching this thing for its initial hype... It's guilty crown all over again... With an actual ending at least. 

6 out of 10 is to kind on this thing but at least I don't feel so forced to watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
Gave the show a 4/10.  Opinions haven't changed much.  As time continues to go on, I might forget this ultimately forgettable show and why it frustrated me.  But additional time isn't going to change that I feel the show is hard to relate to, that it's disingenuous (especially how it handles the nature of Kaori's mystery-illness), and has awful/heavy handed writing that undermined its own themes.

Pretty much how I feel, it tried to take itself seriously yet broke it's own back in the long run.

Like showing us if Tsubaki x Arima ever got together. I mean from the ending you could think that there grew some feelings for her inside of him, or that he atleast acknowledged them. Maybe we could see them as adults with a daughter (wonder what her name would be :P).. I absolutely love time skips. (Hence why Amagami SS 2nd season was so awesome for me)

for sure, we all lined up to have our feels broken.

It's really strange how satisfied I am with the show's ending, more so since that doesn't really happen too often for me when it comes to watching anime. I feel both happy and relieved that it's finally over to be honest. Watching each episode every week would make me laugh, tear up, and cause my heart drop. It's as if a weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I can move on. I had an amazing experience and received proper closure. You can't ask for anything more than that.
>> ARTICLE
You summed up exactly how I'm feeling. Hell yeah am I excited for this OVA but I don't think I've ever felt this feeling of closure from an anime. Hell, even Brotherhood had me aching for more when I finished it, and Shigatsu was only 22 episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm all for an epilogue after a time-skip of 2 or 3 years. I got my closure, and more than enough feels to last for a year or two, but more would be good... very good. I won't keep my hopes up, though.

Honestly, I don't think I'll like it if the OVA's an alternate ending. I'll probably still watch it, if it is, but imo, it would diminish the impact of the ending.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I really wouldn't be a fan of an alternate ending, and I kind of doubt they would do that. It would cheapen the beauty of the real ending.

I hope its a sequel episode. I don't want a side-story that takes place sometime during the show.

i hope they come with a 2 min alternative ending like how they did angel beats. my guess is she is in a long term coma and during the next spring (the coming one) she woke up to his piano playing (he plays piano next to her everyday since the competition).

Hmmm.. well I can tell you he isn't choosing Nagi since she's in elementary school and hasn't formed that type of bond. Tsubaki is his only *realistic* option, especially since he now knows she loves him (from her confession and Kaori's letter).

Well if he watched Clannad, doubt this one would make him feel as much when compared to AS. But that's just my personal opinion.

As someone who skipped quite a chunk of the middle due to reading the manga I wonder what you could have cut out. I feel like Nagi was a required midstory character in the manga and helped him overcome more of his original problem. In the end it was everyone that made him able to play again. Still lacked some interesting stuff partway through, but I did enjoy what I read/watched of this anime/manga. I partially agree with your statements 

I will never watch it again however. Definitely not rewatchable 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, they could have taken out the 3-4 episodes with Nagi. In the anime at least, she did not add any emotional weight towards the central story and just seems to be a deviation.
>> ARTICLE
not sure why youre being downvoted lol. i completely agree. I understand the purpose that shes supposed to be a foil to his own development as a pianist when he was being tutored by his mother, but it seemed out of place and poorly developed in the anime unless i missed something significant. 
>> ARTICLE
While I personally disagree with you 2 guys and agree with /u/Catssonova I don't think he should be downvoted either. I mean Downvotes shouldn't be a "I disagree with your opinion" button but rather a "You add nothing to the discussion" button and that is certainly not the case.
>> ARTICLE
Don't complain about downvotes. For one, it's specifically in the rules of reddequette to not do so. And for two, you will change absolutely no one's mind with 2 or 3 sentences about why it's bad; people are going to downvote based on their opinions.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the Nagi arc was a nice side story that also helped Kousei and his development. In terms of pacing, it's the same as the manga. I believe each episodes was two manga chapters. So it's either a fault of the manga or that the pacing doesn't translate well into anime form?
>> ARTICLE
Watching the show week to week, I kinda felt that the second half was more disappointing than the first. But I recently marathoned the whole series in a rewatch for my podcast and I saw more clearly how everything worked together. The Nagi arc was necessary for several reasons.

1. It gave Kousei, as Seto puts it, "something beyond sorrow" to focus on. 
2. Through helping Nagi grow, Kousei himself is able to grow both as a pianist and as a person. We get to see how much Kaori has changed him for the better. 
3. As things are going well for Kousei, they're simultaneously getting worse for Kaori to the point that she feels like giving up. Kousei and Kaori have essentially swapped the positions they were in at the beginning. Now it's his turn to inspire her and give her hope which is exactly what his performance with Nagi does.
4. The Nagi arc was necessary to jolt Takeshi out of his slump after the Maiho competition tore down Kousei as his unbeatable hero.

You do bring up some legitimate points about repetition that I think affect some of the dialogue and Tsubaki's character development, although at the same time repeating those lines makes them stick out in your mind and be all the more powerful in the last episode. "Will you ever forget?"
>> ARTICLE
I think the fact that it was 22 episodes instead of 12 made it more enjoyable for me. Yes, it dragged on at times and that's what kept it from being really good(and middle schoolers), but the length truly helped me bond with the characters. It was by no means perfect, but I believe it was necessary for the buildup.

Edit: Fuck, you deleted your comment :( I'll repost my comment anyways.

Yes, I agree. Kaori should definitely have had her character developed WAYYY more and her relationship with Kousei as well.

In regards to Nagi, I found her story interesting and immersive. I really enjoy seeing side-character development that is relatively well done, but sadly it came at the expense of Kaori's development. Her development was tied closely to Kousei's and because of that I don't see her as cumbersome. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, sorry deleted my comment. It was basically a reiteration of what was said in the post. 

I went to sleep with the thoughts, and when i woke up, i realized this topic is no longer worth my time in discussion. 

That being said, i am geniunely glad many were able to find fulfillment in this piece. Unfortunately i was not. 
>> ARTICLE
That's ok man. Everyone has different tastes.

Have a [hug](http://giphy.com/gifs/k-on-hug-DjczAlIcyK1Co).
>> ARTICLE
I definitely agree on the kaori part. They could of added more character development for her. I felt that her character development was pretty lacking compared to the rest. Also her relationship with kousei. They should of expanded that and added more scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's agree to concur
>> ARTICLE
I do see where you're coming from but I don't think condensing it down into 12 episodes is a good idea. It is simply not enough to explore all the characters and I'll probably end up caring even less for Kaori and the rest of the characters in the end.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, they could have taken out the 3-4 episodes with Nagi. She did not add any emotional weight towards the central story and just seems to be a deviation.
>> ARTICLE
They're not going to make it 18-19 ep long. It's either 12ish or 23ish. So they would either have to cut more eps or extend other arcs. I felt given the source material they chose the best option.
>> ARTICLE
Well she helped him like the piano a bit more, and it made the relationship between Arima and Aiza a bit more comedic. 

I thought the episodes with her were fine.

But now that I think about it, the friend A stuff and puppet was repeated quite a bit, and it made me mad too, but maybe Arima is just that stupid that he could not realize he liked her.
>> ARTICLE
This is where I think the idea of 11-13 and 22-26 episode course segments falls flat.  The show would do better as a middle ground mostly. In its current state, it could be easier to watch if it was around 16-17 episodes. It could still work as two cour if they did spend more time on the two MCs actual development as a pair. 
>> ARTICLE
I never felt that the show has been milking or dragging when each episode feels like a five minute short.

The only gripe I had with shigatsu was that they're 14 years old. Add 3 years to their age and that'll be fine considering how much they grow up between now and the flashbacks. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I understand your problems. I'm not a very critical person. If I see flaws in a show I like, I can look over them if they don't ruin it for me. But if it does, I can get pretty mad. I gave Shigatsu a 9 because it entertained me end left me breathless. It really made me feel good. I'm not arguing it's faults, but I don't score critically, I just score based on my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
The thing I most agree with is the repeated scenes. These are the points where the producers have to ignore the manga and cut that out.

The thing I disagree on however is Nagi. I don't think her arc was entirely pointless, as covered in some other replies in this thread, but I do agree that they didn't make it quite clear enough why she was important to Kousei's development.

I personally also dislike divergence from the main arc for no reason but I think the Nagi arc was done very well and not completely unnecessary either. I actually rather disliked the character at first, but I really liked how the arc progressed further, and it also had a great performance at the end.

You bring up some solid points of discussion though, I must give you props for posting your opinions of a show that has recently aired and has acquired quite the fan base. 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for your comment. I respect the points you've raised as well. 

However, I would like to state that mere opinions don't bring anything meaningful into a conversation. I think providing support and arguments, in which you have done to some degree, is something this sub-reddit needs to endorse more.

"Opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one and it's often full of shit."

That being said, a lot of what I have said are subjective thoughts as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Also when did talking in the middle of the fuckinh performances become a thing? Maybe I'm too used to Nodame Contabile but I thought Shigatsu would have let the music speak for musicians instead of "Let it ring" being said louder and louder, just spoiling the scene.
>> ARTICLE
I think the repeated lines happen because it's a very loyal manga adaptation. It doesn't feel repetitive at all in the manga because there's less crammed into the manga chapters than the anime episodes. I think implications that they have 'lack of trust' in the viewer is a tad much. Though I do agree they could have mixed things up more dialog-wise.

As for the content, I still thought the side characters were well done and their look at the situation from their angle in the midway of the show was still interesting. Tsubaki had a lot of nice emotional drama going on her end and it was nice to see a third party perspective on all this, as far as the Kousei/Kaori duality goes. I do wish they had more developments alongside Kousei and Kaori though. And maybe using Kousei less as a punchingbag could have helped. It's like women can't help but literally beat Kousei up in the story.

I still think the show is brilliant is because they were able to elicit a lot of emotions and the way shots are framed were really good (as in visual direction). Could it have been better? Sure. But I don't think this show really is in danger of being considered a terrible show personally. Again, it could have used more of its potential, but I think the story as far as Kousei/Kaori goes (whom are the most important in the show), they at least get that right. 
>> ARTICLE
That explains a lot, the part about the manga. Thank you.

Yes, I YEARNED for more interaction between Kaori and Kousei, how they would form a concrete bond (instead of Kousei constantly doubting himself).

The show definitely has its merits. For sure. It certainly portrayed some aspects of anime in a transcending level. Maybe it's because some parts were SO good that I'm so angered by the shittiness of the other, lazy parts.
>> ARTICLE
Well, that is more on the part of the manga I feel, because this was a very loyal adaptation. Meaning they didn't really change things much from the manga. 

But yeah, as great as the drama was, I do wish the characters would have worked with Kousei a bit more. Especially the girls who can't help but literally attack Kousei or just throw an angry fit at him for bringing up serious topics. Only Watari (who ironically is a comedic best friend type) seemed to have many of those moments with Kousei.

Yeah, the comedic timing might not be this show's strong suit. As cute as the moments are, they do shift too drastically from the tone of the moment and I dislike how Kousei is constantly verbally/physically attacked to get that going.
>> ARTICLE
> scattered direction

Care to give some specific examples of where you think the direction is bad? I generally found the compositions to be above average and sometimes very good. The series has generally good flow, especially in performance scenes. I can agree the series has some major tonal issues and some minor pacing issues (which I don't really care to debate), but I'm interested in specifically how you think the directing was bad.

I also ended up giving it a 6/10 (which is still a rather good score) though I really liked the first half of it.

How so? 6/10 means 40% of the content was unlikable/bad
>> ARTICLE
It's above average. And the reason I rated it like that was not because I did not enjoy it, it's because of other flaws which are pretty much all mentioned in OPs post.
>> ARTICLE
Above average doesn't necessitate good. The average show could be horrible. 6/10 in a vacuum is not a good rating for a show.
>> ARTICLE
I said "rather good", that does not necessarly mean good. I could've also phrased it with "fine" which is the MAL equal.
>> ARTICLE
"Fine" and "Rather good" are 2 very different terms. You wouldn't want to watch a show that's just fine. "Fine" implies apathy. Let me show you in a hypothetical conversation.

Person A: Hey, what do you think of -Show Name-?  
Person B: Eh. It's fine, I suppose.


>> ARTICLE
That's one of the worst interpretation of such a rating I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Really? What's your interpretation of a 10/10, then? Do you not think it implies that you liked or thought all of the content was good?
>> ARTICLE
6/10 should be interpreted as, "I enjoyed this show 60% as much as I enjoyed a 10/10 show".

A 10/10 show, is a show without any flaws.
>> ARTICLE
That makes your ratings inconsistent. If a 10/10 is a show without flaws, a 6/10 would be 40% flawed.
>> ARTICLE
Let me rephrase myself then.

6/10 is a show I enjoyed 60% as much as 10/10.

10/10 is a rating for the shows I have enjoyed the most. I tend to enjoy them the most because I consider them to be without flaws.
>> ARTICLE
In that case, how is that any different from what I initially said? 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say any show has no flaws, however my shows I rated 10/10 because they were so good I could overlook the flaws.
>> ARTICLE
If I can rate a show above 96/100, it fit's into a 10/10 category in MAL. A single flaw isn't really enough to drop a show from 10/10. Despite all this, a 10/10 definitely boils down to enjoyment more than anything else, but I'm not enjoying the show if I'm looking at it thinking about what I would've done differently if the show's production was in my hands.
>> ARTICLE
I gave it the same score, but I liked the ending more, when stuff actually started to happen. Before that I felt like they pointlessly introduced more characters to draw it out.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped the show at 16 episodes (the latest I ever dropped a show at) for similar reasons that you mention here. Lack of respect for the viewer, poor direction and manufacturing melodrama followed by the subsequent milking of the "feels". I will cry when I feel like it, not when I am engineered into it, thankyouverymuch.

Hopefully the upcoming S2 of Yahari will be well written and directed.
>> ARTICLE
I hate how easily the term "melodramatic" is thrown around. I didn't think that Shigatsu is melodramatic at all. Arima suffered from child abuse, experienced trauma that caused him to quit playing piano completely, and to top it all off, the love of his life is dying. So yes, I find it perfectly understandable that he would have plenty of high-stress, tearful scenes and depressing, self-loathing monologue. However, I do agree that Tsubaki's drama is a bit over-the-top, but not enough to flag the entire show as melodramatic.

Instead, the gripes I have about the drama of Shigatsu stem directly from the ages of the characters. Throughout the whole show, with every dramatic scene or plot point, the fact that these characters are all in middle school could never leave my mind. Having 13 or 14-year-olds tackling mature themes such as loss, forgiveness, love, etc really pushed my suspension of disbelief. Now, I have read elsewhere that the characters are middle-schoolers because in Japan, middle school is the turning stage in a child's life where he or she becomes much more independent/self-reliant. Maybe it's just the culture difference, but this argument does not validate the characters' ages for me. It wouldn't have taken much to have a high-school setting instead; they would just have to call the characters "high-schoolers" and the character designs could go unchanged. I know that when I was in middle school, I just bumbled around and killed time all day. Perhaps I just don't have enough life experience, but my criticism still stands.

I agree with your other points about repetition, pointless side-characters, etc. I'd like to add that I thought of Kaori as a plot-device up until the very end. For 21 episodes, her only purpose in the show was to act as the catalyst for Arima's development. This may not necessarily be a bad thing, and it's certainly not the first show to have this kind of relationship, but in Shigatsu, the interactions and relationship between Arima and Kaori remained stagnant until [last episode spoilers.](/s "the reveals with the letter.") In Hyouka, for example, Chitanda acted as the catalyst for Oreki's progression into a rose-colored life, and along the way, we see their relationship bloom in color too. Their interactions began to feel more natural, they learned more about each other, and we as viewers can feel them getting closer together. Shigatsu, on the other hand, is completely one-sided. All of their interactions seem very formulatic: Kaori drags Arima somewhere, Arima monologues about his admiration (and eventually love) for Kaori, then Arima goes off on his insecurity and thinks that Kaori likes Watari, not him. Through all this, Kaori remains as one-dimensional as ever. She doesn't receive any development (aside from her health) until the last episode and her relationship with Arima doesn't progress out of the fact that we realize that Kaori actually likes Arima. This made it impossible for me to like Kaori as a character, which is a major problem considering that she is the MC of the show aside Arima.

~~Ah yes, the typical anti-hype backlash that always follows immediately after a popular anime that was highly regarded when it aired has now ended. I'm surprised this is happening so soon with this anime though, usually it takes just a bit longer than this. Outside of the final episode discussion thread all I've seen on here since it's ended are threads by people now being negatively critical of it - not reviewing it, just being critical of the negative aspects; just like what always happens.~~

**Disregarding the above paragraph commenting on this subreddit in general, to answer your criticisms here:** I'm not sure why you're complaining about it being melodramatic or 'style over substance' when that was almost the whole point; the show being bombastic, over-the-top melodramatic, fickle, constantly changing attitudes and forcing its emotions and ideas repetitively on the viewer - that's just like Kaori's personality, and the music (especially what Kousei's playing style became due to Kaori), the main focus of the show. It was not supposed to be a long-lasting 'thought-provoking' piece of work, it was supposed to be more of a temporary, self-contained attack on the viewer's senses that only lasts while the show does, showcasing and resolving Kousei and Kaori's simple story and how they feel about it; and the sound of the music that goes with it.

I will agree that some of the side characters did end up being pointless, and by extension some episodes, but I don't think halving the length of the series would help at all - remember that almost the entire first half dealt with Kousei's trauma with his mother before the main story of Kaori's death began. And don't say that the hints towards Kaori's death were 'foreshadowing' - I'm already sick of seeing people talk about foreshadowing and 'death flags' - it was supposed to be blatantly obvious that Kaori was going to die, it was never supposed to be in doubt whether or not it would happen; it wasn't foreshadowing, it was fatalistic, you were always supposed to know that you were watching a stereotypical 'star-crossed lovers' drama with a tragic heroine fated to die, as soon as it became obvious - the mere fact that Kaori died was not important, the effect of Kaori's death was the important part.

It wasn't a masterpiece at all, but it was pretty good and it told a story that was fitting enough to play along with its music and look good while it did it.

I suspect that the op is perfectly aware that the show was melodramatic on purpose, the contentious issue is that so many people hailed it as the best thing since sliced bread without realizing what you describe very well in the first paragraph. Or perhaps it means that this kind of entertainment is favored over shows that are not entirely 'style over substance'. While there is nothing wrong with that, it might shape the decisions of animation studios regarding future shows (assuming Japanese response is similar) and explains the backlash. This thread is basically a vocal minority going "we don't want most of the upcoming shows being like that". 

And if you disagree that  in the past few years there has been a tendency to pander to the audience at the expense of original, unconstrained works ( la what Masaaki Yuasa does), well, that is a discussion for another time.
>> ARTICLE
It hurts me personally to see people call it foreshadowing. The only "mircale" that could have happened would be a success in the op at the end and that would have given her a few months at max. It's the same way my grandpa died to cancer. It was obviously clear that he was going to die as there was no chance for recovery (the cancer was to wide spread to be treated effeciently, R.I.P Grandpa) and there was still some struggling.
>> ARTICLE
Did they even say what her illness was though? That really ripped the logos from the series from me. I had originally thought it was a brain clot because of her loss of motor functions, but how they performed the surgery was not for brain surgery, but it doesn't seem like cancer either because Cancer, unless it's brain cancer, wouldn't affect the nervous system (as those cells don't generally replicate). I mean we can chalk it up to KEY-aids but I hate doing that.

I also know that feeling, though I was much younger. I lost my Grandma who was 54 when I was 4 years old to cancer.

>> ARTICLE
I don't know which disease it was, but it doesn't necessarily have to be one we know ya know. Also what is KEY-aids?  

Also I'm sorry about your loss. That feeling is something I would never wish upon someone.
>> ARTICLE
Well if there's a procedure for it, you'd think it'd be somewhat known. Sorry I get pedantic when it comes to illnesses. KEY-aids is what I call any unknown terminal illness in anime. The namesake comes from the illnesses in the games/anime developed by [Key](http://myanimelist.net/people/2885/Key) which use this trope a lot in their stories.

Thanks, I just wanted to make sure you know you're not alone because sometimes it can feel that way.
>> ARTICLE
Idk the fact that there was a surgery which potentially could have saved her gave everyone some hope, but yes after a certain point it wasn't even foreshadowing. May your grandpa rest in peace.
>> ARTICLE
they never said it could save her iirc. they only said that it could give her a few more months and that it is risky. 

edit: and also thanks my grandpa was a great man and I am sad that he is no longer around. However he got decently old (74) and it is now 11 years ago that he died so the pain is mostly gone :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh I see. Well, it gave me some hope haha.
>> ARTICLE
it certainly gave some hope that her death will be postponed and they get to share some happy time together. also note that I could be wrong. I had a fever when watching most of the series so some memories might be not 100% accurate.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't care for Nagi either but I'd hardly call her *pointless*. Honestly I thought the show was at its best when it expanded its focus beyond just Kousei and Kaori. I'd probably hate a super-condensed 12 episode version tbh. Say what you will, but this was always gonna be a mood piece, and the "boring middle stretch" is entirely integral to that.

For a musical slice of life without pacing issues, check out Sakamichi no Apollon aka Kids on the Slope. 10/10.

(BTW; OP I saw your MAL and noticed you've watched and agree with me... I recommend you give Beck another shot. The Engrish is painful and you don't like the art apparently, but it does have some of the same essence of Kids on the Slope, give it another shot.)
>> ARTICLE
LMAO.

1. there's barely any music in kids on the slope
2. it has pacing issues out the FUCKING ASS

that one scene where [](/s "kaoru and sentarou play in the school hall is probably the best scene in the entire series, and it's one of very few scenes where they play music together for more than 10 seconds.")

the rest of the series is shitty forced melodrama. honestly, i don't even know how anyone can say it's part of the music genre what with the very small amount of actual music playing there is in it. you might as well call angel beats a music anime.

if you want an ACTUALLY good musical slice of life, nodame cantabile.
>> ARTICLE
Mannnn, I've seen a tonne of show's with forced melodrama, and Sakamichi no Apollon isn't one of them. Nisekoi, Golden Time, Inou Battle wa Nichijou, Elfen Lied, + more. Frigging Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso was so much worse than Kids on the Slope.

I'm pretty sure Kids on the Slope didn't have pacing issues. Not once did I get bored of the show, I marathonned it pulling an all-nighter because I couldn't stop watching.

Perhaps you watched the show expecting more music, it's your most legitimate criticism, although it's more of a matter of taste about how much time you want the characters to stop and play music rather than advancing the story.

I'll get around to watching Nodame Cantabile, but you're way too salty about Kids on the Slope.
>> ARTICLE
Nice one cheese, im glad we agree on kids on the slope. Lol i feel way more happened and characters had more growth in kids on the slopes 12 episodes than shigatsus 22. 

But anyway, thanks for your suggestions. We seem to have a convergence of interest. 

Beck, ill give it another go sometime. For the meantime, im a little worn out by anime, as you can see after seeing my recently viewed on mal by date. 
>> ARTICLE
Haha, understandably. You're MAL is pretty solid in general man, I wouldn't judge you for dropping Beck, the show has buckets full of flaws. I just enjoyed both for similar reasons, and I recommend either to anyone who hasn't seen the other.

But yeah, perhaps my opinion is harsh, but I think Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso had wayyyyyy too many pacing issues. Perhaps I'd enjoy it more if I enjoyed classical piano more, however, I don't go out of my way to listen to jazz but I enjoyed the shit out of Sakamichi no Apollon. Your Lie in April just tended to drag on. The show could have been 12-18 episodes probably without dropping any content.
>> ARTICLE
Iiiii'm gonna add you as a friend on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
Sure, if you want more criticism overall and maybe some recommendations, make a post on /r/PostYourMAL. It's pretty dead but I try to comment a lot there, I don't really want to see the sub die.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. Not 12 episodes mind you. The performances still have a bit of weight. I'd call 16 episodes would be enough to do the show justice. And I think many series would greatly benefit with 16 episodes instead of sticking with 1-cour 12-13 (can be too short)/2-cour 23-24 (dragging too long). 
>> ARTICLE
Has there been many anime that do that though? 1.5 seasons long? As far as I know, it's always been 12-13 or 23-24?
>> ARTICLE
TMoHS is 14 episodes, the new spinoff is going to be 16 and I believe Death Note had three cours for an odd total of 37 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Nisekoi season 1 is 20 episodes for some reason. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's see, Kokoro Connect. While the last 4 episodes was categorized as OVA, its still a followup arc to clinch the story. I think Monogatari series also did it but I'm not sure they fully counts since the arc was very spaced. But hey, the next season Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is [16 episodes](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-03-19/the-disappearance-of-nagato-yuki-chan-gets-original-video-anime-episode-count/.86161).
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the show, but I do agree with a lot of what you said for the episodes around the middle. Some were great, but some I felt the dialogue was lacking and it just seemed to drag on. After reading your post, I agree it was due to the repetitiveness of those themes and sequences. The ending made up for it though. :')
>> ARTICLE
I had a big problem connecting emotionally to this series overall but never quite felt that it dragged. I know that it was a weekly "feels-fest" for a number of people, but I recognize that I have a bit of a hard time connecting when the tragedy/drama is so plainly set forth as what's basically an anvil hanging over my head (Reasons why Clannad and Angel Beats! never resonated with me). I can see the points where people *can* get sad, but I personally kinda wrapped up the series going "Well that was well animated, I don't think I'd want to see it again though". It's solid, but ultimately I recognize that I gave a series I knew wasn't my usual cup of tea a chance due to the amazing direction of the musical performances and I can't say I'm not surprised to be in "No tears were shed"-ville again.

The only time that I started really connecting with the series was when they explored Kousei's inability to let what was basically the ghost of his mother go.

Edit: Accidentally a word
>> ARTICLE
I thought the repetition helped make the characters feel real. I actually liked the way they showed flashbacks as bits and pieces instead of making a full flashback arc.

Haven't you ever gone through something that just keeps repeating in your mind? I feel like that's just how our mind works; you never really go full flashback mode but instead, you end up remembering bits and pieces of your past. You would also remember certain things people say that made a big impact in your current way of thinking. Llife events that define your character (especially tragic things that effectively scar you) also stick with you for a long time. Certain "life quotes" or general advice would also be remembered.

The anime repeating those things just emphasizes that these characters are humans like us. It also helps us understand each character better and see their growth from the thoughts that go through each character's head.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think highly on flashbacks, and this anime had tons of flashbacks. Well that is my opinion, but I really dislike flashbacks even though they are needed to make the story better.
>> ARTICLE
I really hated how everyone always just says Kousei's name during his performances. 

However I believe that this is by far the best the adaption could be.

So it being melodramatic and tedious is really a fault of the manga IMO.

Incoming, "B-but it made me cry! It's a 10/10 masterpiece!" comments

Usually I'm all for emotions really. My favorite late film critic once said that a piece is truly worthy of praise if it elicits emotional response *while* watching and thought *after* watching. If a show is capable of evoking emotion with a backing of substance, it indeed deserves subjective praise.

However, I do not find lack of substance, poor direction, inconsistency in tone justifiable or thought provoking.

Hmm not too much related to what you have posted but

I will always prefer 24 episodes format for a single season than 12, even if they stretch out or drag it a little, (Which I don't fully agree with some of your points on Shigatsu) 

Every time I see a show gets a 11-12 episodes treatment my heart sinks, like what they will do to Yamada and 7even witches, or what they did with Tokyo Ghoul, Grisaia no Kajitsu, Angel beats, Psycho pass 2, 

unless the material is enough for a 12 episodes, which is fine.
>> ARTICLE
I truly understand where you are coming from, my friend. I'm truly happy that you enjoy this piece of entertainment. Unfortunately, I am unable to feel the same about inconsistency.
>> ARTICLE
The second season of Tokyo Ghoul is pretty much the last 12 episodes of the show, and Psycho-Pass 2 is getting a movie to close it up. 
>> ARTICLE
100% Agree.

Note : I HATED Nagi... sorry .. but she was as he said it a "pointless side-character"
>> ARTICLE
Oh, the pacing. Yeah, it started to drag towards the middle. And contrary to what most people during the season were saying - loving Nagi - it was a completely pointless arc.

Though, as usually, when binged, the pacing is less of an issue (I watched 17 episodes on last Sunday). Nevertheless, I would rather have s show that drags a bit in the middle, but flashed out everything it had to show, than 12 episodes of rushed and barely explained story and characters.

And yes, the constant reminder of his mother and being *Friend A* were getting pretty annoying as well. As imho, all the death flags were too much. Yeah, I got the idea after 3-4 episodes, I don't need another bash with death flag up to ep 10.

Only thing I wouldn't completely agree on with you is the ending (there is always someone unhappy with, heh?). While I think it was pretty acceptable and well done, I disliked the conclusion. I think it went against all the dramatic foreshadowing and I would prefer if it ended dramatically. It was too anticlimactic for my liking.

Why are people down voting op for having an opinion? Why do people  mistake the down vote button as a disagree butthurt button. What the fuck is wrong with this sub sometimes?

Op I agree with your criticisms on the show. It really was style over substance, conveying emotion through straight up self deprecating monologues and someone crying every episode. Seriously, Clannad, a widely recommended "feels"  show has only I think 4 instances of crying which were handled and spaced well throughout the series but Shigatsu had one every single episode. Sometimes twice. It really makes you insensitive to anything that will happen later on. 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for your support. But at the same time, I don't think it's that unjustifiable to downvote opinions. If I only spew out my opinions, they are able to express their opinions as well by downvoting.

However, if I support my opinion and provide evidence (which I have done), it becomes an argument. By that point, downvoting is simply a lack of taste and a counter-argument is required. 

"Opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one and it's often full of shit."
>> ARTICLE
According to one of your posts, it doesn't sound like you're replying to this anymore, but I want to argue a counterpoint to your milking comment. 

I think you are being a bit harsh on this point. I don't see it as milking but rather something that someone who has undergone a trauma would actually think. 

Kousei hearing his mother tell him "this is your punishment" multiple times is realistic. You can't expect for someone who blames himself for his mother's death to just think this once and then have the show be like "oh look, I'm over it." I understand from a cinematic experience it may be repetitive, but it shows that people don't get over their traumas easily. 

Onto the next statement "He's just his mother's puppet." When he was younger, it shows the grip that his mother had on his life, preventing him from seeing his friends, beating him, playing exactly as it is shown. It shows that people saw that he wasn't his own person, only doing what he was for his parents. In addition, it shows that after hearing something enough times (especially as a child), you begin to believe it yourself, as evidenced by what he himself said in episode 20. 

Finally, "I'm just Friend A." I'm assuming that you've never been interested in your friend's girlfriend. As someone who has, let me tell you that this is an extremely realistic portrayal of what you think when you have a moment with her, only to remember that nothing can ever happen. 

Again, all of these things might be annoying from a cinematic experience, but to say that they are "milking it" or "lazy" is looking at it in the wrong way. It's realistic for how people, ESPECIALLY 14 year olds, look at the world and their problems.

Deppending what you liked from SAO [(you know it got a second season?)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21881/Sword_Art_Online_II) eather [Log Horizon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon) [(2nd season)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23321/Log_Horizon_2nd_Season) or [Akame ga Kill](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22199/Akame_ga_Kill!)

Then we got the classics that will always be recomended [Cowboy Bebop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop), [NGE] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion), [Code Geass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch) with [R2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2904/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch_R2) being the second season. (the MC for this show just won the Best Guy Contest)

(all of these are action focused to some extent, because that is what you have seen. I would also say watch the first FMA at a later time.)

The show I would recomend to get into the Moe, [Slice of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slice_of_life) scene would be [K-On!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On!) (the [second season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7791/K-On!!) just got an extra "!")

I really do enjoy this show, but this gif just reminds me of how I am personally frustrated with Kousei and Kaori's relationship. [Just in case](/s "It's simplistic/one dimensional. Which I agree has its own beauty, however because of its simplistic nature it alone can't carry a show. Thus all these awesome side characters are added and distract you from the main story. And then at the very end boom sadness. I just think so much more could've been done with the main story.")

[EDIT](/s "Yes I realize this isn't a romance story and I don't see it as such. I see it as a coming of age story and they help each other cope with loss/death. However, I still believe that the simplicity of the relationship and how the little screen time it gets over the entire series messes with the general flow/transitions of everything.")
>> ARTICLE
I agree. It's very superficial, especially when you know exactly what's coming. I don't like what Kaori's doing and what she's going to do to him. 
>> ARTICLE
I think if you look at their relationship from a purely romantic standpoint then youre not going to get much out of it. If you look at their relationship as human drama between two people supporting each other through music as they navigate lifes tribulations, then I think its a relationship thats layered and gratifying.
>> ARTICLE
I think the issue here is because they are in middle school. 
>> ARTICLE
This sums up my sentiments.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you completely. [Also just in case](/s "The show deals with overcoming loss well I think, but for romance it reverts back to frustrating misunderstandings and missed opportunities. The show is definitely beautiful with it's use of music and the message about loss, but I think other shows outdo it for [terminal] romance cough, Hanbun, cough")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Hanbun was really great. Despite it being really short. :(
>> ARTICLE
Oh agreed, it's one of my favorites. I'm so salty it hasn't gotten the Blu ray treatment yet 
>> ARTICLE
Yup, I my opinion Hantsuki had the upper hand over this show in almost every way when it comes down to story and characters. [For me, Kimiuso](/s "blew the romance really bad, I fail to see Kawori as something other than a top tier stalker and someone who bullies her loved one in a very immature way through the whole story, of course, it fits her character, and considering how things went Tsubaki will probably never even get to the first base. So it just became a story about Kousei overcoming losses and moving on.") And there is also better shows about this theme too.

But damn, Kimiuso anime is fucking pretty.

>> ARTICLE
I think that [ending spoilers] (/s "should be considered an attempt to shake a loved one who's in a bad place and lacks the strength to resurface on his own. It's something I've seen working IRL with a friend, and the times Kaori is shown wondering if she's doing the right thing or making things worse would fit with the strategy. Also the ending strongly hints at Kousei starting a relationship with Tsubaki")
>> ARTICLE
This show never really was focused on romance. And i think its a good thing. If they tried to force romance this show will probably end up getting a 7 in my book. 
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't wholly focused on romance but I do think that was a major selling point for the series. When all is said and done, I agree, it's not a romance genre anime, it's a coming-of-age; however the romance subplot is brought up almost every episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree and part of the problem is that the story was trying too hard to [spoiler] (/s "stick to the conceit in the title. Having a central hook is OK, but the author holds the payoff of the title to the very end--such that it distorts the story. Basically, Kaori's full confession is held to the end, hence the lie that she liked Watari has to be held up through to that end which means the MC and Kaouri's relationship is always held in suspension. This is frustrating if one was looking for a romantic relationship. Then again, the author didn't intend for this to be a normal romance...")
>> ARTICLE
[I agree](/s "I definitely don't see this as a romance story, definitely more of a coming of age story. But even then, I feel that their relationship messes with the general flow and transitions of the entire series. But maybe the author purposely made it that way.")
>> ARTICLE
[Not that spoilery](/s "I would still love to have a spin off story that was completely romance based, and Kaori ends up with Kousei.")
>> ARTICLE
I think the show could've benefited from the characters being a little older. They just do not sound like middle schoolers.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, how many middle schoolers do you know that have been throught life altering, soul shattering events though?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not upset or anything about it, but I find it funny that around episode three or four I mentioned that the main characters seemed too young for the story this anime was trying to tell. I ended up getting destroyed in the comments and everyone was upset at me for suggesting it. It's just interesting to see how as time went on the perspective seems to have changed.
>> ARTICLE
My standard approach to manga and anime is to add 3-5 years to the age of every character. I do it unconsciously and it makes the stories a lot more reasonable
>> ARTICLE
yeah, I much as I really do love this show my one gripe with it is the age these characters are.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely, how hard was it to make them 16 or 17? For me it would have been much more believable.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, Univeristy first or second year students would've made the most sense.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure, I don't think they look old enough or mature enough so the whole story would have to be changed. I think they still should be teen figuring stuff out, but not 14 y.o.
>> ARTICLE
Of course they don't look old enough, they were designed as 14 year old kids. The big problem I have is that 90% of the dialogue between important characters is far beyond the maturity of most high schoolers. They should have been writted to be 18 or 19 at the very least from the start.
>> ARTICLE
I really wish more anime would be set in universty/college, the highschool thing gets a bit weird sometimes. Especially when they are heavy on the romance. 
>> ARTICLE
Technically speaking if this was in the U.S. they'd be high schoolers. 9th grade is high school here.
>> ARTICLE
1) Teacher here, there are days where I'd rather deal with 8th graders rather than 9th graders.  There are few creatures on this earth as immature as a 9th grader.

2) It depends on where you are in the US; there are plenty of schools still around where middle school = grade 7-9.
>> ARTICLE
Maturity develops differently from person to person depending upon their experiences, I know I don't have to tell you that. With the two main characters having experienced so much pressure at an early age I think that they might be more adult in some ways and more child like in others. So I think that the age frame work of this story is still reasonable and it works well in a romantic fantasy setting, and especially well if there is a follow up story...
>> ARTICLE
7-9 is considered a Junior High. My school district transitioned to this system 7 years ago and the 9th graders are still basically treated as High Schoolers (for the most part). Their High School transcript starts at that grade, they join the High School sports teams, etc. Yeah, 9th graders are crazy though.
>> ARTICLE
it changes all over the place, even in Canada. One school district might have no middle school at all (1-7 elementary, 8-12 highschool) here in BC and then the next one over has it. Or one has Grades 9-12 for highschool while others are 10-12.

Golden Time dives right into the romance and that remains the core focus for most of the show. KimiUso likes to spend time on side characters and the romance doesn't really become a priority until the 2nd half. Personally I found Golden Time more enjoyable but to each his own.

**Episode 8: Let It Ring**

This episode introduces quite a bit of backstory for the main characters; more than new watchers will even realize. There's not a *whole lot* to analyze in it at face value. Mainly you're just meant to sit back and enjoy the music.

* It's worth pointing out that [Kaori doesn't sit next to Watari.](http://i.imgur.com/r3j6yvn.png)

* ["Phff...I guess he's kinda cool."](http://i.imgur.com/QWdS5T9.png) Watari developing a reluctant man-crush on Takeshi maybe? Is WaTakeshi shipping a thing? It wouldn't surprise me.

* ["It's your fault, you know. Takeshi never would've mastered the piano like he has if it weren't for you. Surpassing you is all he cares about."](http://i.imgur.com/O1YKug4.png) Note how she says this. It's Kousei's "fault" that Takeshi became like that, almost like she's blaming him...

* ["Did you hear me?!"](http://i.imgur.com/cCXgLmj.png) ["You were great out there!"](http://i.imgur.com/COyHp29.png) I think this is the first time Kousei has really acknowledged anyone else's existence at a competition, let alone praised their performance, which is probably why [Emi looks so surprised too.](http://i.imgur.com/JNkwV22.png)

* [Dammit, Watari. You can't just openly ogle other girls while Kaori is sitting right there.](http://i.imgur.com/Y3nGwxO.png) Fortunately, she seems to not care about his wandering eye. \*hint* \*hint* [spoiler](/s "Probably because she doesn't actually care about Watari. If Kousei started making googly eyes at other girls, I bet Kaori wouldn't be so cavalier about it.")

* [Even Kousei has a wandering eye, it seems.](http://i.imgur.com/lFz5olv.png)

* ["Not that I know what it's like to have a good foe." "Those *could* be mistaken as fighting words, Ms. Ochiai." "The mistake would be you *acting upon them*, Mr. Takayanagi."](http://i.imgur.com/SLzdApO.png) I like this lady.

* ["We women can be such combative creatures.](http://i.imgur.com/HeY2aFR.png) [Do forgive me...boy."](http://i.imgur.com/wPXDkZv.png) BTFO.

* "Back when I was 5 years old, I attended a piano recital to support a friend of mine. Just as I was nodding off from boredom, [*he* marched out onto the stage.](http://i.imgur.com/wRA7rFZ.png) The boy was so tightly wound, it made *me* nervous. That was his first time. Turns out, he had never played in front of a real live audience before. That long silence before his fingers touched the keys, as he stilled all the uncertainty in his heart. [The moment he pressed that first gleaming key, my destiny was made clear.](http://i.imgur.com/QDAxOUQ.png) My heart wouldn't stop pounding away, and my eyes filled with tears. My emotions poured out in a flood. His playing...it touched my soul. In that moment, I felt all the joy of music." [New watchers, remember this moment. It's more important than it lets on.](http://i.imgur.com/OkvYNB6.png) [spoiler](/s "This is the moment where both Emi and Kaori were set on their paths. Like a butterfly effect, four minutes of Kousei's life changes everything for them and has enormous repercussions, causing Emi to take up the piano and Kaori to put it down in favor of the violin. In a sort of tragic irony, while his playing was so beautiful that it inspired others, it's what prompted his mother to step up his training and essentially lock that joy away. It should be pointed out that I don't believe Takeshi was present there. His first meeting with Kousei isn't shown until a later performance in the OVA with a young Emi remarking that he "wasn't Kousei Arima anymore" by then due to his mother's training, and shows how both of their playing styles - Emi's and Takeshi's - were shaped upon their first experience seeing him: Emi as the open-hearted young boy who poured his emotions into his music, and Takeshi as the cool, unflappable professional who played with flawless precision. This ties back into my third bullet.")

* ["The truth is, I've been playing the piano all these years because I feel *nothing* like you. This is me rejecting you, Arima! You can beat me, utterly trounce me, but it isn't going to change a thing! Hitting keys like a robot just to win is worthless! I reject you with every note!"](http://i.imgur.com/ml6XCLm.png) She comes off almost like a scorned lover. Emi both loves Kousei and hates him. She loves what he used to be and resents what he became, almost like his rejection of emotion was a rejection of *her*.

[Image Album](http://m.imgur.com/a/1kVVh)

>> ARTICLE
i didn't realize why Emi loved/hated Kousei until the third time i watched it.  i don't know how I missed it.
>> ARTICLE
>  New watchers, remember this moment. It's more important than it lets on

New watcher here. I'm not sure what to make of it. She says she was really moved by Kousei's performance, but she just looked like a kid having a tantrum.
>> ARTICLE
Lol I suppose a tantrum is one way to look at it. Another is that Kousei's playing moved her so much that she couldn't contain her emotions and they all burst out of her at once. She didn't know how to control them, so she just started wailing.

Emi is a very emotional person. As her instructor, Ms. Ochiai says, the slightest little things can affect her mood and radically alter her playing as a result. It also means that she pours everything she has into her music, and is why she resents Kousei so much for playing so robotically.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I see. Thanks. Now I'm really curious how Kousei will play in the next episode and how Emi will react. 

Since the series is not even close to finishing, and since both Watari and Tsubaki failed at their respective sports, I predict that Kousei will play badly. Takeshi will be shocked and Emi will be mad and will start scolding Kousei.
>> ARTICLE
Personal Notes

* I can't decide on if I like Emi's character design or not. Takeshi's hair is so ridiculous it curves right back around into being great though.
* [Hint for first time watchers. Don't read this if you want to go into this series completely raw.](/s "Take a closer look at the people sitting around Emi.")
* Coda chapters 1 and 2 cover what was motivating Kousei's playing during his first public performance. The chapters are not safe to read for first time watchers yet, because it presupposes knowledge of the rest of the series. [Quick tl;dr of Kousei's motivation if you want to know right now.](/s "Kousei was playing for Tsubaki's grandmother, who had just passed away. When he finishes, Tsubaki smiles for the first time since his mother died.") This tl;dr is safe for first-time watchers, but I recommend you read the chapter instead when you can. [My own thoughts on that tidbit, spoilers all.](/s "It seems like Kousei produces his best work when someone close to him is dead or dying.")
* [Here's a live version of the full OP by Goose House! It's great to listen to.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnXkhkEvNIM)
>> ARTICLE
With regards to your last spoiler [](/s "not sure if that really is just your own thought so much as canon as it's been noted that Kousei needs grief in order to continue to progress as a pianist later on")
>> ARTICLE
Which is BS. [spoiler](/s "I mean, the loss of Kousei's mother didn't cause him to progress. In fact, it caused all his progress as a musician to come to a grinding halt. It wasn't until he grew to feel love for Kaori that his music moved forward again. I'm not sure why the series acts like he needs pain and loss to grow.")

[re:urs](/s "Well he can't really rely on that going forward unless he starts personally doing some murdering, so hopefully he matures enough to not need this emotional crutch.")

[](/s "it's been awhile but we never find out the actual result of the last competition in the manga/anime right? or where he ends up going to school? though I guess Nagi's comment that he might be coming would imply that he ended up going to his first choice in Japan?")
>> ARTICLE
No we don't and yes it does but he could just as easily be visiting. I think the result was implied heavily though.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, emi sorta has a fivehead

thanks for sharing that live version of the OP, it was great.
>> ARTICLE
> I can't decide on if I like Emi's character design or not.

I've come to the conclusion that Emi is very *motherly* based on later episodes. She compares pretty nicely with the older women like Hiroko and Yuriko, and I can see her being quite pretty if she only did something about those bangs.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's funny how Kousei made a big impact in the lives of Takeshi and Emi, yet he doesn't even know who they are. Apparently, he never socialized with the other musicians.
>> ARTICLE
WOW! Aiza and Emi are both incredible players! Its hard to believe these are kids playing the piano! This is talent that adults would envy! I really want to know who is/are the one(s) doing the actual music behind these fictional performances.

I liked Emis performance in the very beginning better, but after she started to speed up I liked most of Aizas piece better, but then when Emi really got into her song, I liked her playing better again.

It seems as though Kousei is seeing colors from Emis playing too. But its different from the way Kaori made him see color, right? When it was Kaori, she was making him see the colors of the world when before everything was dull, but with Emi, Kousei was already seeing in colors but the reds and yellows she makes are the pure expressions of her feelings. I hope I am interpreting that right.

Also, darn, we've really been watching for over a week now? I feel like we've only just started. 
>> ARTICLE
>the one(s) doing the actual music behind these fictional performances

There's a record out with the classical pieces from the series. Though I'm not sure, it sounds like a decent bet that the performers for the record would be the same than for the series (as the recordings seem to be specifically made for this release)

http://shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso.wikia.com/wiki/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso:_Our_Music_Book


>> ARTICLE
I really liked both of their performances as well.

Takeshi Aiza's performance feels different from Emi's. Takeshi's performance was fast throughout the whole piece. Emi's performance slows down a bit at some points. Also, Emi's song involved more lower-pitch sounds. 

I think their performances match what they're feeling. Takeshi's performance conveys stress and anxiety, while Emi's performance conveys anger and determination.
>> ARTICLE
The pianist for the series is apparently a young man named Tomoki Sakata. [spoiler](/s "He also paired up with Kawachi Eriko for Kousei's duet with Nagi later on.")
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! His playing is amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Forget childhood friend, childhood rival FTW. Team Emi!
>> ARTICLE
It's funny, because I didn't even recognize Emi as a romantic rival until like my third time watching the series.

The love hierarchy still goes Kaori > Tsubaki > Emi though. :p
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, Kousei doesn't either.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually a really good point to bring up. Remember the first episode where Tsubaki is telling Kousei that love makes your eyes sparkle, and Kousei says he "doesn't think he'll ever inspire that kind of change in someone?"

He had in fact inspired that kind of change in *many* someones. In truth, he's already got his own little harem of love-sick girls pursuing him, and he doesn't even know it.
>> ARTICLE
*This is not a discussion post, but...*
Does anyone know any animes like Shigatsu? I want to watch something beautiful with great characters, but I can't get into anything after watching this series..
>> ARTICLE
I've been looking for an answer for this question since this show aired. 20 anime later, shigatsu is still 2 whole points above my next favorite anime.

I recommend steins;gate in the feels department, it takes a while to get up to speed, but it'll pay off around halfway. I also liked KonoSuba, drop it if you don't like the first episode. AnoHana was okay. I was not a fan of clannad/as, angel beats and 5cm per second which are usually recommended to people who like shigatsu. 
>> ARTICLE
I've tried to watch some first episodes of animes and nothing compares to Shigatsu.. -sigh-
>> ARTICLE
If you are looking for a serious romantic drama with a similar musical motif and teenage/adolescent struggles then I wholeheartedly recommend [Nana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/877/Nana). It's a bit longer than average shows at 47 episodes but if you are able to invest the time then you won't regret one second of it.

If you're looking for a casual rom-com there is [Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakurasou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo)

If you want a heavy dose of *feels* you can check out the movie [5cm per Second](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/Byousoku_5_Centimeter)
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I'll remember Nana, then.

I watched 2,5 episodes of Sakurasou and it was a bit odd for me..

And I also didn't love 5cm per second. 

*whispers: please don't kill me*
>> ARTICLE
i watched clannad and clannad:as afterwards and it was just as rewarding.  it's twice as long though, 2 seasons.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend Nagi no Asukara. Gorgeous art and no shortage of middle school melodrama. 
>> ARTICLE
AnoHana if you want to die inside..
>> ARTICLE
I guess I could try to watch it.. Pretty often some aspect of the anime throws me off.. Either it is too weird, someone's voice gets on my nerves or the art style..  People have recommended Clannad, but the art style just doesn't fit me.. The eyes are huge and creep me out.
>> ARTICLE
My same exact reason for not getting into Clannad. Their eyes are like 2/3rds of their faces. I can't develop an emotional attachment to characters that just creep me the hell out.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah.. I like when animes look more realistic rather than plain creepy. :D
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I tried watching it but those eyes really freak me out too! O.O

I watched Anohana before Shigatsu. I thought Anohana was the peak of my soul getting crushed. Then Shigatsu came along.

I watched Shigatsu first but Anohana crushed my soul XD
We're the opposite I guess..

Didn't know this was going on! Just caught up to the first 8 episodes. PTSD is sure kicking in, but oh man, such good feels! 
>> ARTICLE
The only point I'd like to make is: 
If we connected Aiza and Emi, we'd have a perfect Kousei :) 
>> ARTICLE
I don't follow.
>> ARTICLE
Both of them 'fell in love' with Kousei's music for completely different reasons. 
Aiza because of how Kousei played perfectly according to the score, how he was able to achieve such high results due to following the composer flawlessly. This is explained in the series by 'wanting to be better, wanting to be higher etc', but for me, in reality, it's the matter of how perfectly Kousei played the sheet. Which is also why the first time we hear Aiza play, it's Etude 10-4, the one which is technically very difficult and hard to follow according to the sheet. 

Emi on the other hand was enthralled with Kousei's emotion, (sort of) chaos, naturalness (not sure if this word even exists), the complete opposite of what Aiza feels. It's how he was able to get her to feel the emotions she did the first time, how spontaneous and natural his playing must have been. So she plays Etude 25-5, the emotion one. 

If we were to combine the two ideals of Kousei they had (the technical one and the emotional one) we would achieve a perfect Kousei, albeit it's impossible, as you cannot be natural and play according to the sheet :) 
>> ARTICLE
This is one of my favorite episodes of the series. Not one but TWO incredible performances with great character development of Kousei's rivals throughout. 

And Emi's performance, man. Takeshi was great of course but after Emi slams that Winter Wind down I've forgotten all about it. Watching her play is something else. And that animation, too. 

[Winter is coming](http://45.media.tumblr.com/2d342d51ce212f95a78299de19750f73/tumblr_nfqw2l3InU1rw3w54o6_500.gif)
>> ARTICLE
The direction of the episode itself hands Emi the spotlight. Takeshi gets comparatively very little screen time on the piano. Most of his development happens before and after his performance, and even when he *is* playing it focuses more on Kousei and Emi talking about him while watching from backstage.

Emi is most definitely the focus of the episode. Takeshi is almost an afterthought.
>> ARTICLE
I would agree. Takeshi gets a little more focus later on but this was certainly Emi's episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't help myself, I finished the whole thing today ): 
>> ARTICLE
damn u
>> ARTICLE
Some trivia again:

[Atsuko Tanaka,](http://myanimelist.net/people/100/Atsuko_Tanaka) the VA of Emi's teacher also voiced Caster from Fate/Stay Night and Major Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell. I noticed immediately because I recently completed the F/SN visual novel. The part here when she calls Aiza's teacher "boy" I think is 100% a reference to F/SN. She even says it in the same way she calls Shirou.

I only just noticed, but I really like [the shading of the noses](http://imgur.com/SqlyUDP) in this show. I think it gives some much needed 3D depth. It's very refreshing because most of the time in anime the nose is a just dot or a curvy line and the character's faces look like they don't have a nose at all.
>> ARTICLE
yeah i noticed that the show has some amazing looking characters.  i never realized it was because of the nose shading.
>> ARTICLE
Watari's expression after Aiza's performance is exactly the expression of everyone watching this anime.

Strange shift of expression Aiza xD but he really didn't expect it I guess hahahaha

That pic of the top 3 as kids was so cute!

OH WOW KID KOUSEI SUCH A CUTE KLUTZ.

Kousei now has a harem. Also Aiza suddenly buddy-buddy with Kousei.

Watari just wants all the girls.

Amazing music. Will these two rivals appear more later? I kinda like their characters.
>> ARTICLE
>in fact Aiza has a girlfriend while Emi is single (as far as we know).

Was this in the show? I must have missed this part.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I don't remember this being in the show. Would like a source on that.
>> ARTICLE
She's the girl sitting with him at Nagi's performance. It's made more clear in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, other than being drawn better than the audience and a few lines of voice there isn't much else about her. I guess it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.
>> ARTICLE
im pretty sure it was mentioned in the show.  i guess we'll have to wait until that episode to make sure

edit: well that was dumb, i tried to look for the scene, then ED2 started playing, then i started crying, LOL.  my version of the anime has subtitles for the the OP/EDs.
>> ARTICLE
Haha gotta love those unexpected feels.
>> ARTICLE
Can we just notice that cluster fuck of a character?



Its a fucking mini essay. 
>> ARTICLE
Sorry friends, suddenly it was episode 10 for me ._.
>> ARTICLE
Too bad that the group have only done one ending(Silver Spoon ED) beside OP in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.

Wish they will do more OP/ED anime in the future <3.

[Oh and I love this cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MkWWrlx8qM), for anyone wondering it's the ED in One week friend, great anime btw.
>> ARTICLE
What do you mean by more OP/ED anime?  You mean more covers?  Because in the intro for Shigatsu it credits Goose House.  So that means they actually wrote this song right?
>> ARTICLE
I've got the Full ED here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7cOJRM85qg
>> ARTICLE
WE NEED MORE SHOBRO 
>> ARTICLE
The best version of "Kanade" I've listened to was an [acoustic rendition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtjzyniws9o) by the original band, Sukima Switch. Who also did the ED for Gin no Saji S1.
>> ARTICLE
The ED for Silver Spoon is fucking amazing.
>> ARTICLE
they do a lot of other good stuff and are very popular and well known mostly by female japanese. Maybe they want to do more for their main audience, so they dont do Anime stuff so often.
>> ARTICLE
They're getting more and more popular, but they're still pretty relatively unknown outside of YouTube and I guess USTREAM. Plus if [this is true](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-08-14/goose-house-to-perform-opening-cover-songs-for-shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-anime/.77630), then that means the OP and ED that they've done have been purposely written for their respective anime and it's not just one of their songs slapped onto an OP/ED
>> ARTICLE
They have done the [DBZ op](http://youtu.be/1nSF-Xta3IM) as well.  
[Naruto shippuuden movie song](http://youtu.be/hRtRadK1HFk)

hope they do moreee.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn first time listening to them and I absolutely adore them. Each of them is individually incredibly skilled, they have perfect harmony and sing beautiful songs. What a great day now that I found out about them.
>> ARTICLE
They're my favorite Japanese Singers. You should check out there other videos, there are tons of great covers & originals. 

My personal favorites.

Do you know of any similar bands? And any favorite non-covers? I could really use some recommendations based on these guys. I can't believe I haven't listened to these guys sooner.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, seems like every one of them can not only sing but also play multiple instruments.

Hope they do more OPs/EDs.
>> ARTICLE
You know, if they did a cover of Nichibro's ED I'd be really really happy.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man they covered ZONE!?

[Sotsugyou- ZONE](http://youtu.be/uH7xgGKEnz0)

Amazing!

Thanks for linking this song, absolutely beautiful.

Quality show. Quality post.

Thanks for this. Song is addictive and is one of my favourite OPs this season.
>> ARTICLE
You can just tell that these guys love what they do. They show so much passion in this video.

I've listened to this song so many times I've lost count.

goose house is seriously one of the best groups/bands that i have listened too in a while they have great voices and they have such a good harmony. and they cover alot of anime songs and make their own songs, 
seriously i don't see why anyone would not like them even if its in japanese they are just awesome. Goose house #1
>> ARTICLE
Hot damn their harmonies are so on point!
>> ARTICLE
Goosebumps every time!

Here is the live version of the song that they did for Silver Spoon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONNFHTOueXo&index=33&list=UUFDL0NuxUBAvvu1PnIwW2ww
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I love how they look like they're  really having fun playing that song.

Silver Spoon S3 when?!
>> ARTICLE
Fk, I want the 12string of that guy...
>> ARTICLE
The guy on the right looks like Flame.

edit: Flame from CJ Entus Blaze

Guy with jean jacket = Scara?????

*cough resets cough resets cough resets*

I was sitting here for the longest time wondering why he looked so familiar
>> ARTICLE
Should probably post a pic for comparison :D

Haha, I know right 
>> ARTICLE
So *that's* why he seemed familiar...
>> ARTICLE
God damn I love seeing people enjoy making music.

Also, the guy with the glasses is the coolest dude ever.
>> ARTICLE
Aww yiss. One of best OP song this season (especially since we have so many good OP this season). Raw, peaceful energy, and very memorable.

Ninja edit:  
And hot damn, I just saw that [these guys covered FUNKY MONKEY BABYS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIYejS2ujjo&index=25&list=UUFDL0NuxUBAvvu1PnIwW2ww). Shit. Now *that*.. hits a very close note with me.

Now if you allow me to digress a bit, Funky Monkey Babys disbanded in 2013 due to one of the members proceeding to carry his duty as a chief priest. FMB are mostly known for their good-natured + heartwarming music videos, and that is something that you rarely see nowadays. 

The shit part is that, all those videos almost always get taken down by their forever-stucked-ass-up publisher, Dreamusic so for the niche fan like me, we are SOL (especially since those videos only come in -limited edition- DVDs).

[Here's the original video that Goose House covered on Vimeo.](http://vimeo.com/90506825) 

Sadly, all the older good stuffs is gone now. Now with Goose House covering that song last August, I guess it is safe to say they can consider me as a new fan indeed.

Right, just a digression. If you get this far... thank you for reading.
>> ARTICLE
This is amazing. I've been considering watching this, and I think this just decided it for me.
>> ARTICLE
just wait till you get to episode 2 and hear the violin piece, that is when I realised the show was for me, very empowering.
>> ARTICLE
If you loved the piece in Ep 2, you'll really enjoy Ep 4. [spoiler](/s "they start playing together, he's off to a rough start, but pulls through into a violin vs. piano thing") easily my favorite anime this season.
>> ARTICLE
Just wait until it tries way too hard to be sad.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't try too hard to be sad at all.
>> ARTICLE
Edit: I just realised you probably haven't read the manga and so it isn't trying too hard to be sad yet.

Alright, let's see... So we have your typical boy meets girl - Alright, it can be pretty sweet if well written. But wait, she likes the protagonist's best friend, never seen that one before but I'll let it slide, it worked for Toradora. Next we have a broken childhood prodigy with a dead parent - Fair enough, happens in real life but still adds some more drama for you. Move on with your life protag. [Now for the hilarious shit - Manga Spoilers](/s "The love interest just happens to be a beauty who will inevitably fall in love with the MC, which again, can happen I suppose, BUT WAIT this adorable little girl is dying. Of what? Who knows, who cares, cute girl is dying so it's fucking sad and what not. All of this on top of the fact that she clearly never liked the stereotypical pretty boy in the first place and she's using him to get to the MC who she already knew just makes this a giant pile of predictable melodrama. ")

Now, I don't blame people for watching this. It's beautifully animated and... well, drama is popular for a reason. Just don't pretend it isn't trying way too hard to pull on the heartstrings. And if you haven't read the manga and the anime hasn't yet began to desperately abuse your emotions, then disregard this and keep watching all you want.
>> ARTICLE
"Trying too hard" implies that it's not doing a good job at it, but it *is* doing a good job at being sad, so... it's trying just hard enough?

Would you say Ano Hana tried too hard to be sad?  Because that was sad as fuck, but I still loved it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, fair point. But they shouldn't overload it with drama tropes otherwise it's hard to take seriously. Anohana didn't go overboard with the romantic drama and, despite being supernatural, was actually a lot more believable and realistic.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, if you didn't think that Anohana went overboard then I can't wait to see how much more Shigatsu does it.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's not so much that. It likely won't be as sad as Anohana. My problem is with the core of Your Lie in April. There are just too many unoriginal plot points and relationship dynamics. And the spoiler I posted above is just the icing on the cake. Sure, it can happen, but on top of all of these other coincidentally cliched things it's just insane.

Really though, I'm just particularly cynical about shows with drama. It's easy to go overboard with the sad tropes and I'm one that gets bothered relatively easily.

It'll most likely still be a great watch for those who don't care and just want "dem feels (_)"
>> ARTICLE
Yes there is a bit of melodrama and cliche as some one whose read the manga in the original Japanese I can attest to this fact but at the same time there are many refreshing and nicely played out concepts in this story that aren't all that predictable and aren't all that cliched.  Also being about a painoist who was abused by his parent hits a bit close to home for me.  The main difference is my parent is still alive.  I've got to say though, there are things in the anime that have been better represented then they were in the manga just by nature of it being a medium that allows for that.  The different play styles and the music in general is wonderful.  The visual metaphor is also quite a bit heavier than it was in the manga which almost makes it feel like a different story in some ways.  And of course there's the absolutely stellar and accurate animation when they play the instruments.  I've never seen something so accurate and even some live action shows would have trouble making it this believable.
>> ARTICLE
You might enjoy Sakamichi no Apollon if you haven't already seen it. The music is amazing in that.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I haven't read the manga and I'm not gonna look at that spoiler. We'll see if you're right.
>> ARTICLE
tbh I feel like it's going to be executed really well considering it was awarded Best Shnen Manga at the 37th Kodansha Manga Awards, and it hasn't disappointed at all yet
>> ARTICLE
Oh absolutely. It'll be fantastically executed, but that doesn't stop it being overly melodramatic and predictable.

I mean, look at Clannad. That was, in my opinion, an absolute pile of shit, but it was well executed and made a lot of people cry and grow attached to characters, therefore people think it's good.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the one in episode 2 was better in my opinion, only because the one in episode 4 was a dodgy start! But they'll get better.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished all so-far four episodes and I'm really glad I did. It's great so far and I love it! It reminds me a lot of Sakamichi no Apollon at times and some of the scenes are really beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
I always thought Goose House only had 2 vocals (male and female), which had me confused at the OP because it sounded like they had a lot of vocal range and echo which made it sound amazing.

Watching Goose House perform and finding out it's a group of seven, where **ALL** of them actually sing and can cover at least one vocal range? Holy shit, it suddenly all made sense
>> ARTICLE
These guys are having such a great time jamming, you can just see it. Doing it for the love of it! Beautiful song, sung by awesome people, can't get enough of it.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else want this song to play at the climax of the show?
>> ARTICLE
TIL: My Waifu speaks [English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-ed6J5zEE&t=2m45s) really, really well.
>> ARTICLE
I like the one that's like a Japanese Lily from HIMYM who's fucking awesome at guitar.
>> ARTICLE
How does anything get better than this I don't even know 
>> ARTICLE
I am just sitting here listening to all their songs... Awesome. Thx OP.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus this video is so good. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I just discovered these guys a few days ago doing a cover of Kiseki by Greeeen. I didn't know they did the opening for this anime, that's awesome!
>> ARTICLE
God I love goose house
>> ARTICLE
All the girls are cute :) 

Great song, but they needed microphones for their singing too i guess 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I thought these guys were cover artists from their other videos, but they did the original OP.

They're freaking good.
>> ARTICLE
They've got a couple original songs mixed in with their covers. Notably, the ED song for the 2nd Season of [Silver Spoon] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONNFHTOueXo)
>> ARTICLE
Hot damn this is awesome.


>> ARTICLE
Translated lyrics available anywhere?
>> ARTICLE
yeah, anyone know what it means when she points at her head?
>> ARTICLE
Since the song isn't officially out yet, I don't think anyone's working on a translation yet.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, they deserve better recording equipment :(
>> ARTICLE
Do you think audio quality is bad?  This isn't what they do for the actual songs, I would think they do those in the studio.  And I think they can project there voices far enough.  And there's multiple microphones in the room, and those are high quality.  They basically do this for all their videos and it seems to work right?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I think the audio quality in their videos is generally quite poor. The poor acoustics of the room and amateur recording equipment leads to the audio being very muddy. It's a shame because they're obviously very talented. It'd be nice if in future videos, they recorded in a studio with decent sound equipment.
>> ARTICLE
I think it is more the video quality. Even though it is "1080p" you can clearly see pixels on the far right guitar player and especially the keyboard player.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know an English band that does acoustic sessions like this?
>> ARTICLE
pentatonix
>> ARTICLE
First thing I thought of after seeing the video was Japanese *Walk Off The Earth*
>> ARTICLE
Its so awesome watching them do it live.

feels good seeing faces and not only masks. great cover.
>> ARTICLE
I think the bottom right two (guy + girl) stand out, but I love their harmony.
>> ARTICLE
I ended up watched so many of their videos... I mean, only the ones in which the girl in the backgrond was in.
>> ARTICLE
The first time I heard this song on the OP, I knew I'd fall in love with the anime. Definitely my favorite of this season.
>> ARTICLE
Congrats to Goose House for surpassing [1 million Youtube subscribers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW-ed6J5zEE&list=UUFDL0NuxUBAvvu1PnIwW2ww)! 
>> ARTICLE
Woah never knew the group was so big. 
>> ARTICLE
This group is really amazing, I hope to listen to a lot more of them in the future. This and the AmaBuri OP are my favourites this season.

I also feel that it fits the show perfectly, everything seems perfect.
>> ARTICLE
I'm shocked how good it actually is. My God, it is superrior !
>> ARTICLE
I loved the song, but I loved watching them play it more. They look like they're having such a good time making music!
>> ARTICLE
So refreshing <3
>> ARTICLE
I love this. And I love you
>> ARTICLE
I was hoping the trumpet is part of the original band ;___;
>> ARTICLE
All I need is an acoustic Twintails ED cover and I'd literally die on the spot.
>> ARTICLE
Great. Thanks for planting *that* idea in my head 
>> ARTICLE
If you haven't heard it yet, the full 4 minute version has an acoustic piano+voice segment at the end... hence the idea :)

Wow. They are so talented omg. I didn't think all of them would sing. Also this is my favorite opening from this season.

if you find out let me know

I think I might be in the minority here, but while I love this OP and the song they did for Gin No Saji/Silver Spoon, I find it hard to not be annoyed by some of the members' facial expressions in these videos. They're just so hammy! It's fine if you listen without watching though, because the harmonies are pretty, and they're good musicians.
>> ARTICLE
ah man I love Goose House ever since the ED for Gin no Saji (Silver Spoon). For anyone who hasnt seen Silver Spoon, should. Its really underrated. Hard to believe its the same author behind Fullmetal Alchemist.
>> ARTICLE
Said it somewhere else, will repeat it now...

It isn't fair to the other OP's of this season, because this song just blows them out of the water.
>> ARTICLE
Why have you done this to me. I've listened to this song close to 20 times now. 
>> ARTICLE
All of the OPs this season grew on me when really well when I considered last season, the season of OPs. This one is pretty awesome too. A bit less awesome because the visuals aren't there but still very catchy and works great with the show's atmosphere.
>> ARTICLE
It be even more impressive if the played Kreutzer haha, good nonetheless.

Did these people do the opening of SAO 2 ?

**Episode 5: Cloudy Skies**

Alright, yesterday was a gut punch, but thankfully today's episode is a bit more forgiving. Kaori seems to be getting back on her feet and we actually end the episode on a positive note. Things are looking up for our pessimistic protagonist, although Tsubaki is still struggling to process her feelings after the concert.

* In the episode 3 thread, /u/TheStigMKD brought up [a potentially symbolic relationship between Kaori and the recurring cat](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4fkzf2/rewatch_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_your_lie_in_april/d29uhl4), with cat motifs appearing several times during pivotal moments where Kaori pushes Kousei to move forward. Here we have an interesting example of Tsubaki pushing a young Kousei to do something impulsive and outside his comfort zone by jumping off the bridge, [and what's that on her shirt?](http://i.imgur.com/BnE8nSG.jpg) I'm thinking there might be something to that theory.

* [So sexy!](http://i.imgur.com/zvfsDTM.png) Yeah, no. It's just a bare back. Get ahold of yourselves, guys. Although I guess they *are* only 14, so this is probably the greatest day of their lives.

* Something I just now noticed on like my 5th viewing. I always thought it was [Watari on the left with the heart above his head](http://i.imgur.com/TZIMLHL.png) after they walked in on Kaori, but [it's actually Kousei.](http://i.imgur.com/xf8dny0.png) I guess bare backsides [are his fetish.](http://m.imgur.com/vqMOTbo?r)

* [That's what you get, Kousei!](http://i.imgur.com/zBBycKn.png) It's [Kaori's punishment-by-proxy.](http://i.imgur.com/BdKm10q.png) Next time don't be Jerky McDoucheington.

* ["Because it kinda feels like that's all I'm good for."](http://i.imgur.com/jluy4zq.png) I'm struggling with how to interpret their conversation. I think Kousei is wrestling with his true feelings for Kaori. He loves her, but hasn't really figured it out yet or at least hasn't been able to admit it to himself because he knows she's with Watari. But at the same time he feels like any interest he perceives towards him from her is purely because of his ability to play the piano, and he resents it for that. [spoiler](/s "The reason I find it kinda interesting is because it's basically true. His music is the entire reason that he and Kaori meet, and they literally share nothing else in common.") Another way to interpret it is that Kousei sees nothing in himself *but* the piano, and he's not sure if he wants that to define him. Outside of the piano, there really isn't a whole lot else to him. But like Kaori says, "Maybe that's enough?" \*shrug* Thoughts?

* [He then asks Tsubaki the same question.](http://i.imgur.com/U39DJNe.png) "Is piano all I'm good for?" But of course there's [soooo many other good qualities about him, like.....](http://i.imgur.com/62pYYbB.png) Great job, Tsubs. She has a real way with words.

* [Dammit Watari, you adorable goofball.](http://i.imgur.com/QJuJhd2.png) I can't stay mad at you, even if you *are* a constant roadblock between Kaori and Kousei.

* [Their interaction here sort of confirms my first interpretation.](http://i.imgur.com/8c0yOTT.png) Watari asks Kousei if he wants to go see Kaori later, telling him that "He's the one she turned to" when Kousei is reluctant due to failing her at the competition, and Kousei dismisses it as Kaori turning to him only because he used to be able to play the piano. Did I say Watari was a roadblock? I think Kousei is his *own* roadblock, more than anything. He's trying to convince himself that the only reason Kaori could possibly be giving him attention is because of her misplaced trust in his skills as a pianist, even while Watari is trying to encourage him to go see her.

* [Oh sweet pervy Watari...](http://i.imgur.com/MGMRaeQ.png)

* ["The piano is just one part of you, but in that moment I knew it was your entire universe. You're trying to rip it away and leave it behind. I see you tear at it. And the pain? It's more than you can hope to bare. It eats at you. You hide it, but your face is an open book. You think you can forget? No way. Not a chance! Because that moment?

The culmination of 9 years of work, the reason behind her entire lie, everything she's been living each day for revolves around this single moment with Kousei. It also references her wish not to be forgotten about after she's gone, which recurs several times throughout the series.")

* ["She's a force of nature. She stares right through me. And whether I like it or not, she trusts that I'm right behind her."](http://i.imgur.com/MnbhRCF.png) This is an interesting foreshadowing to later in the series [spoiler](/s "when he begins to see that all he does is follow her and starts to resist it, wanting to stand beside her instead.")

* ["I see. I guess I passed out again."](http://i.imgur.com/UtTKIaC.png) Kaori's deception is revealed. The viewer now knows that this *isn't* the first time she's collapsed, as she tells Kousei later. Someone is keeping a secret. [spoiler](/s "Say hello to death flag #3.")

* ["We're all just faking it. Some of us better than others."](http://i.imgur.com/QEuHXs1.png) This is something you realize more and more as you grow up. Everyone feels like they're a failure or a fraud, and everyone is afraid of making mistakes and screwing up, even the people that you imagine have everything together and know exactly what they're doing. You can't let that fear prevent you from moving forward, because it's not the times that you try and fail that haunt you as you get older, it's the times that you let your fear keep you from trying at all. [spoiler](/s "It's also potentially a reference to Kaori's lie. She is after all 'faking it' in a manner of speaking the whole time she's with Kousei.")

Not being a musician herself, Tsubaki could only push Kousei from behind and wait for him to take the first steps. But Kaori can lead and show him the way.

Why is Watari sweet for being pervy but Kousei deserves a punishment?!

Kousei deserved punishment for ditching Kaori all the previous week, preventing them from being able to practice and contributing to her collapse at the end of the last episode. It had nothing to do with being a perv.

>Dammit Watari, you adorable goofball.

He's so cool I can't even. [Spoilers](/s "I think Watari is really trying hard to ship KouseixKaori, but he just doesn't understand their relationship because he's never had one of that type. I think Watari sent that photo to Kaori because he wanted to make Kaori happy, and what would make Kaori more happy than seeing a goofy photo of Kousei?")

All in all, this is a very laid back episode compared to the previous one. Ideal for binge watching.

Damn man, you're getting really down on Kousei for not wanting to play the piano that's traumatized him since his mother died.

Even if it's Kaori who's asking, I have all sympathy for Kousei for being completely reluctant, having to be convinced and cajoled into playing the accompaniment, and breaking down during the middle of the piece considering his history.

Apologies for the delay today.

This episode (and the next one) are hands down my two favorite in the series. Despite the episode title, this is one of the brightest episodes in the series, and I absolutely love the bridge scene and the one that comes after it.

*Personal Notes*

* [Damn, would you look at that typesetting. Do the streams have anything like this?](http://i.imgur.com/sVXwnox.jpg)
* [spoiler](/s "Mad jukes, continued from the last bullet so first timers can't tell! Kousei promising to marry Kaori before she died would have been super sweet, but probably over the top and would have required Kaori letting on her lie before her posthumous letter. It's better this way, but I can't help but feel a little sad that Kaori wasn't able to get married in the end.")
* [This is the first time Kaori refers to Kousei by name instead of as "Friend A."](http://i.imgur.com/oslXOtS.jpg) A small detail that you might want to remember for later in the story.
* [Can't lie to kids.](http://i.imgur.com/KwQX2qk.jpg) This is so adorable.
* By the way, did anyone catch what book Kousei was reading on the way back? Walking while nose deep in a book seems pretty dangerous, though.
* [spoiler](/s "Can't stop the jukes! Continued from the last bullet. In my opinion, Kaori waiting for Kousei at the bridge absolutely one of the biggest tells, as if her definitely not waiting for him outside school last time wasn't enough.")

Great insight pulled from the old reddit thread, credit /u/DogzOnFire
> Interesting contrast between Arima having to be thrown into the river by Tsubaki, and willingly taking the plunge to follow Kaori. It's symbolic of how Kaori instils in him an urge to follow her to higher places, whereas Tsubaki has to force him.

OST Tracks I didn't actually catch in this episode but come in between the last one I noticed in a previous episode and the next one I caught in tomorrow's episode:

22. Natsu no Hizashi (Summer's ???)
23. Kisetsu ga Kawaru (???)
24. Suimen (???)
25. Uso to Honto (Lies and Truth)
26. Kimi ga Iru (You are here)

>> ARTICLE
When Kaori junps into the water, the track "Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso" is played (yes, that's the name of the track, apparently it's still  = april...). Although it appears to be a variant i can't find online.

I love the camera movements, light beam and cartoony style during that scene.

Natsu no Hizashi () means sunlight / sun rays of the summer.
Kisetsu ga Kawaru () means change of season.
suimen () means water's surface. 
Unofficial translations of course.
>> ARTICLE
The track "Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso" gets reused a lot throughout the series and it's named after the series title, so I wouldn't use that to peg what time of year it is.

Thanks for the translations!

I finished rewatching it two days ago and could've sword the first time she called him Arima Kousei was at the end of episode 3 when she was requesting for him to accompany her when she was about to lose confidence. Double checked and you are correct, this is indeed the first time.

Watari is making me very uncomfortable. He doesn't seem like a bad dude, per say, but it's obvious that some sort of conflict between him and Kousei is inevitable.

So, we start with Kousei jumping and we end with Kousei jumping. We start bright and we end up bright again. It's the middle that's gray with cloudy weather. It's the middle when Kousei thinks and ponders instead  of enjoying life/jumping of the bridge. I like that moment when Kousei finally remembers and understands he will never be able to forget the feeling of being of stage the whole world becomes bright, starting with Kaori's figure. 


It's interesting that when the trio leaves the hospital, Tsubaki takes Watari but leaves Kousei with Kaori alone. Smart girl!


Watari shiping that KouseixKaori ship. Kousei's thinking that Watari has Kaori's number/mail, but doesn't consider the fact that it's HIS photo (Kousei's) that is being sent to Kaori. Talki about misunderstandings. The whole thing of taking Kousei to the hopistal is just Watari helping the ship sail away. Also, Watari saying how Kousei and Kaori create a great combo, on stage and off stage, I guess?

"I know that but you'll never know" - is this about Kousei's piano or Kaori's feelings about Kousei?

"Don't hold back because of me. Let's go together" - basically, it's Watari saying, "Go for it bro, beat me and get her".



Also, [possible spoiler](/s "best bro girl") Kashiwagi appears! I never considered how I liked her. She's just a Watari twin for me.


Last thing, do you think that Kaori saw Kousei with that sandwich at school? Or she just went with Japanese traditions and was waiting for a welcome-back gift?

This love trangle is turning into a love hexagon or something!

I'm not fully sold on the weird blend this how has of lighthearted comedy and gut-wrenching drama.

Like one second, Kousei gets hurt physically and I laugh it off, in the next scene, there's questions about love and how to feel and act.

I think this show pulling it off somehow, thanks to the depth of the characters. It would have been so easy to make Kaori into a tsundere, but she's not. She can be violent, but she is very emotional.

Again, loving the usage of weather and lighting to signify sadness(rain), questions(dark sky+ stars) and love(sun/spring).

Loved the ending. The growth is real.
>> ARTICLE
The whole "now I'll never be a bride" joke is a little funny, but a lot less so if you think about it as if she really means that. That would be a seriously distressing thing. 

But gosh darn it, I HATED that Kaori was smiling and goading while Kousei was getting kicked! He is having enough problems with feeling unimportant and dejected! Those feelings are too real. Losing it at the piano recital was a traumatic experience for him, he didn't do anything bad!

At least the scenes where Kaori is sweet to Kousei are much more nice. I hope he will find a way to continue to be happy. 

The animation on the childhood scene was a lot different from the rest so far, I liked it a lot, that style is cute. 
>> ARTICLE
As much joy that Kaori brings to the series, nothing beats a decent Tsubaki-centric episode. I enjoyed her softball match as a metaphor for her relationship with Kousei: so close to reaching the final base, but was taken out at the last minute by another player. 

Also, double rival hype. 
>> ARTICLE
I gotta admit, I was originally 100% aboard the Kaori train my first couple times watching the series. Now though, dammit if I can't help but root for Tsubaki a bit. I'd still say Kousei and Kaori are the ideal couple, but Tsubaki is so super cute too that I'd be happy with either of them.
>> ARTICLE
Team Tsubaki!
>> ARTICLE
Maybe if she'd stop throwing balls and otherwise beating him up, she'd have *something* over Kaori?

Seriously, which god did Kousei piss off that they made every single woman in his life a tsundere?

Probably pissed off Aphrodite enough that he needed to suffer, but not enough to be denied love entirely.

**Episode 6: On the Way Home**

Another great episode with some major emotional payloads. Picking immediately up where the last episode left off, Kaori heads home with Kousei after their dunk on the river.

* Word of advise, Kousei. When a girl is comfortable enough to go home with you, [get naked in your house](http://i.imgur.com/U5wnkxf.png) and [wear one of your shirts](http://i.imgur.com/HB1E19R.png) while you dry off her clothes, it means she's either a really, REALLY close friend (Tsubaki close) or she likes you. So no more moping about how all you are is a piano to her.

* ["So now that you're all dried off, want coffee?"](http://i.imgur.com/qA3iyGt.png) Coffee in the evening? Kousei, you dog. Watari would be proud.

* ["Look at you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! You poor thing..."](http://i.imgur.com/Te4vkwF.png) This scene has always sort of confused me. I'm not sure whether Kaori is referring to Kousei here and apologizing because she only just then understood how painful returning to the piano must have been for him after witnessing how badly he tried to bury it, *or* if she's referring to the piano itself and apologizing to it for being in such a neglected condition.

* [A closer look at Kaori's bag.](http://i.imgur.com/ltV67C0.png) You can see she has a little plush cat charm as well as the flower hair clip [from her previous performance.](http://i.imgur.com/kvrV7sL.png)

* [Like an angel.](http://i.imgur.com/TdE0V5o.png)

* ["How *do* I want to play this piece?"](http://i.imgur.com/41QIpga.png) Indeed.

* ["You're right. He's suffering. But that pain is where the music will come from."](http://i.imgur.com/bdBJE9q.png) [spoiler](/s "This eerily calls forward to Yuriko's comments later about Kousei's growth being fueled by pain and loss.")

* ["Hey Saito...you wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend?"](http://i.imgur.com/LpEGZzS.png) I like the punctuation of this scene with the railroad warning lights, like it's shouting at Tsubaki, ["STOP! YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE!"](http://i.imgur.com/RGijd34.png) She's only going out with Saito as a way of running from her feelings about Kousei and Kaori.

* ["Do you resent me? Tsubaki told me this has been kinda rough for you. Don't tell me it's not. When I saw your music room, I knew it for sure. You can't hear the piano, so you've tried to abandon it. But you wanna play, even now. You can't get rid of it completely, so you hide it under dust and clutter. You love it, but can't go near it. You miss it, but can't touch it. It tears you up. I *see* that. No matter how much I pretend not to. And all I do is tell you junk like, 'Let's go on a journey...' You're hurting because of *me*! I'm sorry!"](http://i.imgur.com/Y4dO2tx.png) It's so sweet that even after assuring Tsubaki that pain is part of the process, the thought that Kousei was suffering because of her rattled her so much that she had to [rush all the way back to the school](http://i.imgur.com/8ddWfBJ.png) and [tearfully apologize.](http://i.imgur.com/1xUKFBU.png)

* ["Just don't forget who wiped away that dust, alright?"](http://i.imgur.com/5Fop1kg.png) Hear that? That's the sound of panties dropping. There's no way [this didn't end in late night make-outs,](http://i.imgur.com/xpd1bZj.png) if there's any sense in the world.

* [Gah! The cursed light of the day star!](http://i.imgur.com/lWzMEZx.png)

* ["A famous violinist once said, 'Music is the universal language.' Weaving your notes into another person's, you really get to know them. It feels like your hearts are connected. Like your souls are overlapping. Instruments harmonizing as one? It's just miraculous! In that moment, there's nothing left to say."](http://i.imgur.com/EDiSL9P.png) This kills the Tsubaki. It must crush her to know that despite all their history together, in only a month or so this new girl has gotten to know and share something with Kousei in a way that she'll never be able to. They understand each other on a level that's incomprehensible to her.

* "I don't like this. I *don't* like this! And I know it's not my place to feel all funky about it. But this isn't a logical thing. *I just don't like it!* We were a team, Tsubaki and Kousei. Through the laughter, and the tears. And now I'm up in the nosebleed seats. I'm not there for him now, not the way *she* is. I don't like this. Come on, Kousei! Look at me! I'm right here! I've been here the whole time!" [You're out, Tsubaki. Game over.](http://i.imgur.com/oSNhOdE.png)

* [Kaori sent Kousei to find Tsubaki alone.](http://i.imgur.com/1Jgod1N.png) [spoiler](/s "She's obviously realizing that, despite her best intentions, she's managing to come between them, and this is her attempt at patching up the damage she's caused. I feel sorry for both of them. Knowing that Kaori loves Kousei too, it must be difficult for her to have to knowingly sabotage herself like that.")

* ["You never have to hold back with me, okay? Over the years, you've always had to worry about me so much. Maybe you should let me worry about *you* for a change? I might just be the flakey kid brother to you but...I'll try hard. I'll give it my all, because I think that you deserve to be happy. After all, I can't hitch a ride on your shoulders forever."](http://i.imgur.com/LOkuFjj.png) Geez, Kousei is suddenly killing it with the ladies.

* ["I guess there's just something in the air."](http://i.imgur.com/y0wnJcE.png)

* ["Who cares about music? Or even words? Kousei and I, we've spent more time together than I could ever count. So many precious memories that are *just ours*."](http://i.imgur.com/NH6graa.png) Tsubaki realizes that just because Kousei and Kaori have a common bond in music doesn't invalidate all the moments she and him have shared together. They understand each other in a special way as well, as demonstrated by Kousei knowing that Tsubaki had hurt herself even though she had hidden it.

* ["I'm torn up over the loss. Crushed, really. My ankle hurts, and my eyes are filled with tears. Never felt worse.](http://i.imgur.com/mlqxVZK.png) [So why are the stars sparkling *so brightly*?"](http://i.imgur.com/ACxfzcV.png)

* "I just wish time would stand still for me." The irony of course being that time *is* standing still for Tsubaki. Her reluctance to come to terms with her feelings for Kousei and take the next step with him for fear of damaging the friendship they've enjoyed since they were children is keeping her frozen in place, and she can only watch now as Kaori leads him into a future without her.

* And because romantic rivalry alone isn't enough for a great drama, let's introduce Kousei's professional rivals: [Takeshi](http://i.imgur.com/osKXEcT.png) and [Emi](http://i.imgur.com/lUlTMXr.png). We're going to be seeing a lot more of them.

Hmm I never thought about this scene that way. I only saw the train going from right to left. In anime (and I'd say Japanese art in general) usually movement going right-left means moving forward while left-right means getting stuck in the past. We also see Tsubaki walking from right to left while her boyfriend is walking from left to right. Maybe if we make a compromise we can say Tsubaki is trying to move forward by rekindling an old relationship.

>Geez, Kousei is suddenly killing it with the ladies.

Dude even got away with calling a girl fat.

Edit: Some random trivia:

*  [Takeshi's VA](http://myanimelist.net/people/672/Yuki_Kaji) is the same as Eren from Attack on Titan, so yeah, hype.

*  [Emi's VA](http://myanimelist.net/people/869/Saori_Hayami) voiced Yotsugi from the Monogatari series and Chiriko from AnoHana.

He survives that with a mild beating because he also acknowledged her as a girl in the next breath, which was a step towards what Tsubaki had wanted during the game; for him to notice her.

haven't seen AoT in a while, I didn't realize that was him.

also, Yotsugi's voice is pretty unique, and I was able to recognize it when I was watching DanMachi right away, but I didn't realize she was Emi.  Weird.

I didn't catch that. I thought Kousei came of his own accord.

She hides her feelings when she starts airing out the room, but seeing the room and Tsubaki telling her that she thinks Kousei is suffering on the way home lead to her heart-to-heart with Kousei at school that night.

Nope. Unless maybe the subtitled version is translated differently. In the dub, Tsubaki asks where Kaori is and Kousei tells her she went home and told him to come find her by his lonesome.

Again, my favorite episode in the series alongside episode 5.

*Personal Notes*

* I put this up in the manga/anime differences but I do totally want to note that in [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/d9a0YvH.jpg) in the manga Kaori introduces herself as Tsubaki's new neighbor () instead of just remarking that she's right next door.
* [What a](http://imgur.com/DX27Qh8) [fucking player](http://i.imgur.com/J1k5a9t.jpg). Kousei's got girls all over him and Kaori hasn't been in Watari's house now has she?
* [Wan!](http://i.imgur.com/EbdWNLK.jpg) This is the first Snoopy reference by Kaori, of many more to come. It's pretty neat that the author included so many shoutouts to a Western comic strip.
* KimiUso : Peanuts :: Evangelion : the Bible.
* [Remember this scene.](http://imgur.com/VddLowG)
* [Kaori does realize that putting Kousei through this and up to performing again, even if she thinks it's all for the better, has been difficult for Kousei.](http://i.imgur.com/zNoUqXZ.jpg) Luckily for her Kousei agrees that this is the way forward.
* [Kaori's at her best when she's not beating the living shit out of Kousei.](http://imgur.com/wgaIosK)
* I'm sorry Tsubaki, I didn't have anything to say about your scenes this week. Poor Tsubaki still gets outshone by Kaori in her own episode imo.

OST Tracks  
This episode is about where I completely lose track of new tracks as they're introduced. Aside from this first track, which plays when Kaori is getting dressed at Kousei's, I'm basically just selecting a handful more that I think match up with this episode but really I have no idea.

27. Omotta yori Ookii na (It's bigger than I thought)
28. Yuujin A ~Piano Solo
29. Nande Tokuige Nanda?
30. Kousei wa Tensai da yo!

Watching this makes me wish I didnt quit piano back in grade 6.

This anime is so different from everything else I've watched. Dont think I've seen a totally down to earth, actionless, powerless anime yet.
>> ARTICLE
Watching it made me wish I had taken *any* instrument while in school. I feel like I'm way too old now to even try picking one up, but occasionally I'll hear a kid at work practicing as I come in and it just makes me sad that I never got to have that sort of life experience.

I agree that it's an unusual anime. Prior to *Your Lie*, my only other experience with romance anime was always the cutesy, trope-happy comedy harem type. You always had the same scenes, like one or more of the girls conveniently falling on top of the protagonist and him accidentally getting a handful of boob, or the beach episode where all the girls run around in swimsuits and it's total fan service. I'd never really watched a romance anime where everything was depicted so seriously, and I think that's why it had so much more of an effect on me.

Usually I finish a series and I'm just depressed for a day or two because I don't have anything else to watch. *Your Lie* broke me for a solid week my first time.

Did Kaori just quote Snoopy? I love this show!

The fast-paced comedy this show does is really good. More of that. Less depressed/trauma stuff. Pls.

For real though, the show is handling Kousei's growth very well. His pain dealing with the piano is executed amazingly. Him struggling to find reason is very interesting, even though I'm pretty sure his reason for trying is currently called Kaori.

Subaki is hurting really bad. I hope she can work something out and come to terms with her feelings. I'm sorry for the guy she's "dating". 

So glad I'm watching this. One hell of a ride.

Small suggestion, do with it as you will, but I recommend never starting a review from a defensive position because it can sound like you're not entirely committed to your own opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, well, Shigatsu has a large fanbase of people ready to downvote any post that's even the slightest bit critical about their show.  

I'll take your advice though.  I won't do it again in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone who would downvote on sight is someone who is clearly not prepared to give your review the time of day anyway. Thus, fuck 'em. A review is *your* take on something, not *their* take on it.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like most people don't realize that all reviews are just opinions backed by reasoning, and instead assume that author (in this case /u/__U_WOT_M8__) doesn't know what they're talking about if they don't agree.

On top of that, there's also the people that don't even read the review, yet downvote based entirely on the numerical score given. That's a big reason that I hate scoring systems in general. I don't care if others use them, but I don't look at them. The review itself is much more important as far as I'm concerned. 

I just wish that more people understood what a review actually entails, and didn't downvote at the first sign of disagreement. It's kinda like censorship of an opinion, and it's not okay.
>> ARTICLE
Truth. I'm one of those people who loves Shigatsu, but why is my opinion more valid than anyone elses? 

That being said, OP, it's clear you put a lot of time and effort into your review of the show. I think the only thing that I would have done differently is put subheadings over the already organized sections to make the review a bit more aesthetically beautiful. Don't worry about the down voters, they might just not be as open minded as you are. :)
>> ARTICLE
But that's the beauty of reddit, there is always a chance, that a good post gets buried just because the author wasn't trying to appeal to people who would obviously disagree with him. 

Basically karma system in a nutshell. People are afraid to posts what they actually want to say, just because of the chance, that their opinion will be downvoted and never read by anyone who would care about it. 
>> ARTICLE
/r/anime tends to have a lot of great people in /new though so its bound to never get completely ignored if it is good material.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're a little bit harsh on the show, but your criticisms are very valid. 

Ultimately Shigatsu suffers from something most anime dramas suffer from when their main focus is a heavy subject: they chose the jackhammer over the chisel. 

It just lacks subtlety. Aside from Kaori's death flag, or rather, her death plane banner, it felt like every episode someone was crying and it wasn't limited to one crybaby, it was every single important cast member. No one was safe from the waterworks. Which isn't necessarily a problem when you're dealing with 14 year old kids, yet they treat them as elder philosophers when it comes to expressing their emotions in words. 

The show was way too geared on making you *feel* with the characters and their lives instead of being confident that by showing them being themselves, the characters are solid enough to make you live their lives with them. 

Like you said, the cardinal rule of 'show don't tell' is violated too often in a way that's inconsistent with how the characters behave as a whole.

The humor was a way of providing relief from the drama, but it ended up feeling jarring because they never actually lifted their foot of the gas pedal in regards to trying to dramaticize the situation. The tonal shift was too harsh, so the humor fell flat. 

However, I do feel that the animation wasn't just nice, it also provided some stunningly symbolic imagery, so I think you're a little harsh on that regard. 

And I'm also a sucker for music anime, so that automatically elevates it in my book. 

All in all, good review, but I'd have reserved some more praise for the things it did well. Also, maybe try to include captions that summarize a particular complaint as to not make it appear such a wall of text?
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I agree 150% on 75% of your points but the other 25% seems overly harsh even for me who was debating to drop Shigatsu around the middle half. 

First of all, I don't understand why people think **every single character** has to be fleshed out. As long as they have a point in the story (i.e. influence main character/story) they are a strong character. I can't think of a single narrative/literature featuring a large world with 100% fleshed out characters. Because its a waste of time ; we'd rather hear about the main characters. I like Takeshi and Emi as characters and I do agree that they could've been further fleshed out but they were placed as emphasis for Kousei's character development early in the series. I didn't like Nagi as a character though so I can agree with that.

The biggest problems for me in Shigatsu are the slow pacing and messy use of comedic relief. While I did feel like slow pacing works well 99% of the time for Shigatsu and helps forge a stronger, more passionate message during its crucial moments, it got really tedious and annoying after a while. I watched one episode of Kousei struggling to play piano, cool. This conflict is interesting. Oh look he solved it, beautiful. *2 episodes later* Wtf he cant play again didnt we already do this? The comedy just ruined half of the dramatic moments for me as well. Like, I'm on the verge of crying in the last episode and this idiot makes an unfunny BL joke. Really? 

I don't think the 14 year old pseudo - elizabethan dialogue every really disturbed my viewing process but the backflashes of a few years showing such a gargantuan difference in height was rather jarring.

That reminds me. The biggest issue I had with Shigatsu was its inclination towards using flashbacks as a story teller. I love flash backs don't get me wrong. I gave Mawaru a 10 and I'm on the verge of giving Yuri Kuma an 8.5. But Shigatsu's flash backs didn't really do anything for me. I didn't sympathize with the rather abrupt backstory of middle school Kaori that seemed all too cliche for school. 

Really if you looked at the story from an inside-outside perspective, Tsubaki is the only 3 dimensional character. Her backstory is told better from her adventures with her friends and interactions with Kousei as opposed to those flashbacks. Watari is a typical sports player lady player. Kaori is a genki girl who likes music and apparently had an entire narrative to tell on the last episode that made 0 impact at all on me.  

This is just an opinion at the bottom here but I really don't think you needed the "x is decent but not amazing" points. Your analysis is pretty spot-on and in-depth already. Those generic opinion based points are rather detrimental to your focus imo. 
>> ARTICLE
I was legitimately mad when Kashiwagi made that random BL joke in the last episode. It was so out of place and I wasn't emotionally ready for a joke after what had just happened. I definitely agree that they shouldn't change the tone so quickly. The ending also kind of felt anti-climactic to me. Other than that 10/10 would live in denial about her death again

pretty much the only piece of humor that felt out of place to me in the whole series was that joke.

Down-kaori and reported. 

But seriously, this is a nice review, your points were supported well, but I noticed you didn't address the fact that they're only 14 but talk like scholars. I couldn't get through the first five episodes.
>> ARTICLE
He did mention it though. He said the monologues didn't feel natural and felt like the characters were older than 14, which is similar to what you said. 

This show in a nut shell: bad dialogue, no concept of subtlety, but a decent watch for anyone who wants to cry and get all emotional. 
>> ARTICLE
I would agree here.

Honestly, there seemed to be very little reason to have the characters be 14. In all honesty, making them all be like 18-21 might have actually made a bit more sense.

However, their ages are ultimately not really relevant to the story or anything, so I don't know. 
>> ARTICLE
>  bad dialogue

I don't think the dialogue is necessarily bad. It's more that most people "can't/won't" acknowledge stage-play flowery monologues/dialogues. It would definitely fail in a grounded drama, but works in a show like KimiUso (atleast for me) where everything is set in this way.

I mean you don't have to like it but just saying "it is bad" isn't really convincing for me in this case.
>> ARTICLE
To respond to your point about Shigatsu having theatrical dialogue, I recommend you to check out my response to /u/Redcrimson's comment on the first posting of my review.

Oh yea, don't get me wrong, it is totally fine for you to dislike it. I just wanted to bring light to another side of the coin. Probably.

I know, I was just supporting why I said the dialogue in Shigatsu is poorly written.

I felt the dialogue was bad because it didn't fit the characters and much of it was long winded, boring, overdramatic, and pointless (depending on the specific dialogue).

Woo I was waiting for your review to go up. Overall this is what I felt as well but I think the fact they're like 14 years old made everything less believable and the story would've benefitted with an older group of characters, but we all know life stops after high school in Japan
>> ARTICLE
> Concerning the foreshadowing for Kaoris death, I honestly feel that it couldve been done better. Her looming death is blatantly obvious, and just thrown in your face.

I think it's funny because if it wasn't that blatantly foreshadowed a lot of people would have said "It was just for the shock!". Overall I didn't really had a problem with it being that obvious. My focus was more towards Kousei and Tsubaki anyway

> Sound: 7/10, suits the show well but no standout tracks

I found some of the tracks really good. Like Spring's Melody (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso OST - Spring's Melody (Original) on YouTube if you want to look it up).

Also I never had a problem with the monologues or what some call "unnatural" dialogue. The show never really was grounded in the first place when you think about the stage lightning on the crowd in the middle of a performance.

(Sorry for my bad english, it's not my first language~)

Subtle foreshadowing does not equate to shock.  Something that's shocking has no foreshadowing at all, like Madoka Magica's episode 3 if you've watched it.

A better example of shock value would be most of kill la kill. A good show, but much of the story was shock value and the creators knew it.

I was exaggerating. I agree that it could have been done a lot more subtle but it didn't really bother me.

Err, the events of Madoka ep 3 were subtly foreshadowed in the proceeding episodes.

Hint - framing.

There is a LOT of shock value in Madoka but episode 3 was fairly obvious (the overall underlying tone of the show anyway was obvious, the thing that actually happened was subtly foreshadowed but in a pretty obvious way as well). 
>> ARTICLE
I love the monologues. It's not like today's pop culture shit. It feels like reading a classical novel. To me, criticizing Shigatsu wa kimi no uso for its complex dialogue is like criticizing Heart of Darkness for its rich vocabulary. It just completely misses the point of the entire piece. This anime's dialogue mirrors the emotion that it's music is supposed to convey. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, it's nice to see an actual review instead of bashing on the anime without stating reasons. Thanks!

Even though our opinions differ greatly, I can still understand where you're coming from with your most of your points. Only thing is that I'm not a musician or didn't listen to classical music before this, so I never noticed the pieces starting over haha. 

I personally loved all the monologues of this show. I used to write a lot of poetry and was always trying to deepen my messages, so I really appreciate the poetic lines in this series. 

I really like how you pointed out about the meanings behind the classical pieces that were chosen. I didn't know that, so that was really, really interesting! I'll probably look more into it myself :)

My only gripe about the show is the misplaced humor. But that was pretty much it. Either our opinions differed or I didn't mind with the rest of your criticisms. 

Thanks for the review. Looking forward to the next one!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I feel the massively popular ratings it is getting right now are just huge knee jerk reactions to the last episode (I think it jumped from like an 8.66 to and 8.89 after the last episode aired) where many feels were indeed to be had. 

Overall I agree with a lot of your points, especially the ones concerning the side characters, but I feel that your criticisms on complete realism are a bit too much for some parts.

Slightly.

You gave Kiss x Sis a 7/10 and somehow Shigatsu gets a 6.4.....I DON'T KNOW MAN, SEEMS A  LITTLE OFF.

For some reason I can imagine that your review of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso would go much differently if the anime wasn't well received; more or less I am calling you a contrarian-hipster based on the tone of your "review."

This doesn't mean that your complaints are invalid, and to some extent I can understand why you say some of the things you do, but overall you are coming off as hyper-critical towards this specific anime, whereas I'm sure if it was less popular, you would be less focused on everything that you believed to be "bad." Objectively speaking was this anime perfect? no, but it is surely well above the vast majority of average anime. Personally, my biggest issue with the show was pacing (when being watched on a weekly basis), but otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed both the characters and dialogue. 

In response to your issue with characters not being fleshed out; my rebuttal would be that only Watari didn't get substantial character development (at least among the 4 original characters). Now at this point in the discussion, it's hard to determine whether we really needed him to be more fleshed out. Would it have benefitted the overarching story? Overall, would it even have been necessary to flesh him out? We all knew from the beginning that he wasn't the guy Kaori was after, and If you didn't know that, then perhaps you should pick up on the obvious (but I'm sure you knew). I would even argue to say that Watari always knew that he was just Kaori's excuse to talk to Kousei, which is shown through the several bits of advice and hints that he gives our MC. His purpose was fulfilled very early on, and to be completely honest, anything more on him would have just been unenjoyable considering that he was doing his own thing and dating other girls, while fully acknowledging that Kousei had feelings for Kaori, even if he hadn't yet admitted it. He wasn't a character with any real issues, therefore he required no significant development and it would have detracted from the main plot if they decided to over-complicate his character and the situation.

Kaori was indeed a plot device for the growth of Kousei, but as I said, if you paid enough attention you could easily tell what her intentions were all along and that the last revelation wasn't even a revelation, because anyone following the story closely knew everything that was said by watching their interactions and listening to what they were saying, so the ending was not a cop out because it's not as if it was some hidden truth that no one could have known. It was all there and easy to see from the moment Kaori and Kousei saw each other. Even if you didn't pick up on it early on, episode 11 makes it pretty damn clear that she loves him after he says that she was what was in his heart...i.e. her first death flag. 

Would I have liked a little more interaction between Kousei and Kaori in the second half? Yes, but not everything that is good for the soul is good for the story. The purpose of their diminished interaction was to emphasize the internal struggle Kousei was going through once more upon realizing the girl he loves is dying, and it's not as if Kaori wasn't trying to see him, so to say she didn't develop much after the death flags is a little unfair. She was going out of her way to contact him regularly in order for him to visit her, even though she was slowly giving up on trying to survive. The second half of the anime heavily relies on the idea that Kousei and Kaori switched places and that it was now her who was in a pit of despair and needed help getting out, while also showing Kousei struggling to be there out of fear of losing her. 

Now on to Tsubaki, and well everyone else. Now from what I read, you are saying that they did not benefit the story whatsoever, and should not have been there. To be fair, at first I would have definitely agreed with you because I personally did not like Tsubaki all that much, but upon finishing the anime and watching it once more in order to pick up on some things I might have not seen the first time, I realized that all of those characters were in some facet useful and "necessary" to some extent. Tsubaki did have substantial character development, and while I still don't like her all that much, her purpose in the story was to show that no matter what happens, Kousei will never be alone (which goes back to how he originally felt upon his mother dying). The other characters, such as Nagi and everyone else, were there to show Kousei's growth more than anything else. Yeah, they did a little bit of development with them (to make them less random), but as I said, they were there to accentuate Kousei's growth as a person; going from a depressed loner who wouldn't listen to anyone's advice, to someone who was not only willing to receive help, but also help others out who were struggling. All of these people were there in order to help the audience understand how far he had come, and that even with the death of Kaori, he still had people there for him and people who depended on him.

You say that the monologuing was pretentious and unnecessary, but to me it feels as though you took everything at face value in this anime without ever really looking into the subtleties that are expressed both symbolically (not just the musical symbolism) and through the monologues. Almost everything said had a deeper meaning and foreshadowed changes to come. (example: the first time Kousei and Kaori meet, she is crying and non-chalantly claims that she was playing the melodica too strenuously, when in reality of the show, she was crying because she finally was able to meet Kousei...just subtle things that aren't necessarily apparent at first)

Now on to other points...

You dislike their age/believe it is too dramatic for their age: For one, I don't think this anime was ever going for ultra "realism," and to critique it for being unrealistically dramatic seems a little silly, especially considering that this is an animated, fictional, drama. Another point I would like to make is that the environment you grow up in heavily influences the rate at which you mentally mature. I'm sure that a kid who witnessed his mother dying slowly from terminal illness at a young age, and a girl currently suffering from a terminal illness would be much more serious than your average adolescent; not only that, but for anyone who has been young and in love at around that age can tell you how passionate it can make you (myself being a prime example because I can easily relate to those emotions that I felt at the same age for a girl). Honestly aside from Kaori and Kousei, everyone else acted their age in my opinion; Tsubaki and Watari being immature, yet also being serious in their own ways.

The two year difference in appearance is a little strange, but it isn't uncommon for there to be a drastic difference in appearance between a 14 and 12 year old; still, the character models are a little younger looking than you'd expect.

A little side note: In the United States, many people who are 13 with late birthdays are in high school, and almost all 14 year olds are definitely in high school, so it wasn't uncommon for there to be a mature freshmen who got along with older people mentally (I had and still have friends several years older than myself and I am currently in my early 20's). 

Your issue with Kousei's consistency on the piano: He still played in order to transcribe notes for popular songs, so he wasn't completely out of practice, he just didn't play classical music anymore.

The humor in the anime: I guess this is the only thing I can agree a little bit more on with you, but a lot of the things, especially between Tsubaki and Kousei, or Kaori and Kousei were meant to show how tense and awkward the situations were, and that acting in that manner was their attempt at lightening the mood (which I can definitely relate to because I tend to try and make jokes during sad or uncomfortable situations). Other than those situations, I can see why it would bother you, but it's not as if there was constant unnecessary "comedy;" and for the most part, It was generally in the context that I stated. (the comedy I'm referring to is when they physically alter the style in which the characters are drawn...which doesn't account for all of the comedy)

The overarching theme was not the relationship between the two MC's, but the acceptance that nothing lasts forever.

All in all, I have a lot more that I could say and analyze about the show as to why it is good, while also acknowledging that there are imperfections; but i'm becoming incoherent and I would have to structure my own review to really cover everything I would want to..I don't feel like doing that, so who knows. Either way, I think you were so focused on the subjectively "bad" parts of the anime, that you failed to really experience it's deceitfully excellent story telling.

The black cat represented his fear of only being his mother's shadow (as well as his self loathing), and the cat is used to represent this because of the story where it was his fault that the cat scratched him, but he made no argument against his mother when she got rid of it...his mother's puppet, doing everything her way.

Taking into account my personal enjoyment, I would give it a 10; being completely subjective on the matter.

My objective opinion of it would be probably around an 8.5 if I take into account some of the things that don't work and analyze them a bit more.

OP gave it a 6.4, and you obviously gave it higher, so I just wanted to know how much higher exactly. Since you don't have a flair I can just click on. I haven't decided what I'll be giving it yet myself so I may use your's and OP's thoughts in doing so.
>> ARTICLE
I was actually considering writing my own review, but I tend to over complicate my thoughts and I'm not sure exactly what I would want to cover. I focus heavily on the subtleties that aren't thrown in your face, but I would have to watch and find specific examples to really drive that point home. 

It's one of those anime where there is so much to consider, that it has become increasingly more difficult for me to fully appreciate due to the varying levels of complexity that are both subtle and apparent. Not often do I feel as though I could analyze every word of something and find a dual meaning, which is something that the monologues/dialogues do really well; not everything that is said is as cut and dry and you need to really pay attention to the mannerisms of each character to be able to understand why they are that way and what their purpose is. 

I do want to note that I binge watched the first half to catch up, and then watched it once more after I recommended it to my brother; I am also currently watching it in order to fully get a grasp on how I feel towards it, and thus far I am only enjoying it more due to all of the underlying themes and meanings. 

So I've seen the first half of the show about 3 times now, while the second half I've only experienced once. 

>> ARTICLE
I feel the same way at the moment. I am currently collecting more information and writing myself. I have no idea if this will end up as a review or an essay. But I do know that the more I work on it, the better it gets and I will eventually be able to explain, see things, notice things better than I did before I started. In the end, it is just to do it. Just do it. 

This will take some time and I am kind of excited already at the beginning to see what will be of my piece. My overall direction with my piece is to answer the question of what the show is trying to tell us. What is this story all about? Then go on from there. Perhaps you could use it as well?

I really enjoyed your OP, and I think if you worked on it you could make a splendid product. A product I sure would love to read. We need more discussion here rather than gags. :) But hey, that is what the barren /r/trueanime is for.

I've definitely been considering it! As you said it feels like it would become more of an essay than a review, and I'm feeling overwhelmed with where to start as well as finding the time to really watch the episodes and pay attention to the intricacies.

I agree with you that Your Lie in April is a flawed but still good series, but we seem to disagree on what the flaws are. The show was always at its weakest, imo, when it was laser-focused on Kaori and Kousei. It needed a wider perspective, and the relatively few times it actually did that were my favorite moments. Especially the times when it showed that Watari and Tsubaki do actually have lives outside of being Kousei's cheerleaders. 

I also really like the monologues and pretentious dialogue; they evoke a very *romantic* feeling (the literary movement, not the emotional bond), which I happen to dig. Like, a lot. The elevation of the mundane to the grandiose via pretentious narration just happens to be one of my literary fetishes. I blame Guy Gavriel Kay.

What I *hate* about Your Lie in April, though, is Kaori. Or, rather, what they do with her. They made her a [KimiUso](/s "dying") manic pixie dream girl and I absolutely *hate* that. Her character could have been so interesting if they'd just taken out that whole [KimiUso](/s "dying") thing. I think a show where they ended up [KimiUso](/s "falling out of love with each other") would have been **far** more tragic than the BS we got.

The unrealistic moments of the show didn't bother me.  I guess I'm too used to middle/high schoolers having super-power level abilities in anime.

However I agree the monologues really got tiresome, especially when many of them were very similar in topic.  Generally it's better to show than to tell, and if an anime relies too much on monologues then it's a pretty bad sign.  A lot of these could have at least been dialogue between the characters, as the interactions that would have created between the main characters could have been great.

I share a pretty much the same opinion but would get downvoted into oblivion whenever I tried to discuss it :(

While I agree with you on most of your points (but still personally enjoyed the show quite a lot), I do find it worth mentioning that it was mentioned once or twice that Kousei never completely stopped playing piano during those two years (or even if he did, he eventually picked it back up) because he was playing it for his part time job.

I'm looking to know what OP thinks too regarding it. From the little I saw of Kimi na Uso I found Nodame Cantabile much better(except the animation).

I gave it a 9/10 because I'm a sucker for classical, and the romcom nature of it was the main reason why I started watching (I was recommended it by lovely complex) I found the femals lead to be mildy refreshing and it was at least reasonably funny. the romance was better than sakurasou but worse than toradora, so I'd say a fairer rating of it would be 8/10 for an all category anime viewer.

I rated the first season 8/10, the second season 7/10, and the final season 8/10

See, the whole thing about them being 14 is kinda my biggest dislike about the show. I'm willing to concede that pretentiousness and melodrama is fairly common amongst high schoolers, who are going through one of the toughest times of their life and are constantly thinking about who they are and where they fit in. 

When I was in middle school, I was just trying to make friends and think of how not to get bad grades. That's it. I have a hard time believing that middle school kids can be this thoughtful and, at times, pretentious. 

That said, once I got past the fact that these middle school kids looked like highschool kids, I found the monologues very good. It fit into the fact that most characters are musicians or artists of sorts, and artists tend to be over dramatic and, at times, pretentious. You, among others, may not have liked it, but it would have fit very well if these kids were a bit older.

You made many valid points in the review and touched on my main gripe with the show, subtlety, or the lack of it. 

I don't know if the reason behind this is the fact that it's ultimately a shounen, but the show assumes the viewers watching it are the lowest common denominator. Every single point is presented in your face, nothing is ever shown or left up to the viewer to figure out.

Whenever a character says a line that references to a past event or piece of dialogue, instead of letting the viewer connect the dots, they just play a flashback of the scene. It's especially apparent in the performances, where they just play every single relevant scene from the first episode whenever the character realizes himself.

There was virtually no development between the main couple, and instead the show touches up on other side character arcs that ultimately play little importance in the finale. This dampens the final sad moments since you really weren't invested in the characters to begin with. Hell, I felt more emotion in the latest episode of Shirobako than in the finale for this show.

Shigatsu isn't bad, it has some amazing visuals and music. It's just not going to be considered a masterpiece of classic that so many viewers are probably going to think it will be. I'll give it a 6/10 as well.

Wow. Yo. That's too much salt at a time yo.

This show dragged on like a mother fucker in the middle with its stagnant MC, pointless side-characters (Nagi), melodramatic monologues, constant change of attitudes... Oh and not to mention the eye-rolling REPETITION. Ask yourself: How many times was there a childhood flashback to evoke emotion that provided no story development? How many times did this MC say "I'm just friend A?" Or mother's "It's your punishment" or "He's his mother's puppet." Very neat ideas and well-done, but lazy and of poor taste once repeated numerous times EVERY episode.

This is a prime example of style over substance: A piece that excessively uses melodrama and its (great) OST to force and elicit emotional response within the viewers, despite having no concrete substance or action in writing for the majority of the show. Yes, we care about the characters because of the great beginning and lovable (angelic) character designs, but there's comes a point where you're just milking the remaining merit.

That being said, the beginning and end were absolutely beautiful, but due to the tedious, poorly organized middle, by the time the show ended with a fantastic bang, a great amount of transcendence has already been lost.

Could have been a masterpiece if all the inconsistent and melodramatic, lazy production was focused on making this show 12 episodes.

I just happy that I'm not the only one who gave it a 6-7/10 rating for the show. I felt like I watched a different show compared to others and my friends and something was wrong with me ;_; Thanks for putting your criticisms in text.
>> ARTICLE
Well written and thorough review. I agree with the overall rating but honestly feel that the characters were worse then story. The show wanted to use a show rather then tell formula in all of its sequences, but instead decided to show and tell. It spent way too much time giving every character an opinion during important development scenes for Kousei. It was like the show never gave a chance for the audience to develop their own opinion during these sequences, instead the audience constantly needs to be told how to react to all these scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
I do agree with your opinion on the story. It did feel a bit melodramatic in the middle. I would've given it a 9 in my MAL in case other wise. Although 8 isn't all that different. 
>> ARTICLE
Nice review. I don't agree with it on most things, but I can see why you would think those things. I thought the series was overall pretty good, but that 3 things that I thought that made the show an amazing piece. Those things were: The last scene of episode 11, the one with the fireflies. One of the most beautiful scenes I have seen in anime so far.
Then we episode 21, which i thought was just amazing.
And last but not least: the letter from Kaori (and the duet).

Those things made the series for me. I did not like the forced and not-funny comedy, but those things really did it.

About the last episode. I thought pretty much everything was amazing (EXCEPT THE FUCKING KICK IN THE SHINS).
This was pretty much the most serious and most tearing moment of the series and then Tsubaki kicked him in the fucking shins.

Now about your review: it was nice to read and it's cool that you gave me something to listen to at the end :P 
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't it all come down to the fact that this show isn't for people who don't like a lot of talking, either in monologue or dialogue (Monogatari series for example). I find that argument that everyone is using so subjective.

I feel like I can reduce most of your score reasoning to just that one point.

I do agree on the fact that the ages were not chosen that well. Also because the child forms they showed in the anime from around the time his mother died was supposed to be 2 years earlier, so them being 12. The problem was that due to the design choices they made it felt like there was a way bigger age gap between "now" and "then".  
Another thing to note about the age: It was so easily changeable. Change their age to 17, change every time they used "x years ago" to "x+3 years ago", change preparing for high school to preparing for college and tadaaa, something even more believable is born, they actually wouldn't have to even change a lot of scenes, just what they say.
>> ARTICLE
Well of course it's subjective- it's my own opinion after all.  Not even close to fact.
>> ARTICLE
Since you used enjoyment in your score giving it indeed means that you take it the subjective way.

I meant it more like in the way I like to view scoring, the objective way. It's a hard subject because, you know, how objective can a person even be when scoring. But in that sense I meant that too many people use that argument when it's just them not liking that type of anime. If they just give fully subjective scores and reviews it's no problem, but if they want to be "objective" and give those arguments I'll have my doubts. (And that's how we end back at my original point). (The most objective you can get is probably when you work in the industry yourself.)
>> ARTICLE
Even if you try to be objective when rating things, in the end your score will still be subjective because every person has a different taste in anime, and thus the things that they think are "good" or "bad" in a show are different too.

>> ARTICLE
I think KimiUso plays with a lot of ideas that are very difficult to balance, some of which (I think) work in its favor and others that don't. One thing I agree with you with that didn't work in its favor is the age of the cast, so no argument there. I think, however, that the side characters were utilized pretty well. 

Here's how I see it: when a show is focused on [one romance](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!) that's [Toradora spoilers](/s "fated to resolve by the end of the series"), you can flesh out some [annoying](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/toradoranime/images/d/d9/Ami_kawashima.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120628201437) or [basically useless](http://i.imgur.com/flLZ4LN.png) characters because viewers can still be satisfied with the end result. I spoiler tagged that out of habit but **it's bloody obvious at the start of the show as to what the end will be**, so really the show is just about getting there and there's some room to play around with the cast along the way.

But what about a case where there's [conflicting love interests](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11887/Kokoro_Connect) or [something gets in the way](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18671/Chuunibyou_demo_Koi_ga_Shitai!_Ren) of any development happening, and it's unclear as to what the end product will be? Kokoro Connect handled this by not developing the side cast much (in another example, White Album 2 simply didn't have a side cast), and the end results were pretty likable since time could be spent developing the two main love interests. For Chuu2Ren, it found itself stuck in a spot where it had a main romance that could've progressed a whole lot, but its side characters needed some development else they would've just been repeating the same jokes from season 1.

But what about KimiUso? At the start of the show pretty much anybody familiar with the romance genre would've been able to tell you Kaori x Kousei signed, sealed, delivered, and working through the Tsubaki/Watari polygon would've been the prominent subplot to the music main plot. As death flags started popping up though the ship found itself in some fog. Kaori was fucking buried in death flags but sometimes it's hard to tell which direction the tragic characters will take, sometimes they make it through and sometimes they don't. As such, KimiUso plays between the two common romance tropes and has to balance the amount of side-character development they give. The first half of the series implies more is workable since they're definitely gonna end up together, the second half of the series implies that more time has to be spent on Kousei x Kaori if the show wants to tie all of its loose ends in that relationship should things go awry. Frankly, I think the source material did a pretty good job of doing this. It was nice to have some things from Tsubaki's perspective, especially because there was only so much of "WILL YOU FORGET????????!?!!?" that I could stand. I agree that maybe a 3 minute explanation of the lie from Watari could've helped his character a lot but I don't feel the need to gripe about that too much.

Unrelated to debating your comments I would also recommend adding [Pavane pour un Infante Defuente](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEUpQ5pCSOQ), the piece that Kousei refused to play, to the extra listening. There's a lot of symbolism behind Kousei refusing to play it, the title (roughly) translates to **A Procession for a Dead Princess**.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, look, a written review with opinions backed with reasoning and evidence from the show being downvoted. At this point, your criticisms of it are not even a "strict opinion" anymore because some of the things that are said are directly taken from the show as an example.

What a typical day in /r/anime. It's no wonder most of the discussion-based people left this subreddit already months ago. Seems to have only gotten worse since then.

As for the review itself, I haven't seen the show in its entirety just yet so I can't comment too much on it. A lot of the complaints seem valid though, having seen some bits and pieces of episodes. Your thoughts on this seem really similar to mine about Golden Time.

Some suggestions I have though are, as already stated by another person, to not come off from a defensive position. You could also be less meek about it. Saying "in my opinion" frequently doesn't help much. We know it's your opinion, so stand firm with it and don't let yourself be dismissed by naysayers by a simple "that's your opinion" but rather make them work for it by expanding upon why they disagree. The last suggestion I have for you is to structure yourself a little bit better. It seems kind of rambly rather than a review.

A personal thing I do (sort of a suggestion but not really) is to not average out my scores in different categories for a final verdict. How each piece works as a standalone is very different on how they compliment each other as a whole in the context of the show. Since splitting them up into standalones does not represent the whole, then rating the whole as an average of the standalones is kind of a bad idea.

I think you raise some valid points but the points about his piano playing ability can be explained some what and if they can't they would just say he is a prodigy. He hadnt really been on a 2 year hiatus when he played the accomplishment, he had a job where he would play the piano and since the song was played every day and posted everywhere it wasn't exactly a sight reading. I'm fairly sure kousei was just being dramatic when he said he couldn't play after one week like he wouldn't be able to win unless he was in prime condition. Other than that I feel like you bring up a lot of good points and I appreciate your I sight on the musical selections and I also appreciate your "classical"/romantic/whatever era music.

Nice review. I disagree with you about the dialogues, though. Even when they're young, Kousei and Kaori have had hardships in their lives that have made them grow up faster than the people around them, thus making the way they talk be more mature. 

And yes, the show's introduction to Kaori's illness was sudden and with every episode it became more evident that she was going to die (even in the last episodes when she tells him that they will play together again, giving you some kind of hope) but I was really happy how they managed it in the end. I didn't expect it to be so beautiful and emotional.

We've finally come to Kousei's big performance. This episode is front loaded with a ton of Emi backstory, and then gets right into it. You're going to like Kousei's mother even less after this, as well as get a much better look into Kousei's trauma.

> the sophisticated selection process behind Kaori's chosen piece

Now I feel bad. When the selection was first mentioned I actually though there was a hidden meaning behind the selection. How could I think Kaori was capable of such evil?

Nice write-ups mate. I'm just waiting until later episodes for me to dig into.

* [Flower petals escaping](https://gfycat.com/SerpentineTatteredGoat) (sorry for potato quality, gfycat compressed the file to hell) - I'm not sure if this is just a stylistic choice or that it means Kaori's teachings are escaping Kousei in the moment.
>> ARTICLE
That's a probable interpretation and something I hadn't even noticed. [spoiler](/s "In the next episode as well, after Kousei finds his inspiration, you see an entire cherry tree blossoming behind him.") Though in episode 3, outside the cafe, he describes his hearing loss as being "like petals pulled aloft," so it could just be referencing that. But they also make no secret of the association between Kaori and cherry blossoms.

This show has inspired me to get back into piano, hopefully gonna spend next weekend working on it. I never got into competitive playing, but I entered a competition once, ended up being the only one in my age group, and got a fancy 1st place certificate. 

Seeing those meds is definitely a bad sign. I hope this doesnt lead to what I think it's leading to.
>> ARTICLE
Was anyone else glad that Kousei told his mom to fuck off when she smacked him after his good performance? It was about time that he stood up for himself.

Also, does his mom not have eyes or something? Or are they just hiding her eyes for effect?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it felt so good when he did that. He said what probably everyone around them was thinking.
>> ARTICLE
Just hiding them for effect. When Kousei recalls happy memories of his mother, her eyes are usually shown. When he's reliving the traumatic moments, her eyes are hidden.
>> ARTICLE
I've also heard irc that often times in abuse cases the victim blocks out memories of the face of the abuser so that they can cope with living with them

Ah I see. Thanks for the clarification. I guess we haven't seen those happy memories yet (or I just forgot about them).

There has been at least one.

When he remembers playing Twinkle Twinkle and his mother is telling him to play more softly so the piano will be happy.

Joining the rewatch today. Binging through episode 9 to catch up, but I'm hoping this rewatch won't wreck me for an entire day after the end since we're watching daily ;)
>> ARTICLE
This episode is so masterfully done, the tension, unease before the performance, Kousei's struggle with his past conflicting with his new found goal. 

Interestingly, they put Emi's backstory at the start of the episode, which strongly contrasts Kousei's. Emi was inspired by Kousei's performance and wants to be an inspiring musician like him, while Kousei just wants to win to make his mom happy/better. Emi's parents are super supportive, they gave her many options and fully support her decisions. While Kousei's mom was abusive and forced her own dream on him.

 It has come to me that Kousei pretty much has the backstory of an antagonist in a typical shounen series, but here, this is about Kousei's journey to overcome his past.

This show was actually my introduction to anime -- my first *real* anime show I ever watched -- and holy shit, I don't think I'll ever top it.  What a beautiful, masterful, heartbreaking series!  The second viewing is proving to be just as amazing as the first!
>> ARTICLE
It really is a great introduction to anime. It's played mostly serious and many of the more nonsensical and cliched 'anime-isms' aren't present. It would definitely be on a short list of series that I would recommend to someone who had never watched anime before.
>> ARTICLE
It was the perfect introduction.  Shigatsu shows what is great about the medium without throwing you into the deep end with all the said "anime-isms" that turn newcomers off.  All with a story that is expertly crafted.

Since then I've watched most of the essentials (Cowboy Bebop, Death Note, FMA & FMA:B) along with some other stragglers (Mushishi, Erased, etc.), and while those have all been amazing in their own right, I still haven't topped that initial viewing of Shigatsu.

If/when someone new to anime asks me where to start and they tell me they love emotional storytelling, I'll without a doubt point them to this show, because it doesn't get much better than this.
>> ARTICLE
If you enjoyed *Cowboy Bebop* and like science fiction, you can't go wrong with *Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex* and *2nd GIG* either.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the recommendations, I'll have to check those out for sure!
>> ARTICLE
I feel so conflicted about Kousei's mother. On one hand I think she's a fucking bitch for treating her child like that and on the other hand I feel bad because of her condition and that Kousei tried to make her feel better as well as then eventually outright denying her (which were his last words to her mind you). She is a terrible parent (which is an understatement) but her and Kousei's past is tragic which leaves me conflicted. I will say it was a breath of fresh air when Kousei stood up for himself against his mother. Other shows with child abuse don't really allow the child to stand up like that and get away with it so that was nice to see.

I didn't comment in the last few threads, so here are my thoughts on these last 3 episodes.

I love how Emi and Spikey-hair became great pianists because of Kousei and he doesn't even fully realise that.

And holy shit, Kousei has had the most depressing relationship with his mum. Heartbreaking.

Kaori's taking pills, this is a bad flag if I ever saw one. Pretty sure this is gonna end up sad.
>> ARTICLE
Nah. Kaori just has a drug problem. The series ends with everyone giving her an intervention.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if Charlie Brown will be there

Damn dude, spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
It seems like some of those people were just looking for any excuse they could find to take a shot at little Kousei! His mom just died, it seems to have been made public that he was being abused to practice the piano so hard, and so they decide to take a shot at him calling him unhuman because he's still playing perfectly despite his loss!

Kousei is a precious boy who needs more Emi's, Kaori's, and Aiza's in his life, not those negative negativersons! I feel for him a lot, and I think it's admirable how he can still play a little on muscle memory when he can't even hear the notes.

It revolves around a character who is facing a lot of emotional turmoil all at once.

I think Shigatsu is a solid show and I certainly had a great time watching it, but in spite of that I have few less rosy remarks about the show I'd like to add.

Shigatsu is a show that demands a significant amount of emotional commitment from the watcher and a lot of its effectiveness is entirely reliant upon it. /u/CheesewithWhine clearly managed to commit, but if you can't manage to give yourself to the show in the same way your reaction might fall more along the lines of /u/Revriley1, and you'll feel emotionally manipulated rather than emotionally moved. Therefore my principal advice is: **don't watch this show if you're not feeling ready to let it lead you emotionally.**

Aside from that, Shigatsu at times suffers from issues of odd comedic timing. While many of the funnier scenes are quite enjoyable the transition between drama and comedy can often be jarring and leave you confused with regards to the mood being developed.

Depending on how story-savvy you are, you might see the ending coming from a mile away. Whether that is a problem will depend entirely on you, and it partly links back to my initial remark: if you are willing to let the show lead you emotionally then knowing what is coming will not be a problem at all. Everyone knows how Oedipus Rex ends, yet we can all still enjoy it in spite of that. If you can see the end of Shigatsu coming, I suggest you try to go into the same sort of mindset you'd use for a classical tragedy, where knowing how it ends doesn't matter as much as seeing how it gets there.

All things considered, I'd Shigatsu is a good show and well worth your time. The protagonist undergoes an admirable amount of growth and the ending is nicely bittersweet, the kind that will have you crying over losses while simultaneously being happy about the obstacles overcome.
>> ARTICLE
i agree with this, very accurate description of KimiUso
>> ARTICLE
i could see the coming since episode 11, just made it more special of an experience.
>> ARTICLE
Regarding comedic timing, the one part of the show I hated was the physical comedy. MC is going through some serious mental trauma and depression and all his friends (even Kaori!) are constantly kicking or beating him. I don't care if they didn't know about his depression it just made me hate them.
>> ARTICLE
We're doing a WT for a popular series that just ended this year now? Pretty sure you guys are not getting this whole WT thing.

I mean, I disagree with a lot of things in your post, but since a lot of people genuinely loved this show and were emotionally moved by it ~~despite the pretty unbelievable and archetypal characters and obvious deathflags and more~~, I won't try and dissuade people from watching it. 

That being said:

By "deep hidden foreshadowing," did you mean "multiple deathflags so blatantly obvious they remove whatever emotional impact the ending might have had?"

By "well-rounded characters," did you mean "a cast that ranges from pretty okay characters (like Emi and Takeshi) to cringeworthy archetypes (Arima's childhood friends, but especially Watari, who *almost* experiences character growth but his last main scene destroys what little there was) to unbelievably infuriating (Kaori, who fits the MPDG trope perfectly and only really gains autonomy towards the second half)?"

By "masterful storytelling" did you mean "overdependence on poorly timed and overly long flashbacks that overstayed their welcome by episode four?" (Dare I mention the deathflags again?) or "incredibly unsubtle emotional manipulation?"

Where I shan't disagree with you is the visuals and the music. The rotoscope used for the performances was a bit obvious but prettily done. As for the music, the entire reason I decided to pick up the show while it was airing was for the classical music, since I really like classical music. So I'll vouch for that. 

Again, if you're the type who wants to be swept up in a flurry of emotional sob stories and therefore willing to suspend your disbelief and/or willingly ignore that an anime is emotionally manipulating you with hundreds of scenes designed to scream at you "look! these are FEELS. This is emotionally SAD. Be SAD damn you" -- then sure, go ahead.

Ahem. To put it more gently, if you just want a pretty romance story and want to take it by its cover rather than thinking too deeply about it, go ahead. Lots of people loved this one, so chances are you might too. If you want classical music, sure, check it out. That's why I stuck with it, for the most part anyway--the music. 
>> ARTICLE
You have your own opinion, but in a nutshell it sounds like you just didn't like the characters. You thought they were unbelievable, thus unrelatable, thus archetypal. Instead of feeling tension for the characters with deathflags, you ridiculed the show itself, because *it's just a character after all*.

It's a coming of age story after all. I can relate to the characters. It was sad but not a sobstory by any means. I didn't cry once. I only thought the progression had ups and downs, grew tense and lighthearted, and concluded beautifully. 
>> ARTICLE
I will concede that my biggest problem with the show was probably with its characters, but I contest your point that I 'ridiculed' the show based off the characters alone. I didn't intend to sound like I was 'ridiculing' the show, as I don't enjoy *mocking* shows unless they are pure 100% shit, which Shigatsu is not. 

I tolerated the characters for the most part while watching it--my problem with them is mostly from a critical standpoint, after all. The show had other problems besides the characters, to be frank. The pacing was hindered by the oversaturation of flashbacks (which were toned down for the second half, I'll give you that) in the first half, weakly unoriginal major plot points, and we've already talked about obvious emotional manipulation. 

> Tension for the characters with deathflags

See, that's the thing. Deathflags are quite capable of creating tension if they are sparsely (and subtly) used over the course of a show. Shigatsu made use of many, many deathflags over the course of the anime, with no attempt at subtlety whatsoever. I am fairly convinced that they were purposefully obvious at this point. 

Admittedly, you could probably make the case that the major question that's supposed to be hanging over the audiences' heads is still up in the air as the final arc approaches its conclusion. I dunno, though--I think the ending was so obvious and predictable that had the anime decided to go in the other direction it would have been incredibly cheap--so for me, anyway, there was no tension about it. 

Well, in the end, perhaps I'm just a cynical criticaster with a stick up her ass. I can only relate to the characters in certain ways (the paralyzing fear of being onstage and failing miserably resonates with me a lot), but like you, others relate a lot more. I'm not quite in the target demographic anymore, after all. 

(A little postscript: I wouldn't necessarily say that 'unbelievable' was commensurate with 'archetypal' for all the characters. Watari, perhaps the most archetypal of all the characters, might even have been one of the more believable ones, come to think of it). 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, people tend to overrate these kind of shows. It got ranked 13 on MAL.

>> ARTICLE
Well, he does have his opinon. But true, he didn't have to have that tone.
>> ARTICLE
I apologize--I did try to soften it at the end for fear I sounded too harsh, but you're right, the overall tone may come off as splenetic, and worse, condescending, which I didn't intend at all to come across as at all. As I said, clearly many people had incredibly emotional responses to this anime. I was not one of them, but just because I found the faults of the show so apparent and unrelenting as to be unignorable does not mean it **isn't a show that is unworthy of mention or some praise.** I can't write off the show  because it clearly is worth something to a lot of people, and it would be unfair of me to not point that out when discussing the anime. 

I won't go back and rewrite the post (because A. It's one in the morning and B. because I stand by my comparisons and think that they have enough validity as to be potentially useful), but I will try to ensure that any future responses of mine on this thread are more gracious/mild than my original post was. 
>> ARTICLE
I was one of the people who was able to invest emotionally and really liked the show as a result, and you obviously held a different opinion -- but I just want to give you a nod of respect for making this comment in elaboration. It's tricky to convey disagreement without being offensive, and while you lacked a certain degree of tact in your original response, I want to acknowledge your graceful reaction to being called out on it. Cheers.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for your thoughts, and I appreciate them--and I'd be delighted to learn more about (only if you are compelled to, of course) your own experience with Shigatsu, and how it moved you/your opinions on the characters and the show as a whole. 

Shigatsu is honestly probably one of the anime best suited for a (intellectual/respectful) debate. Of this, I have no doubt. It was a powerful anime for so many people, and at the same time, an equal number of people were disenchanted by it. That is something indeed. 

At any rate, I can only be grateful when someone points out to me that I may have been tactless or something equally rude because it means I am now aware of it and can work to be more prudent and congenial in the future. 

Rewriting the original post would be (deliberately) cant. I won't touch it, I promise you that. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't hold back. It was a refreshing critique. Some people get caught up in shows they love and start viewing them as idealizations instead of the authentic versions. Faults tend to get ignored or even praised in this case.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I try to be a bit more objective/flexible with my favorite shows--as much as I love Baccano! (honestly if you checked my MAL account you'd probably think I have an unhealthy obsession with it), I know the anime (and the LNs) have flaws/are not perfect and won't appeal to everyone. Heck, as much as I enjoyed (loved?) Dantalian no Shoka I am *painfully* aware of its flaws (many considered its episodic format 'repetitive', it had little character development, etc) and completely understand when someone says they didn't like it. 

And on the flip side, I try (though certainly I still have a ways to go) to not completely lambast anime I was critical of--and in this thread I tried to do the same by mentioning some of its good points (the music, the visuals) and pointing out repeatedly that it's not an anime one should dismiss and that it does have merit in its own right. 

...well, I did say I have a ways to go in that regard.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Emi was like the literal worst character. Her motivations were shallow, thoughtless, and entirely selfish, and this was compounded by her unpredictable and uncalled for violence and practical abuse of Arima. She was both an emotionally and physically harmful character under the very transparent guise of a girl that wanted the boy she liked to be "happy" again.

I mean, I legitimately enjoyed the series despite its flaws, and think it had some really excellent moments (particularly just about every musical scene was on point), but Emi was just a terrible person. I had the largest feeling of schedenfreude watching the episode when she comes to the realization that Arima likes Kaori. 
>> ARTICLE
To tell the truth, it has been almost a year since I saw Shigatsu (I had no desire to rewatch it), so my memory of some of the characters has grown a little vague and indistinct. Emi would be one of them--all I really remember of her is her earliest appearance in the anime and her concert performances. I'd completely forgotten about the violence. Perhaps I should rewatch some of the episodes again if only to refresh my memory. 

Gee, I'd say Shigatsu really likes the 'physical violence towards the MC' trope. Tsubaki, Kaori, and Emi as well--all happily beat the crap out of Arima. It's a poor excuse for comedy--oh, it can work it certain spare circumstances, I'm sure - but not when it's one of the main constant sources of comedy throughout the show. That's just lazy. 

...Shigatsu may, perchance, have a problem with overuse. It overuses flashbacks and it overuses violent physical slapstick. No subtleness to it. No chance to let the audience think. 
>> ARTICLE
Woah, just realized I totally meant Tsubaki. Totally mixed their names up in my head for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
...Ah, that makes a lot more sense, in terms of your original post (I was somewhat confused when you said "Emi realizes that Arima likes Kaori). 

Yeah. Tsubaki did get on my nerves, but I think overall I just didn't care about her at all and thus was able to tolerate her rather than roll my eyes every time she was on screen. I tried to give her leeway by reminding myself that these are supposed to be 14 year olds and emotional immaturity should be expected. 

Out of the two childhood friends, Watari was the one I was more interested in and frustrated with. He was one of the most archetypal characters in the anime - the MC's 'pervy sidekick best friend/comic relief' (gee, where have we seen that before), and I thought he'd be confined to that box forever. 

The thing is, he actually seemed like he was more than that--having a few serious conversations with Arima, going to visit Kaori, holding the cellphone up at the concert--glimpses of maturity that I hoped were indicative of permanent character growth. I thought at least Watari had the potential to be more, which is what I was holding out for throughout the anime. 

And then, in the last episode, we had that one scene. [He's](/s "in the classroom. With a girl. She proceeds to slap him. He picks up his phone and looks at a picture of Kaori.")

Bam. All for nothing. I know they're middle schoolers. I know. But [having](/s "a picture on his phone of Kaori does not excuse the fact that yet again he blithely screwed over another girl. You can argue that the picture of Kaori is more important than I'm making it out to be, but...no. Just no. What a joke. That pissed the hell out of me--him still toying around with people's emotions and not getting why it's wrong.")
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I wouldn't even rec this show for the classical music. It's the reason I watched it but it's not even second fiddle throughout the show, its like 4th string understudy. 

As another points out, if you want classical music nothing comes close to beating Nodame Cantible.
>> ARTICLE
I really should restart Nodame in the near future. The first two episodes were great--your guess is as good as mine as to why I never managed to get around to the third episode. 

I don't come across other people who also picked Shigatsu up for the classical music very often, so that was nice to know. And I can't disagree with you there - the music did end up feeling like it was stuck on a back burner over the course of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
I found Your Lie in April to be a perfect example of "Tell, not Show." Whatever subtle nuance there might have been to the character interactions at the beginning was quickly cleared up by flashback after flashback of the MC basically going "I can't play piano this time *either*, because look, *this* happened in my past. In case you forgot I had *this* horribly tragic upbringing. I'm so pathetic. No matter what story devlopent occurs next, it'll just unlock another painful memory."

To be fair, I did enjoy some of Kaori's mostivational lines at the beginning, but they lose a lot of their impact when the MC inevitably has to explain to the viewer "and then when Kaori said that, I felt like *this*. You the viewer, appreciate Kaori's line. You should also feel like *this*."

If you can accept the reliance on all the tragic backstory, you might be able to enjoy this show. If instead you like some subtlety and perhaps "earned" feelings, perhaps something like K-On is a better bet.
>> ARTICLE
You and /u/Apocalypse_Fudgeball both put it much more succinctly/clearly (better) than I did, I think. "Tell, not Show" is a *spot-on* I.D. of this show's *modus operandi*, and your subsequent elaboration makes it exactly clear why. I'll try not to be redundant and echo you word for word but...yeah. Emotional manipulation at its most unsubtle. Flashback after flashback hitting you with the same old angst you got in the past five flashbacks. We got it. It's all so terribly tragic. 

And it ends up affecting 'not-sad' scenes too. Oh look, Kaori is singing "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star." How *charming*. This is utterly *charming*. This is not cloying in the slightest (cloying is one of my favorite words for that scene). I should probably view this as sweet and intimate. 

Okay, okay, now *that* is very much my own experience and I will say here and now that I don't expect everyone to react the same way. For me, personally, that was my experience. The blatant targeting of my heartstrings ended up tainting practically everything else. 

Ah, Kaori. I have many many issues with Kaori, but then again lots of people *adored* her. I see her on a lot of MAL profiles' favorite character lists. So I dunno, maybe I just suck as a person, but as soon as Arima saw her at the playground I knew I was going to have a problem with her. 

Haven't seen K-On and honestly haven't been too interested in watching it. I mean, I always figured I'd watch it someday, but I never cared enough to make it a priority. Would you say there's subtlety and emotional depth in K-On, or is it really just the sum of the hearsay and praise I've heard on Reddit and otherwise?

With regard to K-On, yes there's a lot of subtlety. So much subtlety that it's quite possible to watch it and enjoy it purely on a superficial level. That's how I watched it at first, and I would rate it an 8/10 just for how well it did the cute/funny.

I'm actually having trouble explaining exactly what K-On does well, which is a guess a testament to how much of a "show, not tell" experience it is. It really doesn't try to explain itself to you.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZUCvi7H968) 1.5 hour analysis of K-On definitely put into words what I had begun to start feeling. I listened to it between watching the first and second season, and I felt like it enhanced my viewing of the show.

I don't want to give too much away, so I'll just end by saying K-On felt like it had the most authentic character development of any show I've watched, and I can't recommend it enough.
>> ARTICLE
I think I need to watch K-On! again because while I enjoyed the first viewing, I must have missed out on the subtle moments. When it came to character development, it just felt less fulfilling compared to KyoAni's other shows. 
>> ARTICLE
What's super interesting to me is I identified with a different character each time I rewatched it.

If you like classical music you should watch Nodame Cantabile.  It's got better music and it isn't sad for the sake of being sad
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first two episodes a long time ago (having been told it had classical music and was a good show to boot) and liked them a lot, but somehow never got around to continuing the series (it's practically a permanent resident on my watching list considering how long it's been there). 

I hope to get back to Nodame at some point in the near future. It looked like it was going to be a great show. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's a show that gets better as it goes on.  At first I didn't like it much due to Nodame's antics but it definitely grows on you and the music gets better and better.  The characters and their environment change a lot over time which is fun to watch.  Just look at the second and third OPs.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayS6cY0fdL4  and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW3Z3X4pyV8

The music in Nodame is way better executed, IMO, because it doesn't treat its music like BGM while the characters monologue.

Anything popular = shit in this sub. And it seems that everyone has to shout their opinion. For example, I've never seen anyone claim AoT or Tokyo Ghoul were the best shows ever, yet it seems that a lot of people claim that a lot of people do say those things.
>> ARTICLE
While I love this sub, I feel like I've become such a cynic. 
>> ARTICLE
It's actually making me improve in the sense that I normally take the opinions of others too seriously. /r/anime has been good for me that way.

Edit: ...aaaaand I got downvoted for that. Who says the universe doesn't have a sense of humour?
>> ARTICLE
Like others have said before, I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer here, but I had a question or two I wanted to ask. People call this show a feel train, but to feel sadness at an unfortunate (putting it lightly) event that happens to a fictional character, one must feel connected to this character on a personal level. How does one connect personally to a character when said character does not act like a person? 

My biggest issue here is with Kaori and Arima. Kaori doesn't do anything in this show. She gets angry at Arima, which somehow is supposed to translate into humor every single time no matter what the context or content, and she gets sad and thus makes us feel sad. But she has no personality, nothing to individuate as a singular entity in the show. She is a plot device that drives Arima to get in touch with his own love of music. And then there's the obvious spoiler alert toward the end of the show. Why do people become sad when something unfortunate happens to this character, when the type of person she is would never exist in real life? Rather, whoever she really is within the context of the show is not known to us, the viewer, because it was very obvious to me by the end of the show that I knew absolutely nothing about her. What makes her tick? What was her childhood like? Any difficult relationships in her past? What really really annoys her for no reason? What are her favorite things? What is she afraid of? Are there things in life she's uncertain about? Quite simple, we know next to nothing about the answers to those questions. That being said, why are we expected to cry over her as if it was our best friend or lover even, when the extent that we know about her is akin to a friend you met at a party and have seen at another 4 or 5 parties? 

Secondly, Arima has a lot of interesting character development, but that's because we get to see a lot of what he's thinking due to his near perpetual monologues. That's my issue with it though. We are supposed to feel connected to him as the protagonist of the show and we are supposed to root for him and be sad when bad things happens to him. But again, I would argue that we know him about as well as we know Kaori by the content shown to us in the course of the show. Imagine if you met someone who barely ever talks and is really shy, but every single day they let you read a page out of their diary, in which most of the entries use mostly identical language as in the last one, often repeating phrases and entire concepts, and rife with meaningless and vague metaphors that are repeated often as well. Aside from the fact that one might be incredibly frustrated at the abysmal ability of self-expression and reflection this person has, what would you really learn about this person after 22 days of reading their diary and exchanging a few glances and a handful of conversations? Would you cry yourself to sleep if you found out that his mother used to beat him when he was a child or that something tragic happened to a girl he had a crush on? Because let's face it, these two did not love each other, they were *in* love with each other in a very limited way that relied only on vague romantic attraction that was based on love at first sight for both of them. Either way, what are we supposed to feel connected to, when again, we don't even know this person?

My point at the end of the day is that the crux of the show relies on the tragedy and beauty experienced through these two characters and their relationship, but nothing that happens to or between these characters is remotely accurate of either real-life people or a real-life relationship between any two people. So my question for those who felt so deeply moved by this show is, what is it about these characters' unrealistic and redundant behavior that causes you to feel as though they are real enough to cry over them?

Again, I know I'm coming off as a hater, but I really don't hate this show. I enjoyed some of it, but I just really don't understand when people talk about it as if it's the next Clannad.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it makes much sense to compare this with Clannad. Clannad + AS has only one scene where i found a bit of emotion, and it wasn't sadness. Shigatsu was... something different. Someone who relates to Tomoya will most likely not relate to Arima due to the differences in personality of these characters. 

A different poster here says that it is almost impossible to relate to the unrealistic backstory of the main character. Agreed, but irrelevant. The fundamental part is that these movies are loved by some because of the likability of the character actions or personality, a very personal thing. The moment where a character does something and you think 'hey, i would never do that', the show immediately becomes less enjoyable on an emotional level. Shigatsu keeps the experience believable by not displaying anything onscreen that i would never do. For me, Clannad fails that test despite having far more realistic characters.

I don't think Clannad was sad in any way, or AnoHana, even though those shows are often referenced as such. I think that Clannad was boring and that the fireworks episode was the only good one in AnoHana. I kept waiting for that moment to happen where the shows turned into something great, but it never did.

My honest answer is that i like Shigatsu because [spoiler](/s "Up until two thirds of the last episode, i was still in denial over whether Kaori would die not not."). No idea how the show did it, but it worked very well.
>> ARTICLE
Well, there's also the fact that Clannad in its entirety is twice as long as Shigatsu, so that gives it a leg up in terms of development. But I would argue all the same, that given the same amount of time, we knew more about what kinds of people Tomoya and Nagisa were than we did about Kaori and Arima. I related to Arima a lot as a person, because I've had a similar experience insofar as I grew up trained in a classical method for piano, but I never loved music until I started playing with my heart and not just what's on the page. I'm also not very confident about most things and tend to curl up in fear over trauma like Arima did. That said, he just didn't develop in any really meaningful way, so I still just felt like an acquaintance with him. I mean, he certainly changed, but he sure as hell tried really hard to keep me from appreciating any of it with his inner monologue. I see a lot of people on here mentioning this, and I agree. He tells you what's going on waaaaaaaaay too much, and I end up feeling cheated out of any actual development because he just describes to you what's happening.

I don't there's any excuse for Kaori though. She is truly a character lacking any dynamicity. We get a tiny bit of character development in the last episode, and up til then she's just a walking plot device.
>> ARTICLE
This show has been on my PTW list for ages, but as this thread shows, it seems to be very polarizing. I hesitate to watch it for this reason because viewer reactions remind me of those for Sakurasou, which was a major disappointment for me. 

I enjoy dramas and romance as much as anyone else, so my question for those who are critical of this show: what shows in this genre do you think are great examples of drama/romance that's well-done and presented? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm saving this for when I need to make recommendation for this show.
>> ARTICLE
>Through masterful storytelling and writing, including the highly effective use of foreshadowing, parallel, symbolism

Which examples of foreshadowing were masterful? I found the foreshadowing really obvious and didn't feel like foreshadowing at all.

> Your Lie in April boasts a set of lifelike, relatable main characters

[Spoiler] (/s "Can you please tell me how you related to a boy who was abused by his mom and a girl with a fatal disease?" ) Not trying to be mean or anything, but I didn't find anything about those kids relatable.

> For comedic scenes, the show employs a chibi-like slapstick animation, which not only provides good visual contrast with more serious scenes, but also saves budget for where it counts.

I found those quite annoying and unfunny, actually. I don't think the chibi comedy was a good thing.

I agree tbh, but I think it's more of the daily YLIA threads that makes it feel "too soon". The anime did air about a year ago now.

It's been over a year since it finished airing, I think that's enough time.

Yeah, but Netflix got it a month ago so a lot of people have probably just watched or rewatched it after it got added. Generally a year is a decent enough time, but a lot of people (especially if new) probably have already watched it recently. It would have been a good idea to start it right after Netflix added it.

**Episode 7: The Shadow Whispers**

This episode is a bit more emotionally subdued than the last one, although it still contains one of the more tender moments between Kaori and Kousei. Then it ratchets up the tension in preparation for Kousei's big solo performance and wraps up with his rival, Takeshi, taking the stage.

* ["The worst they're going to do to you is point and laugh if you fail. It's better than being abandoned."](http://i.imgur.com/5ylKTYb.png) Referring ahead to later in the episode when you learn that Kousei's cat, Chelsee, was taken from him and abandoned by his mother.

* ["You're no Beethoven. More to the point, you're no Chopin. Tell me, who are you in there?"](http://i.imgur.com/BZbydVm.png) This conversation represents Kousei's struggle to find himself. Likewise after Watari's game when [he wonders if he "gets" Chopin and asks himself if he's in the music.](http://i.imgur.com/Uw7F8sU.png) All his life, he's just been a "robot" playing the scores exactly as they were written. But he's not Beethoven or Chopin. Now he's being pushed by Kaori to be himself, and he has no idea who he is inside. When he looks inward, he only sees his mother's puppet.

* [Watari puts on a brave face](http://i.imgur.com/h7PPvrB.png) after losing the game, but he's broken inside. I find this particularly sad because it shows how Watari really has no one to lean on. Whereas Tsubaki was able to open up with Kousei in the last episode, being told that she never had to hold back with him, [Watari has to express his sadness alone.](http://i.imgur.com/DYC9xEz.png) He and Kaori don't share that same connection.

* Oh man. [Kaori heard that Kousei collapsed](http://i.imgur.com/xB8lriu.png) and she must've immediately feared the worst. And then she finds it's just because the dummy has been skipping meals in order to practice. [Don't go scaring Kaori like that!](http://i.imgur.com/xd6ZxAN.png) Oh and also, Tsubaki beat her there and was the one to 'nurse' him back to health. Yay! Tsubaki is contributing!

* [Kaori notices the milk Kousei's drinking](http://i.imgur.com/iF2pY1k.png) and must be recalling [the previous night](http://i.imgur.com/8ddWfBJ.png). His collapse is just another reminder that he's hurting himself for her.

* I'm just gonna say it because it's been bothering me since the first time I watched it. [That cat is ugly as hell.](http://i.imgur.com/xxoNPiy.png) Thing looks like a damn gremlin.

* Yesterday, /u/TheStigMKD mentioned that [in manga it's not uncommon for motion right-to-left to symbolize movement forward while the opposite symbolizes the past.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4g1i6f/rewatch_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_your_lie_in_april/d2e2izs) Here, after Kousei recalls his past trauma, we see [the train in the background moving left-to-right.](http://i.imgur.com/giS8UJQ.png) Kousei is falling back down the rabbit hole.

* ["You like egg sandwiches, and your favorite kind of milk is Moo Moo brand. It's good for washing down all the sweets you eat. Sports are not your forte. Tsubaki's always been like a sister to you. Aaand you're kinda jealous of Watari's way with the ladies.](http://i.imgur.com/mflBVlU.png) [Change all you want, or don't change at all. You're *you*, no matter what."](http://i.imgur.com/Nsut8ul.png)

* After Kaori's pep talk, we see another train pass by. [This time going right-to-left.](http://i.imgur.com/Adkt5u9.png) Kaori is pushing him forward again and not letting him wallow in his past.

* ["Just play with sincerity!](http://i.imgur.com/xT8ekvh.png) [Give the performance of your life with everything you've got."](http://i.imgur.com/yiZvbag.png)

* "When you're depressed, it always helps to lean your head on your arms. Because arms like to feel useful like that." [Our second Peanuts quote by Kaori,](http://i.imgur.com/jRzaV1R.png) this time from Charlie Brown.

* ["Just know, she's going to be there."](http://i.imgur.com/UlpV8gz.png) Kousei is going to have to confront the ghost of his mother if he ever hopes to move forward.

* ["You're going to shine like a star up there!"](http://i.imgur.com/r1dFjZi.png)

* ["Time to face my past."](http://i.imgur.com/bZ4ZllC.png) (You expected a picture of [Takeshi and Emi](http://i.imgur.com/cwgvyqh.png), but it was *me*, ~~Dio~~ Kousei's mother!)

* ["Far as I can tell, he just doesn't care. Not about other people, and not about us.](http://i.imgur.com/z06LiOi.png) [Maybe not...himself either."](http://i.imgur.com/LIa3cav.png)

* ["Kousei runs like a digital watch. Precisely, but no soul. No resonance."](http://i.imgur.com/sxbF3Pv.png)

* ["Who's been talking trash about my friend?! I'll kill 'em!" "*Yeah! You messed with the wrong pianist!*"](http://i.imgur.com/1Wu85yf.png) I love how at every concert so far, a new person has had to sush Watari and/or Tsubaki. First it was [Kousei at Kaori's competition,](http://i.imgur.com/8w66EhP.png) then it was [a guest at Kaori and Kousei's performance.](http://i.imgur.com/fVTlmkS.png) Now it's [Kaori at Kousei's competition.](http://i.imgur.com/hyIlju4.png)

* It's interesting to contrast the differences between Takeshi and Emi's motivations. They're essentially polar opposites. Takeshi idolizes his "invincible hero" represented by Kousei's mechanical perfection on the piano and is struggling to reach that same level, but he has too much emotion in his playing which has prevented Takeshi from ever surpassing him technically. Emi on the other hand embraces emotions and despises the machine Kousei's mother turned him into, and she competes in an effort to open Kousei's eyes and destroy the "concrete boy." Takeshi is struggling to become what Kousei *used to* be, while Emi is struggling to show Kousei what he *could* be.

* [Kousei wonders why this time feels so different.](http://i.imgur.com/h60NJYY.png) As Emi said, he never used to care about anyone or anything else. He'd move through his performances with his head down, emotionless. But now Kousei's emotions are starting to come through. [For the first time, he's looking up](http://i.imgur.com/799zyfH.png) and seeing how everyone else is struggling around him in their own ways.

Pretty typical for anime, in my experience. Kids either look like they're in 3rd grade, or they look old enough to be in college, with no in between.

As someone who has experience working around middle-schoolers, none of the cast of *Your Lie* look like they're in 8th grade. They could pass for high school seniors *at minimum*.

It's probably hard to draw the relatively subtle differences that separate a high schooler with a young adult. I've noticed that the older an anime character is supposed to be, the smaller their eyes are.

I'll be dabbling in videos for the rest of the rewatch because I'm starting to feel like stills just don't cut it sometimes. If you have any requests let me know.

* I know perfectly well how it feels to be in Kousei's position regarding Emi and Aiza. I had an almost exact experience when I was 14.

English is not my native language, however, I've been exposed to it since I was an infant for various reasons. Everyone kept telling me I was so good at it. At the end of primary school (I think that's middle school in the U.S.) I went to an English language competition. I ended up winning first place with a staggering 30 point difference between me and the second place. I made the high score in the whole nation and it hasn't been broken to this day AFAIK. I also received a huge scholarship that paid for all of my high school tuition.

My friends who studied really hard for the competition kept asking me how had I done it? I really had no answer to them because I'd never thought about it before. I hadn't invested a single minute into preparation for the tests. I kept shrugging it off like it was no big deal. This made everyone furious. I only realized it several years down the line.
>> ARTICLE
that's a cool story, thanks for sharing

Interesting. Most *native* English speakers aren't even very good at speaking or writing correct English these days, so I imagine you'd need to have an exceedingly good grasp of it to be winning competitions for it. Do you mind me asking what your native language is?

Possibly 3, actually. The cat in the opening has bright blue eyes, the cat that Kaori chases in episode 1 and that we see again in episode 3 outside the cafe has blueish-green/aqua eyes, and the cat we first see in this episode has distinctly yellow-green eyes.

It's possible though that different lighting just accounts for the difference in eye color between the first two. Or even that differences in lighting account for all 3, since Kaori exclaims "Look who's back" when sees this cat, and it should technically be her first time seeing the green-eyed one.

I was surprised though. I always thought every instance of the cat outside the opening was the green-eyed one.
>> ARTICLE
They aren't meant to be the same cat. I believe the blue-eyed cat from the opening was Kousei's cat, Chelsee, whereas the green-eyed cat is just a stray that looks similar and serves as a reminder to Kousei.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't Chalsea also have Green eyes? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if Chelsee's eye color is ever explicitly stated. I'm just assuming that the cat lounging on the Steinway & Sons piano in the openening is meant to be Kousei's.
>> ARTICLE
So many different spellings of Chelsea lol.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going off of the spelling on the [box of candies](http://i.imgur.com/mGBERSU.png) that Kousei said he named his cat after, so I figure that's gotta be the right spelling of it. Even though it's not how you would typically spell the actual name, Chelsea.
>> ARTICLE
Watari lost too :c and nooo! Not Chelsea! What happened to Chelsea after she was abandoned?!

Kousei really likes those egg sandwiches, I hope Tsubaki is happy he ate the food she gave him.

Kousei's rivals really have a lot of rage built up in them!
>> ARTICLE
Just a question about the recordings you selected for the playlist, is there any reason why you put recordings of Richter playing Bach instead of Gould?  I've always felt that Gould was, and is, by far the best interpreter of Bach's pieces.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, I never really listened to many of Gould's recordings of Bach's pieces.  I've listened to all of Richter's recordings and I thought he did a fairly decent job; hence why I put them in the playlist.  

Since you brought it to my attention, I'm currently listening to Gould's interpretations of the two Preludes/Fugues I have in my playlist and I see what you mean now.  

I think I'll go ahead and add his recordings to the playlist since I like them quite a lot.
>> ARTICLE
I hope they release a CD of the performances. I like the OPs/EDs and the OSTs, but it feels incomplete if I can't hear some of these performances in high fidelity.

Thanks for writing all these. I played piano for 6~ years, but never really looked any of the famous composers, I just played music (Probably why I haven't enjoyed piano music until a year or so ago). Knowing more about how the music is created, analyzed, and played really makes it all the more beautiful to listen to. 
>> ARTICLE
Why no write-up for 22? Or this Chopin piece has been already discussed and I'm missing something? 
>> ARTICLE
I did the write up on the Ballade for Episode 21.  I didn't think I needed to write up anymore for the final episode.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, baka me. So overwhelmed that I completety forgot its the same Ballade as last episode... Sry :) 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you
>> ARTICLE
Concerning the Ballade, is there a full version of piano AND violin duet available somewhere? I found just the solo piano version.... 
>> ARTICLE
Chopin composed the Ballades for solo piano. I'm fairly certain that the violin was written in by whoever did the music for the show.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I'm wondering if any of the soundtracks have the version with the violin. I might have missed something 
>> ARTICLE
Yes a soundtrack will be released with more classical pieces on Mar. 25.  Among them is the Ballade version with the violin (which was arranged by Ysae).

I feel like the lone man out, this show didn't hit me as hard as some other ones I've watched. I was given plenty of time to prepare for the ending, and I felt like it was done very well. Great show, but I cried more during the beach scene with Kousei and Tsubaki than I did during the ending.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you a lot. It is a sad show, but it prepares you for the ending really well. [Shigatsu Spoilers](/s "I did cry at the end where Kousei and Kaori were playing their duet, but it wasn't really about her death, but the fact that they never trully had a "start" or truly, physically had a good duet.") 
>> ARTICLE
[Shigatsu](/s "I think that is one the things that hit me hard about the show. Not just the ending but the lost potential. All the things that could've been and now will never happen with her gone. Basically the lost of their possible future that will now never be. Also the main reason I have problems with forced engagements that are used far to often in anime. They are almost always about the girl being forced to give up on her future.")
>> ARTICLE
You see, [spoilers for the show we're talking about in this thread](/s "I THOUGHT I was prepared. I really did. I'd steeled myself for the whole show, and when they announced the surgery the same date as his competition I hardened myself for the inevitable scene of Kaori flatlining on the operating table and the mournful doctor breaking it to her distraught parents.")     

[still talking about the only show that it would make any sense for me to be talking about right now](/s "But we didn't get that. INSTEAD, we got the scene in Kousei's mind's eye of her scattering in a cloud of cherry blossom petals while he begs her not to go. WHICH WAS SO MUCH WORSE. That scene utterly broke me in a way that I was completely unprepared for. It's been a week since I finished my first watch of that YLiA, and I'm still not quite right.")

I think it captures, in essence, what the entire series is.

I find that the cherry blossom in the background is perfect because it be interpreted as part of his ideal image of her - the beautiful springtime violinist that changed his life forever. The darkness of the background shows just how lonely he feels without her, but he pays no attention to her. This shows how she is always on his mind, but the main focus of his has become the piano.

The whole criticism of he's being abused by his friends argument, reeks of oversensitivity, and people who have never spent time with conflicted people. Kousei has a conflicted relationship with his mother, people throw the label of abuser on her and think that means he should burn every bridge connected to her, that just seems so ignorant. People love their parents, despite abuse, despite unhealthy relationships, we still forge meaningful connections, and entrench them into our lives. To complete cut them out of your life, is to just complete ignore your problems, at least the way Kousei is doing it. I've always felt that getting past abuse came from understanding/ or learning to let go of anger/ move on with your life. Not to mention that beyond all this history Kousei has, he still loves music, he still feels inherently drawn to it (the sheet music he writes as a job), and to the people who play it (Kaori). His friends are trying to push him to confront his struggles instead of living this grey, apathetic life he's let himself sink into (Lack of Color). Not to mention, the whole abuse argument only exists in a third party's mind. None of his friends understand why he left music behind, and from their perspective they're just trying to push him into a passion that he seems to be to timid to try again. The show is obviously aware of the anguish this causes him (necessary anguish I'd say). To anyone with this complaint, give it time, I'm pretty sure this show is smart enough to let this struggle bubble to the surface.


(Anyway this is just my argument after the first paragraph I'll be updating it in a second)


>There have been inklings of this since the beginning of episode 3, when Kaori and co. first ask Kousei to be her accompaniment. Kaori and Kousei are at the cafe, and Kousei is forced to play the piano because he is not allowed to embarrass her (Kaori) in front of the children. Later, he stops because he stops being able to hear the notes on the piano. Kaori proceeds to comfort him, i.e. tell him that hes weak and that if he cant play, he should just play! Yes, it does not make a lick of sense. Its like telling a person suffering from depression to stop being sad and to get over it. She even tells him that his trauma is just an excuse so he can give up on the piano. Shes discrediting his suffering, and this is incredibly insensitive, aside from Kaoris already awful personality.

To the writer of this article, remember that what we see as the audience is not what Kaori sees. She doesn't know about his mother, she hasn't heard his internal monologues, she hasn't seen him alone clutching his head in agony like we have. From Kaori's perspective Kousei (Someone she respected as a great pianist) has just lost himself to indifference and fear of failure, so with all of her, albeit blunt, emotional tools she is trying to pull him out of his head. She's sees herself as the emotional anchor that Kousei needs to get out of his head. His real problems are self-loathing, a buried fear of failure (instilled by his mother), consuming apathy, and a clouded state of mind. What Kousei lacks is simple unwavering beliefs, those self evident truths that Kaori overflows with, all those things he could never gain as a child. And so Kaori serves as a juxtaposition from which he rethinks his entire life, and begins to regain his childhood (Jumping off the bridge, 4).

>Then, Kaori and Tsubaki agree to get Kousei to do the accompaniment together. Great minds think alike, I guess. They literally force the poor boy to do it; they put the sheet music everywhere and invade his personal space, they hit him with a baseball and force him to listen to the music he doesnt want to. Then Kaori and Tsubaki have a chat on the bus, where Kaori finally has the decency to question her actions. Tsubaki promptly says that she wants him (Kousei) to be able to play music on his own terms. This angered me greatly. When exactly does he get to do anything on his own terms when theyve been forcing everything on him? How is that playing on his own terms? It doesnt make sense for them to assume they know whats best for him and force him to act when he should be able decide for himself. This is especially so for Kaori. How does one understand someone else in such a short time? Shes barely known Kousei.

It's almost like they think he's running away from his problems, and are strong arming him like friends often do. It's less about the music, and more about concern for a person who has completely lost sight with themselves. All they're trying to do is get him to do something, you can't approach your life like it's a lazy river.  You can't just cut your problems out of your mind and pretend they aren't there. The writer here says he can't play music on his own terms if they force him to do it, but he's not being forced to do anything. No one can make you do anything with words. The simple choice to do it, to face his fears was his, and his alone. He said no a thousand times, and a thousand times more, so why did he say yes in the end? Nothing changed situationaly, so what changed his mind. When he saw Kaori crying he realized the affect his actions had on others. This apathy, this self loathing, this universal hatred he had, they hurt other people. The way we behave affects the people around us, the people who love us, and in that moment Kousei realized he wasn't just hurting himself, he was hurting the people he cared about. So even though he said no a thousand times, and even though nothing had changed from the last time he said no, he said yes. He agreed to face his problems, on his own terms.
>> ARTICLE
Bravo! A fantastic rebuttal to the article. I'm sorry I'm only able give you an upvote.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with the majority of what you said, but I don't think the show says anything about his friends not knowing
>> ARTICLE
Nor has it said they do know, but we can be fairly sure Kaori doesn't know since she just met him, and she's the one most people are complaining about.
>> ARTICLE
I want to see what you think of the thing that's already been brought up, in a different light. 

Kaori knows he was a famous pianist. Many people know Kousei is a famous child prodigy. 

We ALSO know that in flashbacks, there are the "whispers" we hear of the audience members saying "Didn't he train under his mother? She probably beats him" or something to that effect.

The point of this is that his mother has a REPUTATION for abuse when it comes to piano playing. I am not convinced that Kaori, given her talent and time in the scene, would not realize that his mother was abusive.

Then again, I do agree that this is only episode 4 of a 22 episode show and we need to see where it will go. 

But, you know what they say, first impressions and all.
>> ARTICLE
Well Kaori would have been a kid too, so I doubt she was told, or would have understood. I read into that particular scene more as Kousei's distrust/disenfranchisement of/with adults. Not only was there an abusive mother, there were these parents who could have helped him, but didn't. It seems more like a rumor among other parents than something that would have been brought to any of his friends attention.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure Kaori doesn't know. I was thinking about the other 2 who push him around and try to force him against his will
>> ARTICLE
And this would be my reply

>Again, context. Kaori doesn't know Kousei needs therapy, and Kousei doesn't either. This show isn't about Kousei fixing his problems through the magic of music. It's about Kousei leanring to at least face his problems, through the help of his friends. He can't do anything if he keeps running (Ignoring) away from his problems. I'm pretty sure the music is more symbolic of his past as a whole then anything. As in, it contains both the good and bad of his childhood. All these people around him are trying to stage an intervention of sorts, trying to get him to actually take a look at himself and his stuggles, by wrestling with this complex history and sorting out what he needs to leave behind, and what he needs to take with him. Hence the duality of catharthic release, and complete dissociation he experiences in their solo. Only by anchoring on to Kaori's simple good will can he navigate his feelings.
>> ARTICLE
Aka Kousei *needs psychiatric therapy*! Not a manic pixie girl shamelessly emotionally manipulating him to play for her!
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say he needs psychiatric help. He knows that he's just making excuses for himself.
>> ARTICLE
Bingo, which his friends CAN help him with (though realisticly he may need some form of therapy later down the road).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he may have some deep seated problems, but his friends could certainly bring him back to reality without pushing him into the deep end unexpectedly.
>> ARTICLE
It's not like they did already(forcing him to play with Kaori ending up in his own purgatory).
>> ARTICLE
A purgatory which led right into the most cathartic moment so far. Music is both agony, and joy for him. He is trying to wrestle with these two emotions to see what music really is for him, does he really love it, or is it just what his childhood callously forced into him. He needs conflict, he needs to confront things.
>> ARTICLE
And to do that, you *emotionally manipulate* a person with psychiatric problems. I don't know about you, unawareness is one thing, dramatizing their methods as something positive for Kousei is not something I look up to.

He needs to vent his own emotions with others, not have everyone else forcing theirs *on him*<- ofc that won't backfire as it realistically would, since that's not how the story is taking direction.
>> ARTICLE
I guess, really, we'll just have to watch the rest of the show to get a feeling for how his friends are behaving. Without complete context either one could be right.

I will say nothing has stricken me as emotionally manipulative, more like poorly executed worry. I mean their middle schoolers, they seem to express themselves in a very broken emotional language. And I've read it as 3 friends deeply concerned about a friend who won't open up to them, and won't actualize himself. So they're doing what a lot of friends do and take a stand. The whole thing comes off a bit worse because of the abuse context we as third party observers are aware of, but as a whole I'd say it's pushing him towards the right conflict.
>> ARTICLE
Again, context. Kaori doesn't know Kousei needs therapy, and Kousei doesn't either. This show isn't about Kousei fixing his problems through the magic of music. It's about Kousei leanring to at least face his problems, through the help of his friends. He can't do anything if he keeps running (Ignoring) away from his problems. I'm pretty sure the music is more symbolic of his past as a whole then anything. As in it contains both the good and bad of his childhood.

Hence the duality of catharthic release, and complete dissociation he experiences in their solo. Only by anchoring on to Kaori's simple good will can he navigate his feelings.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think his friends are staging any sort of intervention. They don't care about his feelings, or understand them.
>> ARTICLE
Why did Kaori cry when he wouldn't play with her, why is Tsubaki in a perpetual state of worry? How can these be anything but deep seated concern for a friend who they are desperately trying to understand. They don't understand him, so they're trying to help him in the only way they how, by pushing him towards what seems to be the center of his happiness, and the center of his problem (which he won't face). Obviously this isn't what a psychiatrist would recommend, obviously this is going to blow up (I predict during the climax). But it's better than literally nothing, than letting yourself sink into nonresistance.
>> ARTICLE
Kaori cried because she needed him, not the other way around.

Tsubaki worries about him because he's always unhappy. She doesn't understand, or try to understand a thing.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you can say that, Kaori knows Kousei was a great pianist, and as selfish as people want to paint her out to be (People always assume Tsundere's are bad characters), she seems to feel deeply hurt at Kousei's indifference. She seems hurt by the fact he can't experience what she does in music, even though he so desperately needs it. Kaori doesn't actually need him as an accompanist ( She basically ignored her last one). I can't really think of way to interpret her intensity of emotion other than a desire to help him. ( Though obviously there's a component of her needing him in an emotional sense)
>> ARTICLE
Who knows. I guess we'll just wait and see.
>> ARTICLE
If I'm wrong I give you permission to gloat, and call me a pretentious wanker for over analyzing.
>> ARTICLE
No, I get your point and you are correct in that perspective on some points, but even then, the show isn't handling it well, along with overdramatizing the realistic elements for catharsis or triumph.

Though props for the discussion and analysis, but I'm sticking with Kousei's side, since I empathize with him and next to him Kaori is manic and irrational.

Anyway, nothing wrong with analyzing. If it wasn't 3 AM I would have went all the way with it
>> ARTICLE
They do care about his feelings, that's why they want to get him back playing, since they know that's Kousei's entire life.

What they see as mere excuses for him not to play is a serious psychological barrier created by a traumatic event and hard childhood.

My problem isn't that Kousei isn't communicating that, it's that the entire anime glorifies Kaori's actions of pushing him over the edge with no reconcile or a hint of empathy, but rather selfish desire and emotionally manipulating a person with an identity crisis and then say it's for his own good.
>> ARTICLE
I see your point, but I'm gonna go ahead and speculate that Kaori and Kousei knew each other as kids, or something along those lines (#ItsAnime), and she's helping him in the classic tsundere way, "I didn't do it for you b-baka". I analyzed this above, but I don't know how to interpret her crying on the roof as anything but concern for Kaori, and a desperate need to help him (Which is admittedly manipulative, but not really in the way you're saying). As I see it she's pushing him to do a lot of the right things for him, but being very close mouthed about why, and just throwing up a front of selfishness. Or maybe she is being selfish, and they'll get to that later, which would be equally as interesting really.
>> ARTICLE
They already established that she knew him as a child and since then she held him in high regard. He was her inspiration and stubbornly wanted *him* and no one else to play with her. In a way it's her whim, and she is encouraged to act upon it by Kousei's buddies as well.

Her tsundere moments are there for comic relief, but in the serious moments when she's forcing her own resolve onto him through crying or intimidation(before the performance), that's where she crosses the line for me.

And with her being anemic, she has a good basis for that resolve(rejecting her physiological limitations for her expression, though that's unhealthy within itself, but a good mindset nonetheless).

Lastly I don't think the show will take that in consideration as much and will keep going on pushing Kousei over the edge with no negative consequence and Kaori will still be someone to look up to instead of someone who is Machiavellian through emotional appeal(lol).
>> ARTICLE
That first point is probably on point, but it then raises the conflict in Kaori that she could be trying to save Kousei from himself because she's so crestfallen to see how far he's fallen.

To the second point, time will tell definitely.

A good analysis of her character, and one of the reasons I think this show is better written than people are giving it credit for.

Again, we'll just have to see
>> ARTICLE
True enough for the first part, I was forgetting about some details. 

Actually I agree with everything you said.
>> ARTICLE
Psychological counseling. Psychiatry won't do much better
>> ARTICLE
Yea you're right, why don't we hook Kousei up on a bunch of meds, make him go to an institution where they label him as a special child, and prevent him from ever playing piano again /s
>> ARTICLE
>why don't we hook Kousei up on a bunch of meds, 

I already said that psychiatry won't do much better. Did you confused the two terms together? The use of "you're right" and "/s" means that your are mocking my point.
>> ARTICLE
So you think sitting on a nice couch and describing his vulnerabilities to a stranger would be more effective than his friends?
>> ARTICLE
They know good ways for coping mechanisms and will be able to develop strategies to deal with the behaviors issue. It's about problem solving and tackle the issues that affect him. 

Sure some anxiolytic drugs can reduce his symptoms, but ultimately he needs some CBT to fully address his issues. His problem is complex but we have to try non pharmacological interventions first. If his friends can do that, great, but next up should be some counseling before having to take up some drugs. Even General Practitioners should be contacted, but I'm not sure if that's the culture in Japan
>> ARTICLE
If he finds a good counselor that understands his experiences and can help guide him down the right path, then I would agree. However, I think it's more likely he will be diagnosed with a number of disorders, tries a different counselor, diagnosed with even more disorders, and spends his life taking a large number of different medications.

My biggest gripe with modern mental health is this obsession of finding problems in patients and categorizing them by various cases. Even if the patient was perfectly normal, by giving him a victim mentality he will always see himself as somehow insufficient and in need of outside help to become better. The show even mentioned Beethoven as an example. If Beethoven went to a modern psychologist after he lost his hearing, for sure he would have been told to quit composing. And where would that leave classical music today? 

Kaori meanwhile doesn't take any of Kousei's excuses because at the end of the day, Kousei needs to face the music (pun intended) if he wants to move on from his current outlook on his mother. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably an American side of things then. Their system is not one I'm familiar with. Guess that explains why you were so against it
>> ARTICLE
I'm a little confused as to the distinction you're trying to draw here.

Psychiatrists also use psychotherapy and counselling skills. While psychiatrists are able to prescribe medications (and use ECT), there's more to them than that. And they definitely don't institutionalise people willy-nilly like /u/secretvandal seems to believe. 

In Kousei's case, I would think that he may be suffering from a degree of depression (in addition to that PTSD/inability to hear piano), and he may benefit from anti-depressives *in addition* to counselling/working through his issues.
>> ARTICLE
Probably due to the different systems. In Australia psychiatrist refers to psychologists to more of psychotherapy and counseling stuff. They take care of behavioural aspects while the psychiatrists focus on the medical side. They can still listen and talk, but generally a referral is made.
>> ARTICLE
Ah fair enough, I guess it was the same in the hospital where I worked (also in Australia).

I suppose psychotherapy is rather time-consuming, so referring long-term counselling/therapy to clinical psychologists would make sense if they're short on time. 

I just feel that the media has a habit of misrepresenting psychiatry as some evil organisation out to medicate/institutionalise people rather than counsellors with additional treatment options.
>> ARTICLE
You aren't wrong. I'm not against medication, but people needs to understand the benefits of counseling as well. I did mention the involvement of having a GP in his ongoing treatment, but the Asian culture probably doesn't like that idea to begin with. 

That's probably a rash decision of mine to try to have some input in this discussion to begin with in the first place. 
>> ARTICLE
I personally hold the term "article" to a different standard than an animefan blog post.

I think the friends were a little too pushy too, but I think it's also about differences in how the American culture deals with these kinds of issues and how East Asian culture deals with them. In addition, I think it's important that to Kousei, his music represents everything he did and had with his mother, both good and bad. To completely turn away from it is something that no one wants.

As for Kaori, I think that's her whole character too. She doesn't want him to dwell on something that she doesn't associate with music because to her, music represents something else entirely. I also don't think we know enough about Kaori as a character to make strong judgments about her.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they know why he can't play... 

and the most important thing which many tends to forget that they are 14 years old in middle school, what did you expect ? helping him psychologically ? of course they will act like that. 
>> ARTICLE
> and the most important thing which many tends to forget that they are 14 years old in middle school, what did you expect ? helping him psychologically ? of course they will act like that. 

It's directly addressed in the article:

> Now, I know people are going to disagree with me on this. You might think its OK for them to act like they do, after all theyre only fourteen. Teenagers being stupid as hell is like a universally accepted truth. That I agree with. Yes, they are all stupid (clearly) and yes, fourteen year olds can act like self-important, prudish little pricks with no understanding of what it means to be a little sensitive towards the feelings of others. But that can only fly when the series writers themselves understand this fact, and do something to show that they KNOW these kids are wrong. It doesnt.

The problem is not that they're fourteen - it's that the show seems to glorify their actions and suggest that it's a good thing.
>> ARTICLE
If they've known him since pre-school, I bet they must've noticed how disciplined and seemingly unhappy Kousei looked.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly OP I agreed with the article. Though I would say as I get mad at their friends I do recognized these are middle schoolers and that these kids aren't perfect. it is the dissonance of our knowledge of Kousai's issues and his friends being oblivious to how physically crippling his abused was. I would say the bridge scene was cute its just suck that I have to deal with these bullshit friends. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure what point you're really trying to make here. Kousei's problem is rooted in the fact that his mother forced him to play, and he never enjoyed it, but he's still loyal to his mother and influenced by her. 

His friends don't understand what he's going through or sympathizing with it. They basically tell him to suck it the fuck up and do it. 

I do think that he mentally limits himself into it, and wants it, but just can't break that barrier
>> ARTICLE
Sorry that I didn't make my point clear. As a child Kousei has been playing the piano. Whether he enjoyed it or not, it is still an important part of his identity. As he is attempting to do, he can't just cut that off from himself.
>> ARTICLE
I hear this in various comments during the episode threads, and every time I hear this, it kind of annoys me. My view is that we're only on episode 5 where you've only seen tiny bits and pieces of Kousei's problems through vague, jagged flashbacks, so clearly *you don't know Kousei anywhere near as well the kids around him do*, and thus you should not be so quick to judgment.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad someone agrees with my opinions on this show. There's some good music, and an attempt at a good message there, but the show fails in the execution (including its complete lack of subtlety).

> Which brings me to my last point  that the presentation of the series is flawed at its very core. The series has been actively excusing Kouseis friends actions, and ironically by doing so they have been insensitive towards their protagonists own suffering. The series goes so far as to incorporate humor, which is OK, but considering the context it makes every single (unfunny) joke tasteless. They have been trying to make the audience laugh AT Kousei being pushed around, NOT at cute friends being happy with each other. They have been sugarcoating the issue, glossing over his suffering by putting cute pretty flowers and sparkles over everything. Theyve been using the Spring is coming motif to push the audience towards thinking that the characters are all good-natured, selfless people helping their poor friend. Theyve been painting Kaori in bright colours, while Kousei is characterized in dark blue hues  treating her like a person the audience should idealize, when they clearly shouldnt. This discrepancy, I think, is representative of the series hypocrisy and complete misunderstanding of its characters.

Black Lagoon with the twins.

I didn't expect the series to take such a strong tonal shift.

A lot of people seem to think that Rock was sickened by mutilated gentiles or something but to me I think it was just the sheer idea that a child would think it's only logical to offer sexual favours to someone just because they were nice to you.

I watched it alongside Gakusen Toshi Asterisk and it was almost like watching the same show twice. Both were pretty decent, though kinda forgettable.
>> ARTICLE
>Implying Asterisk and Rakudai is comparable

That's pretty brave of you m8. I kind of disagree though. Personally Asterisk was pretty meh and I regretted not dropping it while Rakudai was way better than what I expected. I agree that both shows are kind of forgettable, though.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, they're pretty comparable. I get that people are enjoying that rakudai wasn't as bland as others and fulfills their craving of an MC entering a relationship and who reacts better to stuff. But it still has most of the stereotypes, tropes and sins that make up its tight-knit genre, along with asterisk.
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes it's not about having the same things as other shows in the genre, but rather executing it way better than the others. That's if you even think that Rakudai is in the same genre as Asterisk, Taimadou, Mahouka etc. which I disagree with.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I don't wanna sound rude here, it's just those seem like pretty and empty words. It's not "what it is about", the mere fact that they share so many similarities because of the type of show they are (and then some more) makes them comparable. "Comparable" is what we were talking about and they *were* rather similar, so better execution doesn't mean much. I get it, rakudai is the better show, it does something right that the others don't and that fans have been wanting that type of show to do, that doesn't make it a whole different plate than asterisk, and even if the difference in the quality of execution did, it's not like rakudai is really so immensely superior you can't even compare them. It was still forgettable, for one.

As for not being the same genre... ah, I probably won't change your mind, but for the sake of argument: If we're talking about the more basic genres in anime like ecchi, school, supernatural, sci-fi, etc. they share many. If we're talking about the one that list shares, the "school battle" anime that is like an amalgamation of simpler genres and some elements particular of it, they both share it. They don't need to be exactly the same (and they're still pretty similar) to have the same genre. Actually, I'd say Asterisk is closer to Rakudai than to the other 2 you group it with, and Mahouka is closer to Rakudai than to the other 2 you group it with. To say it is not in the same genre, it just sounds like you think so highly of it, that you think the few things it does differently to many school battle anime deserve it a different genre, that you just don't want it to be pitted with them because you think better of it. Oh, shit, sorry I'm not assuming you think that way, it's just what I can think of as to how someone would not find them comparable or of the same genre, and cite better execution as a reason. Shit, now I sound like a snob, sorry about that.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, you don't sound rude at all. 

I can see where you are coming from. Tbh I kind of assumed wrongly that you were one of the many who would categorise all 4 under magic battle harem, which I don't think so because Rakudai wasn't a harem.

Sure, I agree that they may share many genres, but I still think that the different directions that they went into makes it unfair to say that they are similar, specifically towards the second half of the shows. For me, the similarities are only in episode 1 and maybe episode 2, and superficial at best. 

Basically what I'm driving at is that shows with the same genre does not mean that they are similar. It's like saying Oregairu and Sakurasou are similar because they are comedy, drama and has a love triangle.
>> ARTICLE
They are the same show almost, at least as a premise (some differences in plot later). MCs (obviously dark-haired self-insert highschool male with a troubled past) are martial artist/sword users with superhuman reflexes/speed/skill making them pretty much unbeatable in highschool-organized duels that build up to some kind of tournament. But they use their power too much and they physically suffer for some reason. They end up pairing up with a pink/red haired high-ranking princess from another land, who initially tries to fight them until they lose. These princesses both wield flame-type magic, and end up being primary love interests for MC. 

As for the differences between the two shows, I think Asterisk's princess was a little more interesting as a character than Cavalry's, though Stella does get kudos for being more straight-up about her feelings and actually dating the MC. The fights are pretty similar, but perhaps Cavalry's were a bit more entertaining. Asterisk's ending song was pretty awesome as far as anime music goes, though it may just be the use of English that hasn't been butchered.

Overall, pretty decent and I'd watch a second season of either, but they were pretty generic and overshadowed by other better stuff last season.
>> ARTICLE
The only similar parts were ep 1 imo. After that they went in different directions, with the MC collecting girls like pokemon in Asterisk while Rakudai focused more on the action and the MC's backstory.

The harem is so blatantly in-your-face  in Asterisk while you can't say the same for Rakudai. 

Personally I felt that Rakudai as a show was much better executed and was definitely way more interesting than Asterisk or Taimadou. That may be just me not feeling like watching harems at that time, though.

What other shows were better last season? I've watched very few, only the 3 magic knight shows, Sakurako and dropped OPM but I felt that Rakudai was the best among them. Do you mind recommending me some?
>> ARTICLE
I really didnt like the incest they were trying to force with the little sister in Cavalry, you are right it was a bit less haremy than Asterisk but I wasn't really watching either show for the romance anyways. 

As for good shows that season, I dunno why you dropped One Punch Man, it was an amazingly fun to watch series as long as you realized it was meant to be a parody of the heroic shonen genre, perhaps even a parody of Western superhero comics too. They actually managed to make a ridiculously overpowered and unrivaled MC to be both interesting and likeable, and there's no shortage of other great characters too. Got even more fun when I caught up on the manga (great art style) and even the web comic (shitty art style). Definitely anime of the season for me. 

A close second place for me was Noragami Aragoto, a fantastic sequel to Noragami. If you haven't seen Noragami, it's basically modern-day Japan but with the existence of supernatural beings from the underworld, and Gods whose power is dictated by their popularity among worshippers and the weapons/items they wield which are actually the adopted spirits of dead people who never made it to the afterlife. The main character is an unknown and shrineless God named Yato who does random jobs for money and also fights monsters as they appear from the underworld and possess humans.

I'd say my third favorite was Owarimonogatari, part of the Monogatari series which is very much a love it or hate it. Pretty hard series to get into, and it isn't something that's immediately appealing but grows on you over time.

Another one I enjoyed was Owari no Seraph Season 2. But it's essentially like Attack on Titan if you replaced giants who mindlessly eat humans with vampires who pretty much treat humans as livestock. Entertaining, great music, and good for getting a decent fill of mild gore.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped OPM because the humour is really not for me, not because I thought it was a serious show.

Noragami is on my PTW and I'll get to it someday.

 Bakemonogatari is on hold for me and I'm not sure if I will finish it because it's too dialogue heavy for my tastes and I didn't understand much.

I kinda dropped Owari no Seraph S1 by episode 3 because it didn't seem like I would enjoy it, and I had a lot of other shows to watch that season.

And Sato isn't aware of the fencing that saves his life; in his mind, after he tells Misaki that he's going to save her and destroy the monster with the 'revolution bomb', he really jumps.

[Spoilers throughout](/s "Earlier in the series when Sato almost falls from the cliff, he very nearly kills himself, but it's not really suicide because it was an accident. He slips as he turns away from the edge. However, at the end, the opposite is true. Neither of them actually die but the actions they take, without at any point turning back, to the fullness of their knowledge, will actually end their lives, and so while something prevents them both from dying it is not themselves. Had not the circumstances intervened, then by their own decision they would have died")

I think he's saying they [](/s "both successfully jumped off and commited, but something external saved them.")

With NHK, it's one of the few shows that completely justifies its tone, so by the time the ending comes around we have a good grasp of what kind of climax we're going to get. The ending shocks you [](/s "not because they die, but because they don't. The vast majority of replies in this thread will likely be about shockingly dark moments; but NHK executes the exact same feeling with a very fine and bittersweet ending. They commit suicide with genuine intent; and they survive. I do wish they spent more time fleshing out this part of the show though; I think the reason why people call it a cop-out is because it felt really quick when it happened.")






>> ARTICLE
Weird. I thought it didn't need fleshed out more because the heat of the moment was so intense.
>> ARTICLE
I should clarify it's less to do with the specific scene and more the entire final arc. 

[](/s "You're given a big exposition dump about Misaki's life by another family member to setup her suicide - and you almost feel as though that entire info wave deserved it's own episode dedicated to the character. I would have liked that very much. The actual scene with the suicide though was intense and certainly good enough.")

What shocked me the most about that ending is [ ](/s "upon completing that episode, I went onto forums online and found out that people actually thought Lelouch died.") However what REALLY shocks me is that [ ](/s "7 years later, people STILL think he's dead.")

honestly the ending can be interpreted either way

Not really, unless you want to believe that Nunnally's hand-holding skill went up from reading emotions to complete mind reading just for the sake of one scene. And C.C.'s last line makes sense only in one scenario, not in other. Weird that people prefer ending that "feels" better for them, rather than the one that just makes more sense.
>> ARTICLE
Spoilers much?
>> ARTICLE
It's not necessarily that it's not pretty clear [](/s "he's still alive according to the story"), it's that, like most of the plot points in CG, it makes no fucking sense. The show just showed [](/s "him getting spectacularly killed with millions of onlookers"), and now expects us to process the fact [](/s "that not only did nobody notice his immortal, self-healing body, but he's also managed to slip away while keeping the world in the dark?")

Would you mind linking me examples of the two things you stated in your last sentence? I've watched CG and loved the ending but [CG](/s "I definitely don't remember seeing any evidence to point towards the fact that he survived") and I'm generally fairly perceptive when it comes to anime.

[CG #1](/s "He acquired Geass in both eyes - a condition for inheritance of Code Geass")
[CG #2](/s "Before Charles was killed Lelouch had contact with the hand with the Code Geass - presumably transferring it to his throat.")
[CG #3](/s "When Nunally touched Lelouch she received memory flashbacks - consistent with possessors of the Code Geass. If regular geass users could do this - the series would have ended much earlier with all the physical contact Lelouch has.")

Wow that's pretty awesome actually. Thanks for explaining it to me.

[Code Geass R2](/s "I dont understand why people want him to be alive. The ending has so much more impact if Lelouch is dead. The entire show was a chess game, Lelouch using everyone else as his pieces in order to secure victory.

[Code Geass R2](/s "I think there is by far enough value even if he does die - because it doesn't matter. Death being the ultimate sacrifice is simply not necessary, because it is nothing against what he actually accomplished - He claimed victory over Power itself. When people have power they want to use it to change the world, everyone wants to accomplish something, and for that they need more power. They will fight for it, and they will hold on to it. This results in all the problems people in power cause no matter if they are kings, dictators or politicians.

Nope, and I don't plan to. It's not a bad show, but a gorefest for the sake of a gorefest just doesn't appeal to me.

It really isn't simply a gorefest for the sake of a gorefest. Trust me, season 2 is so worth watching.

Do you think I should start watching it tonight? I loved Shiki if you have seen that.. when they cry have been on my list for quite a while and I kinda know how it all works cuz a few years ago when I was extremely new to all anime I watched like 4 episodes, went WTF and quit watching.

It feels kinda weird tho since I have to watch an entire season first, and then just 1 more to get the conclusion.

> went WTF

Oh you will experience that for the majority of season 1. It'S extremely confusing at first. However, season 2 explains everything very nicely and is definitely one of the best anime I've ever seen.

Just keep watching. I'd like to tell you more but I really don't want to spoil anything. Just know that you'll be quite confused for the first season (Maybe you'll be able to figure stuff out on your own) but the 2nd season explains it all.

Man, I wish I could be you right now and watch it for the first time again. I've never had that feeling of suspense and tension when watching an anime again since Higurashi. Fuck, just talking about it makes me want to rewatch it.

Oh yeah, if you have any questions, shoot me a PM and I'll try to answer as best as I can :)

I can't disagree with it being a gore fest. S1 is a gore fest for the sake of setting up season two. Unfortunately gore isn't for everybody.

Are there many different timelines? I've tried watching it twice now, both times I dropped it as soon as the second timeline starts. I'm not sure why, but especially in Higurashi I just couldn't stand it. As I watched it I just wanted it to be over sooner/continue on with the story, not watch an alternative version or whatever. I'd guess it's because I'm not a fan of the art-style.

It amazing.

The end of the first episode of Gakkou Gurashi! / School-Live! is probably one of the most shocking moments in anime for me. I'd been told to get through the first episode to know what was up but I just wasn't expecting *that*.

The entire episode I was just thinking "WTF am I watching...?", and then those last 3 minutes hit my like a bucket filled with ice water. It hurt man, it hurt.

Ryuunosuke is one of my favorite villains ever. He's like the Matou Shinji of Fate/Zero. I love to hate those people who are evil in such a petty way. They don't want world domination, they don't particularly want the Grail at all. They just get a kick out of being monstrous assholes.
>> ARTICLE
The really creepy thing with Ryuunosuke is that he does it with such child like wonder and enthusiasm, he's so fucking casual about it, it's surreal.

 The way he talks about god, philsophy and all that stuff with caster, it's like he's just casually talking to a bro about Sunday night football and not distinguishing murder.

I'd say Gate's first episode this season was quite a bit darker and more shocking than expected. I know the manga was dark and gore filled, and that it wasn't much of it in the anime, but i'd say it turned darker than expected. 

*That* scene was quite shocking, and the season seems to be doing great in that aspect judging from the episodes.

Yeah I remember seeing a post on the sub asking if it was gonna get darker down the line and then I was wondering how, then I saw that scene and was like "oh like that".

Which scene are you referring to?


>> ARTICLE
[Season 2 Gate spoilers](#s 'The sex/rape scene. Never expected it to be so direct. It, and anime in general, usually joke with stuff like that, so I wasn't even sure if it actually was that at the start. But it was, and it was way more direct than I expected, especially for anime and the one like that which has been pretty light on things in the first season. There were some slight hints of stuff, apart from the massive slaughter of people in season one, about darker stuff. Elf girl looking for dead fad, still is in season two though. Sexual diseases, and the hostage in episode two rescued, which seemed to have her family slaughtered.")

Good, not great. Ambitious and very pretty most of the time, long-winded and hilariously under-animated some of the time. Probably needed to be about 5 episodes shorter, or cut a few plot/character threads. Pretty good as a tragic melodrama, not so good as a teen romcom.

It would probably just barely make my top 15 for the year, let alone of all time, but MAL gonna MAL. 


>> ARTICLE
I loved it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a good show which has it's problems.

It has great music and an an interesting story with a good development of the MC.

My problems were that there were a lot of characters whos story or background sadly weren't more explored/developed [Spoiler](/s "the two rivals for example"). Also the moodswings were to fast and offputting [Spoiler](/s "Episode 13 is a good example. He plays his hearth out to say good bye to his mother and it is really emotional. And then comes the little girl and gives him a headbutt"). An other thing that put me of was that there were too many girls who were interested/in love with the MC (I got a little bit of a harem vibe from that).

It's not as bad as a lot of people say it is but it also is not the greatest anime (14th place is too high for me).
>> ARTICLE
IMO there's some problems with the narrative.  I wouldn't say it was bad, but it was probably just okay.  There's plenty of better dramas out there that could be watched instead.  To clarify, there are quite a few things I liked about the show.  I'm only going to list problems below though because I'm unsure how to articulate the positives beyond "this show gave me the feels" or something, and those same positives have probably been said by a million people already. Anyways, some of the problems I had were:

* First off, Kousei's trauma can be pretty gimmicky at times.  They could have just had him be nervous about playing and have stage fright/nervous breakdowns or something.  It would have performed the same function in the story, but instead they went with this arbitrary and (imo) pretty silly "I can't hear the notes" business which is a lot harder to catch my interest with.  

* I have serious issues with the way they handle exposition in this anime, which is in the form of extended monologues during performances.  It's supposed to be (in my mind at least) in anime about music, and yet they're constantly interrupting the major performances of the show in order for Kousei to have some philosophical crisis or whatever.  This sometimes works depending on what the subject of the episode's drama is, but there are other times when it felt unnecessary or repetitive and I just got aggravated.  I fully admit this may be due to personal bias though--due past experiences as a performing musician in high school/college, I have a pretty strong desire to listen to other performances uninterrupted. 

* [Ending SPOILERS](/s "I also don't like the way the ending of the show was executed.  If you're going to have a character through some unavoidable circumstance (ie. illness in this case), the only way to make it meaningful for me is to show it's impact on the other characters.  In instances like this I don't really feel much emotion about the death itself, and with YLiA we didn't see anything about how this death affected Kousei other then a two minute or so epilogue (which was a good scene that technically accomplishes what I want, but it wasn't enough imo).  I think that rather than ending the show with Kaori's death, they should have added a part after about Kousei falling into grief and then eventually overcoming that and moving on.  For comparison, there are two other very popular anime I can think of featuring deaths of a non-main-character that accomplish this really well.  Not listing them here because spoilers, but I'm sure people can guess the shows I'm talking about if they've seen them.")
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed it. My one big grip was that I kinda wished the characters were a little older because to me it kinda takes away some of the drama.
>> ARTICLE
> My one big grip was that I kinda wished the characters were a little older because to me it kinda takes away some of the drama.

Gets a decent amount of hate here but was a really emotional show. I'd say most people enjoy but I've seen the negative side be a whole lot more vocal.
>> ARTICLE
As I mentioned in a previous thread that you've probably read:


>I feel like the minority of people who disliked _Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso_ make it very clear just how much they hated it on this sub; in a sense it seems to get a lot of hate because the people who hate it really really really strongly make their opinions known.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I pretty much took my answer from last time :p

Still really agree!
>> ARTICLE
Now that I think about it Your lie in April has kinda fallen of the map in terms of discussion here for a while outside of the feels threads. 
>> ARTICLE
Frankly speaking, _Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso_ is quite atypical of the average anime. A lot of the anime are stills and movement is generated from camera movement. Movement is generally simple; effects are focused more on precision of replication (such as the Steinway & Sons grand) and less focused on the day to day actions of the characters. At some points I do feel that I was passively listening to a visual novel (and reading one with subtitles).

I loved _Shigatsu_ though; it is admittedly fairly atypical of the average anime.
>> ARTICLE
It's not really a show that comes up much. It's romance is weak, there's no action and is a bit heavy at times so not much chance to pop up as much!
>> ARTICLE
I feel, that apart from not being able to fully appreciate it unless you were in a familial situation similar to the MC's, you also cannot fully appreciate the atmosphere if you're not a musician.
>> ARTICLE
It's my 5th favourite anime and has a 10 rating from my part.

Really beautiful story, the music was full of emotion, I was shivering all the time, the MC's are awesome, it's a beautiful love story.

Also, call me crazy, but I love drama.
>> ARTICLE
Most of the problems people cite with this show don't bother me at all. The narrative was excellent, the ending was well-written, and the mid-performance monologues didn't gain a single rise out of me. Instead, my problem came from the forced humor at inappropriate times. It would completely ruin the mood that they had spent entire episodes developing just to throw in a cheap gag and a reaction face. Without this problem slapping you in the face at unexpected moments, the anime as a whole would have been much better. 
>> ARTICLE
General consensus IMO is that it's a good show with glaring issues. 

There were severe problems with 

[general characteristics](/s "middle school kids apparently having more mature thoughts than adults")

[plot spoilers](/s "Kaori's death being seen a mile away before the end of the 2nd episode")

[Application spoilers](/s "calling it a "musical anime" which is IMO complete bullshit as it's a drama romance with a music background. Music was merely a medium of communication")

[Character issues](/s "Side characters being introduced and used for no reason (seriously the rivals had no purpose in this show at all other than to be in awe of Kousei IIRC). We spent too much time screwing around in the beginning and they spent the important middle parts to develop the characters rather than develop the plot which happened in the latter quarter of the show which by then made many people rather apathetic towards the cast.")

[Interruptions](/s "Random comedic moments that just ruined the tone (varies per person, didn't bother me but it did for others")


Overall I gave the show a 7/10 as it was nice, but not really engaging for me and it felt like it was trying to make me feel for the characters even though I barely knew anything about them and could not care less about what happens. It was memorable though and the OST is very nice.

Nailed most of my gripes with it.
>> ARTICLE
When I was in middle school, I was more mature than most 25 year olds. I had gone through a situation similar to the main character that made me that way.

[](/s "Kaori's death") wasn't supposed to be unexpected. Kind of like with Plastic Memories, or Clannad. You knew it was going to happen, it was just a matter of when. The impact didn't come from the sudden occurrence, the impact came from the buildup to the event. 

The medium sometimes makes all the difference in the world. Think about this. We're on the anime subreddit. Anime is a medium. It's most of our preffered medium.

> When I was in middle school, I was more mature than most 25 year olds. I had gone through a situation similar to the main character that made me that way.

Pretty much.

There seems to be some unwritten bastion of storytelling where adults must be perfect and can solve all problems that children face; [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Spoilers](/s "Seto's deliberate absence from Arima's life instead of helping him face his fears and dark past is perhaps a good example of adults not knowing what to do")

Frankly, most of /r/anime hates it, if [past threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3xi5vr/your_lie_in_april_thoughts/) are any indication.

I loved _Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso_. It's the anime I recommend to friends who do not typically watch anime and want something to get into anime with, because it is so strikingly pretty and a lot more typical of a drama than your shounen, fanservice-laden anime. A lot of people did not like its melodrama; frankly _Shigatsu_ was more of a audio-visio experience than the typical anime given the high usage of stills with camera pans.
>> ARTICLE
Hated it. I found it painfully melodramatic and overwrought. As always, YMMV.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty good
>> ARTICLE
Good show with several glaring issues that take away a lot from it. I get the Angel Beats kinda vibe in that it's just desperately trying to make you cry, but in its defense it does so with significantly better developed characters. 

MAL is probably getting those rating simply cause of the nature of the show. I mean for cryin out loud Angel Beats was sitting at an 8.5 with a barely passable narrative, something like Shigatsu with a much stronger ending and a similarly emotional style is bound to score super high on MAL.

This show is hitting home with me. This scene was incredibly moving. I put down my Clarinet two years ago and I've been missing the musical part of my life ever since. This scene makes me want to pick it back up, I think I will.

EDIT: Oh fun fact on why I stopped playing, my clarinet was stolen from my school after a performance, it was a really nice one to. I didn't have the money to buy another one so I stopped playing. I am finally making good money and I'm still a dependent (No house payments or anything like that) so I'm definitely going to try to buy a similar one. Honestly just thinking about it makes me tear up a bit, I've been missing playing music for people, it's truly a magical thing, can't wait to be back at it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm finding the comments from people with a background in music (especially violin and piano) to be the most interesting part of the discussions -- namely how accurately or inaccurately the animation matches the music, the background in the music itself, etc.

I liked how the [ep 2 minor spoilers](/s "Judge praised her talent but still docked her off from placing").  I wonder how other participants would've reacted to her performance with her taking the spotlight like that. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never played piano or any strings so I can't really comment, when I performed in a group it was in a band made up of woodwinds, brass and percussion. The competition thing was incredibly accurate though, when I played solo that's how it was, I never really liked it. Music to me is about creativity. For me, if someone were to break how the song is supposed to be played and they owned it that hard, I would feel inferior but I would praise the hell out of them. If someone did that at a competition I was at, they would earn my respect immediately.

I do really enjoy the comments that one guy makes on the weekly thread about a music piece featured. Kreutzer Sonata is a beautiful song and I'm glad he went in depth with it. Just watching this show brings me back to performing and I will definitely be buying a clarinet to try performing again as long as I can still pay college tuition next year. I've already started to hunt down my first teacher/conductor, she is someone who instilled the value and wonder of music in me. Last I heard she teaches at a university in my town but I don't know if she has gone back to Japan or not.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've only played set pieces in a band myself a long time ago, trumpet/baritone specifically, so I have zero experience in solo competitions.  I likely won't be getting back into it though.
>> ARTICLE
Solo was nerve racking for me. I was never amazing, I considered myself good, but not good enough to place first so I felt judged when the better players watched me. The worst was trying to follow their performances. I enjoyed performing in competitions with my band though. The band competitions were the best, we placed first in my region the last year I had my my original conductor Ms. Yasuko. The new guy I finished the last 2 years of band with was terrible, had no idea what he was doing.

I don't know how you brass people do it, it just looks uncomfortable as hell to hold brass instruments and to do the mouth positioning. 
>> ARTICLE
If you've never done it, I suggest finding a small group (really small, like 3-5 people) to play with.  

I was forced to play an instrument from age 9-18 and absolutely hated it.  Practicing every day was drudgery.  Solo performances were nerve racking torture.  School orchestra was better but still not good.  "Don't screw up.  Don't embarrass yourself.  Live up to expectations."

After I got to college, I was determined to never pick up my $%^&* violin again, but my parents made me bring it with me, because it would just be a waste to leave it at home.

I ended up being friends with a couple of other kids with a similar back story.  For shits and giggles, we started messing around in our free time, playing really simple stuff.  Popular music especially (The Beatles or Aerosmith or the theme song to some movie or whatever- played on two violins and a cello).  First time I ever really got into the spirit of music.  Playing with the sound.  Building something interesting with friends.  Experimenting.  Sometimes trying to make it sound "right" with the proper dynamics, the proper balance of parts, etc.  But usually just screwing around and seeing what we could twist this famous piece of music into.  Really playing- in the true childlike wonder sense of the word.  
>> ARTICLE
> I was forced to play an instrument from age 9-18

I don't want to be ruse but I fucking hate parents/guardians that do this. You can't force an instrument on someone, that makes them hate it and never want to do it again. It was an option for me and I loved it. I had a friend who was forced to play sax and despised it.

Your last paragraph brought a smile to my face. I definitely think it's something I'd like to do in college when I go next year. I'm going to try and save up for a nice one like I used to have. I do want to perform for my first conductor again though, I just need to find her, pretty sure my old section leader still talks to her.
>> ARTICLE
I only played a couple years and was second chair for most of it anyhow -- the holding and mouth positioning are consistent, but the pressure variation still took getting used to (especially for playing notes quickly which I never did all that well).

In some ways I do miss playing within a band simply because there wasn't as much pressure.  It also reminds me of practice where every time I accidentally made a mistake, I would look at the conductor, she'd look at me, and then I'd smile while trying to play (of course during practices only).

I think I'm more flabbergasted at percussion players -- being able to do multiple things at different beats is mind boggling to me (though of course I'm sure it comes with practice).
>> ARTICLE
I was in the high school band starting from 7th grade (K-12 school) so I was last chair, I think it was 6th for 2 years and then I took over first and was concertmaster during my two years in high school that I played. 

I thought your mouth positioning is what changed not the pressure, that's really interesting.

I gave the percussion members in our band a lot of credit. They would be all over the place, each song they changed who played what. From snare to bass drum all the way to cymbals and xylophones, they knew it all. They all thought our job was harder though, the only part I think is harder is having the chops to play in our performances since they were on the long side.

Our brass line was really small, I think we had 2 trumpets, a trombone and a baritone. This compared to 8 clarinets, 5 saxophones, 7 flutes and a few other smaller instruments. They definitely produced a great sound though. 

This is really nostalgic for me right now haha
>> ARTICLE
> I thought your mouth positioning is what changed not the pressure, that's really interesting.

I should reword that since I based my comment off my own lack of experience -- much of it is also lip positioning and ideally you want to minimize pressure (though it depends on the player).  It's just that I had a hard time in middle school trying to play those extremely high notes and had to compensate as a result.

I think my band was more or less evenly distributed among the instruments.  If I had to do it all over again though, I probably would've wanted to learn the guitar, piano, or violin, but those were generally not offered in most school settings (at least where I was).
>> ARTICLE
Ah same here, I had trouble for a while hitting the higher ones and somehow manipulated the reed by trying to make it squeak in order to play high notes correctly, don't ask me what I mean, because I have no idea I just know it worked. 

If I had to do it over again I'd do Violin, I really love it's sound but I also love Clarinet. Meh, I might've just done both haha.
>> ARTICLE
I probably just wanted to play some Zelda songs with the violin >_>
>> ARTICLE
It's not as uncomfortable as you might think, I played Baritone for like 8 or so years and eventually the instrument just kind of falls into place in your hands. Honestly I always thought woodwind was harder to hold, Sax just looks like a nightmare and I don't have the co-ordination to manage that many finger things at the same time. 

Also shout out to the guy who comment on this before me, lower brass gotta represent, and sorry for butting in on the conversation.
>> ARTICLE
Clarinet wasn't to bad actually, looks like hell, but it's very comfortable. Flutes look stupidly hard to hold in my opinion, the hand position, distance from your face and the positioning of your arms just make it look terrible to hold. I held a sax and it was definitely a bit harder to hold when compared to a clarinet but it wasn't to bad.

> I don't have the co-ordination to manage that many finger things at the same time.

You'd be surprised how easily it is to just memorize your hand positions. After a year or so everything was muscle memory, I saw a middle C, my hands felt like they just automatically went in to position.

> and sorry for butting in on the conversation.

Are you kidding me? No one has an issue with you saying anything lol. If anything I welcome more people who play/used to play to comment. We can all relate to this anime and it's fun to hear opinions from different instruments!
>> ARTICLE
I think it's kind of hilarious how we each have been praising the ability to play other instruments yet we downplay the difficulty of our own.  Kind of reminds me of Japanese etiquette and the constant back and forth of "no no, I'm terrible, *you're* amazing".  Just shows how experience changes perspective so easily.
>> ARTICLE
["And this instrument is harder and so is this one and so is that one"](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me7selYAoH1r4qjd6.gif)

Definitely agree though. We can't totally wrap our heads and [hands](http://i.imgur.com/kedMBQI.jpg) around other instruments so they seem difficult whereas our own are just muscle memory/familiar so it's just kind of whatever to play it.
>> ARTICLE
If anyone wants more of something similar to this and can't wait for the next episode, I highly recommend checking out [Nodame Cantabile](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=7010). I can see all sorts of influences that anime has had on this one.

My favorite part of this scene (aside from the amazing music and animation) is how the pianist in the back is like "ah, fuck, where is she going? ahh..ahhh...is it...ahhhh....where the hell...ahhhhhh......"

No mentioning of Kids on the Slope? Much more enjoyable and better animation than Nodame.

This show was great, it singlehandedly motivated me to pick the piano up again. Yoko kanno is a great composer.

Completely subjective. In my opinion Kids on the Slope had great music, but other than that it was pretty mediocre while Nodame didn't try to be more than it is and played its strengths very well.

Can anyone really point out where she went so far off with the piece? I'm familiar with string music but I find the interpretation that Kaori takes isn't too far off what it should be.
>> ARTICLE
The judge is smoking crack or something, Kaori was no more off tempo than any other professional. She actually follows the score pretty much as written, barring the typical stylistic flourishes most professionals do when they play this song. That said, this rendition of Kreutzer was actually very good.
>> ARTICLE
I agree! I thought I was going crazy because I didn't hear her doing something super wrong or going off tempo a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Strictly speaking, the anime cheats a little in order to make a subtle difference more noticeable. She actually isn't adlibbing a stylistic flourish, she's just playing a different part of the (very, very long) piece - the other performers played a fairly slow, melancholy section, but her performance was taken from the more upbeat, joyful final part.

I think that, to general audiences, the subtle changes in style that might qualify as "heretical" to the judges wouldn't be obvious except to the musically inclined, so they fudged the facts a bit so it'd be more accessible, and I'm perfectly fine with that.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually in favor of it. I understand that those who understand what is going on might be upset that they're cheating, but I think the overall greater impact it generates is worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I personally want an OVA wherein they use the entire recording that they had and animate Kaori to the entire thing.
>> ARTICLE
It's a bit disappointing to me as a fan of the manga, but considering the alternatives I think it's a pretty good way to get the point across with minimal effort. 
>> ARTICLE
> the subtle changes in style that might qualify as "heretical" to the judges wouldn't be obvious except to the musically inclined

Hilariously, the recording they used actually follows the score almost entirely, barring some minor (and typical) flourishes. It's still pretty clearly Beethoven. Though to be fair to the guy, his music is naturally very animated, not a whole lot has to be added to make it interesting. 


>> ARTICLE
Well its hard to make up your own beethoven right?

I'm not really familiar with the music genre of anime.  I know K-on! is one but from what I've heard it's more cute girls doing cute things than actual music.  What are some of the genre's defining shows and do you think this could become one of them?
>> ARTICLE
White Album 2 is very good in its romance and music imo. I wouldn't really call it a "musical" anime though. I recommend this if you like realistic romance and great OST.

Edit : Yes, it's my favorite anime of the season along with F/SN and Grisaia.
>> ARTICLE
Nodame Cantabile, Beck / Mongolian Chop Squad, and Kids on the Slope are all really great music shows. 

And as for it becoming a genre defining show I think it could. This show feels like a prettier, better animated, Nodame Cantabile.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget Nodame came out in 2007 though. I marathoned Nodame Cantabile when i found it so frustrating waiting weekly i just want to keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
K-On is as musical as I am Martian. 

It is an slice of life about people that, drink tea, eat stuff, do 'moe' things get flustered for some of said 'moe' things and may or may not play music, sometimes.

I might get stoned for what I'm about to write but, to my knowlege, there are no such thing as 'musical anime' genre. Lots of different shows have a profuse use of music or have stories about musicians, (and, certanly, 'Shigatsu wa kimi no uso' it's one of them) but that hardly make them 'musical anime'. 

I mean, this show it's about romance first and uses music as a base; just as other romantic/comedy shows use history as theirs and can not be called 'historical' (Trapp Ikka Monogatari is set on the second world war, for example).

That said, there are good shows that use music (the ones that comes to my mind now are 'Sakamichi no Aporon' or 'Angel Beats') as an important factor in their plot.

Now, downvote me all you want.
>> ARTICLE
MAL lists it as a genre, but then they also list "vampire" as one.  I see your point, but calling something a genre is a useful way of categorizing a show *and* there's no reason a show can't fall in several genre.  Music seems like as much a genre as ecchi or harem though those are much more common.

Also I don't see why someone would downvote you for that comment.

Uh... I mean, the show's good, but the plot seems relatively clich so far. I'm enjoying it anyway.
>> ARTICLE
never said anything about plot.
>> ARTICLE
...Define "cliche characters", then, without referring to the plot.

The characters so far are pretty straightforward archetypes - the depressed MC, the carefree girl he falls for that inspires him, the playboy, the childhood friend who's fallen for the MC - but then literally almost every single character in fiction falls into some kind of archetype. It'd be hard to differentiate them beyond that in 2 episodes, but it's not exactly the pinnacle of originality. (And using character archetypes isn't a bad thing, if, for instance, you want to reference classic themes and stories through that similarity.)
>> ARTICLE
...Does the animation not match up with whats being played at times?
>> ARTICLE
As a person with zero experience in playing an instrument of any sort, I thought the animation for that was done really well. This is probably because I don't know what to look for to critique it but at the same time it looked passionate and accurate enough to properly fit the music, IMO. 
>> ARTICLE
As a former violinist, it matches up much better than most violin scenes I have seen. Her movements do lag a little at times, but overall I'm pretty impressed! They even animated her vibrato and finger movements quite well :)

This show is probably my favorite of the season. It's so good that while I was watching it **with my headphones on**, my sister glanced over at the screen and just kept staring. 

"It's not really the same experience without the music part" I told her.

"I'm getting the chills just watching it" was her reply. 

I unplugged the headphones. Then my mom came over and started watching it too. (My mom, who usually laughs at my absurd love for all things animated.) *That's how good it was*. 

If it keeps up it's current quality and perhaps even accomplishes the mix of Music and Emotion that Boys on the Slope did so well (for all it's flaws, that show *knows music*, it gets how to convey emotion through it, for amazing effect), it won't just be my favorites of the season, it may become one of my favorites period. 

[edit]: I had lost a lot of my inspiration to play my Viola, just practicing as much as I needed to (once or twice a week). Kids on the Slope introduced me to the vast world of Jazz and brought back my love for classical-style music. Chihayafuru brought me the inspiration to do my best and try harder. This show looks like it will be a similarly inspirational anime.

There are an awful lot of blonde Japanese people in the world of anime.
>> ARTICLE
It's a cliche they like. There are various explanations but they do have a sort of obsession with hair color that is not black. It's easy to understand why when everyone's natural hair color is only one color.

They usually have various explanations for it, the most common one being "returnee half Japanese" or a half-Japanese person who was previously overseas. It keeps them just exotic enough without going full foreigner. Though, lately some shows (like Kin-iro Mosaic) have just gone full blown foreigner (typically one who is obsessed with Japan). This is heartening since it shows some momentum for more widespread social acceptance of foreigners in popular culture. One last explanation that tends to be common is that it's just hair dye/bleached hair. Dye-ing your hair is very common over in East Asia and is sort of a hip thing to at least have highlights in your hair if you're a teenager.

Sure!

*Fingers don't correspond to notes played

*No set tempo, nor set dynamic

*Holds the bow the wrong way

*Slurs slur too much^

*She hits the other strings when she is supposed to be playing one^

*She swings the violin around

*Piano is the real MVP

*You don't play music for one person, unless you wrote the song ORIGINALLY. "I hope it will reach him"-Bad musician/ Plagiarist 

    ^=Might be how its written, but it still sounds wrong. Soloists rewrite songs 
    so it sounds better when played solo, but I feel that she didn't.

Anyway, her technique was bad, interpretation was bad, and she sounds like a 4th grader trying to play Beethoven.


P.S. I hope I didn't sound like an elitist, but these were my honest opinions of the piece. My teacher could
have travelled the world as a soloist, but she chose to be a teacher at our school (She even got to play a Stradivarius for a few songs.) She can play many things much faster with correct bowings, but this just might be a difference in skill between the Japanese musician who recorded it and a professional that (could have) been as famous as [David Garrett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Garrett_\(musician\))

I urge you to try, it's a beautiful show.

The artstyle is definitely uneven, some parts look absolutely awful, then you have scenes like Dragon vs. Kong where the expressive artstyle is used to its fullest. If you get used to the artstyle you will be able to experience some of the best art direction of 2014.

One of the things that I enjoyed about it is that because it looks different from any other show, there's nothing to compare it too, so the I expect nothing from how the story will play out. It's like the show starts with a completely clean slate.

I found Noragami's balance between comedy and drama to be rather spot on the whole way through. That, and its rather complex set of characters made it quite interesting to see as they developed over time. The battles/fighting were never stellar, but the animation and art itself was dreary and rather nicely done. The music (as pointed out above) is also killer the whole way through.

They leave some unanswered questions and a few plot points open for later continuations, but I was satisfied with what went down and where it left off! :)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, a good soundtrack and solid comedy/drama sounds really good. Thanks!  
Now I have to watch this, and Chuu2koi, and finish Sakurasou and Toradora. Fun times.

I started watching this after combing through Netflix for something to watch. I got hooked as soon as I heard the OP. Please tell me there's gonna be another season!

Well, [when it first came out](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/22p1cm/2014_tv_anime_sales_rankings_update_nisekoi/), it did pretty well! So, I'd say keep your eyes peeled, for it at least has a shot. :)

Does this mean hating on No Game No Life won't be the cool thing to do any more? Can we finally accept that people liked the show?
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed the show wholeheartedly. I think it's just haters picking up major flaws and making it a big deal (the tracing fiasco).
>> ARTICLE
You must have been reading a different subreddit over the last year. There was nothing in here except a gigantic NGNL circlejerk for over a month. 
>> ARTICLE
No the point is that people are complaining about how many people like it. People weren't hating on it because it was bad, they were hating on it because there were lodes of others saying it was the best show ever.
>> ARTICLE
And as we all know, the most valid reason to complain is that other people aren't hating the things we hate
>> ARTICLE
Are people not allowed to criticize a show? I personally think that, while it wasn't bad, it has many problems and it definitely is nothing incredible. 
>> ARTICLE
While I won't disagree that people liked it, you still won't get me to acknowledge that it's anything amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I would hazard most people would agree with that,  but it still gets voted best of the year.  It's just a shame that shows like ping pong are forgotten. If more people watched it I'm sure it would have been higher.
>> ARTICLE
> but it still gets voted best of the year.

No it didn't. It got voted favorite show of the year. Even with the /r/anime favorite = best mindset, there's still a difference there.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't favorite show imply best for you? You're right that there's a difference, but I think that shouldn't change your vote. In general, I think people should just admit it if they enjoyed some generic moeblob anime over a psychological one if that's what they liked the most that year. That's why we see contradictory voting patterns with NGNL as favorite anime and ecchi genre as most disliked. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean, not everyone likes that kind of show either you know. It goes both ways. I happen to love NGNL, but i thought ping pong was kinda bad. Really not everyone's kind of show, especially having to go through the very odd art style. They're in the same boat in that regard. Different stuff for different people. 
>> ARTICLE
I heartily agree, I didn't say Ping Pong should necessarily be ranked higher than NGNL. What I'm lamenting is that more people didn't give it a chance despite acclaim. If as many people who watched NGNL watched Ping Pong, it would be higher, I firmly believe that. 
>> ARTICLE
Most people say that it's an enjoyable series but just not a good one or at least shouldn't get the rating it has on MAL. It gets somewhat the same complaints as SAO.
>> ARTICLE
It was pretty much accepted that a LOT of people like the show. It was just the vocal minority that hated on it.
>> ARTICLE
Just like SAO..

I swear, I never picked up SAO because of how terrible people said it was.. I mean it was hardcore bashing on the next level.  I watched SAO and it's one of my favorite shows of all-time.

My point is that anime fans have no idea what their talking about and I'd rather get punched in the taint than let another anime fan sway my opinion again.


>> ARTICLE
When you say it's your favourite show, that means you like it. A large majority of people actually enjoy SAO, but don't consider it a good anime. Unfortunately they also feel the need to show other people that they don't think it's a good anime. Hence the constant bashing despite most people liking the show.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, I liked the first arc, but after that the show went to shit for me. Didn't mind the start of GGO, but even that wore thin pretty quickly for me. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the hate is there because people were disappointed with how poorly executed such an interesting subject was.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think many of the people who give it heavy criticism (like me) hate it, it's just that it has many blatant problems and is definitely nothing incredible. It's just decent and fun, but nothing beyond that. Of course, when a show is more popular, it will receive more criticism (especially when criticism is merited), simply because it will have a higher number of people who've watched it.

Yes, there is still the portion of people who will always hate anything that gets too popular, but I think a lot of the criticism towards NGNL is fair. 
>> ARTICLE
So last time I was interested in a few questions:

* How many anime have you seen?
* On average, how many episodes do you watch a week?
* If you download anime, how much do you have stored?
* Do you consume any other forms of Japanese media?

And predicted these to be their answers:

1. 76-100 or 101-150
2. 21-30
3. 500+ GB 
4. Music &gt; Manga &gt; Visual Novels &gt; Light Novels &gt; Live Action Films &gt; Live Actions Television

And these were the answers:

1. 101-150
2. 11-20
3. 1-5 GB
4. Manga > Music > VN > LN > Live Action Films > Live Action Television

So my guesses weren't that bad except that 3rd question.
>> ARTICLE
>LN and VN lower than Manga

Weakkkk. I can't believe people have watched so little anime though.
>> ARTICLE
>Weakkkk.

I prefer Manga myself over LN and VNs (Never read a LN and barely started on my 2nd VN). What I notice a lot though is that there quite a number of users on /r/anime that don't even read manga.

>I can't believe people have watched so little anime though.

The subreddit is filled a lot with newcomers. /r/TrueAnime should have more people that have watched 200 anime or more.
>> ARTICLE
I personally prefer LNs as a form because of the writing style and how it functions more like a novel than a comic book. VNs usually have a better quality of writing and characters are more fleshed out. As a reader this appeals greatly to me. But yeah, I see exactly what you said in adaptations of anime where there are a lot of people who haven't read the source material. Not that that's a bad thing, just something I noticed.

I was just a bit surprised, considering the amount of people on the sub as well as the sheer amount. It just seems kinda strange that people wouldn't have watched more than 100. I just kinda find it hard to believe that so many people on /r/anime are newcomers.
>> ARTICLE
Quite honestly I can't fucking stand the style of most LN. I find them very dull and very similar to each other. The translations themselves aren't often all that great and don't really "flow" right in English.
>> ARTICLE
To TLers credit Japanese is a very hard language to translate without missing a lot of nuance that is present.

>Very dull and very similar

What do you mean by that?
>> ARTICLE
What I meant was that the majority of translated LNs just aren't interesting. Half of them are all just a shitty version of a harem or a "MC is speshul" story, and I can't be assed to read something that is just another version of a weak MC who gets super strong powers and gets girls.
>> ARTICLE
I actually find that a lot of LNs have more opportunity for world building and characterization than the majority of manga(VNs are an exception because they follow a similar structure). While you are right, there are a lot of self-insert LNs, a lot of them have good worldbuilding aspects to them(Index and Mahouka being standouts in this category).
>> ARTICLE
I am not sure why you would think that most people would have 500+ GB of stored anime. I usually either stream it or torrent it and delete it after I am done with it (yes I seed of course).
>> ARTICLE
I just thought that the people who would bother downloading would also have a decent storage where they'll keep their stuff.
>> ARTICLE
That fits me perfectly, was so disheartened when I had to start deleting some older things ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Happened to me too but I got a 1TB HDD a few months ago and it has been more than enough to store all my anime.

>> ARTICLE
Nigga I have a 1TB HDD too, but I still don't feel the need to store anime I've seen. I'm not big on rewatching, so I only ever store what anime I have downloaded and am waiting to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, I also don't rewatch shows and mostly use it only to store anime I'm going to watch but I also fill it with series that I feel are worth storing like Parasyte or F/SN especially since a friend of mine could end up visiting me just to ask for that one series I've on my HDD.

Yeah, UBW is high quality, not particularly unique. The production values are insane, and it's pretty, but in terms of style I think there's a lot that beats out UBW. Hell, even Barakamon has a more unique aesthetic.
>> ARTICLE
While that is true, the question asked for peoples *favorite* artstyle not the most unique. It is probably voted high because of its amazing animation but you cant discount the fact that there are probably a *lot* of people who like the 'normal' kind of anime artstyle over the more unique ones. Especially considering one of the most common reasons people cite when they say they dropped ping pong(or clannad cuz those fucking eyes)is because of the artstyle. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not like there's even a consensus to what "art syle" means.

OST is pretty clear cut. Everyone knows what that means. Animation? Well how frames are put together, the different effects, "camera" shots, character designs, etc...

Animation is an art and there are different styles of animation. Don't blame people for confusing animation for art style while it can be treated as that. Certainly if there isn't a good understanding of what is an art style.

Hi, I have a question. I watched the original Fate/Stay Night series, I just learned there was a movie called UBW in 2010 with an alternate ending based on the second ending according to the novel. And I also just learned they made a new series in the 2014 called the same as the movie, why?
>> ARTICLE
Simply put, the movie and original Fate/Stay Night anime were considered to be lacking the overall scope the Visual Novel had and were overall disappointing adaptations. So they essentially got a new company to redo one of the three routes as a anime show(Because the original Fate/Stay Night tried meshing all 3 routes in one) and they went with UBW(They also have a movie for one of the routes as well called Heavens Feel). There is also Fate/Zero that the new company made as well which a prequel to Fate/Stay Night.

>UBW 3rd for best OST.

I'm sorry what? It had a fairly generic OP and a nice Kalafina ED but I cannot remember a single insert track that played during the show. Completely forgettable.
>> ARTICLE
This is easily because the soundtrack is there to give you a cinematic experience. If you watch hollywood blockbusters you can notice the same thing, the soundtracks are there to ENHANCE the viewing and not OVERTAKE what's happening on the screen which is why you won't notice it as much as a regular anime soundtrack. In my opinion, this soundtrack does its job superbly and  feels like a mix of both categories I mentioned above. It's also much more diverse than the one trick pony OST that was used in Fate/Zero and I'm glad they didn't hire Kaijura for the soundtrack again. 
>> ARTICLE
While I agree that the OST wasn't as good as the DEEN one (only good part about that show, thanks to Kenji Kawai), I thought a few tracks, especially Rin and Berserker's themes, as well as the little initial bit we got of Archer's, were all pretty good. I agree that the OP sounds fairly generic, but at least the title and lyrics are very fitting. And of course, most importantly, [UBW episode 12](/s ""This Illusion" remix with LiSA as Rin jumps off the rooftop pretty much made the episode for a lot of people, myself included.")

I don't like these categories. They don't fit with the others.

While the other categories are meant to quantify opinions and collect stats. These numbers don't tell us much since it's skewed towards the most popular shows. Most people watch 5 shows per season, if we assume those 5 are the Top 5 most popular shows then most responses will only be of those 5.

I had to drop it after 1 episode, I can't stand the harem/ecchi/fanservice/loli.

But most importantly, ctrl + f "JoJo" 0 results. =(

You're in the wrong place, as much as people hate to deny it, the anime fanbase is composed majorly of people that are not annoyed by and/or enjoy ludicrous fanservice(lolis, boobs everywhere, panty shots, etc) in their shows.

Ping Pong + Nozaki have been my favourites I'd say but I haven't watched as much compared to others here.

Log Horizon 2 Is so disappointing 

Im really really surprised its not on the top 3 Disappointment .

Dare I say sao 2 has been more enjoyable despite being average .

Why?  I mean it has that awesome raid and everything...   More action and game mechanics than the first I dare say.  Also DEEN is doing fine.  It's not like Log Horizon had top-tier animation to begin with!

Overall for me its nowhere near season 1 .

Its Deen Quality  for a start so there's that . The episodes where average/boring til the very later stages . I dont even mind little action like season 1 since I love MMos.

Maybe because in season 2 they focus to much on akatsuki and shes not as interesting as  I hope as a Second MC . 

hey more power to you and to the people who liked it but it did not just worked our for me like physco pass 2

I will never understand the popularity surrounding Amagi Brilliant Park. It's a generic comedy with absolutely nothing to distinguish it

Wanna explain how its generic? I would love to hear your insight on this.

The characters are based entirely on quirks just like every other comedy, the comedic timing is unremarkable, and the jokes are generic.
>> ARTICLE
Jokes are subjective, so I guess you are entitled to your own opinion. I don't get your point on the characters though. The whole point of mascots is that they are centered around a quirk. The Elementario are pretty original, as are the other mascots imo.
>> ARTICLE
I wish these guys would get off your back because your points are valid. Comedy was hit and miss, a bit more the latter. The main story continually gets lost along the way for the sake of side stories. When it picks up again it's suddenly pushed along at breakneck pace. 

I gave it 6/10 almost on its uniqueness in art choice and tone, which is quirky and fun.

Yes because the insanely popular and cult classics Clannad, Clannad Afterstory, Air, K-On, Chuu2, and Nichijou aren't good. In terms of pure quality of animation, KyoAni ranks above most other studios, even big ones like A1 Pictures and P.A. Works.
>> ARTICLE
The Clannad series is vastly overrated, shameless emotion porn, Kanon and Air being even worse iterations of that very same idea. K-ON is a plotless moe blob comedy. I've yet to watch the others.

> Too bad it's one of the most unimpressive and unoriginal animation studios in existence.

Too bad the quality of their art and animation speaks otherwise. And all the animes I have listed are loved by the vast majority of the anime community. Your not so subtle insinuations that you have better taste than everyone else and that we are all "sheep" is fucking retarded. Also, just because shows are overrated doesn't mean they are bad, and just because something is a moe comedy doesn't make it bad either. Your reasoning behind why said shows were bad(in your opinion I might add) is stupid.

You're not wrong at all. For this kind of scenario,  I think they should have tried to sell the idea of a magic theme park more,  give it a mysterious, fantasy air to the place then show how it became irrelevant to the general population over time. When the whole thing is comedy based,  it's hard to make the audience care about the characters or locations.

You are the reason comedies can never win awards over dramas

So you telling me, there's shows about amusement parks and people have to save the princess from "dying", and monsters that work for some dude in high school, all put up together in one big show?

I liked NGNL, but  best show?, meh, I thought it was a good show  but not the BEST!!!of 2014, meh, it's just my opinion, but if i were to compare NGNL with mondaiji (I know it's from another year), I will go with mondaiji, I enjoyed it more. 

Tl;dr: NGNL was great,  but meh, I don't think it was FREAKING OMG!!! BEST SHOW 2014. But  it's favorites of 2014, so nothing that i said matters.

The category is *favourite* and not *best* - but again I'm not sure if that's how people interpret it anyway
>> ARTICLE
Thats why i said that category "is favorited, so nothing i said matters", yeah  i got the point,  even tho my comment is badly written and oriented, yet NGNL is so high up in  MAL which i think was  the reason why i wrote the comment that way, sorrey pal.

Well i mean mal scores are just as subjective as this poll so im not sure why you would expect anything else

Watch ping pong, don't expect too much,  but I've had very positive responses even from friends who don't usually watch anime. I don't want to overhype it,  but from its standing on the list,  it's clear that people are not listening to the recommendations to watch it. It deserves higher.
