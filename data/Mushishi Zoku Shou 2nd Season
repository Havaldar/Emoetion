ITTTTS BACK!!!!

I really enjoyed finally getting some more backstory on Ginko this episode. Seeing him not as the rational mushishi we know and love but rather as the young, uncertain, and anxious boy really gave him some long needed character development. 

Cant wait for next weeks episode "The Fragrant Darkness"

>> ARTICLE
It's nice to witness another turning point of Ginko's past, since we haven't seen any of it since episode 12 of the 1st season. You can really see that even though this event had a rather melancholy conclusion, young Ginko took a lot from it. He definitely doesn't have that same wonder and fascination in the mushi that we are so accustomed to, but you can see that his position begins to change by the ending from the initial resent he felt for them.

Despite doing something terrible to the natural order, the mushi still beckon him back, essentially validating his existence and telling him that he *does* have a place in the world. This is something that young Ginko has probably never experience from people before (we hear in the beginning how wherever he goes, he is always followed by rumors of a strange boy that brings disaster with him). Although he's hesitant, you can see how the mushi have given him a sense of belonging and purpose, and rather than seeing them as a burden, he is beginning to become curious.

The final scene where he lightly touches the mushi residing in his eye and falls asleep was a perfect way to sum up all that took place.

and i felt that ginko had a distrust in people at the start because he said that the previous mushishi he had been with took advantage of him to make money then tossed him away when things got hairy.. it was suguro who had no other intention for him other than wishing him well.. the things suguro said to ginko was pretty touching imo.. shed a manly  old tear.. probably cuz i missed the show too much though.. only anime i watch


>> ARTICLE
It was a great way to return to the show. I felt like the themes were very representative of the entire series: there are mistakes that can never be undone, but no existence is a mistake in and of itself. 
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is back, and all is right with the world.

Was it just me or was young Ginko voiced by Sawashiro Miyuki?

Edit: [Yup] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/457/Mushishi) she's played young ginko before, never realized.

When Ginko was running through the forest I knew the voice was familiar. When it hit me all I could hear was a flustered Inaba from Kokoro Connect.

This one was a little dark to be feeling bliss. Might want to talk to someone about that.

The budget for this show must be a mushi. There's no way something so beautiful and improbable could exist otherwise.

I guess everyone has that one episode of Mushishi that they just can't get out of there heads. By the end of this one I was crying and I didn't realize or know how long I had been. I guess it just struck me in a very personal way.

I feel the same. The incredibly graceful way they told the story, building off what little back story we have about Ginko and expanding it... and that ending hit me the same exact way. I bawled my eyes out.

Fantastic episode.

i fucking missed the opening its so good

and we get to see ginko's past damn this episode was a strong one for the second half of the season 2 

was hyped since the end of the first half
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see Ginko's past :)
>> ARTICLE
That was a really quiet and beautiful episode. It hasn't been that long, but i've missed this show so much. 

It relaxes me like nothing else.

Also, [Ginko looks so cool in this frame](http://i.imgur.com/fU5J4C7.png).

YES ! God it feels like years since I last watched Zoku Shou. One of the few episodic anime that I enjoy on a non-comedic level with a calming OST and overall tone. This is likely already gonna be my AOTS with FSN close behind.

I love how a couple of the earlier episodes somehow connects to this one. The darkness reminded me a bit of the Path of Thorns special and the Cloudless Rain episode also relates.

>> ARTICLE
It's back! Seems like it's been awhile since the first part of this season aired. Really glad there was character development for Ginko, there has been so little in this series. 

I guess the theme to take away from this episode is that everyone has a purpose in this world. They just need to find it. 
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the fact that we finally got some more background on Ginko. I think it's a nice followup to the special. Ginko ended up accepting mushi for what they are from his his experiences, and Kumado had the opposite, both flipping their opinions (resentment to attachment for Ginko, indifference to resentment for Kumado) of mushi from the effects of one event. In both cases, the actions of other people had caused their resentment. 

Ginko really pulled on my heartstrings this episode. That part where he started crying and every time he said something self-depricating killed me a little bit inside. The ending was cathartic.

[Anyway, here's some screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/5gkpP) I'm extremely happy Mushishi is back. I'm curious about what the final episode will be. I can't really imagine an 'ending point', but the manga already had one.

I think you misinterpreted his question. He means can he watch this if he hasn't seen the special that comes after season 2 yet. Which he definitely can.

this one though requires a little bit a back story though.. like the permadark mushi, the reasons for his white hair and some info about mountain lord in the mushishi universe.. this one is not a straight on hop in episode..

suggest to watch mushishi season 1 "the sleeping mountain", "one eyed fish" and the zoku shou's "banquet of the forest" so you know what mountain lord and the light vein are.

Should be no problem at all.

I have only watched the first season of the 2006 Mushishi and it didn't follow a specific storyline except the ones that explained Ginko's story, can I watch this?

Yes, but you should watch the first half of zoku shou before you start the second half.

Generally you can watch Mushishi in whatever order you like, it's very episodic.

does this really count as S2 if this is just the unaired episode 11/12?

No, this is season 2 of Zoku Shou. The unaired episodes, 11 and 12, were released as a  47 minute long special, and can be found here: http://myanimelist.net/anime/24687/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou_Special

Episodes 11 and 12 from the first part of the S2 were aired in August. It was a special episode : http://myanimelist.net/anime/24687/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou_Special  
What we got now is the second part of the S2. I hope it's clear for you.
>> ARTICLE
thanks for your reply! yeah, that's what I thought at first but then the OP has

>Also knows as: Episode 11

so i got confused...
>> ARTICLE
This episode may have been one of the most well done episodes of Mushishi ever, even including the first season. The story flows so well, and follows its own pace, not revealing anything until absolutely necessary. This pacing engaged the viewer, not explaining what was going on until it was fairly clear to the us.

The presence of Ginko in this episode was fantastic, he was such an important figure but at the same time only spent one night with the family. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I didn't really like Ginko's appearance here. It would have added so much to the mystery and atmosphere if he hadn't explained exactly what's happening and how to avoid it. The writers lampshaded the fact that you really can't know that this mushi exists and I think it should have stayed that way. Where is the quiet magic of mushi if all of them are known? Kaoru's story would have been fine if he had made the decisions he did on his own, with his feelings of uneasiness or his love for his wife driving him to avoid or enter the tunnel.
>> ARTICLE
I think it could have been great either way, but Ginko's presence was important. If he wasn't there than Kaoru never would have discovered what was causing his feeling of forgetfulness, and we never would have had the story switch to his wife's point of view. 

For the viewer, the mystery of the flashbacks generates intrigue, but once the mystery unravels, the story would have nowhere to go. This could have been successful if the episode was paced differently, but they would have had to make the flashbacks much longer in the beginning, risking losing the interest of the viewer. Ginko's interference in the time loop creates a break in the repetition after the viewer has come to understand the mechanic of this particular mushi. This way when Kaoru finally sees things for the first time, the viewer feels the same way, and when the image of his fatally injured wife appears we feel the same hopelessness as Kaoru: The feeling that this wasn't the new world we wished for.

Really love how each episode of Mushi-shi is a self-contained parable. I enjoyed the colour palette for this episode!
>> ARTICLE
I was crying through the entire last five minutes, made my day.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed a great episode. I'm a sucker for time loops. I really like how he gave up on changing the past because it would prevent him from living a peaceful life with his family, but then he entered the loop again to save his wife. 

I also like that you don't know the full extent of things at the end. Does he still remember the looping, or was he swallowed by the mushi and only the wife is looping now? It does not give the answers, which in this case is a good thing.
>> ARTICLE
I think it may have been hinted that he did remember, because of the difference in his expression in the last loop when he's holding the branch for her. He's not in awe of her beauty like he seemed to be the other times. He's just kind of fixed on her, as if he's thinking "This girl is going to be my wife. This time we'll get to the end." When in reality she's going to have to go through the same thing he's had to go through. Maybe that's just me overthinking things.
>> ARTICLE
No kidding, that's one of the best episodes of an anime I have seen in quite a while.

*Oh my God.* Even for Mushishi, that was something else. That cold opening, that atmosphere of uneasiness. A powerful little story.

I just looked it up and that was what i was missing! Basically i just found out there's more to see. Im pretty happy right now.

I was chanting "no no no..." when he saw that tunnel and was so relieved when he decided not to go in. Then that ending... ;__;

What happens next?! T_T This week's episode has definitely been one of most engaging.

I started crying when he started walking away from the tunnel, then again when I realized what was going to happen with the wife. Mushishi is the only thing to ever effect me so strongly so consistently, I'll be so sad when it's gone.

Why isn't this being talked about more? :/. Aside from that best episode of Mushishi so far in my opinion even though I am still collecting what is left of my shattered heart off the floor, episode did what it set out to do 10/10
>> ARTICLE
Time loop episode? Fuck yes! This and the winter mountain god episode are my favorite episodes. 

This episode is what I love about Mushishi. The atmosphere, the pacing, the execution were all perfect. I felt Kaoru's emotions, from confusion (all the jumps successfully confused me despite already knowing the time loop was happening), to worry, to relief (he steps back from the the tunnel), happiness (he sees something he never had before, and hugs Iku), to desperation (when he sees the tunnel carrying Iku on his back, I was yelling at the screen) and then sadness as he walked through. I was close to tears as the credits rolled. I loved the loop from Iku's POV, too. I think it made the ending even more effective. Mushishi is the best.
>> ARTICLE
AOTY
>> ARTICLE
Anybody else think this episode was extremely Nietzschean? The man who walks through the tunnel thinks he has the opportunity to perfect his life, so he creates a "Real World" in his head opposite the "Apparent World" that he sees. In the Real World he never accuses that boy of breaking the vase and his wife never falls. Because he is obsessed with the imperfections of his life he becomes unable to appreciate his life, and in the end he dooms his wife to the same fate, and the viewer is lead to believe that he never really saves her.

These last two episodes of Mushi-Shi have been so powerful and emotional, here's hoping the trend continues!

That was simply incredible.

So simple but so powerful, fresh, and beautiful a story.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi certainly is doing way better than the past half of the season. The number one reason I love this anime is not the music or the peaceful settings but the fact that the storytelling always steers away from the cliche and pays respect to the viewer by not taking the direction they'd expect. Time loops/deja vu are certainly exhausted topics in media but due to a couple twists, this episode felt very original.
>> ARTICLE
What a beautiful episode.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely amazing. Probably my favorite episode of all the ones in second season so far. The atmosphere combined with the exquisite story telling and calming OST manages to engage me so well that I'm attached by 5 minutes. I usually like less the episodes that adult Ginko isn't really present but this episode was so compelling that it made me forgive that. The story is a bit cliche and the lack of the usual OP was a bit disappointing but the execution of the episode and how well it was done makes up for that. I couldn't wrap my head around something this episode and I think its that the character designs seemed a little more complicated than usual, or something along those lines. I didn't cry but did get numerous shivers down my spine. Can't write enough to convey how happy I am that this series is back this season.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a little confused at what happened in the end.  Did he join the Mushi and now his wife is the one trapped?  Or do they both just have Deja Vu?  

Also, if she is the only one trapped, I wonder how she would  enter the tunnel again, as she only entered it because he chose not to and then later chose to...so confused!

On a silly side note, that must be the most powerful Mushi able to turn back all of time over and over again! 
>> ARTICLE
Watching it again:

Kaoru got assimilated into the mushi, since he knew about it before going in, and no longer is looping. Only Iku is now.

Makes me wonder how Ginko knows these things that can't possibly be known by anyone not directly involved.
>> ARTICLE
>Makes me wonder how Ginko knows these things that can't possibly be known by anyone not directly involved.

Of course we can't know for sure. But Mushishi is a show that let you imagine every possibility :)

Here's mine : I guess the only way for Ginko and all mushishis to know about this mushi is because one mushishi, in the distant past, has been trapped by this type of mushi. He probably walked through the tunnel at some point, not realizing what he was doing, just out of curiosity. After experiencing enough loops, he could remember enough to realize his condition, and began to "study" the tunnel. In its "last looped life" (whatever that means), he probably sent records to Tan'yuu. However he probably did not send records about his whole (looped) life (it would have been a big book !). He kept it short, because he knew the mushi enough to know there's no easy solution. He might have written the strict and factual minimum, something like :  
"Hey fellows, I found a new mushi. Here are the characteristics : shape/appearance of the mushi ; fragrance at night ; symptoms of "dj-vu" and anxiousness we experience when we are affected. Here's what it means, what the mushi does : time loops ! From now on, you will be able to detect it. However I found no cure, and it's impossible for a mushishi to investigate it more, at least safely (unless another mushishi than me gets trapped). Just stay away from those dark tunnels and be aware when someone talks about dj-vu."

Ginko says "I never heard of a case where someone could change the past". However he can't know for sure, since he doesn't know in details the life of the first mushishi who found the mushi. For Ginko, the first mushishi could not change the past and had no choosing over its life, he was trapped, and that's precisly why its precious records could have been passed to Tan'yuu and other mushishis. For the person affected, it looks like it's possible to make some choices (feeling of free will). For the outside world, it seems that people affected by the mushi only had "one life/one timeline". It's indeed impossible to know everything about their life, you can only have a grasp if they left written traces or testimonies in their last timeline.

It means that the other cases that Ginko talks about are just cases similar to the one we see in the episode. Mushishis are aware of this mushi, so they write about cases of "dj-vu" when they think it's mushi-related. We can suppose that Ginko will send a record of this story to Tan'yuu : "Hey, I found Kairou case ! Here's a brief description of the story". The last Ginko's record that will be passed to other mushishis in the distant future (after Ginko) will be different. It will be the last testimony he will hear and write from Kaoru, or Iku, or both, or no testimony at all in fact. Because we always describe what we feel, the last testimony will not be "Once, I changed the event by walking away the tunnel, and I experienced a life never experienced before". Instead, the ultimate testimony will be tainted by anxiousness : "In fact, as far as I remember, I always lived a life already lived, except maybe for my very first timeline before I crossed the mushi's path at something like 70, or when I chose to walk away the path to increase my total life by 2 or 3 years. But it doesn't matter anyway, in the end, maybe I never realy had a choice. In the end, as of right now, there's not a second of my life that I didn't live already."

And the next mushishi in the future will do the same thing that Ginko did, he will say to the patient "I read some records on this mushi, the last one was from Ginko, and again the report states that it's impossible to change the past. My only advice is to walk away the tunnel when you encounter it, maybe you will get a few more "fresh" years (but only for one or two loops top) before being consumed". Note that the mushishi should not destroy all of the patient's hopes by predicting that he will never get out of the mushi influence and live an unexpected life ^^

This theory holds only if the mushishi (Ginko in this case) does not try to go visit the couple in the future (when they are old). So the question is now why Ginko did not go visit Kaoru more frequently to see how the situation evolved, since he did so in other episodes/cases (like S1E15 "Pretense of Spring" and S1E04 "The Pillow Pathway").

EDIT : TL;DR : Ginko got a record by a mushishi affected by the Kairou mushi. People affected by the mushi have a feeling of free will but for the outside word they can't change the past. What mushishis can learn is only from rare testimonies and sources from the "last timeline" lived by the people affected. There are probably many plotholes and implicit assumptions, and it's just one of the many interpretations we can have with this marvelous show. So don't take it for THE explanation, just my thoughts.
>> ARTICLE
I think they are both trapped. By the time he asks Ginko about the mushi, though, she'll be asleep again. She won't find out, and everything will play out like it did before. We didn't see her really engage with Ginko at all, so she might never ask him about it. 
>> ARTICLE
>Did he join the Mushi and now his wife is the one trapped? Or do they both just have Deja Vu? 

It's left intentionally ambiguous which one of those happened. The show also ends before we see her get to her choice. Will choosing not to enter the tunnel lead to her fall off the cliff? Will the husband still remember everything and somehow save her? We don't know.

 The show is not about the end result of the time-loop, but about the reasons behind his choices. He initially got caught in the loop because he wanted to change his past, however when he gave up on that he was finally able to live further with his family. But when his wife is dying the mushi tempts him again. Are they now reliving their lives over and over again together? Is the wife alone in the loop and will she die when she exists? No one knows. But he chose to try to save her that way not knowing what the results would be, which is why we don't know. All he knew is that she would loop like he did, and even if that meant him becoming one with the mushi he was willing to make that sacrifice to save her.

>> ARTICLE
so this episode is very subtle and powerful.. That's why i love mushishi, it has a very strong philosophy undertone that makes you think.. The superb art and music just enhance the experience.
some questions i have

Was changing the past really impossible? I felt like the scene in which Ginko was asked about Kaoru dejavu happened only once in his numerous loops. Because when he decided to not go inside the cave again, he thought of what Ginko had told him previously. 

Was  Kaoru aware of him being under the effect the mushi the second when he decided to bring his dying wife inside the mushi? 


>> ARTICLE
When Kaoru learns about his condition from Ginko, what we see is the continuation of that same timeline. So when he steps away from the tunnel, he essentially continues his life and leaves the loop. Basically he re-enters the tunnel, because that was the only way to save his wife in his opinion since he already knew what the mushi does.
>> ARTICLE
Well done! I mean seriously, well done to the creators because this was brilliant! Not only is it a time loop episode, which can go very wrong very quickly if done badly, but it's coming off the tail of Ginko's back story, something that's difficult to just walk away from.

Man this episode is awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Man, right when I saw they omitted the opening I knew this episode was going to be special.

It was.

Masterpiece. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that was a top tier episode. I mean they're all good, but this was fantastic. If you knew you could go back in time would you? Try to fix your regrets? Or accept them and move on? Good theme this week. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if you were being rhetorical or not, but the episode made me wonder if I would keep on entering that loop or not. I think I would, it'd be wonderful to relive some moments of my life. But that's the instant gratification side of me, and the idea of just being slightly aware that there isn't a single new experience in your life is absolutely terrifying. With every loop getting just a bit more unsettling, that would be complete madness. This episode gave me chills.
>> ARTICLE
That was pretty scary, getting stuck in a loop then having your wife stuck in the loop as well.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. This is probably the best episode of Mushishi so far.
>> ARTICLE
I was expecting him to unconsciously alter the future by saving the kid, which leads to him to not meet his future wife and somewhat *saves* her from her death. He will then live a completely different life with a different family, job, everything. That would have been very bitter sweet.

This version is pretty awesome too though.
>> ARTICLE
I can totally see this plot work in a movie (there has probably been one already).
>> ARTICLE
Just when he made it out of the loop, the future got something else in store for him.Sure, the guy is alive in his wife's loop but I cant help but to feel that the original looping guy is dead, the warning from Ginko pretty much confirms it.Great episode, I knew something good is coming since there was no OP.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know how many episodes this is getting?
>> ARTICLE
This is second cour, so it's probably no more than 13.
>> ARTICLE
he said he wanted to see the future more than altering the past.. then took his wife back to the past.. wot?
this guy basically ruin the lives of hundreds of ppl working in the saki refinery cuz he was being a dick to a kid.. coulda changed that but decided to move on with his life instead..

mushishi created some dude again you dont know whether to feel sorry or not cuz his decision making is completely shit.
>> ARTICLE
You've got the entire thing wrong.

The one who was stuck in the loop was the man only, not the entire village. He 'saved' his wife by making her get stuck in the loop too, instead of dying like she probably would if he tried to get her to a doctor. Also note that Ginko warned him not to go into the cave ever again, otherwise he might become part of the Mushi itself. Thus, we could conclude that he sacrified himself to make his wife live, even though she would live in the loop only. Anyway, we'll never be sure of what really happened, since the episode didn't explain what happened later.
>> ARTICLE
Put yourself in that situation and 99 times out of 100, a normal guy like you or me would probably give into that temptation, not keeping big picture consequences in mind. Also realize that in the episode, those who feel that uneasiness of Deja vu were only those that entered the cave. 

This isn't a case of Mushishi creating a character you're not sure you feel sorry for, it's a case of you as a viewer failing to realize the situation and context that led to the character making a reasonable and relatable decision. 
>> ARTICLE
I always loved how they do character design for kids. I always find them adorable :D

That ending was really beautiful and sad. In the end, she was too kind to step on anyone's shadow. The way these stories end is always just awesome and perfect. It just makes me sigh when it ends.
>> ARTICLE
They are great, but I find most of the character designs are very similar, to the point where I'm thinking this looks just like the guy in another episode.

There's been at least one incident when I got confused in the same episode too, which is bad I think. For this episode it was pretty close considering you don't really get a side by side comparison.

And the fact, that they use actual child voice actors to voice children... It ruined me forever and now grown up women doing those fake children voices sound really creepy to me :/

I disagree with everyone saying this was a comparatively worse episode than previous episodes of this season. This is the first episode to make me genuinely cry at the end. Akane's second chance at life constrasting with her inability to step on another's shadow was so heartbreakingly beautiful.

ever since mushishi season 1 ended, the sequels haven't had the same impact on me; however, this episode really brought back those same feelings and emotions. 

this episode was simply beautiful.

Me too! Some episodes have almost made me cry but this one was the first to fully succeed. Where most shows need many episodes of build up to bring out that kind of emotion, mushishi apparently only needs 20 minutes. This episode reminded me why we I love mushishi.

Yes, yes! I just finished watching this episode and I think it may be one of my favorites ever!

My God, this anime is really a fountain of beautiful stories.

Another amazing episode. This last cour is shaping up to be the best of the series. This anime is unparalleled in terms of intertwining human drama and speculative fiction elements. The only ones that come close are Natsume and Mononoke. 

My only criticism of the series is it relies too much on flashbacks to set up the story and characters. It can feel a bit formulaic at times, but the stories are so good that I barely even mind it.

> the series is it relies too much on flashbacks to set up the story and characters

Unfortunately, this is the major problem with series that do stories one episode at a time. You kind of have to use flashbacks to set up the characters or else a lot of precious episode time will be wasted.

Not that I mind the execution in Mushishi though. The show handles it very well and makes the stories so good that the use of flashbacks is alright. Also, the show's direction somehow manages to get the transitions in-and-out of the flashbacks to be very smooth and of sense.
>> ARTICLE
i appreciate you from doing thsi cinematography.. i have been checking them out every episode. short but well done
>> ARTICLE
I get what you are saying with the flashbacks, but I honestly don't think its an issue. This show, with a main character (Ginko) as detached from the plot of each episode (kinda like a spectator), I think it kinda gives the creators license to use those flashbacks. 

Regardless of whether its an issue or not, the show still is brilliant.

Hearing Youkichi and his wife bicker reminds me so much of my grandparents and to some extent my own parents. This weeks episode, I thought, was more impactful than last weeks.
>> ARTICLE
I had a huge lump in my throat at the end there. There's never any happy-ever-afters in Mushishi. Nature doesn't allow for happy-ever-afters.

I like how this show constantly makes you place yourself in other people's shoes so effectively. When Akane's voice is talking about what the other world she found herself in is like, I really got a sense of the slow everlasting dread she must've felt. Was time the same for her? Did she spend 60, 70, 80 years wandering around in a lonely world of constant dusk? That was a little hard to swallow.

the use of music in this anime.... holly fuck.. at the end when he apologizes to the shadow along with that beautiful tone playing in the background... too surreal
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is an amazing show. It's one of those shows perfect for watching before you go to bed - every episode is a self-contained story that manages to do in 20 minutes what many shows don't manage over several seasons. Some of the episodes are heartwarming, some of them are scary, some of them are sad, but they always manage to evoke emotions in me, and they are unusually relaxing... After watching them I can't help but think about the episode, about life, the universe, and everything.

This episode is a perfect example of that - the ending was perfectly bittersweet, I sat there looking at the credits for quite some time with a knot in my throat, just *thinking*. That poor Akane, too sweet to even step on the shadow of the man who married the girl who stole your own life.

Mushishi, never change.

I was ready to nope out 1 minute in. [This](http://puu.sh/czBxr/1116d6209d.jpg) was some Yami Shibai shit right here.

Still no OP. Goddammit... 

At least, we're having great episodes.

I don't remember the first cour being really dark or anything, but man... The first two episodes of the second have been kinda dark/bittersweet so far... I love that, but it's kinda hard to bear.

Seeing Mikage realize what she had done and Akane not being able to steal away someone's life because she's too kind was heartbreaking...

I'm glad for Youkichi that Mikage was not the total opposite of Akane, personnality wise (kinda like Kuro/Illya...)

Also, goddammit was their fight when they were kid cute!
>> ARTICLE
? you meant the last 2? cuz the first episode "Grass Cushion" is very heart warming
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, indeed. We're at episode 15 now.. Right. My bad.
>> ARTICLE
The creepiest thing about this episode, Ginko never said this could be because of a mushi. none were named or investigated he just said he'd heard of such a thing.

>> ARTICLE
Such a strong episode.
>> ARTICLE
I thought this episode was fantastic as well, third episode in a row to make me tear up.
>> ARTICLE
What a tearjerker episode. She probably followed Mikage for 70 years since she doesn't know what the right choice is. I guess it's Grandpa's turn to be the shadow, but I think there's a way around this.

1.) Find someone who's on their death bed.

2.) Step on their shadow

3.) ????

4.) Profit.
>> ARTICLE
You don't age in the shadow, so that would just cause someone to have a really confusing death. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow all the tragic ends for the episodes shown this cour...
>> ARTICLE
First I was creeped out by the mushi thinking its was just acting like a wormhole, a minor shenanigans in mushishi world to me but then we learned that it actually keep the person inside itself. I cant imagine what will happen if Akane remembers back, was it an accident the guy stepped on her shadow or he did it willingly? Man...
>> ARTICLE
Have to say this week's episode might not have been as strong as last weeks, but still pretty good. I will say, however, the comedy was pretty great today, we had a lot of great small moments that got some genuine laughs out of me. 

The whole "mushi reappearing after Ginko reveals what it is" mechanic was used again this week, and probably lost some of it's impact due the repetition. I also feel like the old man's character's motivation was a bit weak, and it was hard to tell weather he loved Akane before, or if he had gotten over it. It may have helped a bit to make us sympathize with her a little more, to show us  either some more of her life before the switch or some more of the effects of her disappearance. 

Looking forward to next week's episode, "hidden cove"
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure what you're getting at with your observation that mushi (or its effects) manifest itself after it's revealed by Ginko, but Akane appeared several years after Ginko's departure. There was genuine purpose behind Akane visiting Mikage's grave at the end of the episode, it's not just an arbitrary decision by the writer.
>> ARTICLE
I did not think of the mushi (Akane) reappearing at the end to mean that she was visiting Mikage's grave, that is an interesting point. 

I wouldn't say that it was an arbitrary decision by the writer, I was just drawing parallels between this and last weeks episode. In both cases Ginko only dropped by for a day or so, and rather than directly solving it he merely explained the phenomenon surrounding the mushi before leaving. In both stories, after an indiscriminate amount of time the mushi would appear and, rather than Ginko take care of it, the people would choose how to deal with it on their own terms.

 I am just pointing out that to me the two episodes had fairly similar plot structures, and I believe that may be the reason why it was less impactful than last week's episode
>> ARTICLE
Ok, I understand what you mean now. It's true that the past two episodes Ginko was only used as an expository character, rather than a main character.

My counter-point would be this: It was never less impactful when Ginko consistently directly solved problems and mysteries caused by mushi. I don't see why it therefore would be less impactful for Ginko to only indirectly play a part in the story for a few episodes.

I think it's less of it being objectively less impactful and more of it just not being your cup of tea. You like seeing Ginko more involved in the story. That's totally fine, and I got that feeling a little in last week's episode too.
>> ARTICLE
No, that is not what I mean at all. I actually think Ginko's minimal interference in last week's episode improved the story, he didn't need to be there any longer than he was and the writer didn't make him be there any longer than it was. 

I am saying that in both this week's episode and last's, the characters of both stories face similar situations where Ginko's knowledge on mushi ends up being useful much later on. I don't think that Ginko being there or not affects the emotional impact of the stories, but rather the repetition of the pattern where the characters meet the mushi again without Ginko. This repetition in of itself is what I am saying affected the impact, not Ginko's presence or lack thereof. 

It would have been interesting to see these stories in the opposite order to see weather it had the same effect or not. 
>> ARTICLE
The real question is how the rest of the season is going to play out. Is it going to focus more in Ginko or continue what has been happening these past 2 episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
My guess would be a mix of both. Zoku Shou as a whole has has a much smaller focus on Ginko, and a greater focus on how regular people deal with mushi. I would love to see some more of Ginko's past, or possibly some sort of character arc for him, but I doubt that will happen. All I can say is that these upcoming episodes have me incredibly excited.
>> ARTICLE
Nice episode! Personally I think it wasn't as impactful as the last week's episode but considering this is Mushishi we are talking about.. it's still a very awesome episode.

The background music was good, those moments when Ginko goes around curing old people's knees were funny, and that scene when he had to piggy-back Mikage were good too.

I wonder what will become of Youkichi? Will he be trapped in the "other world" forever unless he stepped on another person's shadow too? 
>> ARTICLE
He'll probably decide to stay trapped in the other world. He knows what happens and since he's old, he has nothing to lose by staying in the other world. By doing that, he also lets people live their lives peacefully without having to make a hard decision (stepping on someone else's shadow to live but being selfish or let others live their life but being trapped alone forever...).
>> ARTICLE
To build onto that, I would agree with your assumption that Youkichi won't step on another person's shadow but I think the reasoning behind his decision isn't a "nothing to lose" situation. In fact, he has everything to lose. You heard it through Akane's (or Mikage's? I couldn't really tell by the voice) words about how it felt to be stuck as a shadow. Forever stuck at dusk, representative of a sort of limbo, you'll pretty much wander around forever unless you choose to step on someone else's shadow. I believe Youkichi felt an immense amount of guilt (just as Mikage did) for living his life like he did after Ginko told him about the situation. He's going into it knowing the pain and the everlasting loneliness to come, but he's making a decision (not sure whether to call it selfless because of its immediate consequences or selfish because he went against Akane's wishes) to carry that weight.

Another beautiful, relatable episode from Mushishi. This final season is looking to be the strongest the show has to offer. 
>> ARTICLE
so should you be happy at the end or sad?  confused
>> ARTICLE
When is Mushishi anything but bittersweet?
>> ARTICLE
Very interesting episode. Had a somewhat similar structure to last weeks, but had a totally different feeling compared to most of the episodes in this series. An atmosphere of gentle isolation? Of warming loneliness, or a kind of calming resignation? I don't know, but this show nails it's unsettling atmosphere and manages to intertwine it with so much more. All built on a very human situation of finding out your own happiness was built on another's loss of their own, with a very human reaction based on no ill will.
>> ARTICLE
You couldn't find a better series to bet on as Halloween-appropriate. Disappearing people being replaced by others living as shadows connecting through from other worlds is just perfect.

This episode was just pouring on the atmosphere. I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like this episode has the least amount of music this season. Silence like that allows the voice actors' performances to really pop through and create awesome scenes where the audience is listening in on a real conversation, just wondering where it's going. It makes the audience connect with the characters much more naturally than when music is guiding that process through.

This season, for me, surpasses the first in every way but the fantastical imagery (which isn't a problem since most of the themes of this season don't lend themselves to that as much as the first season's exploration of the Mushi did) It's going down as a definite recommendation for anyone who wants a series that takes them on a journey.
>> ARTICLE
Good episode, and like everyone else has said not as good compared to last weeks. Regardless, it seems they packed onions with this episode. Luckly was not as bad as last weeks, almost dehydrated me. 

The ending was a tad bit too rushed, could have delved into the shadows (Akanes) backstory a bit more and what it was doing all those years, but whats done is done.


>> ARTICLE
Ha! I finally found a flaw in Mushishi's writing!

Why did the old man believe Ginko about that shadow switching immediately? If he had expressed at least some doubt, it'd be more believable.
>> ARTICLE
Not really a flaw , Mushi-shi seemed to be as respected as doctors in this universe. So if a Mushi-shi says something is the way it is , than you usually won't get any naysayers in the show.
>> ARTICLE
There are plenty of episodes (or chapters) where people doubt Ginko. It usually ends in a disaster, but nevertheless.
>> ARTICLE
Didnt the old man mentioned that there was a mushi shi in the village some time ago? In my oppinion the trust in which the old man places  in Ginko comes from the insurance that mushi shis actually makes a difference and solves mysteries or the unknown/unseen. So its only natural to believe Ginko.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention that Ginko had helped his knee, though it could've easily been a placebo effect until the following morning. 
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain this to me: 

The manga for Mushishi is godly. The Mushishi anime is amazing. Mushishi Zoku Shou is also amazing. Mushishi in general is revered and loved by almost all. 

The second part of basically one of the highest quality anime in the last few years, which doesn't comply to a number of tropes that everyone complains about, is currently airing.

But barely anyone in this sub seems to care one bit. The episode threads get tens of comments. It's been an hour since the episode went up and not a single comment. Why is that? I guess /r/anime has shit taste, kappa.

Honestly, it's very frustrating reading so many threads where people are cynical about the current state of anime. Everyone still watches bullshit like SAO, but ignores the high quality stuff that deserves support.  edit. Let's be clear I watch SAO too, lol.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll definitely streams Mushishi, both America and Europe so I doubt that's it.
>> ARTICLE
because people here on this subreddit cant enjoy an anime with beautiful art, music, plot they need overpowered brainless mc's with a 10 girls harem and some quality panty shots go better to mal they enjoy this anime more and the discussion there is better

>> ARTICLE
Dear god this has probably been the most condescending comment thread I've seen in a while. Please refrain from pushing your opinion as absolute while simultaneously bashing on this imagined, mindless fanbase you have in your mind. 

I agree that Mushishi is an excellent anime (one of my favorites) and it deserves more discussion, but at the same time, this doesn't call for starting a rant about "superior" tastes in entertainment. Let people enjoy what they want to watch, and please keep the discussion to the episode's contents. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, this might just be me but I'm saying it anyways. I love the anime, but I'm only 5 episodes in after watching it for like two months because something about watching it is just way too relaxing. 

That's a good thing, and I watch it especially when it's hard for me to sleep, but it's really bad to marathon like you can with most anime. I caught up with Psycho-Pass to watch P-P 2 in like a week, but I just can't do that with Mushi-shi, or I'll fall asleep.

It's the only reason I'm not on these threads, I just happened to look in this one to see how it was going. 
>> ARTICLE
People judges a book by its cover and Mushishi doesn't really ignite that interest on a quick glance unlike SAO. I mean, I've heard about how good Mushishi is for a long time but didn't pick it up until recently. Instead, I watched those high-profile shows like Aldnoah, Nozaki-kun, Attack on Titan etc.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe a lot of people haven't seen Mushishi and don't know this is an episodic anime so they think they can't watch it because they haven't seen season 1.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is Mushishi isn't a type of anime for everybody. It requires a special taste of things, I think. And it's not that much debatable since there's no big plot into it. And I'm not pointing it as a flaw. It's just different. I'm recently new to this subthread although I watch Mushishi for a long time now. I just feel good about watching it, I feel the need to make other people watch it but I don't feel the need to discuss it, you know what I'm saying?
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is more like a cult classic than a mainstream hit. It's one of the reasons why 'everyone seems to love it' but yet it sits as a S.A.V.E. title on [Funimation](http://shop.funimation.com/Shop/ShopProductDetail.ss?itemid=47044).

The only reason it's getting any NE love is b/c Aniplex is releasing BD's at some point. But we don't know if they'll dub it (doubt it tho)
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, there's not a lot to actually discuss in a Mushishi 'discussion' because the show pretty much lays it out on the episode. As they say, the work speaks for itself.

Say what people will about other anime, but they are a lot easier to comment on because they often leave a lot of plot threads hanging (sometimes on purpose, sometimes not) and there's a lot more drama within the premise of the story, characters and the fandom.

It's really not a knock on other anime or Mushishi. It's just how it is.
>> ARTICLE
No clue, I love the single story per episode format it does and still keeping a certain thread across all the stories.

Guess its not for everyones pleasure :\

Edit:

Though this does give one big advantage. I can browse peoples anime lists and find hidden gems that I'm sure I will like. Going though Denzoos list (pretty big anime compatilibly @ 84%) and cherry picking what I have not seen yet :)
>> ARTICLE
I rather like the fact that Mushishi threads don't devolve into what other anime's do - waifu wars, source-adaptation comparison, inane drivel, fawning over certain characters, "X best Y" bullshit, borderline retards quarrelling, gif/screenshot/quote dumps (Hey, we watched *the same fucking episode?!* Holy fuck, what are the fucking odds!), and other mindless bullshit.

Mushishi threads are like its episodes - quiet, mellow, and pleasant.
>> ARTICLE
I never comment on these threads, but I have seen every episode. Mushishi is the kind of anime that is hard to craft a middling response to. Its so enveloped in themes and messages that it takes some actual analyzing to say anything moderately useful on the subject. 

"I liked it, it made me cry/laugh/happy/sad" is not an interesting comment to write, nor is it interesting to read.


I imagine a lot of people watch this, but just don't comment on it.
>> ARTICLE
I agree completely that it's a show that doesn't elicit much interesting response (not like that stops most people in other threads,) but look at the ratings on CR - only 57 ratings for the most recent Mushishi episode, and 357 for the most recent SAO episode. I don't think a lot of people are watching Mushishi at all. It's also very unfair to compare it to one of the most popular anime of recent years, but hopefully you get my point.

I'm sorry for my generally whiny comment on the state of the anime fandom, but where better to express my discontent than the void of reddit.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think a show like Mushishi would be immensely popular in any medium. Mushishi, despite its strengths is not a fun show to watch. That goes doubly so for people like myself that like an overarching plot in my shows. 

I'll be honest. If I were to tell you that I look forward to this show every week, I would be lying. even further, I can't even say that I really enjoy the show all that much, but I wind up rating it high anyways because that was kind of the point of the show. 

Its a show that seems tailored to analysis, which is not going to be your casual anime fan.

>> ARTICLE
I think a major contributing factor in the lack of attention surrounding Mushishi is essentially the manga dates back to 1999, and the first series aired in 2005. With the subreddit every expanding the majority of users now are getting into the hobby through recent series like Shingeki, things that started a decade and beyond ago are out of their scope at the moment most likely. Very little ever touches the front page outside of the flavour of the month mainstream references that garner easy upvotes, that's not much of a help either.

You need to have watched 2 series/2 specials dedicated to Mushishi to be watching this at the moment, and the highly episodic nature of the series means that there's very little opportunity to theorise what's going to happen next or make comment on certain happenings(which is the sum of most discussion threads.) Because each and every episode has a beginning middle and end and no doubt leaves most people satisfied with nothing to say on the matter unless they feel like deconstructing the episode.
>> ARTICLE
We had a [survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2lwkda/midseason_comprehensive_fall_2014_anime_survey/) a few days ago. Out of 3209 people 341 said that they are currently watching Mushishi Zoku Shou 2.

That is still not even close to what it deserves, but 11% is a decent amount if you consider the kind of show that it is. 

Most casual anime fans prefer action or comedy shows so looking at the popularity on sites like CR or MAL isn't really fair.

/u/Advenna64 will make a detailed post about the survey results soon, so if you are interested in seeing what people on /r/anime watch and enjoy then keep an eye on him.
>> ARTICLE
I completely forgot about that survey, despite participating in it! I look forward to the more in depth analysis!

How dare you insinuate that MAL or CR are for casuals. I'll have you know that I have over 300 confirmed animes on my list.

Also, please keep spreading the love for Chihayafuru. That third season's not going to happen, but I sure hope if I say it enough on the internet it will.

How? he cannot see Mushishi

Yeah, he'll probably have a fake shiny one made and then sell it to him.
>> ARTICLE
Doubt it because i don't think he could get fake shiny kimono since the glow is from mushi. If he does get a fake one that shiny without the help of mushi then its hella expensive which i don't think he can afford or willing to pay. 

Edit: well this is just from a guy who knows nothing about kimono and shiny stuff

> How? he cannot see Mushishi

"Ginko? Where are you?!"
>> ARTICLE
I liked this one a hell of a lot more than the last two. Ginko was a more active participant this time, that's a plus. I also liked this episode's characters more, they had clearer motivations and personalities. Felt really nice to see Gen happy at the end.  
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is like a fine wine, it only improves with age.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me, or has it been a long time since we've met people who deny the possibility of the existence of mushi? The first season had a lot of that, while the second seemed like people are starting to accept the fact. I guess this episode felt a bit refreshing in a sense?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe after all the phenomenon that has happened, people slowly learned to accept it. Although, I don't think Mushishi is linear at all. But rumours spread and whatnot. Maybe it depends on the location, some villages may be more inclined to superstitious beliefs more than others. Especially those which actually have designated town mushishis.
>> ARTICLE
When the father said 'Gen, I'm sorry...' i almost thought he was gonna say his mother had died in the years he hadn't seen her.

I think mushishi has a mostly seinen audience, SOA is shounen/sienen so it has twice the potential audience

SAO is about as pure a shonen show as you could come up with. It's not aimed at adult men at all, though of course there's some splashover regardless.

>> ARTICLE
Great ending, one of the "feel good" ending in mushishi to me. Others are somewhat depressing or bittersweet for me.I cant help but to grin and say "Fuck you mushi, not in this episode".
>> ARTICLE
The fact that the mother does not miraculously gain feelings for her son  after she learns that he was only trying to protect everyone is what sets mushishi apart from other animes. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think one good incident will automatically make amends for their past history, but I wouldn't have minded if she started seeing him in a better light. Either way, they will have to learn to live with eachother and accept reality. It just shows that families can learn to improve as with any other kind of relationship.
>> ARTICLE
I can't really see that as a good incident.  She was trying to be a better mother by committing suicide through her son, not particularly caring about the likelihood he'd live through the fact scarred for life.  He pushes her away and denies her of her selfish wish.  She's not happy, he's not happy, no one is happy.

The whole point is that no matter what crazy thing happens, the mother cannot feel anything for her son.  Her son is even less than another person to her, just as her husband is.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm not disagreeing with you there. Either way, the immediate disaster was averted. I think that's at least the good news.
>> ARTICLE
In the end didn't it say that the son went on to live with his relatives.
>> ARTICLE
I think the beauty of its ending is that the answer stays in the air. The son and mother got apart but she took an effort to find an umbilical cord and he holds it. Their relationship is not getting better but doesn't die. It exists like a weak, thin thread, or like a small, dried umbilical cord. No one knows where it goes. It's not black or white as a life is sometimes like that. 
>> ARTICLE
The closer we draw to the eventual completion of the manga's adaptation the more solemn a new episode feels. And that emotion carried through this episode in its exploration of this broken family unit.

I love how the mushi simply leaves of its own accord as an affirmation of the irreparable nature of Reki and Shino's relationship.

I love Reki's challenging stare as a demonstration of his frustration when Shino halfheartedly tried to call him back inside.

I love how Shino will only accept some form of escape as a means to reconcile with her son, coaxing *him* to relieve *her* of her misgivings first and foremost.

I love how Ginko has been referencing data from the archives lately. Every time he breaks out a scroll, I immediately beam with happiness at the thought of Tanyu's pen having graced it. I've always imagined Ginko's narration at the end of an episode as a conversation with her that gets committed to that written base of knowledge that Tanyu spearheads. At the moment she's almost another member of the audience, but one day in the far future they will set out together to live out those stories together.

I really don't want this series to end, guys.
>> ARTICLE
wish i could be immersed in such a great series as yourself

perhaps its the superficial lack of overarching plot to pair with the immense development, but mushishi just doesnt bring me back week after week
>> ARTICLE
I'm of the opinion that each user here has one or two shows that engross them in one way or another. Mushishi is just that show for me. The way it carries itself plays into what I look for in a show of this nature. I can find an endless amount of small, peripheral things that I appreciate and that keeps me invested and excited for a new story each week.

Yup, I always imagine his narration as a story he's recounting for Tanyu to record.

Well, it's hard to not win when your only competition is literally soulless.
>> ARTICLE
I think with Mushishi, at least it feels like Ginko will carry on even if we don't get to see it anymore.

So while it will be sad to see it end, at least it doesn't feel like an absolute finality to me. Because it feels like the lives of the characters will continue onward.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely. The show established everything it needed in order to leave me with that feeling, but letting go still feels like a hurdle.
>> ARTICLE
Is there some Japanese tradition about holding on to the umbilical cord? Why did they still have it after all those years?

EDIT: Actually did some googling. Apparently there is such a [tradition] (http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2002/09/08/general/the-japanese-attachment-to-umbilical-cords/#.VIOYZjHF9tU) TIL
>> ARTICLE
I know my parents had mine as well. I'm white with no association with any oriental ancestry so the tradition carries on in the states somewhat as well.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow every episode of this show leaves me with an empty feeling, a longing for it to continue and never stop. This feeling is one I only ever get from the endings of truly fantastic series, yet every episode of Mushishi gives me this feeling. And somehow, it keeps getting better.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, two depressing episodes in a row.

On a side note, I really love how the scroll is written in feudal-style kanji+katakana, but the grammar is still completely modern :p It's a neat touch.

Any idea how many episodes we have left?

What was in the boy's hand at the end?
>> ARTICLE
Me think its the remain of the umbilical cord seeing as it is a important plot item with its multiple subtle meanings such as the connection of mother and child.

Mushishi never cease to amaze how beautiful a story can be told in such subtle, gentle and quite way as if whispering a intimate secret into your ear.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, definitely umbilical cord.

>Mushishi never cease to amaze how beautiful a story can be told in such subtle, gentle and quite way as if whispering a intimate secret into your ear.

Love that description. Very fitting.

I absolutly love the tales of Mushishi.

It's just interesting to see and all the ideas...

I would watch hundrets of episodes if i could.
>> ARTICLE
Am I wrong or did the mother want him to get hit by lightning?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, that was the whole point of this story. The mother was forced into this marriage. That's why she just couldn't love the child she had with the husband she didn't want.
It went so far that she wanted to die herself and didn't care about her son dying or not.

...I really liked this episode.
>> ARTICLE
It was a pretty dark episode when compared to the rest. 

... I liked it as well. Ginko the psychologist.   
>> ARTICLE
You could almost say that he's one of those in most of the episodes, I think. In almost all cases, the mushi causing the problem is merely a reflection of one or more of the characters' mental states being given a physical consequence.

The girl who it rains on everywhere she goes, the boy whose skin is cold to the touch and who is constantly thirsty, the old woman who can't quite remember where she comes from, the child who is incredibly strong and quick to anger.

They're all things related to a mushi who, although being neither good nor evil, causes problems for them that manifest in ways that are almost always completely interlaced symbolically with what the characters of each particular episode are going through.

Then Ginko comes along and usually finds a way to cure them or exorcise the mushi in some way, which in turn resolves the psychological struggle which is occurring in those people. There are some blatant exceptions to make it clear that sometimes life is just a bitch, and that no matter how you try sometimes things will go wrong that can't be fixed. But there's always a meaningful psychological lesson that it brings for the people involved, usually but not always from Ginko.

...sorry for the long-winded necro post, I should've just said "Yeah!" That's enough ranting on from me.
>> ARTICLE
No problem. I loved the ending with the time loop, when the man decides to be devoured by the mushi, but his wife is then then locked in the time loop and they can spend at least one more iteration of time together.

Onions.
>> ARTICLE
This episode had Ginko display a lot more emotion than usual, which is a little bit weird. Yet, it added to the raw emotion of the story. The raw emotion that has Mushi-Shi to entail the audience, makes Mushi-Shi one of the best anime of all time.

*WHAT A BIIIII*^*I*^^*I*^^^*I*^^^*T*^^^^*C*^^^^^*H!*

Seriously, fuck that woman. I get that she's unhappy because she got forced into arranged marriage, but a) she could have eloped, it's not like that hadn't happened back then, and b) leave the kid out of this, you stupid, petty cunt. I like how even animators have drawn her as physically unattractive. Just compare her to any other young-to-milf girls in Mushishi. Her turtle face betrays her character - that of a reptile that would eat its young. Who gives a fuck if she's haunted by the memories? She deserves worse. God damn it, usually Mushishi soothes me, but this episode just pissed me off.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think her character was drawn to look unattractive, it was a pretty standard looking face for the series. Also she is in the depths of depression and has limited free will, it isn't her fault that her family sent her off to a place she didn't know to be married to a stranger. I am pretty sure the woman wouldn't just run off with a man in this setting, seeing as it would be looked down upon by the society she was raised in. Sure it isn't the kids fault, but she can't force herself to feel an attachment to him.
>> ARTICLE
**Mind-dump**

> I've known that old man since he was a young one

For some reason I feel I laughed way too hard at this line.

A true testament to Mushishi's storytelling is how it weaves an otherwise straightforward tale into something more enriching. The episode starts simply enough. Kanta seeks to remain untethered through his work while his wife, family, and village both express and represent a force exerted on him to settle down. After consuming the fruit of the entity that solidified the stability of the village that would welcome him should he choose to stay, he is forcibly bound by that entity and shown the history that it has recorded. Kanta doesn't take this well at first. He's shown to be haggard and deflects his daughter because he feels that he has no value in this state. But the knowledge that he is bestowed ends up saving the village *because* the villagers still hold him in high regard and work with him to minimize the damage of the earthquake/mudslide event. He seems to accept his new role in the final scene after his prior skill set ironically becomes needed when Kanta no longer possesses the capacity to perform that work.

**Things I appreciated**

* The amount of detail in some of these shots was staggering, especially in shots where the camera focused toward the ground or on the wildlife that the Eternity Tree saw.
* Ginko basically querying the collective of Mushishis for some form of remedy. Again he passes no judgment on the inflicted, perhaps merely nudging Kanta in his acceptance of his new role.
* Nui describes the tree as "watching", not interfering. It is said to be immune to the actions of man, but both neglecting it and venerating it are shown to have negative effects.

**Thoughts**

In a way, I'm relieved that I don't have to say goodbye to Mushishi for a while. Knowing that the conclusion has yet to come softens the blow of its departure for the time being. The movie was teased for all of 2 seconds and the prospect of checking this out in a theater entices me to no end.
>> ARTICLE
Great summary, and I agree about your analysis. I also can't wait for the movie to air...since it's Aniplex maybe we'll get a small theatrical run here in the states.
>> ARTICLE
> since it's Aniplex maybe we'll get a small theatrical run here in the states.

I wish I could be optimistic, but really, I see no chance of this happening.
>> ARTICLE
The distributor is Aniplex?! I feel silly for not noticing that on the Crunchyroll page. There is hope! I had the good fortune of getting to see [Expelled from Paradise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13391) - also Aniplex - in a theater not to far from me so fingers crossed that this increases the likelihood of a foreign premiere.
>> ARTICLE
derailing from mushishi, how was Expelled? It screened close to where I live but the CGI looked pretty bad from the PVs I saw. The only hook for was the Butcher's name on the poster. Was it any good?
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed it. It sells itself through high-intensity action, light mystery, and the unlikely-duo-settling-into-each-other dynamic. It had an interesting take on the tragedy of the commons and future of humanity at large. If you expect fun, you'll certainly get it here.

From the director himself [paraphrased], the visuals are "3DCGI meant to mimic cell animation". You'll only ever notice any awkwardness when the characters are moving mid-range in the depth of field and a few lip movements from Angela that felt akin to South Park. Otherwise, I thought it looked really good.

On the Urobuchi front, there is one conversation between Dingo & Angela in which they debate the implications of two different societal models and it's pure, uncut Butcher philosophy. Human Spirit. The ruthlessness of utilitarianism. Very keen and insightful with its application of technology in that regard. Otherwise it's absent for the most part.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked this episode. The characters Kanta and the tree contrasted very well. And as Mushishi often does, it balanced a sense of despair beautifully with a sense of hope.\\

I had resigned myself to Kanta's fate as Kanta did, right before he noticed the red flowers. And then I feared for Kanta in particular, either because of a kind of organ rejection like scenario caused by the mushi, where either his body or the mushi rejected the other enough to endanger both. But it ended up being the salvation of the village. It wasn't a joyous ending; the village was destroyed and Kanta still has to live with his legs, but the events weren't devastating, as I expected them to be. I thought this was a great episode to end the second season with (even though I feel like the movie will be the official cap).\\

I like that Mushishi bounces between happy endings, unsettling endings, and balanced endings like this one. The entire series has a balanced feeling that way, and I feel like that balance touches deeper emotions than those that are stirred by shows that reach for passionate emotions. They're emotions that kind of sit in me, and aren't swept away after the moment is gone. Great things come from both sets of emotions, but Mushishi is one of the few shows I know that goes for the deeper set, and I really appreciate it. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's interesting that this series Ginko has been less involved in the story and more of an informer and observer than a fixer of problems.

Sometimes things that seem as a fault turn out to be an advantage in life. This episode was great - and finally a positive result as well. I can't wait for the movie!

[Mushishi Zoku Shou S2 Episode 10 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/12/mushishi-zoku-shou-2nd-season-episode-10.html)
>> ARTICLE
Well all that is left is to look forward to the movie coming out in the summer. All in all this has been a really good season as to be expected from this series. 
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me being picky, or do they use one same character model for every man and one for every girl? 
>> ARTICLE
It's just the art style of the manga artist. She has shown that she can design dynamic characters, so I believe that she keeps her Mushishi off-character designs simplistic in order to reflect simple Japanese pre-industry living.

The plum was well worth it, I guess.

Overall, this season had a complete different feel than the previous seasons. I'm not sure how I feel about Ginko having less of a role than before. Its been mostly stuff happening and Ginko being there to explain to the audience what is going on. 
>> ARTICLE
When Kanta's legs started flowering, I was concerned he was depressed with his fate and becoming suicidal. Happy that it ended differently. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode is almost a perfect metaphor for social media. I see this on occasion where people living within driving distance of each other would write in FB or some other place things like "I miss you." Go drive over there and have tea together, you lazy f*cks.

Thank you for this comment. I took another interpretation, but this one is literally perfect.

My thoughts as well. It was especially solidified when Ginko, even as un-meddlesome as he is, told them to just go visit one another.

*Man*, I was ready for the worst to happen I was on the edge of my seat. Glad everything worked out in the end
>> ARTICLE
Good episode as always. I'd like to see more Ginko action tho.
>> ARTICLE
This episode really reminded me of the yuri genre. Not only the fact that there were two females who are deeply emotionally attached to each other, but the societal pressure forcing them apart, as well as their own guilt regarding their relationship. In the end the solution to the girl's problems was right in front of everyone, but no one wanted to acknowledge it. Did anyone else get similar vibes, and do you think it's intentional?
>> ARTICLE
It did, but at the same time it was more of a little girl with a huge mother's complex instead of a romantic relationship. So the dad's solution made sense had the mushi not been there. At the end of the day, the girl still rejects others and is just as clingy as before though. Just goes to show that Ginko can't just come in for a few days and fix long-time issues other characters have, which is a good takeaway from this episode in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why, but this episode felt really heavy to me. I am not even sure why but it dragged me in completely.

I think you meant to post in the World Trigger thread.
>> ARTICLE
I think the best part of the episode was when she decided not to touch the life sparks at the end - knowing how much pain her family went through prior.

I wish we had more Ginko in these episodes though - it seems this season is really sparse.
>> ARTICLE
Why was she even tempted to go there *again*? I'm not sure, if I understood that part correctly
>> ARTICLE
I don't think she was tempted per say, I think the beautiful light just captivated her like it had prior. Only this time she had gone through the ordeal and knew the pain it had caused so instead she just enjoyed the moment.
>> ARTICLE
I always try to find links between mushishi and possible situations they could be applicable to in real life. This episode makes me think of being captivated in your own interest to a point of addiction. She loves the lights so much she forgets her family and herself while still being supported by her family through food and the doll. Also she is the only ones that can see the lights causing disconnect between her and her family.Parallels could be drawn between a drug addict still living at home causing problems for immediate family while ignorant of the fact because they to focused on themselves
It ends with the girl still drawn to the light but having set personal boundries so she can enjoy her interest while not losing herself.

This conclusion is a recurring theme in mushishi. In "Raindrops and Rainbows" parallels can be made with the father chasing the rainbow being a victim of addiction and the effect it has on his family and how addiction can be transferred to your children. The ending is also about appreciation of beauty but not letting it take hold of you.

In "Floral Delusion" the family that takes care of the blind deaf woman think she is so beautiful that they are addicted to her. Doing everything  they can to keep her alive at the cost of innocent people. Again the ending is 2 men standing and appreciating the beauty of the sakura tree(The girl is a symbol for the tree) and then moving on.

I think mushishi is trying to tell me that even though you enjoy your own interests please don't forget about the rest of live
>> ARTICLE
So Mushishi is the antithesis of otaku-ism?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i think so. Thats a great title for my post actually.
>> ARTICLE
I really like how the girl never really felt alone despite being visually presented that way. Would've been easy to portray her as isolated and lonely but instead the episode focused on how the love of her mother and sister kept her from feeling that way.
>> ARTICLE
This episode seemed to wrap up pretty quickly, also the mushi world just get more and more bizare. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode really felt like it went by so fast. It was another wonderful episode though. When in the well world how all the sounds were dull and echoed a bit was a nice touch, and watching Ginko fade away back to the other side was really well done animation. A lot of the transitions between scenes were wonderfully done as well.
>> ARTICLE
Feeling like you're alone even though you know you're not. Not being able to see or hear the people right in front of you. Being blinded by something unimportant while the people who care about you worry. I think a lot of people can relate to that.

Mushishi always makes me reflect on something about myself that I wouldn't have otherwise. As long as it keeps you thinking, it's accomplished its goal. A great series. I don't think I can ever dislike an episode of this show.

In a time where almost every other anime is about cramming as many events into one episode as possible, Mushishi takes one small event and lets you reflect on it. No world-saving or world-changing hero, just one man travelling around and helping people see what's important to them. It's so soothing.
>> ARTICLE
This story was great, and very surreal. Funny enough however it brings to   mind some of the things scientists are learning more about recently. Not   going to explain it, but maybe this episode was made more subconsciously   knowing of these things.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm very curious as to what things scientist are learning more about?

Lively discussion going on here ... Where is everyone[?](https://i.imgur.com/C4j3ovu.jpg)

How come every week there's a comment like this... Let people enjoy the show the way they want to. It is not something you debate or discuss with other people. Mushishi is an anime to reflect with yourself. At least that's my opinion. 

>> ARTICLE
Yup, I watch it every week, but I have nothing to say. The show also doesn't have that man watchers in the first place. The MAL stat has  8,128 watching. I imagine many people might wait until the season is over to watch as well.
>> ARTICLE
That might be the most shocked I've ever seen Ginko. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt like that would have been a good opportunity for him to have been smoking and just let his cigarette fall out of his mouth in shock.
>> ARTICLE
Today's episode really hit the spot. The story did a really good job of building up the recovery of Yuuta to make the final disappearance hit that much harder. The series itself has set up such a good rhythm of Ginko successfully helping those who follow his instructions that seeing his oversight lead to a complete failure came out of nowhere. Of course, he returns to his typical self after the fact, but the shock, confusion and fear that overcome him when Yuuta evaporated was such an unexpected and atypical expression that it's effect was almost harrowing. 

EDIT: Thinking over it, did Ginko Really fail? I wonder if knowing the full story in the beginning would have allowed him to approach the situation differently. 

As a side note I think that this particular case had Ginko Returning much more often than other long term cases than he has had before. 

>> ARTICLE
I think the point was that it was inevitable that this would happen to her son. The loss was inevitable, and it was only then about how you react to it. Even if Ginko knew the full story from the start, there was probably nothing he could have done. As he said, her child and the mushi fused at birth. They were basically one and the same.

I think the most difficult thing to accept when something terrible like this happens is that there really was nothing you could have done. That makes people feel very empty for a long time afterwards. Losing a loved one in tragic circumstances. "I couldn't save him" or "In his last moments I couldn't do anything for him" or "I wasn't there". That's what I think most of the regret, when it comes to loss, comes from.

Sometimes bad things happen that are inevitable, and it's just about how you deal with that fate, accept it and move on. There's no shounen plot armour in real life.
>> ARTICLE
I was kinda surprised the mom didn't blame Ginko at first, she just lost her son and I'm pretty sure she wasn't thinking rationally in that moment. That probably would have unsettled him even more.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was interesting. This episode offered an interesting contrast from when Ginko usually fails. Normally his treatments don't work because there is someone who is all "I don't need this damn mushi crap!" or "Ehh, that creepy white haired dude told me not to do the thing, but he hasn't been around for a while now, I guess I can do the thing." But this one was almost entirely on Ginko. 

As for the mother, I think the reason she wasn't mad either had to have been her acknowledgment that Ginko was honestly doing his best to help them, or that she knew secretly all along that Yuuta was living on borrowed time. She had already experienced his death twice (once when she drowned, once when he was born and they thought he was dad) so she could have just been prepared for it. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the biggest thing is that there is absolutely nothing he couldve done apparently.


>> ARTICLE
It was very refreshing to see an episode go in that direction. I never realized that I actually really wanted to see Ginko fail for once. He always appears to know everything that he needs to know in order to handle a situation. Especially last week when he managed to pull a girl out of *another dimension,* and it was even implied that other mushishi had failed before him. I did love that episode of course, but no one is that great. 

I really like the message in this episode though. The mother was given a few years with her son that she would otherwise have been without. It is sad to loose a loved one, but she should be grateful for the time that she had with him. He was given to her, and then he was returned. This applies to any death, but this narrative made it easy to make that rationalization. 
>> ARTICLE
Only let down that I had in this episode is that I expected a stronger emotional reaction from the mother when her son vanished. 
>> ARTICLE
Well. That's biggest downer Mushishi's ever ended on.
>> ARTICLE
I had a feeling thing wrapped up too neatly, and then the kid evaporates. 
>> ARTICLE
When the kid evaporates at 17:00, I was like, "Shit, the kid is dead unless if Ginko pulls a really fast move to save him." The kid didn't survive :( 

Still, the episode showed the power of the love that a mother/father (mother in this case) has over their children even if there is something wrong with the child. For example, there parents with children who had autism, but for many parents, autism or any other diagnosis only strengthens the bond between the parent and child.

Damn Ginko, you killed a kid. I guess that's how surgeons must feel when they wrongly diagnose someone, operate, and then that person dies. In both cases they leave the broken shell of a family afterwards. 
>> ARTICLE
That kid merged with the mushi before he was even born. He was eventually going to be part of that mushi's life cycle whether Ginko did anything or not. There's nothing Ginko could've done even if he knew this before hand. What he did is give the mother and son a normal life even just for a short while.
>> ARTICLE
> There's nothing Ginko could've done even if he knew this before hand.

We don't know that. Ginko has proven to be pretty resourceful given that he knows exactly which mushi is affecting someone, and to what extent.  
If the kid managed to live through several years of rains and floods, he'd live through more.

> What he did is give the mother and son a normal life even just for a short while.

They weren't unhappy before he had given them the brew. Sure, kid was a little cold and a hair's breadth from being a windowlicker intellectually, but they loved each other as parent and child. I'm sure she'd be happier with his kid still around, even if warped.
>> ARTICLE
The mushi gave the kid couple of more years to live, episodes like this shows the harmony of the mushi and humans and how mushi can help humans (I'm saying this now as I also just finished watching the Light Thread episode). 
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap. This season's been especially dark. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that was a very dark episode as opposed to the other episodes which were more sad. I think it was the fact that the dude was willing to kill his nephew, even after his nephew said that he didn't hate him, that I found most disturbing.

In for a penny, in for a pound. :\
>> ARTICLE
There was a lot going on in this episode, from the powerful visual metaphor of carrying vestiges of the deceased to Ginko letting Sousuke talk through his lingering hang-ups on the callous custom of abandoning the dead on the mountain and losing his father. Mushishi places its exploration of human drama above all else, and this is reflected in the manner in which Ginko conducts his investigations and the degree of his success in applying some form of remedy. When questioning Shigeru, Ginko abruptly stops before any inferences or accusations can be made on his behalf. Shigeru was seeking forgiveness not unlike what he denied his brother Shinobu. But Ginko is not here to deliver that, and Shigeru meets his demise when Sousuke denies him that release as well in their final confrontation.

Mud Grass bears the signature mark of beauty in aesthetic that we've come to expect in the show, but this story is relentlessly brutal. Not an offering I've come to expect of the show, but one that I'll certainly accept.

Three weeks until the final chapter. There is much to do to prepare myself for it.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is great that way in that some of the human drama might even be mundane if it isn't enhanced by the supernatural and given a twist to look at the drama from another angle. Mushishi reminds me of some of the better X-Files episodes in that regard, where the human drama is filtered through the mysterious and the supernatural. So even when the themes may not exactly be the most innovative, the way they're approached is unique thanks to the mushi interaction.
>> ARTICLE
Wow a fantastic - yet dark- episode. I was trying to play detective on how the weed was growing on the uncle towards the start; but once we got to the reveal of him murdering his brother out of rage I couldn't look away. It was an engrossing episode to watch, even if it was really dark as others have said.
>> ARTICLE
The question is was that grass silhouette the nephew's or the Uncle's? I am guessing the uncle's as his body probably washed up further up stream and the silhouette looked too big to be the nephew's.
>> ARTICLE
It's the uncle's. Ginko even mentioned at the end how he didn't even get to return to the mountains. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode gave me the heebie jeebies. Having uncontrollable warts/plants/parasites growing on me is one of my biggest fears tbh
>> ARTICLE
I was squirming the entire time. This episode was really uncomfortable for me as well.
>> ARTICLE
I love Ginko's thought process. He's very different from "shamans" portrayed in anime - he thinks like a doctor, a *scientist*, which is rather unusual in an universe where exist god-like creatures like mushi (everything from causing wind, through summoning rain, time manipulation, and ending in alternate fucking dimensions).

Oh, and *fuck me* that scene where murderer thinks he sees his brother's corpse apologizing to him... "Nii-san... So sorry...". Bloody hell, I haven't been so scared since Ghost Hunt episode with Urado.
>> ARTICLE
Argh, this episode made me so uncomfortable all over while I was watching it since I kept on getting goosebumps every few minutes (because they continue to show the seeds/warts on people).

Just when I thought I was sort of getting used to that they show us the uncle with the actual weed/dead grass growing on him. 

I watched every episode of Mushishi and had only been slightly discomforted by that one episode where there were mushi in the girl's eyes. But this one is on another level, more akin to nightmare fuel but it's still such a beautifully woven story.

Pretty sure this is the episode I'll skip if I re-watch Mushishi again though. orz I'm still getting goosebumps even after the show is over. I think the idea of growing those seeds/weeds on your body is just a really disturbing thought. LOL I think I'd rank this as the most disturbing episode of mushishi I've watched yet.
>> ARTICLE
The other one like this I remember was that one where the lady mushishi had the plant growing in her lungs or something, or the one where the couple gives birth to multiple spore kids. *shivers* Needless to say, I'm generally not in a hurry to rewatch those.

But yeah, combine the seeds and weeds with the dark subject matter, and it goes up there with the tree episode from earlier this year in creepiness (that tree one was practically Criminal Minds level but without the squick factor today's had).
>> ARTICLE
Oh god that spore one. I've still had nightmares about that one.
>> ARTICLE
The spore one wasn't too bad tbh, I didn't feel any discomfort for those since it's not really something akin to body horror in a way? (I actually don't remember the plant growing in the lady mushishi's lungs.. was it the same mushishi that acted as Ginko's mentor?)

But yeah oh man, I like how Ginko's basically pointing out the truth without saying it directly and not judge the uncle for it? He sort of leaves it out there that he knows what the uncle did, but he'll still try to help as a mushishi. 

Even now I'm still having goosebumps here and there, argh this is going to take a while to get rid of. I regret watching this last after all my usual Saturday animes haha.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, she might not have been a mushishi, been a while since I watched that one. And yeah, different people get squicked by different things, since the spore one got to me more than today's.

And yes, I loved how Ginko handled it. He knows and is willing to help, but at the end of the day it was up to the uncle to do what needed to be done and I think they both knew that. I was sad but not entirely surprised at how the uncle decided to handle it. :(

I have been contemplating whether or not to continue watching the Grisaia anime. I haven't read the VN, but people have been saying that it is really much better. I really enjoy shows with interesting characters and great development; also enjoyed this anime. However, idk if I have 50+ hours to do so. Is it worth it? I've never read a VN before and held off the anime since ep 4
>> ARTICLE
I'll always recommend people read visual novels, it's my current favorite medium. In my opinion, grisaia is an above average VN in its genre and worth reading, if you like the genre. 

Vndb and fuwanovel are the two sites to go to for info, as well as our own /r/visualnovels
>> ARTICLE
VNs are just like regular novels in that it's easy enough to put down and pick up later. It took me weeks to find the time to read the entire thing, and it was amazing all the way through. 
>> ARTICLE
as an anime only watcher, i'd say go read the VN.
The last few episodes have felt so rushed you don't get time to get attached to the character and sympathize with their backstory before everything is suddenly over and the show moves on to the next
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. It's particularly bad in this case, since one of the strengths of the VN is how much time it spends introducing and developing the characters before even hinting at their pasts. Not having that attachment really kills the "Holy shit" factor that *should* come when you understand why they behave the way they do. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't dropped any as of yet, however I'm thinking about putting UBW on hold. Just so I can binge watch it later on.
>> ARTICLE
You guys are really gonna have to try hard to avoid spoilers. There will be a massive explosion both at the end of this cour and partway through the next cour.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it will be a problem. However I'm currently playing through the Fate route in the VN. So most likely I'll continue with the UBW route after that so spoilers might not be an issue :p
>> ARTICLE
Oh god yes. And it's not like the internet isn't already a minefield of spoilers for fsn
>> ARTICLE
Similar for me. I'm putting it off until I have a chance to do the VN.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't dropped anything but then again I hardly picked up anything either, the only ones I'm watching right now are FSN, Parasyte, Log Horizon 2 and 2nd season of Chaika.

Nothing else looked interesting to be honest, and next season isn't looking better.
>> ARTICLE
you should add bahamut
>> ARTICLE
Does this show get better after episode 2 because the first two were a huge let down to me.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly it gets better, but not much better.
>> ARTICLE
I recommend you catch up on Psycho Pass so you can watch the currently airing second season. 
>> ARTICLE
I've dropped:

* **Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai** - watched two eps and it seemed pretty ...bland.

* **Denki-Gai no Honya-san** - the comedy was hit and miss, for me. I like the characters so I might pick this back up later.

* **Sanzoku no Musume Ronja** - dat CG. Too childish, as well.

* **Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete** - The first (or second?) episode was pretty interesting but when I dropped it, it just seemed like a generic harem with a bit of a twist. Not enough of a twist to keep watching, tbh.

* **World Trigger** - Dropped at first episode

* **Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji** - the dude in it is a fucking asshole

* **Gugure! Kokkuri-san** - meh. 

* **Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Crystal** - For whatever reason it's just not as interesting to me as the original. I've watched about 20 episodes of the original and I only managed 7 eps of this.

* **Girlfriend (Kari)** - Not what I expected, but I'll watch it at some point if it ends up being a *good* CGDCT series.

* **Orenchi no Furo Jijou** - uneventful

edit:

>***On hold***:

* **Shingeki no Bahamut Genesis** - Don't hate me! I want to marathon this when it's done.

...I dropped a *lot*, but I'm still watching 15 shows. c:
>> ARTICLE
The latest episode aside (because it was terrible), SMC is something I think mostly would only appeal to those who have that childhood nostalgia associated with the series. I'm really excited about it... most of the time... but the crappy CG doesn't endear it to anyone.
>> ARTICLE
If you fully intend to watch something after its airing, then you didn't really drop it. If anything, you put it on hold. Dropping an anime, at least the way its been defined in this community, means that you don't intend to watch it anymore, at least any time soon. 
>> ARTICLE
Aww, Kokkuri-san is pretty funny, though.
>> ARTICLE
If you plan to binge watch Shingeki no Bahamut, then you haven't dropped it. You've only put it on hold :p
>> ARTICLE
Does this show get better the first 2 episodes were meh at best for me

>> ARTICLE
IMO the plot gets better, but I'm no fan of the characters so, watch those that are out atm, and decide after that :p
>> ARTICLE
Its probably just not the type of show for you then. It's quality has been fairly consistent across the board, but you may be more drawn in as plot/character's develop. 
>> ARTICLE
True, although I hate using my on-hold list ~~because it's so full already~~ ; u ;
>> ARTICLE
I've only dropped Selector Spread WIXOSS. I think I just lost interest in the story, the characters annoyed me more than usual and I don't like Yuri.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the exact same thing until I saw episode 7. Things are getting serious, you should pick it up again.
>> ARTICLE
I *might* pick it up after it finishes airing but I doubt it. Tell me this, is there still Yuri in the show?
>> ARTICLE
Kinda, yeah. But it's a very relevant plot element.
>> ARTICLE
Selector Spread was at the point where I was ready to drop it, and then the latest episode happened. Guess I won't be dropping this show, shit got very real
>> ARTICLE
I usually drop series when i find myself literally falling asleep when watching them.

-Trinity Seven (i dislike generic harems so there's that too)

-Girlfriend (Zzzzzz)

-Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai (Zzzz)

-Donten ni Warau (Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz)

-HisCoool! SeHa Girls (never owned a console so..)

-Sanzoku no Musume Ronja (being cg helped too, and a little too childish)

-Orenchi no Furo Jijou (I did watch Love Stage and want none of that ever again thx)

On the edge: 

-World Trigger ([ayy lmao](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2lq1q8/toeiplsstop/))

-Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (wating for that sweet plot twist that will probably never come)
>> ARTICLE
Depending on what EP you dropped Donten ni Warau I'd recommend picking it back up, but that's just me, I enjoy historical fiction. Also i'm 3 episodes behind on Yuuki Yuuna, should i catch up?
>> ARTICLE
Last episode was quite interesting, i'm curious to know where they will take it from there.

And i dropped Donten ni Warau on the second episode, disliked the main characters.
>> ARTICLE
> Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (wating for that sweet plot twist that will probably never come)

Same director as *Angel Beats!*, *Humanity Has Declined*, and *Arpeggio of Blue Steel*, so shit'll probably get real in the last 3 episodes or so.

To be honest I could see how you think that. I think of the shows i'm watching right now it's probably one of the weakest. 

Still enjoy some moments out of each episode to keep watching though.
>> ARTICLE
I think episode 3 was the weakest episode, at that point i was like "hey, maybe this isnt so brilliant after all", but i kept watching and i loved the latest few episodes. But i could still see how it wouldnt appeal to everybody, so its up to what you think
>> ARTICLE
I beg to differ. Episode 6 was by far the most cliche and uninspired out of the bunch so far. I'm just sticking to it because it's KyoAni and I'm over halfway done anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Episode six had a pretty cliche plot point, but the humor was great that episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you have very good taste in cartoons.

SO THERE SUCK ON THAT!!!
>> ARTICLE
Not really dropped, more like put on hold but:

-**Nanatsu no Taizai**: Already read the manga and don't have much time to watch it

-**Sanzoku no Musume Ronja**: Haven't even finished the first episode, but wanted to give it a try since the plot sounded aight


-**Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso**: Read the manga as well, but don't know if I'm going to pick it up from the looks of the manga. Takes too long for MC to realize/admit his feels for the girl. And half of the time I feel like to him Piano>Girl


-**Yowamushi Pedal**: Read the manga heh


-**Kiseijuu**: Overall it's hard to watch anime where I already know what happens because of the manga. Unless the manga is like a 12/10

-**World Trigger**: First episode I dropped. Tried to read the manga and dropped that after 10 or so chapters.

Everything else is still a go!
>> ARTICLE
I say pick up kiseijuu again. The right now is very good.
>> ARTICLE
The last 3 minutes of the last episode was so good, that hype with the soundtrack was perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Say what you want about the pacing but the hype skills of the show blow me away
>> ARTICLE
I only legitimately dropped **Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji**. Not because I necessarily think it's bad, but the way Kyoya treats Erika, it makes me cringe and I can't get past the cringe.
>> ARTICLE
I have dropped:

* **Girlfriend (kari)**: I just can't do it. SoL with zero plot. Basically cute girls doing cute things. Not my thing. Dropped after Ep1.

* **Gundam: G no Reconguista**: The art style didn't go well with me. Even though I'm a big mecha fan, the characters just annoyed me way too much and it seems to be too kiddy for my liking. Dropped after halfway through episode 1.

* **Shingeki no Bahamaut**: This one is probably the most controversial. I've watched the first episode like 2 times trying to get into it, but for me I just can't. I don't like the characters at all. I'm not saying its bad, but I guess there are just some animes that won't click for everyone. Dropped after Ep 1.

* **Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete**: The animation for the series is just awful. The characters look so out of place that I just couldn't take it anymore and dropped it halfway through episode 2. The plot also seemed pretty boring to me and there was absolutely nothing interesting that stood out to make me look past the animation.   

* **World Trigger**: This one was one of the few shows that piqued my interest back when the fall 2014 season show list was announced. Definitely the biggest disappoint of the season for me. Everything just screamed boring to me and the monsters themselves are just laughable. Dropped after episode 2.  
>> ARTICLE
Funny, I accidentally watched the 4th episode of Bahamut first, had no idea what was going on, and loved it.
>> ARTICLE
I didnt really get hooked on the first episode of Bahamut either, you should consider watching at least episode 2. If you dont like it by then it just doesnt click for you
>> ARTICLE
Bahamaut I don't know if it is because of how stupid the MC looks or what but I could not get past episode 2 
>> ARTICLE
I totally understand! I didn't get into Shingeki until seriously an episode or two ago. Till then, I was just watching because I felt like I should like it, even though I didn't. I'm really on the edge with ushinawareta too - I keep thinking it might get better and have something interesting happen, but it keeps not happening... and I hate looking at the main girl and guy. I didn't even attempt on World Trigger after episode one. 

I am still watching Girlfriend though. I'll watch anything if it's cute enough, so cute girls doing cute things is perfect for me XD
>> ARTICLE
Shingeki didn't click with me until episode 3 or 4 when I realized how freaking smart and subtle the writing is (for an anime). It doesn't hold your hand and walk you through the show, characters develop quietly and their motivations, while obvious aren't explained to you the viewer but to the characters in the show. And everything the characters do make sense, Basically it's really well directed.
>> ARTICLE
Heh, yeah, and that's why I kept watching it. I'm still having trouble getting over Kaisar's pants though o__o
>> ARTICLE
Only thing I specifically remember dropping was World Trigger.

Checked out the first episode and it seemed really terrible.

Avoided Terra Formars since I heard about the censorship, but from the discussions it doesn't look like it'd be my cup of tea anyway.

Still watching 27 shows from the season. 80% of which are thoroughly amazing.
>> ARTICLE
>Still watching 27 shows from the season. 80% of which are thoroughly amazing  

22 shows this season make the cut as "amazing"? I can't fathom how one can be that easily amused.
>> ARTICLE
While 80% may have been a little bit of hyperbole (or might not have been since I'm excluding the 5 or so shows I fell behind on during the exam period)

* Akatsuki no Yona

* Amagi Brilliant Park

* Cross Ange

* Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken

* FS/N UBW

* Hitsugi no Chaika 2 

* Gugure! Kokkuri-san

* Parasyte

* Log Horizon 2

* Madan no Ou to Vanadis

* Nanatsu no Taizai

* Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji

* Ore Twintails ni Narimasu

* WIXOSS

* Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso

* Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis

* Shirobako

* Sword Art Online II

are all exceptional examples of their relevant genres and the shows that I haven't included because I fell behind on them were looking to be quite exceptional as well.
>> ARTICLE
There were a few shows I dropped for the reason of that I was watching a few more shows than I usually do this season, but I decided to pick most of them back up. Stuff like Okami Shoujo and Shingeki no Bahamut I stopped after the first episode, but came back to them around when the 3rd episodes came out. I also stopped watching Cross Ange at the first episode just cause I didn't think to much would happen that I would like, but people are saying it's cool so I'll probably catch up with it in a few days. Daitoshokan I have on hold cause I wanna read the VN first, which will take quite a while since I'll actually have to get somewhere in my Japanese studies.

Edit: Oh yeah, I forgot about Grisaia no Kajitsu. Although that's less so because it's kind of a rushed adaptation, but mostly because I finally finished the VN after a year so I kind of want to distance myself from it until the sequels get translated.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually really surprised with Ange. With the SEED guy involved and those ridiculous pilot suits, I was expecting a complete trainwreck. However, they manage to fit a ton into the 24 minutes they have per episode, the theme/concept is interesting, and the mecha are really cool with the motorcycle-style controls. 
>> ARTICLE
Drops: Inou-Battle, Madan no Ou to Vanadis, Garo, World Trigger  

* **Inou-Battle**: 3 episodes. Not my style of anime, I was hoping it'd be more than a school/slice of life since it had the seemly interesting powers, but it wasn't.
* **Madan no Ou to Vanadis**: 3 episodes. Too much random harem and ecchi, several questionable character decisions (like archer goes in the middle of the road to shoot enemy, prisioner with lots of freedon gets an army, general raids house alone with no protection and so on).
* **Garo the Animation**: 5 episodes. I liked the show, but it is so forgetable that I forget watching it, I don't know why. I may continue watching someday.
* **World Trigger**: 3 episodes. Kuga was too annoying with that =3= face, show didn't manage to pick my interest. 
>> ARTICLE
dropped grisaia no kajitsu because i had no clue what was happening
>> ARTICLE
The visual novel is better in the sense that it actually explains things in detail and it develops the character's backgrounds. The anime adaption cuts out 90% of all content in the VN, and that is the reason why for anime-only viewers, some things seem rushed and make no sense whatsoever.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped:
**World Trigger** : Completely unlikeable characters and just really genuinely stupid dialogue. I'm pretty new to anime but this is probably the worst show I've seen yet.

I haven't watched:
**Psycho Pass 2** : I'm just planning on marathoning it once the season is over because I'm lazy and can't watch it on Crunchyroll. Enjoyed the first season a lot though.

I'm thinking of dropping Grisia or whatever it's called because it honestly seems pretty lame and I've never played a VN before so I don't really understand the appeal. I just don't get it.

I'm tempted to drop Log Horizon 2 because it's been 1.5 seasons and literally nothing has happened. They have an interesting premise and good characters so I'll stick with it in the hopes that it lives up to the hype but right now it just seems so slow and flat. For as much as people rag on SAO at least the characters do things and give a shit about what's going on around them. Log Horizon 2 characters get stuck in a game and just sit around in a city. They don't try to get out or get stronger, they spend an entire season learning how to cook.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the need to point this out whenever people compare SAO/LH2. You may or may not be aware of it already. 

Log Horizon character's are **not** stuck in a game. They woke up in an alternate reality that mirrored the game. The game wasn't a VR like SAO, it was a keyboard and mouse game like we have today. 

Imagine going to bed and waking up in WoW/Everquest/insert fantasy MMO. It has no end to beat, and there is no obvious goal/way to go back to their reality. Its just an alternate world/reality that has some game like mechanics, but **not** an actual game (at least no more so than real life is). Personally I think stabilizing a society and proceeding to use your collective resources for the task is the best route which is exactly what they're doing.

That said this season (Log Horizon 2) has pacing and animation issues up the wazzu.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I don't think it's necessarily an important distinction, but thanks for the clarification. I don't think that the way they act given the circumstances is very reasonable (stuck in a game or in an alternate reality), particularly if they are supposed to be the "heroes" of a story and that's my biggest complaint. As a result I feel like the characters (after the set up) feel very flat. They feel (and act) a lot like NPCs would in a video game. Very static. They just don't act like human beings would given the situation. There is just no urgency.

That being said I've never seen/read the source material and maybe it's all a pacing issue with the anime. I'll stick with it and hope it becomes good. Honestly the main reason I would compare it to SAO is because everyone who talks about them compares them. SAO has it's own problems, but I've always liked that it takes a pretty real approach to human nature. People in stressful situations panic and make poor decisions. People who are trapped try to escape. People in a game act like they would in a game.
>> ARTICLE
Well its a major distinction because if they were trapped in a game there would be a way out and/or a chance of rescue. As it stands "a way out" of their reality is about as realistic a goal as flying to Alpha Centari is to us. Something that is theoretically possible, but we have neither the knowledge or resources to do it. It isn't like SAO where they have the clear goal "beat the game and be free". 
>> ARTICLE
**Denk gai no honya san**, comedy is hit or miss, bland overall. I was hoping for a character driven comedy, I got a comedy with caricatures. Dropped at episode 3

**Gogure kokkiri San** felt very sparse to me, it's pretty funny but doesn't have enough substance to hold me. Dropped at episode 3

**Ookami  shoujo** I hate every character they all are unnecessarily awful people. Plus every episode feels the exact same. Dropped at episode 4

**chaika** maybe it's because I I'm not marathoning this season but it doesn't have enough to hold my attention. Plus I never found chaika cute or endearing. It feels like I'm being retold things I already know every single episode.


Shows on the edge of being dropped:

**Inou Battle** needs to either get to the battle section of the show or add a heaping dose of Mirei.
>> ARTICLE
I just decided to drop UBW. Because Emiya is too generic of a MC.
>> ARTICLE
**Denki-gai no Honya-san** - bored  
**Grisaia no Kajitsu** - Not interested in the premise  
**Gugure! Kokkuri-san** - moe by itself isn't enough to interest me  
**HisCoool! SeHa Girls** - Seriously?  
**Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de** - Interesting premise, but it's a comedy/harem, it's not taking its own premise seriously at all so dropped.  
**Magic Kaito 1412** - Just boring.  
**Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji** - So this being what it is, I expect the girl to fall for the jerk guy. Except he's not just "a jerk", he's a blackmailing douchebag. Unless I get spoilered that she *doesn't* fall in love with him, this is staying dropped.  
**Sanzoku no Musume Ronja** - Just boring. I guess I had higher expectations from Studio Ghibli.   
**Terra Formars** - Ridiculous censorship ruins any little enjoyment that could be found from such a premise. The dumb decisions characters make didn't help either.  
**Trinity Seven** - Not interested in the premise.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped all of those shows except for Trinity Seven. Given the amount of other great shows we have this season, I can't justify spending time watching something I don't particularly like unless the season happens to be slow. 
>> ARTICLE
Grisaia no Kajitsu: The fan service is kind of dumb, to be honest (every girl getting a panty shot in the first episode kind of sets a tone), and I find none of the characters interesting. And it honestly made me kind of angry that they tried to argue that the girl who *pulled a knife on someone they just met* had traits that *totally* make up for it. Trying to cut strangers is kind of a dealbreaker in my opinion. Maybe there's something in her backstory that justifies it, but that doesn't change the fact that the way the characters reacted given the information they had at the time was just nuts.

Inou Battle: The promotional blurb made it sound interesting, but then the actual show came out...I guess I was expecting more from Trigger. The art style is kind of generic and the moments of beautiful Trigger animation are very sparse, and the otaku pandering is a bit much for me. Not that I mind a bit of otaku pandering, but it feels like the show doesn't offer anything else.
>> ARTICLE
> Otaku pandering?

Dropped
Sora no Method - Bored me to death after episode 3
Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso - The story and characters bore me
>> ARTICLE
Yes! Sora no Method = Boring
>> ARTICLE
* Gugure! Kokkuri-san - I don't know. Nichijou is one of my favorite shows but I guess this show's humor just didn't click with me.
* Akame ga Kill! - It would not do this show Justice to keep watching.
* Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete - With a start like that I was hoping this would turn out to be the next Steins;Gate. But I couldn't find anything particularly likable about the characters and the CGI bothers me.
* Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai - Did this show get anywhere yet? The humor is great at times but the original premise kinda got lost by the wayside and I'm behind by two episodes with little motivation to continue.
* Sora no Method - It's pretty, but also not much happening for the first 5 episodes.

Honorable mention:

* Karen Senki - My golly this show is terrible but I'm doggedly keeping up every week to see if it can get any worse.

^^Still ^^Watching: ^^UBW, ^^Amagi ^^Brilliant ^^Park, ^^Chaika, ^^Twintails, ^^Bahamut
>> ARTICLE
On the topic of Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai, it's a bit boring and really shouldn't have taken half the series to get into the plot and explain the whole "Shepard" thing. I'd only recommend picking it back up if you liked the MC as it completely revolves around him deciding if he wants to help people or just be a selfish dick at this point.
>> ARTICLE
Ok thanks! I'll wait until it finishes airing then before deciding if its worth picking back up.
>> ARTICLE
Your Lie in April. This is a show I wanna watch in one sitting when I'm in the mood for that type of anime. It's really really good IMO, sucks that I have to wait but whatever.
>> ARTICLE
Not called dropping m8, it's called putting a show on hold! 
>> ARTICLE
Never said I dropped it?
>> ARTICLE
I don't drop series but put them on-hold instead and here they're:

* Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai - Didn't seem to get any better and I fell behind on the episodes.
* Donten ni Warau - I don't like Historical settings.
* Girlfriend (Kari) - Looks terrible and I don't like CGDCT series.
* Gundam: G no Reconguista - I don't even know why I started this, it looks a bit old and I didn't understand anything at all.
* Ore, Twintails no Narimasu. - Boring as fuck.
* Sora no Method - CGDCT.
* Terra Formars - Horrible censoring, I'll pick up the manga instead.
* World Trigger - Toei butchering the series, the white haired guy was annoying.

EDIT: I'm gonna assume that most downvotes comes from saying that Twintails was boring as fuck. If you disagree with me then tell me what makes it enjoyable and I would be glad to discuss it.
>> ARTICLE
If you don't really like mecha shows and generally don't know about Tomino's shows, I say wait until a few more weeks to see if you the show got better for you. It started to pick up in this week's episode and it will probably get better as it goes on.

Kruzy! What are you *saying*?! >:|

Mind letting us know your reasons why? Just curious. :3

The animation is whacky. The story is stupid. The characters are annoying. 

You have a guy with a twintail fetish fighting a bunch of perverted monsters over and over. It felt like it's trying too hard to be funny and the whole subreddit treating it as the second coming of Jesus doesn't make it any better. Half-way through episode 4 I just said Fuck it, there is better shit to watch than this.

I dropped Denki Gai,Trinity Seven, Yuki Yuna is a Hero, mainly because I didn't start them and I've been busy as hell this semester so episodes have been piling up. I might pick them back up to binge them at the end of the season. Other shows I may be dropping might be Celestial Method, Girlfriend Beta, Grisaia, and Gugure! Kokkuri-san. I think I might power through those though. The first episodes had me a little hooked.
 
>> ARTICLE
Gugure! Kokkuri-san: Loved the first episode, but with the introduction of Inugami the show just stopped being funny.
>> ARTICLE
I'm waiting on a lot of episodes for shows like in search of the lost future, lord marksman, and many more 
>> ARTICLE
World Trigger: I really wanted to like it but the animation and awkward spaces drove me away. (episode 2)

Ookami Shoujo: Characters are unbearable and the girl is so stupid. (episode 3)

Akame ga Kill: I really wanted to like this one too but I hate [](/s "when they keep introducing characters only to kill them off. 3 of my favourites are dead and I just don't want to keep watching people die. Plus I really don't like Mine.") (episode 6)
>> ARTICLE
Having dropped any because I didn't pick up much to begin with. Picked up whatever was on CR minus whatever seemed to be getting bad reviews + Shingeki no Bahamut(Funi) and Fate/Stay(Hulu).

If I absolutely had to choose one to drop, it would either be Gugure (because it can be slow at times) or Sora no Method (because middle school drama).
>> ARTICLE
* Grisaia no Kajitsu - I'm reading the VN instead, it's a lot better
* Ookami Shoujo - The characters were either boring or unlikable
* Sora no Method - I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and all I got was little kids fighting about things that I didn't have enough knowledge about to care (i.e the saucer) 

>> ARTICLE

Fate. Looks amazing, but I feel like watching it would spoil me or something.

Terra Formars. I imagine the manga is decent, but everything is just so poorly executed; the pacing is incredibly slow, and I have no reason to care about any of these characters. There's just no exposition.
>> ARTICLE
* **Cross Ange**: Got bored of it after 4 episodes.

* **Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai**: After 5 episodes didn't really care about this show anymore.

* **Donten ni Warau**: Couldn't even finish the 3rd episode before dropping it.

* **Garo: Honoo no Kokuin**: Dropped after 3 episodes. Wanted to know more about the prince than the main.

* **Girlfriend (Kari)**: Grew tired of it after 2 episodes.

* **Grisaia no Kajitsu**: Everything just felt too rushed so decided to just finish VN and maybe giving this another try.

* **Madan no Ou to Vanadis**: For me pacing for this show felt awful. In 6 episodes it felt like the show just went everywhere.

* **Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji**: Not my cup of tea.

* **Sora no Method**: Wasn't enjoying this show.

* **Terra Formars**: Not the best story and censored episodes.

* **Trinity Seven**: OK for a harem anime but nothing else was good about it.

* **Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete**: Was interesting at first but then just fell off from there.

* **World Trigger**: =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3=

* **Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru**: OST was nice but it didn't interest me after 4 episodes.

World trigger. Seemed poop

Sora no method.  Got a few episodes saved, just never watched.

Akatsuki - idk.  I just havent gone back.

Dropped:

* Grisaia no Kajitsu, because I'm going to read the VN.

* Sora no Method, because I'm going to wait for it to end.

* Karen Senki, because it's shit.

* Cross Ange, because it's shit.
>> ARTICLE
I think saying "because it's shit" is kind of a cop-out. It'd be more informative to explain what made you decide it's shit. 
>> ARTICLE
Cross ange is pretty cringy but it gets better after 3-4 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
My group of friends that never watch currently airing shows are meeting up with me to watch Cross Ange every week, solely because it's just a train wreck. 

We enjoy watching it so much that i don't know if we're still making fun of it or if we actually like it now.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat...
>> ARTICLE
I'm prepared to be downvoted but I dropped fate stay night have no idea what's going on for real but I do intend too come back to it later after I finish some other shows 
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched Fate Zero? It will make more sense if you watch it before FSN :)
>> ARTICLE
Is Fate Zero the original ?
>> ARTICLE
No, but it was created as a prequel to FSN. It explains everything about the Holy Grail War and the motivations of some of the characters in FSN :)
>> ARTICLE
If you're interested in the world, I recommend picking up the visual novel. Unlimited Blade Works is the second route, so you're kind of supposed to know what's going on, and it's basically just eye-candy for us VN readers. The first route of the visual novel will explain the relevant mechanics of the Type-Moon universe, although there's plenty that it doesn't go over since they're more relevant in Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai, and others.
>> ARTICLE
**Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso-** Disliked the female lead and how aggressive/pushy she was. Also found it somewhat boring even though I enjoyed the music. 

**World Trigger-** hated the =3 face and the animation didn't leave much to be desired.

**Denki-Gai no Honya-san-** The comedy fell flat for me. Felt like the characters were trying too hard to be crude and it didn't seem fitting at all. 

**Girlfriend (Kari)-**  Cute girls doing cute things is simply not enough.

**Ore, Twintails no Narimasu-** Didn't find it funny which takes away its biggest strength. 

**Sora no method-** Not a fan of little kid drama. The start was also quite boring and uneventful. 


 
>> ARTICLE
> CGDCT 

Thank you ! Finally found someone who dropped Sora no Method. That show was literally a sleeping pill
>> ARTICLE
I'm putting Log Horizon on hold for the moment - I'm not a huge fan of the art and the story seems a bit jumbled and rushed (after 5 episodes)


>> ARTICLE
I'm also on the same boat as you. Fit me it just seems soooo boring. I find Akatsuki's not even an interesting character and the dialogue is so bland, repetitive and cliche. There's very little I find impressive about this series.
>> ARTICLE
The only show I've dropped with no intention of picking it up again later is **Karen Senki**. Unless you count **Akame ga Kill** since it's still airing from last season.

I'm waiting on more episodes to binge through for **Terra Formars**, **Selector Infected WIXOSS** and **Ronja the Robber's Daughter**.
>> ARTICLE
I feel pretty good, of 15 shows I only dropped 3. 

* Girlfriend: I was never that much into it, and dropped it in the first episode when that German/French girl started talking in that horrible horrible excuse for language. It's probably the shallowest reason I've ever had to drop an anime, but like I said, I was never that much into it so I would've probably dropped it for whatever other reason later on. 

* Inou Battle Wa Nichijou: Another one I was never that much into. Three episode rule, felt pretty generic and genuinely uninteresting. Dropped. 

*  Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai: This one was pretty much the same. Watched the first two episodes. Way too generic and uninteresting. Dropped. 

I also have Shirobako and Log Horizon 2 kinda sorta on hold (nothing especially wrong with them, I just don't feel like watching them right now).  

Other than that I'm really up to date with the rest of my list, so I'm happy. 
>> ARTICLE
Well at first I would have agreed with you about Inou Battle but what really sets it apart from the other generic harems is the MC.  Andou is a harem MC that is actually intelligent and knows what to say at the right times. 
>> ARTICLE
His only personality is that he is nice to the girls and helps them out when they are going through some hard times. Just like every harem MC.  Ohh and he's chuuni.   
>> ARTICLE
Can't say I really noticed it, man... To me he was pretty average. 
>> ARTICLE
It started of quite generic, but because I know that Trigger studios produced some great stuff before (Kill la Kill), I gave it a chance, and I feel like it's picking up pace. It's still not amazing, but I do enjoy watching it every week.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus Fuck, how many of these threads do we need?

Well, notable drops people hate me for:
Shirobako
Twintails
Inou Battle
Trinity Seven
>> ARTICLE
I also dropped Shiroback, but also tune in from time to time to check the episodes.

It's realistic in a sense where people fuck up and drop their issues on one another, but again it keeps the light tone and resolving them with an optimistic outlook.
>> ARTICLE
Grisaia no Kajitsu - I hated all of the characters except Michiru. i get the feeling i wouldn't like the VN either. 

Akame ga Kill -read the manga and it was a pretty meh shonen. The main characters die before I even get a chance to like them.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso - Kaori's eyes really bother me. But no, I'm gonna watch it later by marathoning it.

Terraformars - gonna marathon it later. 

Twintails - I only have so much time in the day and that's not enough time for twintails
>> ARTICLE
> Twintails - I only have so much time in the day and that's not enough time for twintails

I find your lack of attribute disturbing, give up sleep:)

D: Not enough time for twintails? There should always be enough time for twintails! XD

* Garo: Honoo no Kokuin: Just not interesting enough.
* Gugure! Kokkuri-san: Got bored the first 9 min cause I didn't like the girl and the "humor".
* Magic Kaito 1412: I thought the heists would be more interesting, also the characters are meh.
* Sora no Method: Nothing really happend the first episodes.
* Terra Formers: Characters were boring and nothing interesting was happening.

Dropped Denki-Gai because the comedy just did not work for me.

Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.
>> ARTICLE
And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

Good to know. [Those liars at MAL!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.

> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.
>> ARTICLE
Redline scraping by in photo finish.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.
>> ARTICLE
Well deserved.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.

Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites. 

Miyamori is love, Miyamori is life.

I'd love to see this updated after every season. Maybe this can be a sidebar addition or something. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

Surprised I've never heard of rainbow considering its so high up this list.

In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good

I loved all of it, really enjoyable

Though I knew about it, you're right, it's almost never talked about. I was surprised by its rank too.

Holy shit.

I feel like I need to watch this.

You should, it's pretty great.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

[](#yousaidsomethingdumb)

IIRC it was at 8.70~ after it ended. It dropped only by a little bit.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)

I see the merit in separating them, they're kind of hard to equate with series. But MAL doesn't separate 'em and you actually end up with a nice variety of both when you condense it like this so I thought it made sense!

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

From my quick scan it seems like I only got 30/100.

I don't believe the scores I gave them were that great anyways so I don't feel too bad about missing out on the rest of the top 100.

I would really like to revisit this chart once Season 2 of Shokugeki no Soma is animated by JC Staff. Autumn Election final 8 is, IMO, the strongest arc of the manga.

Yay for Slam Dunk making in to the top 100. Very first sports anime that I watched and enjoyed. I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, I dodnt even realize that lol

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

Angels Beats is always rated high for some reason :/. I liked it, but there are many others that are definitely better.

If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people. Maybe I just don't see it but can someone please tell me what is so good about this show cause I rated it a 7(and I think this may be overdoing it)and that is mainly due to the animation. The jokes can only be funny for so long and I didn't even find them that funny in the first place.

OPM is a really good show. But no way it should ever be above Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people don't agree with you on this as seen by the rank. It's not worth complaining over because you personally dislike it.

I'm not blankly complaining. I actually want to know what it is that makes people go nuts over the show and want to have pseudo discussion.

I don't understand why people like game of thrones but i'm not just going to complain about its imdb rank am i?

So this is clearly going over your head. I said I want to hear what other people are saying as to why it's so good. Do you not want to hear people's reasoning for their differing opinions?
>> ARTICLE
Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol
>> ARTICLE
It bothers me cause I have a friend that during the entire Fall season only talked about OPM and it was starting to piss me off.
>> ARTICLE
Lol, u prob wanted to stay off of /r/anime during the entire fall season then.

the guy probably wanted you to get the same enjoyment he experienced, I dont think he meant any harm. 

I think anyone would be pissed off if they experienced what you did with any show, not just OPM.
>> ARTICLE
I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.
>> ARTICLE
recommend a show of yours he hasnt watched, if he likes something you like, youll solve that problem lol.
>> ARTICLE
It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.
>> ARTICLE
True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.

Why do we need this thread posted every week?

I'm here quite a bit, usually I just see people complain, I think this is only the second time I've seen a consolidated list.

And it looks like episodes 11 and 12 of the first part of the split will be released as OVAs with the DVDs. A shame, but oh well. At least we'll be getting them at some point.

So far every episode this season has been amazing. Even surpassing the first. Hopefully it continues to the second half. 
>> ARTICLE
So is this S3 or S2 part 2 like Gin no Saji?

I believe it's S2 part 2 but I have no way of being sure.

I think this is a second cour to season 2? Seeing as Zoku Shou sits at 12 episodes right now.
>> ARTICLE
More Mushishi is always good, hopefully they'll adopt all of the manga which is amazing 
>> ARTICLE
I hope it's better than the first half. This season doesn't feel as mystical as the first season did.
>> ARTICLE
While I'm still enjoying the second season immensly, I must agree that most of my favorites are still in the first season. The biggest reason for me though that the first season has a leg up on the second is the soundtrack....I just really miss some of the first season tracks
>> ARTICLE
While I can see where you're coming from, I like the fact this season has focused a bit more on the everyday aspects of mushi affecting humans. Ginko isn't really a point of view character this time around, he just happens to show up at opportune times. The first season in comparison was all about Ginko and the mushi-shi.

It sort of reminds me of what happened with Snake in Metal Gear Solid 2. The first episode with the brewer stumbling into the mushi-shi meetup was much like Raiden meeting Snake. By taking the former protagonist out of the spotlight, they become that much more mysterious and legendary.

Awesome cast of characters, A vast world to explore, great villains and the best character development imo.
The anime ended in a good place where if togashi writes more manga it could open endless possiblities for the show,
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched it and are questioning it? Or have you not watched it?
>> ARTICLE
I have not watch it and was looking for an opinion about it.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because HxH on 2014 had the best year-run of episodes anime has ever seen, with the ending of the anime and especially the ending of the Chimera Ant Arc, best arc in anime history hands down.
>> ARTICLE
If you are in anyway remotely interested or not put off by action/adventures with strategic battles and high episodes counts, I'd say give it a go. In fact I'd say give it a go anyway. 

Hunter x Hunter is a show that starts off good and only gets better with every episode. It's has amazing characters (in particular its villains) that carry an incredible story. There's an over arching plot line but really its "the little detours" our protagonists go on that makes HxH really special. 

I won't tell you what it's actually about because I think it's one of those shows best experienced embarking on the journey from episode one knowing nothing at all. Just a tip though, the second arc (Yorknew city arc) will make you mind up to whether the show is for you or not so if you dont like that arc, there's probably no point watching the next hundred episodes. 

Hope that helped and you decide to watch it. It's not highly acclaimed and AotY contender for nothing.


>> ARTICLE
Thank you. As I am right now picking a new series to watch the ones that have caught my eyes were Legend of the Galactic Heroes or HxH.

Both are lengthy so I didn't want to comit to a large series if it wasn't good at all.

Thanks for the opinion bhvgcf!

You're welcome :) HxH is one of shows you just gotta share

edit: grammar yo
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching the show a few days ago. I'd say, at the very least watch through the Greed Island arc.  That was probably my 2nd favorite arc.  The Hunter Exam arc was my favorite.  But Greed Island finally starts to give you a taste of Gon's power.  It also has the best ED: "Reason".

The Chimera Ant arc is very, very different from the rest of the show, in my opinion, and dragged on for way too long. It ended extremely well though.

Overall, the show is great, the soundtrack is very good, and there are many cool characters.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. This is pretty much the exact opposite opinion of most fans. The Chimera Ant and Yorkshin arcs are overwhelmingly the most popular, and Greed Island and the Hunter Exam are generally the least popular.

If you really liked the Hunter Exam that much you might be interested in checking out the 1999 version of the show. While everything else may be up for debate, I think most would agree that arc was definitely better in the original.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Greed Island was by far the worst arc for me
>> ARTICLE
That's really interesting to me.

I really don't get why Yorknew is so beloved. I'd rank the Arena arc above that one. The Phantom Troupe had some interesting characters, but they were underutilized.  It revolved around Kurapika mostly, and Kurapika was honestly a pretty boring character to me, despite being voiced by my favorite seiyuu.

The way the Chimera Ant arc wrapped up was fantastic and really surprising to me...but it really changed the tone of the show for me, and it just wasn't fun for me for the first 20 or so episodes of the arc.
>> ARTICLE
YES! Everyone I've met loves the Yorknew arc, and while I wouldnt put it above Heavens Arena, it wasn't very fun. The only interesting parts were the auctions and the [Ep. 50-ish](/s "Kurapika vs. Uvogin fight.") Everything else was mediocre, but maybe that was because I had read up till the very beginning of Greed Island in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, 2011 Hisoka is the best thing to grace anime, without him what's the point?
>> ARTICLE
Greed Island was amazing. Currently on episode 114 (the narration-heavy episodes). So far the Chimera Ant Arc is my favorite. Initially I was put off by it's length and told myself that since it took up almost half the show, it better be pretty damn good. So far I haven't been disappointed. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude get off reddit. If you're on episode 114.. You must continue immediately.

Btw chimera ant arc is my favourite arc but I didnt really start to love it until the final 20 episodes, so if you love it already you're in for a wild ride mate.

I gave a quick scroll on the other comments, although I did not watch  Ping Pong yet, I feel confident enough to give my vote to Hunter X Hunter (2011), this revitalisation and also continuation really bought one of my favorite manga and anime series from my childhood back to life. Hisoka is still a creep perv though.
Honorable mention to Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season, one of the few "Sports" anime that is actually great, a step above Prince of Tennis in my opinion. Not sure if sports or battle anime though, the guys from KnB and PoT could easily be in a fighting genre anime with their powers.

On my personal list I wouldn't put on Parasyte since it still airing this doesn't count and would add silver spoon instead, but since this subreddit has such terrible taste nobody added on silver spoon. 
>> ARTICLE
You can add Silver Spoon yourself. 
>> ARTICLE
This is such a hard choice, but I have to go with No Game No Life. It is probably in my top 5 anime (yes, I do have shit taste). My other picks would be F/SN UBW, KLK, and Akame ga Kill. Hunter x Hunter is also fantastic. 
>> ARTICLE
Nagi no Asukara anyone? One of the best shows I've watched for sure and definitely my AOTY.
>> ARTICLE
Yes please! My top anime by far.
>> ARTICLE
Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu all the fucking way.
>> ARTICLE
Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-) will win.

It has 8.73 on MaL and 9.1 on IMBD and is by far one of my favorite anime...ever

Its an amazing anime but not popular enough

It's not surprising. Even though I liked it myself the characters didn't get much if any development. It was chuuni based slice of life with a *kiss* of romance.

Quite true, but even though there wasn't that much development, it was still a fun show to watch, though... it wasn't AOTY quality just yet. Typical KyoAni stuff is what it was.

I was desperately looking for it! Totally should be in.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely one of the best of the year.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, didn't even notice it wasn't in. It definitely should be here 

Edit: [](#mandom)
>> ARTICLE
Agreed! I would personally argue it's my favourite of the year, next to Nozaki-kun and WIXOSS.
>> ARTICLE
My top three are probably Barakamon, Ping Pong and Witch Craft Works. WIXOSS was unexpectedly good too, and Nozaki-kun was hilarious 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Ping Pong, but Witch Craft Works was a fun show as well. But I can't say it was among my favourites. It did have, by far, the best ED of 2014.
>> ARTICLE
You should try Ping Pong out. Especially if you've tried Yuasa's other works like The Tatami Galaxy and Mind Game. 
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is overrated, it was good but not that good.. that is my humble opinion at the very least.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, it has extremely well written characters, but almost everything else about the show is rather unremarkable. Or distracting like the art style and animation. The characters carry it to an 8.5  *at best* imho. Aoty for me is Parasyte; HxH had some great parts, but it also had terrible parts(overall probably close to an 8.5 as well). I cant even think of something to complain about Parasyte off the top of my head.
>> ARTICLE
If I were to complain about Parasyte it'd be something along the lines of the side characters being very one-dimensional and undeveloped, but all in all I agree, AOTY 2014.
>> ARTICLE
It's all up to the person if they like it or not, I've heard it's high on Character Development, which is what I want in anime.
>> ARTICLE
It did have impressive character development and the story was good but not even close to as good as people want to make it seem but it's pretty lackluster in the remaining areas, honestly I believe it to be the most overhyped series of 2014... not to say it's bad because it's definitely not.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone has their own tastes :) if everyone's tastes were the same it'd be boring.

Hands down, Hunter x Hunter was best. Mushishi is second for me.

Ok bye. No ones gonna miss you. 
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind that many people haven't seen Ping Pong, so it would still be understandable even if No Game No Life beat out Ping Pong.

They should have something to compensate for the dependency on having seen it.  It would be interesting if we could see votes and rankings for anime *after* controlling for what anime people had seen in addition to it.  My guess is that more people would pick No Game No Life over Ping Pong, but that if you *controlled for people who had seen both* it would be a lot closer.  That's just one of the demerits of these polls.

NGNL currently in second?

1. Space Dandy (Season 2)

2. Nisekoi
>> ARTICLE
2014 felt pretty lackluster for me at least, very few anime above an 8/10.  

That being said Ping Pong and Mushishi were easily the best, if I had to pick a third it would probably be WIXOSS, I just loved the shit out of that series even with all the things wrong with it (more so in the second season). Parasyte deserves a vote from me too but I have a thing against voting for/putting shows in a top list when they aren't complete.
>> ARTICLE
I vote Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso for #1 anime and Kaori for best character/chara development

>> ARTICLE
I have to agree. I don't know why he was complaining. 
>> ARTICLE
Although I do love HxH, I think other shows like Ping Pong, Haikyu, and Fate were the standouts this year. Personally I think Ping Pong is #1 because of how unique and well done it was. A truly incredible show following the best character development I have ever seen in 11 episodes.

I feel bad voting on this because there were so many shows that I didn't vote for simply because I haven't seen them yet.

There's a big difference between not voting for a show because I haven't seen it and not voting for one because it wasn't good enough, and this poll doesn't capture that.

That said, I fucking loved Kill La Kill and it looks like it might win, so yay.

Barakamon :(

Make sure to vote for it in the Wild Card!

5. Space Dandy, but I dunno if I should include it since I've only seen 2 episodes. I've loved what I've seen though. I'd go with Shingeki no Bahamut otherwise.

In my humble opinion these are the best anime of the year:

1. Kill La Kill

2. Parasyte

3. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso

4. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis

5. Zankyou no Terror
>> ARTICLE
One Piece?
>> ARTICLE
Add it to the wild card if you like, but remember that only the episodes from 2014 are included in this.
>> ARTICLE
Does that mean that *only* the HxH episodes from 2014 is what we are voting on as well? If that is the case perhaps you should mention it in the post, because it definitely solidifies my vote for Parasyte over it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. I just figured it would be common sense, wouldn't it? This is a poll for 2014.
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah i guess that does make sense, but few people on reddit(including myself) use their common sense lol. Anyways, I have a feeling most people would still vote for HxH based on their feelings of the anime *as a whole* instead of just the 2014 episodes even if you did edit the op for clarity.

How is NGNL higher than Parasyte and Kill la Kill? -_

While Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun was pretty good, I don't think it deserves to be top show of the year (as it currently is ranked). For me the only two choices were Mushi-shi and Your Lie in April.

Actually somebody else mentioned Barakamon, which I would also put in for the nomination.
>> ARTICLE
At the time of this comment, No Game No Life is just about taking the lead.


I will seethe quietly in rage if it manages to win.


Mushishi, Ping Pong, F/SN, HxH are all 'valid' winners in my eyes, Though personally I found Ping Pong to be such a stand out I really hope it makes it.

Yeah, but what I mean is that you shouldn't base it off of anything that happened in 2013 or earlier. Example: Naruto Shippuuden episodes 1-270 ish or wherever they started in 2014 don't count. Just the episodes from 2014 :)

Yuuki Yuuna is premiering on the 17th October while Ai Tenchi Muyo is premiering on the 6th October. Nothing on Donten ni Warau and Aikatsu 3 seems to be missing too but I can't find the MAL page.

It looks like seasons 1 and 2 are merged into the single Aikatsu page (and it shows the series as ongoing, so I imagine that encompasses S3 as well).

Most of these'll be out around 2am the following day for us, as usual.

Can you explain to me the time difference? Does the release time that we follow here on /r/anime the same time as Japan? For example, if the show in Japan shows at 8pm on Monday, in Australia would it show at 8pm as well(or the equivalent timezone difference)?

im calling it, grisaia for best anime this fall!
>> ARTICLE
And I would llike to challenge that claim with Nanatsu no Daizai as this seasons best shounen anime. If A-1 animates the fights as well as they did SAO, we are looking at a seriously strong contender against the "big 3" mark my words. This series needs more hype!
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't be that optimistic, the VN might be really good, but the adaption could be as bad as DEEN's fate/stay night.
>> ARTICLE
i know, but the common route was really good too, if they dont screw up that part ill be at least a bit satisfied
>> ARTICLE
The least we can hope for is some decent PLOT.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is, Fate/Stay Night wasn't just bad because DEEN messed it up by being over-the-top with it. It's also because the Fate route which they focused on the most is pretty bad. UBW and HF are the real meat of the game. Grisaia on the other hand will likely either just be the common route or common + Yumiko, both of which are fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
It will be Yumiko's route will it? I thought it might have been Amane's but that would be difficult to adapt.

There's actually a good chance it might be Amane's route seeing how a certain silver haired girl is in the promo art.

I have one question though, this is the first time I'm getting into the weekly watching of shows, and since I don't know much of these animes, can someone list the ones that are sequels to previous seasons? (besides Log Horizon and Psycho Pass which I'm looking forward to, and the Gundams which I don't really care for) 

I'd appreciate the help! :)

Most of the sequels should be marked by a _____ 2. WIXOSS is the only one I can think of that is an exception. Most things will be completely new.

Ai Tenchi Muyo is a reboot.

Hummingbird does the upcoming list a lot better:

http://hummingbird.me/anime/upcoming

In which way is this better?

because there is pics?

The point here was to give access to MAL page of shows organized per day of availability can Hummingbird do that?

[ANI](http://beta.anichart.net/fall) at least gives info about the show and you can organize them by next airing date.

Still not exactly telling you which day what will be... but already better...

Nope I really do not get your point in this context. You are free to prefer hummingbird for as much reason as you wish but it does not give what op gave us and so fail to do it better

I love how Gintama manages to make this list too.
>> ARTICLE
Not really surprising.  This is just for Gintama': Enchousen (2012).  Gintama (2006) Is rated 46 or something in popularity.  When people add shows to their MAL, they don't always take into consideration that additional seasons in MAL often get added as separate entries.

Really it's just because a lot of people who have watched a ton of Gintama still might not have made it that far. (I haven't yet)

Gintama makes every list.

Ashita no Joe is enough boxing for me. I really don't need more than one anime in my life for any given sport.
>> ARTICLE
I would think not a lot of anime watchers are into something like boxing. When you count over 100 episodes with all the series combined that adds to it also. Hajime no Ippo definitely one of my favorite series of all time though.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that's sort of the reason but I don't even like boxing and Hajime No Ippo is in my top 3 easily.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. I find myself watching a lot of sports anime when the only ones I follow are Cricket and to a lesser extent Football(Soccer)
>> ARTICLE
Definitely on my top list, but I feel a sort of dissonance when I tried watching an actual boxing match, it just didn't feel the same. The author and artist did something to Ippo to make the series spectacular.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because the manga and anime has to make every match insanely good, as intense as a boxing match can be, it's a battle shonen series afterall. Obviously only one in a thousand real pro matches can get close to it. Same with any sport.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Nodame Cantabile on this list. Just started season 1 and its so much fun.

They are both good and very music oriented.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the recommendations, I haven't yet seen Kids on the Slope, but I'll definitely watch that soon. As for Shigatsu, I am watching that as it airs, and while the music is great, the writing is a bit too melodramatic for me.

One day, [Sora No Woto](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To) will be on a list like this.  
[Until then...](http://i.imgur.com/bFYqoLb.gif)
>> ARTICLE
It might be too late for our trumpet girl as the anime's been out for quite a long time.
>> ARTICLE
Most likely never going to reach a decent scoring unless MAL somehow resets them (even so, it probably won't affect much of anything).

But for those wondering, Sora no Woto is a spectacular SoL series located in a very interesting post-apocalyptic setting. The show definitely has a very cute cast of characters, but it's not afraid to venture into a more heavy scene as the show progresses. Accompanied by the musical talents of Kalafina & Yuki Kajiura, the show has one of the best OSTs from a SoL. 

It is not at all a K-On clone like many have assumed it to be. The only drawback this show has is the fact that the world it takes place in is left devastatingly unexplored. I would've loved to learn more about the world this anime takes place in.

Give it a chance.

EDIT: A phrase.
>> ARTICLE
Nitpick: Sora no Woto's OST is by the unparalleled Ooshima Michiru (Xam'd, Tatami Galaxy, Zetsuen no Tempest). While I will disagree with you on the worth of the show as a whole, the soundtrack is a work of art. 
>> ARTICLE
Seems I've screwed up a little bit.

Perfectly fine if you don't hold it up as close to the candle as I do. Even if people don't agree with how great of a show it is, it's still a fine military SoL.
>> ARTICLE
Sold, added it to my plan to watch queue. Even though that means I still will probably never get to it but it's closer.

Also the statement about resetting the scores seems odd. Is there some reason that resetting the rates would bring the score up? Like was there a bunch of hatred for this show at one point and was given crap ratings. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not too sold on the idea that resetting the scores would bring up the score by much either (despite mentioning it). That's just the only solution I could see possibly working that would raise it's current rating. Sort of just threw the idea out there since the chances of MAL getting a score reset is unlikely

Then again, I'm not sure what the reason was for the initial dislike the show received when it had aired. I'm just assuming the general consensus now is that it isn't deserving of it's current low-ish score. And I agree with it. 

Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.
>> ARTICLE
>Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.

Pretty much this. haha. I don't know what could be done so that the scoring was meaningful. Just hope someone recommends and speaks out for those diamonds in the rough so you get a chance to experience them.
>> ARTICLE
Scoring will never be a useful tool for reviewing without some form of commentary to go along with it. All my scores on my MAL are only meant to be useful for myself.

Thankfully there are always a few reviews on MAL & other websites that give me a little bit more than just a score. 
>> ARTICLE
So mushishi, natsume book of friends, Kara no kyoukai, black butler, saint seiya, JoJo, hanamonogatari belong to "lesser known" list? What the actual fuck
>> ARTICLE
To be fair it's movie 8 of Kara no Kyoukai that's on here, the lesser known 8th movie that wasn't even as good as movie 6 IMO... but yeah, still a little odd.
>> ARTICLE
It's because many of them extra seasons.

To get to Book of Circus you have to watch two seasons (many put off by the second), Hanamonogatari three seasons and Nekomonogatari kuro and for Mushishi Zoku Shou you need to watch the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is a set of loosely connected histories. One could easily skip right to season 2

Similar case with monogatari, new seasons and films aren't all released in proper, chronological order
>> ARTICLE
Kaiji is brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
I watched part of it before, but it was too depressing and soul crushing for me that I dropped it.  Lately I've been toying with the idea of rewatching and then finishing it, but before I do, I'd like to ask something.  Does it have a happy/at least semi-happy ending?  If he ends up just being a slave or dying or something it won't feel like the watch was worth it at all for me... so I'd like to know beforehand not to watch it if there's a bad end.  I don't want any in depth spoils, just a yes or no @_@.
>> ARTICLE
> Does it have a happy/at least semi-happy ending?

It does, but you have to watch both seasons

Alright thanks, that's all I needed to know to re-add it to my queue. :>

Kudos to Cross Game for having the saddest first episode in a children anime.
>> ARTICLE
See: Kotoura-San
>> ARTICLE
Does Cross Game actually deliver instead of pussying out after two or three episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Please, dont think that cross game is anything like Kotoura-san. Its Adachi's most accessible and easy to watch/read series, and easily one of his best.

Adachi is the master of nostalgia high school sports, mixed in with somewhat opaque romance and usually a touch of tragedy. Its a brilliant mix, and hes been doing it for the better part of 30 years
>> ARTICLE
Comparing the two is an insult to Cross Game.
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
> in a children anime.

What. Did you just call an Adachi (possibly his best in many ways) series a kids show?
>> ARTICLE
What would you say is the target then? The anime basically aired during a time slot that was appopriate for a younger audience.
>> ARTICLE
its shounen sports that borders on sienen at times.

But adachi doesn't write your normal shounen sports ala slum dunk style, he has his own unique style
>> ARTICLE
It also frequently opened with a drawing song and displayed pictures submitted by viewers at the end of the episode. That means it is, at least in part, targeted towards kids.

...and that damn song is still stuck in my head

*booru futatsu tondekita~*...
>> ARTICLE
Let me tell you about what happened on Tuesday. I made one of the worst decisions of my life, concerning anime.

So, I had Cross Game on my PTW for a while now. Tuesday night, before I hit the hay sack, I decided to watch the first episode before going to bed, thought, "Might as well start it". 

I think you can guess what happened next...No sleep for me for 2 hours, stayed up watching 6 more episodes...Godammit...


>> ARTICLE
That's it?  I just watched through it for the second time and watched until 6AM and then got sick.
>> ARTICLE
Also has the [](/s "best confession.")

[](/s "Can I lie?") Cross Game is easily one of my favourite anime.

And suddendly a lot of good shows appear

Ahh yes, the anime hipster. I almost forgot about you guys.

LoGH, Initial D, Redline, Ashita No Joe, Mushishi... Damn those hipsters and their shows noone even heard about, right?



>> ARTICLE
I've legitimately never heard of any of those.
>> ARTICLE
Then you don't belong here.
>> ARTICLE
Then you legitimately never bother to search for good anime to watch
>> ARTICLE
Don't know why you're getting downvoted, but if I legitimately never heard of any of those, I'd've think I've struck the mother lode :>
>> ARTICLE
If you don't know them, you're either new to anime or not making an effort to find good anime.
>> ARTICLE
I've got casual anime friends and colleagues who watch a series solely by word of mouth, or on recommendation only. There's no sense in thinking negatively on people just because they've never heard of your favorite series xxx. It's like telling a guy off for not having watched The Sound Of Music and Citizen Kane before watching the the movies now showing in cinema.

Really, there's no other prerequisite to watching anime than watching anime. We're all fans here.
>> ARTICLE
No. Some are fans of what's popular. Others are anime fans and do try to know more about something they like.

I'm pretty sure most "anime fans" say they're fans but only care about watching what's popular, which is only a small fragment of what anime is.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, anime has much more depth than what's popular, but honestly, if people are enjoying themselves, then there's no harm to it. Popular shows are good for socializing and community, anyway. I feel that's a much stronger part of what we are than if we were to view anime as art, and it's where anime cons, doujins and even this sub draws strength from.

So it's only better for us if we were to be excellent to everybody here :)
>> ARTICLE
I can get either Galactic Heores or Redline , but Initial D and Ashita Joe?
woah, you're missing a lot then.
>> ARTICLE
Those are all really popular shows in Japan. For example, in many anime [Ashita no Joe spoilers](/s "when somebody dies or supposedly dies the screen turns black and white with the dead guy sitting there, smiling (see a certain character's death in Gurren Lagann. This is always a reference to a scene from [Ashita no Joe](http://i54.fastpic.ru/big/2013/0224/4b/fce7b32778c4cc79144c7ba4b6ec874b.jpg)").

Alright. I have a ton of anime on my list already, but you can never have too many. Haha

Sure, they've heard about them. But have they actually *watched* them?

A lot of sequels, as expected. Since only the ones that liked the first season would pick up the second too.

Seeing a lot of great shows on here, like the Aria series, Gin no Saji and Chihayafuru.

Chihayafuru made both lists! S1 on other the other one and S2 here! It's such a great show and should get more attention so we can get a S3

Utena is unpopular, I think I've officially given up on the anime community. 
>> ARTICLE
Granted, its REALLY FUCKING OLD. Then again, so too is Sailor Moon and DBZ...
>> ARTICLE
> ...its REALLY FUCKING OLD.

Utena is from 1996.  That might be old, but not 'REALLY FUCKING OLD'.  Talk to me about 'REALLY FUCKING OLD' when we're discussing shows from the 60s and 70s, you babby.  :P
>> ARTICLE
For me, that's pretty old in terms of Animu. 

Then again, I like things like Rose of Versailles and Candy Candy, so yes, I can talk about REALLY FUCKING OLD if you want :3
>> ARTICLE
Growing up back on the old anime forums and geocities (damn I feel old) all people talked about was Utena and then I finally saw it around 2001-2 and I understood why. It's a shame that classic deconstruction series like this are not well known but everyone knowns Evangelion (It's my favourite series but it really is kind of over rated). 
>> ARTICLE
I think they're both iconic and should be studied, but shoujo, for better or for worse, has always been overlooked in terms of actual influence and interest.
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely agree with that regard but Shoujo has had quite the effect overall on mainstream anime and has also resisted the changes of mainstream anime as well. 
>> ARTICLE
It has, but its also a lot less popular in absolute terms, for better or for worse. 

(I mean my favorite "old time" series are things like Rose of Versailles, so you're preaching to the choir here :P)

But yes, there are a ton of really iconic series.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely, we need to try and raise awareness! At least if only so people can see how much affect shjo has on anime period. 

And I feel like a terrible shjo fan because I never saw rose of versaille, and I've always wanted to. :(
>> ARTICLE
It's on Crunchyroll! Go check it out, FANTASTIC series. 
>> ARTICLE
It's in my queue, I actually found it today. I'll check it out once I'm done with Saint Seiya Omega (I tend to only watch 3-4 series at a time, any more and I lose interest) which should be tomorrow since I'm marathoning the series. . 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Utena was ever on Toonami/Cartoon Network, though. Could very well be wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
First time I saw anything Utena related was the movie back in 2002 on the International Channel, I actually didn't see the anime series until a few years after that when Anime Network aired it. 
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't, but it was one of the first major series imported to the US en masse 
>> ARTICLE
That's probably why it's not all that popular, though. Most people I know who watched anime when they were younger watched it on Toonami, including myself. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe? I know some kids like me were a bit proactive and started searching for imports when we were younger though.
>> ARTICLE
Utena is really old, and quite niche. :(
>> ARTICLE
I mean I know shjo is niche in the west but when it first came out Utena was big over here, I think it's more the culture has changed and we can only remember so many "classics" and they're invariably marketed towards the largest fanbase, boys. 
>> ARTICLE
This shows that not enough people have accepted Yuasa as their lord and savior.

Also [Texhnolyze](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26/Texhnolyze) is probably grossly underrated but I haven't finished it yet to say for sure.

You just have to get through the first 9 episodes haha.

There's some good stuff on this list. Shoutout to Kuuchuu Buranko at the very bottom!

I might've been tempted to strip out sequels entirely. But it's your list, you did the work, so nice one.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I thought about only putting the first entry of a series I'd encounter that fits the criteria at first, but there aren't that many in the end, and I still find it interesting when compared with the attach rate. Major's attach rate is absurdly high compared to Mushishi for instance, despite the latter being in the top 30.
>> ARTICLE
I think it would have been nice to free up space for others in the list by collapsing sequels to one entry. Attach rates for diff seasons could be in a note column or something
>> ARTICLE
I am in the crowd of "Mushishi is great ... I never watched the second or third season".

It's too episodic / "too much of the same" and I never had enough interest to keep watching it after the first series.
>> ARTICLE
I always find it funny how I see people say "Mushishi is great but you should take it slow" while I'm sitting over here marathoning it every time I watch it. I specifically waited until Zoku Shou was finished airing so I could watch it all at once. Now I just have to wait for the movie.

There is no 3rd season by the way.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I thought I saw 3 entries in MAL on it, shrug.
>> ARTICLE
The second season was split into 2 cours + a movie, iirc. 
>> ARTICLE
> Kuuchuu Buranko

This sounds very interesting, is it any good? I might give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
I don't have much to add to SSVD's answer, but yeah, while it isn't everyone's cup of tea -- which is fine -- it's a fascinating show which is definitely worth a shot.
>> ARTICLE
One of my personal favorites. It's more psychedelic and trippy than SHAFT shows, but its a show about psychiatry, so it's very fitting. Highly recommended if you like dramas. The show I think it's closest to in initial impressions/structure is The Tatami Galaxy.

It is episodic in nature, but every episode runs concurrently over the same 2 week time period, so they all interweave in subtle ways. Each one is about Irabu helping people with their mental problems, and it's consistently funny and touching.

In terms of production values, Irabu's VA lifts the show up 10 points alone, OP/ED are both great, music's wonderful, the art is excellent, and I hope you like live-action elements in anime, since this goes full Aku no Hana every now and then, (probably to cover up that there's very little animation in the thing).

I'd call it a 9, as it might have benefited a little more from a stronger overarching narrative, but the individual arcs are all fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds awesome, I'll check it out later, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I really need to get to Ping Pong. :3

And maybe I can entice people to watch Chihayafuru based [on the OP?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOioO61in8I)

I too need to get on watching Ping Pong and yes Chihayafuru is amazing! S3 please!!

Ping Pong is fucking amazing!

You really need to get to Ping Pong. And kudos on linking Chihayafuru, love that show to death. Season 3 when?!

Chihayafuru is my jam, watched both seasons in one week. The sports anime with an unlikely sport. But now we wait...
>> ARTICLE
> Chihayafuru is my jam, watched both seasons in one week.

Shit, I thought I was the only person who did that. Spent a week watching both seasons, and when I was on my computer and not watching Chihayafuru the OP was playing in the background, because the OP is glorious.

Dude.  Chihayafuru is one of my favorite series of all time.  But still, when I try to imagine professional caruta in real life, I imagine something like [this...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAzIqJpX7i8)

You aren't alone. We can be casuals together!
>> ARTICLE
Didn't expect to see MSG: The 08th MS Team on this list, but I imagine it fell under the radar due to being a 90's OVA for one reason or another. I for one think of it as a gem. Not to mention, Shiro and Aina had such a sweet romance.
>> ARTICLE
Just counted, and I haven't watched 54 of these. But seriously, we need to let others know [Patema Inverted](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12477). It's an awesome anime to watch.
>> ARTICLE
It is a cruel world that would ignore the majesty of Whisper of the Heart. A very cruel, world. 

Looking over the list it's funny to see how many 'must watch' anime are on it. Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Revolutionary Girl Utena, MSG: 8th Team, Conan, Dennou Coil, and Maison Ikkoku all stand out as being among the most critically lauded shows in anime history. 

None of which I've yet to finish, mind you. Which says an awful lot about me. 
>> ARTICLE
Some of them are pretty daunting, I should've included the number of episodes as well. The only one I've seen that you listed here is Dennou Coil, which was very good. Reminded me of Steins;Gate in its pace.
>> ARTICLE
And the colors! The color palettes are kinda pale and faint, almost drab. Kinda overexposed. 

Pls, no S;G spoilers, I'm just at episode 10.

>> ARTICLE
Lol?
>> ARTICLE
I'm thrashing through LotGH at the moment. It's absolutely enthralling. Really can't stress how little it matters that it was made in 1993. It deals with things I've never seen another anime deal with, and is overwhelmingly compelling to watch one episode to the next. The only anime I can compare it to, in terms of how high a regard it holds its themes, is Monster. They're about completely different things, but the essence of how they deal with the real issues surrounding humanity is similar.
>> ARTICLE
> Revolutionary Girl Utena

What is wrong with you people? This is one of the greatest anime ever made. 


>> ARTICLE
> What is wrong with you people? 

Nothing *wrong* with these people per say... but you forget that the majority of people on /r/anime and MAL are basically the same age as Utena.  If it's 15 years or older, most people haven't seen it unless it's mainstream.

Also, most people here are guys, and won't necessarily get into things ostensibly for girls.
>> ARTICLE
I was being sort of facetious. The thing is anime is way more popular as a whole than when I was getting into the scene. There are way more of us now than there were 15 years ago. 

Anyway thanks for making me feel weird. /s It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.
>> ARTICLE
> It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.

I always found this funny.  Watching anime in general is already a niche that's, at best, looked at strangely by the general population.  The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing.  Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).
>> ARTICLE

Funnily enough even in its home country. 

> The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing. Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).

I think it goes without saying that our society is geared against folks that don't identify with the general norm. I read manga/watch anime for the art, the story and the characters but despite having all of those I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(
>> ARTICLE
> Funnily enough even in its home country.

Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

> I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(

Sure you are, do what you want!  I watch crap for kids and adults; crap for guys and girls, it doesn't matter.  Quality and artistry doesn't know gender.  Let the haters hate.  Besides, this is the anonymity of the internet too, so:

1) Who cares what other people have to say.

2) You'll find a lot more like minded people here than you would have assumed.
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

Oh definitely, tho there is rampant homophobia as well it just manifests differently (like being gay is considered a phase that kids go through in Japanese culture). But the stigma in Japan for anime in general is a lot like the stigma for watching cartoons over here in that its still seen as something primarily for children.

I wasn't quite saying that I personally would change what I like, I've been watching what I like for damn near over a decade and a half now, just critiquing the dominant view. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm at episode 12 from 39 and to me it seems like the plot is just starting, while Ping Pong, the masterpiece of anime, already finished an episode ago. 

I'm definitely having fun up to this point and it'll probably blow my mind by the time I'm finished, but the show is taking it's time. And shojo's of the 90's look weird. NGE looks way better.
>> ARTICLE
You're almost at one of the best arcs ever made for any anime period, the Black Rose arc, look forward to it. 

Trust me, by the time you finish this, you'll be a believer. Just be glad you didn't get the movie four years before the series like those of us way back when. :p Also shjo, at least in manga, has not really changed since the late 80s except males have become skinnier, it's only in the anime adaptations where utena eschews a more shnen look for keeping the shjo flowery approach. 

NGE is my favourite anime ever, and yes it looks good, but so does Utena in a different way. 
>> ARTICLE
Just stumpled upon this thread and by now I have finished Utena. Still don't relaly know what to think. It definitely well done, but at face value it does so little and I am not all that good with symbolism. It had some really hilarious stuff. That's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck is wrong with you?
>> ARTICLE
Well rheumatism, arthritis, demen-wait what was I talking about again? /s
>> ARTICLE
It can be pretty painful to watch. I mean how many times must I see the stair climbing montage? Only to be outdone by the elevator taking montage. 

Also, plenty of times throughout the show I wanted to scream "What the hell are you trying to tell me?" So it can be a frustrating show for people that are driven by plot as opposed to themes and symbolism.  
>> ARTICLE
Man the stair-climbing/elevator-taking are when things get real in an episode, they serve an important point. Repetition is a huge focus for reinforcing themes. Remember Utena is about growing up, the stair-climbing, elevator-taking are symbolic of going from lower to higher, that is becoming an adult. 
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea how Utena is so low (comparatively) in terms of ranking, both popularity and score-wise. How have more people not watched this show? I've met people who've watched a ton of anime who've never even heard of it. Is it because it's a magical girl series (kinda)? Is it because Utena's a girl? Are most people really that unwilling to watch anime that's more than seven years old? People on here talk about Penguindrum fairly frequently, and obviously a lot of attention is on Ikuhara with Yuri Kuma Arashi. I wish that there'd be more discussion about Utena beyond it being mentioned as a classic because it has so much depth to it, it easily deserves threads on the level of, say, the NGE rewatch. 
>> ARTICLE
I got bored after 14 episodes and quit watching. I can't relate to anyone in the show they are all so backwards.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly there actually were rewatch threads on here for Utena a few months ago. But only like two people posted in them.
>> ARTICLE
It's odd because all throughout the late 90s - early 2000s Utena was hailed as a masterpiece even if half the people watching it didn't understand that it was largely a coming-of-age story. 

But really Utena is to shjo what NGE is to mainstream anime, remembering that shjo while influential on the mainstream is largely resistant to the mainstream as well, an endpoint to a bleak era after the economic downturn of the 80s-90s. It was a clean break between the themes prevalent before and after. I think there are enough of us around to create a decent discussion thread. :p

Is the 'Aria' series worth pursuing? 
>> ARTICLE
it is my second favorite series behind hunter x hunter
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. I watch very little slice of life because I often find the majority of them to be mostly pointless apart from them making you feel comfy. I noticed that the Aria trilogy was quite often referred to as best SOL out there so I decided to give it a shot and it turned out to be one of my favourite shows.

 It is a coming of age story what gets better with each series and ends perfectly in my opinion. What made me love this series so much was how the main character Akari viewed and interpreted the world around her in such a beautiful way that I couldn't help but feel warm and fuzzy inside. 

The OST is also great at making you feel relaxed and comfy, here is one of my favourite songs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1hGtQxHvs 

I can't recommend this series enough, the only negative I can think of is that I found the cat's voice a little annoying initially but like the series he grew on me very quickly.
>> ARTICLE
It's an episodic slice of life anime about rowing gondolas on terraformed Mars. There is an overall linear progression, but it's mostly about the development of its characters. There's no denying it's hard to get into for most people, but it's charming and soothing, and it ends on a conclusive high note.

I would say that a large amount of the sequels could have been taken out, as they typically have viewers that decided to watch based on the first season, giving them unnaturally higher ratings. 

Edit: You may also want to think about removing those with scorers around the 12,000 mark and above, because quite a few of them are well known (At least on reddit (as it seems to me))



>> ARTICLE
Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of sports shows... including the best one: One Outs!!!!

If you like mind game stuff, One Outs, Kaiji, and Akagi (which is a bit too low to make this list) should be at the top of your list.

Arpeggio of Blue Steel is a really underrated anime imo

I'm on Kaiba episode 10 right now, and it is quickly becoming one of my all time favorites.

A bit surprised to see 8th MS team and Unicorn on here. Even more surprised to see anything Jojo or Gintama on here.

And Inuyasha TFA is on Toonami, but it's still on the list. That surprised me, though I haven't been watching it on Toonami, so I guess if other people are like me, there might not be much of an audience at that time slot

after seeing slayers next and gintama on this list, it wouldn't suprise me to see dragon ball and shaman king

The Twelve Kingdoms is probably my favorite anime of all. I always get a happy feeling when people watch it and fall in love with it like I did.

I'm honestly surprised some of these aren't more popular. Not in the "damn it all these plebs have shit taste" way but in the "Huh. That's interesting" way. I've heard about, and watched, quite a few of these. Maybe I've watched more than I realized... I thought i was still pretty entry-level.

Gundam UC, Love Live! second season, and 8th MS Team stuck out to me. I love those and thought they were pretty well known. Along with the second season of Space Dandy.

> Top 100 Madhouse anime according to MAL

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
Big Windup! is one of my favorite sports anime so I'm glad its getting the recognition it deserves
>> ARTICLE
Dennou Coil is a masterpiece. It really is just about perfect. 

It has an interesting and well thought out world. Characters are likeable and relatable. The story has a well pacing, is interesting and actual works out. The soundtrack, while nothing really special, is used very well, always fits and underlines the atmosphere, but also knows when to be silent.

But I'm sad X, Arjuna or Giant Killing didn't make it. At least X could've managed to get it. Clamp manga animated by Madhouse? It should've been popular. Arjuna has Yoko Kanno's best work, but a weird story. I like it.

**BUT** how in fuck did Inu Yasha get in there? Judging by the 120 episodes I watched before droping it, it isn't a contender for top 100.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen InuYasha, but this is the second season. To get there you must have already went through 167 episodes, and judging by the description, it seems to be much faster paced (covering 21 chapters in 26 episodes compared to 35 in 167, from my understanding), which must contribute a lot to its high rating.

I was disappointed not seeing Cross Game in the top 100 earlier now i feel better
>> ARTICLE
There is quite some stuff on that list that I adore(Cross Game, Chihayafuru, Kaiji, Gin no Saji, ...) but it makes sense.

I got to most of those through checking the Top MAL scores and not because they got recommended or written about.

But there are also a lot of em that seem to sit on my ptw list forever, since there is always something "more important" to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen quite a few of these shows mentioned here but haven't watched them yet, I should really get around to that. The attach rate is interesting, most shows are below .6. It would be interesting if MAL included that stat itself so we could compare shows by what percent of  people dropped/finished it more easily. 
>> ARTICLE
Considering Mushishi, Utena, Tatami Galaxy and Chihayafuru are some of my all time favorite anime I find this list depressing. Watch these shows damnit! Especially Chihayafuru because I want a season three!

As a Hajime no Ippo fan, Its nice that its on the list , but it also means that its apparently "lesser known." :/

if you look at all their other works, it's all shitty original scripts other than the one which is a doujin of another light novel, and funny enough once that franchise tried to do a sequel it exposed its weak structure as it has nothing to copy from.

Having never seen Fate/Stay before, do I need to watch previous seasons to follow it ? Or should I watch it anyway.
>> ARTICLE
No! Don't watch the anime. What you need to do is read the VN. At least finish Saber's route and then watch Unlimited Blade Works airing this season.
>> ARTICLE
No, this is actually a good starting point. The only thing that would be better is if you have the time, read the first route of the Visual Novel. I think it takes about 12 hours. 
>> ARTICLE
But the VN was never translated...
>> ARTICLE
Yes it was. Just not professionally. 
>> ARTICLE
What!? How? When?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not 100% of the details but it's available at fuwanovel I believe. 
>> ARTICLE
What about Fate/Zero? Should I watch that before Fate/Stay or after?
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero before Fate/Stay Night is ~~like~~ worse than Star Wars Episodes I-III before the original trilogy.
>> ARTICLE
After. The original way was the Visual Novel (FSN) then there was the Light novel (FZ). Ufotable made Fate/Zero with the assumption that people saw the original FSN anime, which is considered mediocre. That covered the Fate route of the FSN visual novel. FSN as a VN has three routes, Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heaven's Feel. Like I said, Fate was the original anime (by studio Deen) and is considered mediocre. So the best way to do it would probably be:

>Fate Stay Night Visual: Fate route

>Fate stay night Anime by Ufotable: First Unlimited Blade Works then Heaven's Feel

>Fate/Zero anime

Then if you want you can watch the Deen FSN anime.
>> ARTICLE
I find the general consensus to be that you should watch F/SN before F/Z since it spoils less compared to the other way around and that was the order in which they were written.

In my opinion though, a spoiled F/Z ruins suspense (the conclusion of a few things are already determined) while a spoiled F/SN has its asspulls justified (the background of some characters). Of course, I'm not saying this is the case for all the spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's what I meant. He asked if he should watch F/Z before or after F/SN and I said after :p
>> ARTICLE
What my comment was saying was that watching F/Z before has its merits as well, though. Possibly better ones, too, but I can't be the judge of that.

Oh. My bad, I misread your comment.

I know it isn't popular, but I can't wait to watch Magic Kaito!

Yeah, no offense, but you're the first person to seem excited for it. What's it all about? I didn't really look into it that much.

Well it's because I'm a huge Detective Conan fan. And in the series, Kaito Kid makes a guest appearance (same mangaka).

Parasyte and Psycho-Pass 2 are big ones.

Tatsunoko Production. I haven't seen anything they've done I don't think

Okay, all of my worries have just vanished in a single gif.

Ryo-Chimo is an extremely talented animator and director, one of the reasons why **Hana no Uta** was such a great series.

The studio's more recent works also include **Ping Pong** (with Yuasa's style) and **Gatchaman CROWDS**. All fantastic series from the past year.
>> ARTICLE
Tatsunoko isn't some new studio - they've been around since the 60s. Production IG actually was basically created by Tatsunoko producers with the staff that had made the anime [Zillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zillion_(anime%29) for Tatsunoko, and Production IG does own around 11% of Tatsunoko.

Like other big anime studios that have made tons of anime (of which a fair amount is children's anime), their quality of animation in Tatsunoko works can be hit-or-miss. It really depends on the series. I would imagine that Psycho-Pass 2 will get enough resources to be a well-animated series.
>> ARTICLE
This is cool. Thanks for putting this together.

Going to be watching Parasyte, Wixoss, Log Horizon, Fate/Stay, Psycho Pass and will probably check out Twintail since I was real into Kore wa Zombie and this sounds kind of similar.

No problem! I'm going to try out a lot.

Has anyone heard anything good or bad about the new Gundam Series? Gundam SEED is probably my favorite anime, having another Gundam series just as good (00 was great, but not better than SEED IMO)  would be awesome! 
>> ARTICLE
> Has anyone heard anything good or bad about the new Gundam Series? 

Well, it is an original story (like other Gundam shows) and it hasn't aired yet... so no one can really say whether it will be good or bad. It is being written & directed by Tomino Yoshiyuki, the original creator of Gundam.
>> ARTICLE
Yea very true, sometimes people hype animes up. I don't pay much attention to any kind of hype at all so I wouldn't know if anyone had an early presumption about how the show will be.
>> ARTICLE
From what I've heard it is the same director as First Gundam (or Gundam 0079), who also did most of the Universal Century series, along with Turn A, and some of the same art-team that did Eureka 7 (even though that was a Bones project). So it looks like the team should be good enough for this series.

Bahamut looks nice but I don't expect it'll have much of a story.

Fate/stay night, Terra Formars, Amagi Brilliant Park, Legend of Korra Season 4, WIXOSS Season 2, World Trigger and Grisaia no Kajitsu. 

You can ask me anything about these and I'll do my best to answer if you want. 
>> ARTICLE
Fate/stay night do I need to have previous experience with the series. Also I'm hyped as fuck for Kora season 4. 
>> ARTICLE
The best way for fate would be to read the first route of the Visual Novel then watch this anime. The longer version of the preferred order is quite complicated, but if you can't read the visual novel (don't have a computer, etc) then this should be a fine starting point. I can type up the preferred order if you want, but I don't have the time now. Let me know if you want me to and I'll type it up for you later.

It was nominated. 
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, the [Nomination Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ro3ci/ranime_awards_2014_category_nominations/) was confusing as fuck to use/participate in. Granted i didn't watch many seasonal animes last year myself, some of the nominations that made it through were like "..Really??" 

For Future Nomination Threads, i think a Collective-Elimination vote would serve as a better format. Take Every Title from the year, break them all down in catagories, Make the public vote 10 out of each. Top 10 in each catagory goes on to the Finals (The Award Show). 
>> ARTICLE
I don't really see how the nomination thread was confusing. If anything, I thought it was really simple. You find the category you want and then you vote for your anime/character/whatever. It wasn't that hard. Even if you asked me a question I did my best to be clear and make sense while explaining what to do/how it worked. I was even willing to link to a thread if you couldn't find it. 

I think I might actually still do this. I'm going to finish posting these poll threads daily and then do one big thread with all of the categories limited to just 10 nominees or 5 for the less popular ones (like sports in this case.)
>> ARTICLE
> I don't really see how the nomination thread was confusing.

idk, maybe im just retareded (not even joking hahaha), Well now looking at it as it sits (complete), it's not so bad. The last i looked at it was as soon as it was posted-several hours after. Things were moving up and down, There were a couple troll nominations that went up "Boku no pico!"/etc. It was complete Chaos in a sense. But it even'd out pretty nice.

Great thread. Sadly, most of these I haven't seen, so it's pretty easy to make a choice when you have either SAO or PP2, for example.
>> ARTICLE
~~Sakura Trick for romance~~
>> ARTICLE
SAO II is up there as a romance. Unless Kirito x Asada is canon, it shouldn't be up there. 
>> ARTICLE
Here are my personal favourites from the particular genres (trying to make it so that the strength of the genre dictates my choice):

* Comedy: Mangaka-san to Assistant-san

The only show of the year where I can honestly say I was laughing from start to finish every single episode (and during each of the full length OVAs). The particular brand of comedy it supplies is far from for everyone but it worked so well for me.

* Slice of Life: Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou

Sakurasou is my favourite show of all time and I think Kawaisou is the closest any anime has come to replicating the humour and setting. The romance was brilliant even though [](/s "it didn't develop as far as we all would have liked"). The humour was wonderful and the characters were unique and colourful. It was a show with a lot of heart and I hope it gets a second season at some point.

* Harem: Nisekoi

The best way to compare harems is by their girls and every girl in Nisekoi is a serious best girl candidate. The reaction gifs and humour are marvelous and SHAFT did a ridiculously good job keeping their SHAFTiness *relatively* contained.

* Thriller: WIXOSS

Continuous plot twists, lots of suffering, an interesting premise and fantastic delivery.

* ~~Sports~~

Not a fan of the genre, didn't watch any of the options. Tried to watch Ping Pong but unfortunately I have huge trouble getting into shows with art styles that I don't like.

* Romance: Sakura Trick

Continuous kissing, which funnily enough is rather unique. Maybe it's not the best show ever but the romance had me from start to finish and has kept me rewatching particular scenes since the show ended.

* Science Fiction: Aldnoah.Zero

This was a hard section since I'm not sure Aldnoah would deserve it. Parasyte isn't Sci-Fi enough for me to vote for it and I haven't seen a lot of the rest. Aldnoah was very entertaining at least, even though the writing was at times disappointing.

* Action/Battle Shounen: Noragami

The premise, the characters and the action were all great. Not much else to say. Hiyori best girl.

edit: reasoning
>> ARTICLE
> Romance: Sakura Trick

It had some great potential, but I flipt a table when it turned into the most generic yuri anime ever 5 episodes in. Like it wasn't even funny how generic it became. Such a shame, because it could've been a lot better than it was if not for that.
>> ARTICLE
> the most generic yuri anime ever

If you know another yuri anime with kissing (let alone that much kissing) please, *please* enlighten me.

The plot was pretty typical of SoLs but the execution was not.

I thought rebellion was aired in 2013 ? At least it says so on MAL..

>> ARTICLE
The movies started airing in theatres in 2013, but weren't available on DVD/Blu-ray until 2014. Thus, its considered here as 2014. 

It felt odd voting for it though, since I did actually watch it in 2013...guess I'll have to put up with it.

Out of curiosity, why is Mushishi in Slice of Life? While I recognize it's difficult to categorize and deals with some daily trivialities, doesn't putting it alongside Yuuki Yuuna and other, well, *slice of life-y* anime kind of ... diminish it? If anything I feel like it should be listed under Thriller, especially as dark as some episodes this series were.

I have a feeling I missed a poll thread along the line somewhere. >.>
But I guess it's so niche it probably wouldn't win any popularity contests anyway, so I'll just vote for it and move on.

Voted for Trinity Seven for Harem which is likely only me. >_> My reasoning is that it actually has romantic development, good girls, and can support itself as a Harem. [It's the only Harem series this year](/s " to develop an actual stable mutual Harem.")

I can understand Nisekoi love but I don't think it's a High Quality Harem series at all. It regularly uses from the big book of tropes, dense as fuck protagonist, and very little actual romantic progression. It's strong points though are the cute girls and the visuals... Which is about it in my opinion. I think it's a better comedy series than a romance series.

Sci-Fi: Psycho-pass 2

Action Shounen: Log Horizon
>> ARTICLE
Comedy - Amagi brilliant park for being half funny and having characters named after rappers. 5/10 won't watch again but worth my time. 

Honorable mention goes to space dandy s2 which I didn't finish. 

Slice of life - Space Brothers for being a mature story about adults with actual dreams that I can be invested in and caring about its characters. Too slow at times though and pretty long. 7/10 won't watch again because too long but it was good. 

Silver spoon s2 because the show does a good job in portraying it's characters and making them go through struggles actual teenagers go through. Also it was very funny and charming. 8/10 will probably watch again some day. 

Harem - whatever monogatari stuff that aired this year because monogatari is best harem. Usually 6 or 7/10 because too much otaku pandering. 

Thriller - abstain because I haven't seen anything good. But it's probably between wixoss, rage of Bahamut and terror in resonance 

Romance - (edit) the wind rises is my choice because it was half decent. Forgot it's considered romance. 

Sports - PING PONG THE FUCKING ANIMATION MOTHERFUCKER 

SciFi - space Brothers for being the best series in the category. 

Action/ Battle Shonen - HxH - if this was 2013 and I had to pick between Jojos (2012) and hunter x hunter it would have been hard. But this year stardust crusaders was pretty weak compared to Jojos 2012 so HxH gets my vote. 

>> ARTICLE
> Comedy

Nothing 

Perhaps Gekkan Shoujo.  I didn't particularly find anything too funny this year, especially not the shows which were nominated.

>Slice of Life

Barakamon - I mean it's not really a unique idea but it was executed so well and so much charm it'd be foolish to vote otherwise

> Harem

Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai

> Thriller

Zankyou no Terror - I didn't particularly like ZnT but it had some good cliffhangers in the middle and did what a thriller should do.  I think the best thriller isn't even on this list lol.  Argevollen is nowhere to be found

> Romance

Soredemo Sekai no Utskushii - It was really well done, and the subtle changes in the OP reflect the level of endearment the crew had for their show.  It might have been a bit boring for some considering a lot of popular romances are drama's but I think this is the best we had.  

>Sports

Ping Pong the Animation - I think this show is way overrated and I was one of the people hyping this up.  But even then this show was one of the better ones of its season and probably the best sports anime, and put a little twist on the formulaic genre.

> Science Fiction

Sidonia no Kishi - This one just takes the cake.  You may have a bit to say with the CGI (which was handled pretty well) and stock footage reusage but goddamn this was one of the better scifi universes animated this year

***Wild Card***

If something was wrongfully shunned and *not* submitted, add it as a reply to the second level comments below, each saying a season! The comment I have responded to this with will be the judge. If your nominee for the wild card is in the top ***5*** replied below ***AND*** above my comment in points, then it's in. 

This one is a little different, make sure that your anime ***ended*** in the season you're submitting it in. For example, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders started in Spring but it's only valid for Summer, because that's when it ended. Similarly, anything that's still currently airing but aired last year as well belongs in the *Fall* category. An example of this above is Naruto: Shippuuden.

Just a note on your comment on Tokyo Ghoul, the root a anime is also written by the author of the manga, isn't it? I mean, I still heard the manga is much much better, but I also heard they're totally different stories.

Really glad to see Shirobako and Shigatsu doing so well.

I'm not surprised to see that the sales of shows with no BD are pretty shit, especially TG and T7. They're a pair shows that people are really waiting for the BD for, since one is an ecchi they want more ecchi and the other is censored to shit and they want uncensored.

Unlimited Budget Works is still more than making up for it's budget costs, no surprise.

KanColle selling stupidly well because it's KanColle, regardless of all the twitter bitching, again no surprise. No matter how much they bitch about a shit-tier destroyer's fate, they still want their ship daughters in glorious blu-ray.

>> ARTICLE
>KanColle selling stupidly well

For such huge brand, 19.7k just meh, i guess the average will be only ~50% of GuP average(35999)

Kancolle is selling well because it comes with the lottery ticket to the upcoming August official fan event hosted by Kadokawa themselves.

If any, most of them will buy the BD just to get access to the event itself.

True. To be fair, though, event tickets are *very* common in anime v1s. It would be unusual for KanColle to not have one.

Just so people know, this is just the preliminary list which usually only has around the top 30 DVD sales and top 20 BD sales. The series without BD sales have sold less than 2292 BDs.

The full list will come out tomorrow.

You underestimate Japan's market for moe. cgdct sell really well, especially if there's a really big game market behind it.

If the story was better, I wouldn't be surprised if it sold >25k units like GuP

What do you mean?

It was well recieved, big budget, and got rekt in sales.

It's almost as though people are telling kyoani to make more BL.

4,000 isn't bad for a pretty throwaway one-cour (as entertaining as it was), I know it's not Kyoani big, but I bet it boosted the shit out of sales for the source material, so I assume it did fine. Plus I imagine the opening sold fairly well.

That's something I forgot to consider. It did boost manga sales, they got that going for them.

Yah, a show like Brilliant Park was never gonna post huge numbers, we all enjoyed it as it was coming out, but would you really put down the money to put it on your shelf? I'm sure the TV ratings where better.

I hope those numbers for Yowamushi will be enough for them to order another 60 or so episodes of Yowamushi Pedal within the next year. But holy hell those Haikyuu sales. Not to mention Free. I wonder what the prospects will be for an all-girls sports show to do this well. It seems pretty boy sports shows are a surefire home run nowadays. I'm a fan of all those sports shows, but wow, that monsterous leap in sales figures between shows is crazy.

Definitely proud of Shirobako and Shigatsu for sure.  Pretty nice seeing Dog Days and Cross Ange do pretty well too.

Also crazy how Youkai Watch is up there considering it is a children's show. Its popularity really knows no bounds!

Finals - Personal opinions

**Best OP** - I'm pretty undecided on this one, actually. There are four main ones that I really like. Here they are:

>**Ambiguous** - *Gamidelia* from Kill la Kill - The song in this is great. I really like the flashing of the different costumes the characters all wear in the beginning too. Towards the end of the OP, it gives me a feeling that something epic is going to happen, which fits really well with Kill la Kill. Also, boobies.

>**Database** - *Man With a Mission* from Log Horizon - This one seems to be a fan favorite, not surprised that it's in the finals. The song is fun, the visuals in each of the openings with this song are great (especially the first one) and I feel like it sets a unique tone for the show. 

>**Hikaru Nara (If You Will Shine)** - *Goose House* from Shigatsu wa Kimi no Osu (Your lie in April) - I really like the song and the visuals in this are great as well. The only reason I'm wary on this is that I haven't watched any of the show yet, so I don't know if it fits the show well or not. Either way, it's great and I might vote for this regardless. 

>**Trigger** - *Yuuki Ozaki* from Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - While I didn't like the show as much as most because of Five, the OP is great. The song is great, the visuals are great and there's just not much more to say about it. The lyrics kind of make me feel like it was written for the show, since they seem like they're extremely relevant. 

>Honorable mention - **Tada Hitori** - *Bakudan Johnny* from Ping Pong the Animation - I can't believe this didn't make the finals. One of the best from this year for sure. OOOHHHHH YEAH!

**Best ED** - This might actually be one of the easiest decisions in the entire event for me.

>**Innocence** - *NoisyCell* from Barakamon - The song is just amazing, and the kind of hazy/foggy visuals mixed with the watercolor animation just looks amazing. I don't know how to describe my feelings about it. /u/DrJamesFox showed me a short write up he did about it, but I can't find it right now. I remember one of the words he used to describe it was 'nostalgic' and I can't say I disagree. Even just watching the ED makes me tear up sometimes. Such a good ED. 

>Honorable mention - **Walk Like An Egyptian** - *The Bangles* from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders - The bizarre song choice and extremely colorful style in the ED really work well together, making it a combo that rivals Roundabout, but falls short by just a little. Either way, this was unexpected, but surprisingly still great. 

**Best ____ anime of the year** - I'm going to just name my anime next to the genre below.

>Comedy - **Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** - The premise is interesting, and the execution is just perfect. Has some of the best comedy I've ever seen in an anime, and the scene where they play the visual novels is probably my *favorite comedy scene* in **any** anime I've seen.

>Slice of Life - **Barakamon** - The premise, again, is interesting. I really liked the whole show, how Handa grew up when he moved to the island, and how it made him see what was important. Every character is unique and each one has great characterization, really combining to make something special.

>Harem - **Nisekoi** - So many best girls, so little time. If absolutely nothing else, the best girl wars make this the best. So many arguments between Chitoge, Onodera, true best girl Tsugumi and the other girl who no one cares about because she came into the anime too late. 

>Thriller - **Tokyo Ghoul** - Awesome premise, and the execution is good enough that I enjoyed the story. Unique to see someone cope with what Kaneki had to cope with, and seeing him [](/s "getting used to eating human flesh") was awesome. Also had one of the best last episodes last year. 

>Romance - Abstaining - I've only seen two shows from here, so it would be next to no contest.

>Sports - Abstaining - Only seen Ping Pong.

>Sci-fi - **Psycho-Pass 2** - Even if it didn't bring much new stuff since Psycho-Pass pretty much established the system, the new things they brought in were super interesting and cool.

>Action/Battle Shounen - **Kill la Kill** - Well, who doesn't love a great anime with great battle sequences? Not me! This show was great and the action scenes are just fun, even if they are a tad repetitive.

**Best Male character** - **Jurai Andou** from Inou-Battle - Shout out to /r/gayforandou. But seriously, as much as I wasn't a huge fan of the show, Andou carried it on his back, which is saying a lot for an MC, let alone one of a harem anime. You can really tell that Andou really cared about all of his friends in the show. Also, he's a total chuuni which is cool too.

>> ARTICLE
> so I don't know if it fits the show well or not. Either way, it's great and I might vote for this regardless.

I can assure you the OP captures the show perfectly. You really need to watch this one soon...but I guess you have a pretty long list of shows you really need to watch soon eh? :P

>showed me a short write up he did about it, but I can't find it right now. I remember one of the words he used to describe it was 'nostalgic' and I can't say I disagree.

I could link to it but it's unnecessary. Basically the lyrics of the song are recalling a very important time in the singer's life. A time that made him both incredibly happy and changed him. For Handa, that time was living on the Island and realizing what is important in life through his interactions with Naru and the other Islanders. The ED reflects the emotions in the song and the anime with it's watercolor art-style. It feels nostalgic because the art-style gives the ED a feeling of it being a memory. You know how when you think about any memory and details are kind of blurred? Same with the ED. The watercolor artstyle blurs the details of these fond memories. 

Oh and sorry if I've given you the impression that I've been ignoring you. I haven't been doing that intentionally. Stuff has been real tough at work and I'm working long hours to make up for people who have been laid off. I've been drinking a lot and immersing myself in manga when I'm not working to escape from these difficult times. Because of that I haven't really been in the right frame of mind to help you with your threads. I'm not looking for any words of encouragement, just letting you know why I didn't respond to some of your messages. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, no dude don't worry about it. Let me know if you want/need to talk about anything. /u/ugotmal is always here for you, s-senpai.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for that, but I try to use the internet as an escape from IRL problems. My having gotten fairly close to you and a couple of other redditors on here has caused the lines to blur a little though. I just let you know those bits of information because I didn't want you to get the wrong impression from my lack of responses. 

Oh and I think you asked about House of Cards, right? Shit is next level television, but you've got to pay careful attention to it or it'll go over your head. I consider my knowledge of US politics and government to be well above average but there were still several plot points that were difficult for me to follow. Amazing show though. 

And I saw you mention Tokyo Ghoul in your previous post as one of your favorites from last year. You should definitely consider picking up the manga if you haven't already. The anime is headed towards an anime original ending which I can't imagine will top the manga's beautifully epic ending. I started from Ch. 70, which is where I read the anime began to branch off from the manga. 

The new sequel manga, Tokyo Ghoul:re, takes place 3 years after the ending of Tokyo Ghoul and is looking *very* interesting through 15 chapters. 

Also, you calling me senpai gave me a good chuckle...thanks for that. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, well if you ever change your mind, I'm all ears. I know what it's like to have a stressful day. 

I did ask about House of Cards. I don't really know much about politics, should I just pass on the series then? 

I don't know if I'd consider Tokyo Ghoul to be one of my favorites from last year, but I enjoyed it. I'm gonna get into the manga eventually. I actually bought the guest volume and then when it came in the mail it was in Japanese... I was pretty upset. And btw, when you say that RE is very interesting, do you think it could be better than the first part of the manga? That would be great. 

And I'm just glad that senpai finally noticed me! Lol. 
>> ARTICLE
>I did ask about House of Cards. I don't really know much about politics, should I just pass on the series then?

I think you should probably watch a couple of episodes to see how it feels to you. The second season is much more politically complex than the first though. It felt too high level for me at times, and like I said, I feel like my understanding of politics/US Govt is better that average. 

>when you say that RE is very interesting, do you think it could be better than the first part of the manga?

I began reading the manga at Ch. 70, which is where I was told the anime began to diverge. So I can't answer that question. I'd say RE is interesting because of the timeskip and the effects it has had on the characters. If you like Tokyo Ghoul because of the characters, RE is *extremely* interesting. If you like Tokyo Ghoul because of the world building and action, then RE is just okay. 

>And I'm just glad that senpai finally noticed me! Lol.

I might check a few episodes of HoC out. But even if I like it, 2d 4 lyfe.

May I recommend you either vote or watch and vote for our lord and saviour [Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time) for the romance genre?

Not to say it's without it's flaws but what fun would it be to reveal those [amirite](http://i.imgur.com/A0jPpO0.gif)?

Really want Haikyuu to win best sports; It's against Ping Ping though so I dont see it happening



>> ARTICLE
Agreed, I do believe Haikyuu!! to be better than Ping Pong though.
>> ARTICLE
My OP and ED choices would've been slightly different if it wasn't including animation and art but now that it is.

**Best OP - This Game by Konomi Suzuki**

**Best ED - Tokohana by Yanagi Nagi**

**Best Comedy: Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** (I can imagine it's between this and Barakamon for the win).

**Best Slice of Life: Barakamon**

**Best Harem: Nisekoi** (Was considering Monogatari but honestly I found Nisekoi to be superior to Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari and it'd be unfair judging on the past seasons).

**Best Thriller: Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** (Zankyou no Terror close second though).

**Best Romance: Golden Time** (Most realistic romance anime I've seen, can't help but loving it).

**Best Sports: Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season** (I find Ping Pong to be the most overrated series of 2014 on this subreddit honestly, Haikyuu!! is probably the most worthy winner though, I'm just a Kuroko fan.)

**Best Sci-fi: Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei** (I'd place this 4th amongst the series in terms of how much I liked them but it's undeniably the best out of the 5 when it comes to Sci-fi attributes IMO.)

**Best Action: Hunter x Hunter (2011)** (Honestly I don't see anything that can come close to touching Hunter x Hunter for rank 1 here, possibly Bahamut).

**Best Male Character: Izumi Shinichi** (Real hard decisiong between Izumi and Archer, I swear to shit though that if Inaho wins I'll flip a table or something.)

A question though, scrolling downwards it seems to me like people voted with their favourite of the shows in mind, am I the only one who voted for whichever series I found pulled off the category in question the best? (aside from the sports category).
>> ARTICLE
Best OP: Unravel (Tokyo Ghoul)

Best ED: Shirushi (SAO II)

Comedy: Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun)

Harem: Nisekoi

Thriller: Haven't seem most of them so I can't really judge.

Romance: Shigatsu wa kimi no Uso

Sports: Kuroko no basket 2

Action/Battle: Fate/SN UBW

>> ARTICLE
I'm a little bit shocked that Barakamon's OP didn't make it to the finals, but ED did. OP is sooo wonderful, still listening to it a lot.

**Best OP:** - Hikaru Nara by Goose House then.

**Best ED:** - Innocence by NoisyCell

**Best Comedy:** Barakamon, I laughed like crazy while watching it.

**Best Slice of Life:** Barakamon, no comments, my love 2014 :)

**Best Harem:** Monogatari, Araragi has it right!

**Best Thriller:** Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu.

**Best Romance:** Golden Time - it's the best romance out of that choices.

**Best Sports:** I really hope Haikyuu!! wins, it was truly awesome. I told about it to my non-anime watcher friend, and he marathoned it and then even rewatched. It's just great.

**Best Sci-fi:** Aldnoah.Zero - the most sci-fi out of these ones.

**Best Action:** Akame ga Kill - really loved battle scenes here (and haven't watch HxH yed :D)

**Best Male Character:** Kanye FTW!

Best ED:Your song  
Comedy: Nisekoi

Romance: NAGI NO ASUKARA<3  
Sport: Kuroko no Basket Season 2

>> ARTICLE
Best OP - Shiver by Lucy Rose from Mushishi Zoku Shou - this fucking song man, so fucking great. Probably my all time favorite OP. 

Best ED - Walk Like and Egyptian - The Bangles - Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders - if you haven't guessed I like it when a show has some English songs as the OP or ED. 

Best Comedy Anime - Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun - It was between this and Amagi Brilliant Park, and both were funny, but nozaki Kun was much more clever and didn't give us an asspull ending, so it gets my vote. Also, dat catchy ass OP. 

Best SoL - Barakamon - I didn't see all of them, but all I hear is good things from Barakamon, so I'll pick that. 

Best Harem Anime - Monogatari Series - the answer is always Monogatari. It's the best harem, period. That isn't saying much and I don't particularly like the series, but il give it credit where it deserves it. 

Best Thriler Anime - Parasyte the Maxim - Parasyte is a damn good show, and the rest of these shows are meh to okay. 

Best Romance Anime - abstain - of the few romance anime I tried, I hated them all. And I didn't see the rest yet so I can't give judge. They all look like shit anyway. 

Best Sports anime - Ping Pong the Animation - again, the only right answer. Best sports anime ever, and much better than the rest of the shit we got this year. 

Best sci fi - Parasyte the Maxim - again, it's a great show, while the rest are either bad or average. 

Best action/battle shonen - Hunter x Hunter - I thought Kill la Kill would be my choice, but Hunter x Hunter just barely edged it out. Both are great series, and if I could pick both I would, but if there can only be one, that one needs to be HxH. Chimera ants FTW. 


>> ARTICLE
Best Op: It was hard choosing just one case their are so many good choices. But I had to pick Tokyo Ghoul because I listen to that song constantly when I first heard. 

Best ED: This was a toughy a pick from either Log Horizon or Barakamon. But I had to go with Barakamon. This ending made me tear up everytime I stayed after the show to listen to this beautiful song. Don't know what it was but for a song to do that is pretty great.

Best Comedy: Barakamon again cause I don't think I have laughed so hard in my life after watching that show.

Best SoL: Barakamon again lol

Best Harem: Nisekoi

Best Thiller: Tokyo Ghoul

Best Romance: Golden Time

Best Sport: haven't watched any of them so I picked Haikyuu!! since that looked the most appealing to me.

Best Sci-fi: The Irregular at Magic High School

Best Action: Kill la Kill 

Best Male Character: Jurai Andou

>> ARTICLE
Personally I love Unravel, best song of the year IMO, but due to the fact that I absolutely adore the art and animation in the NGNL OP and that I like the song a lot as well I had to pick that, I'll save Unravel for when it's judged purely on the music :3.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no I understand I Love NGNL op too but i like [this version better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRQbVNzmCK0)
>> ARTICLE
Best OP - Shiver (Mushishi Zoku Shou) I haven't even watched Mushishi but I love this song and I now am a fan of Lucy Rose.

Best ED - It's the right time (Kiseijuu) This song is always a good come down from all of the intensity of the show.

Best Comedy - Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, this was actually a huge surprise for me, I expected it to be nothing special and it was so much fun with a great cast and some of the funniest scenes I've seen.

Best Slice of Life - Barakmon, truthfully I never finished it but it was always a nice relaxing show to break up all of the action shows that season.

Best Harem - Monogatari Series, I love this series, not really much to say.

Best Thriller - Kiseijuu, the first half was really fantastic with some of the most tense moments from last year.

Best Romance - Nagi No Asukara, I just wish best girl won :(

Best Sports - Ping Pong, this is my pick for the best show of last year, everything about it is fantastic.

Best Sci-Fi - Kiseijuu

Best Action/Battle Shounen - Hunter x Hunter (2011), I haven't quite finished it yet but its been a real ride, I didn't expect to like it at all but it has some really great characters and moments.

Best Male Character - Kong Wenge (Ping Pong) since my first choice of the Ping Pong boys (Peco) didn't make it, I have to go with Kong.  His development from being an arrogant asshole looking down on others to a real team player/team captain was really quite something.

fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck

Also no Enigmatic Feeling? :(

(Best OP nobody saw:[AMAZING BREAK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxgBRVt9dHU))
>> ARTICLE
Best OP: **Kimi ja Nakya Dame Mitai** (GSNK) There were a ton of good OPs this year but this one is just bursting with energy and creativity. It really portrays the mood and atmosphere of the show well.

Best ED: **Dareka Umiwo** (Zankyou no Terror) I think the quality of this song is a major part of why I was so disappointed with ZnT. It's haunting, the visual metaphors are really well done, and Aimer's vocals are god-tier.

Best Comedy: **Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** As /r/anime is sick to death of hearing, this show was just fantastic. The fact that a completely irrelevant character from a single scene is on the best guy list speaks volumes for how memorable this show is. Even mention Tomoda and someone, somewhere, will respond with TOMODAAAAA!! guaranteed. He doesn't even have more than one drawing.

Best Slice of Life: **Barakamon** This show is just so touching and happy I flit back and forth between smiles and tears, sometimes both.

Best Harem: **Nisekoi** Shaft really did an amazing adaptation with this. Complain all you want about plot progression, this anime *satisfies* visually and comedically. The VAs are all amazing and fit their characters perfectly. Monogatari is definitely going to win, but whenever Nisekoi comes up, it always devolves into a best-girl argument. *That* is what a harem comedy is all about.

Best Thriller: **Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** This show took a little while to get going, but when it did, holy shit. You really feel the repercussions of the debatable actions Shinichi takes. The last episode, my jaw was dropped basically the whole time. It's suspenseful, violent, and tense.

I don't really have input on sports anime, but Ping Pong will definitely win.

Best Sci-Fi: *Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** again.

Best Action: **Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis** This was just unlike anything I've seen. It just oozes cool. When the MC uses a shortsword and *revolver-crossbow* you know you're in for a treat. Every character was great, I especially liked how Kaisar was handled.

Best Male Character: **TOMODAAAAA**

Glad to see Gin no Saji have a high "favorite show transference," it was absolutely amazing. Not surprised to see Chuu season 2 fall off; I, like many others, was very disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Chuu2 messed up, starting the Season at 3rd in Week 3 and ending up at 17th at the end, quite the drop.
>> ARTICLE
just a heads up I think you accidently skipped Hajime no Ippo for "favorite show transference"
>> ARTICLE
It had 30 viewers. The cutoff criteria was 50 viewers.

Transference in particular is extremely sensitive to small viewer-count. If 4 people watched a show and 3 of them voted for it for top show, it'd rule the chart.
>> ARTICLE

I looked at it and quickly decided that it just wasn't in my interest range.
>> ARTICLE
oh I didnt notice that, ok nvm then.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't realize Samurai Flamenco was so unpopular. I finished watching it a few days ago and loved it.

Kill la Kill tops the charts, surprising no one (I really should continue watching it).

Is Space Dandy not any good? I thought it would be more popular just based on the director's pedigree (much like KLK).
>> ARTICLE
> Is Space Dandy not any good? I thought it would be more popular just based on the director's pedigree (much like KLK).

Good or not, it was *disappointing*, meaning expectations were not met. It was episodic, so people didn't feel compelled to keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
Which is odd. The first time I heard of it, I thought it would be a wacky space adventure with a dandy guy, and that was just what I got.
>> ARTICLE
I also thought it did exactly what it said it would do on the tin. It was a dandy show with a dandy guy... in space. It was a Watanabe Shinichiro show to the very core. 

Then again, folks around here don't exactly like episodic shows. So once word got out that it was episodic, it got a lot of flak from the redditaku. (Or should that be the hikikomoreddit...) Also too, the simu-dub caught a lot of crap as well, because dubs will always catch a lot of crap.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, it's consistently had bizarre shit going down on tons of creative alien worlds with gorgeous animation and funk music. what more could you ask for, baby?

and honestly, I like that it's episodic; the lack of connectivity means each episode is fresh and unique, and lets the show explore a lot of different scenarios.
>> ARTICLE
the ramen episode made me feel legitimately bad for meow :(
>> ARTICLE
> I didn't realize Samurai Flamenco was so unpopular.

It started out as a quirky but somewhat forgettable series. You had to wait until around ep 7 to really see it start balling out of control. It's not uncommon to have dropped the series at the 6th episode if it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.

> Is Space Dandy not any good? I thought it would be more popular just based on the director's pedigree

That's probably exactly why it tanked in the polls. Shinichiro Watanabe is not a name that can be ignored. It wouldn't surprise me if Space Dandy actually had more people watching it's first episode than that of any other  series starting that season.

It turned out that it wasn't the second coming of Cowboy Bebop, despite all the thematic similarities. It also seems to be that many people dislike the episodic format. It didn't take many episodes for interest to drop off.

All the hype aside, I think it was fine. Definitely in my top 5 for that season, including continuing from last season.
>> ARTICLE
Flamenco went the opposite way for me.  I was really into it until it started going out of control.
>> ARTICLE
Many people liked *one* mood or even *two* of Flamenco. Not many people liked them all, or even if they did, they may not have liked the transitions.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked SamFlam (all of it) but I marathoned the first half (started watching anime at the beginning of the year) so that may have played a difference. I didn't really feel it was that abrupt tbh more like WTF moments. For people who didn't like the transitions, was it because they really expected that it would go one way? Or are shows like SamFlam just unpopular?
>> ARTICLE
I thought the whole thing was so great because no matter how many times the setting changed it was still the same show that I loved from the beginning. I marathoned the first 23 episodes to be ready for the finale so I don't know what effect that might have had on my enjoyment
>> ARTICLE
oh whooo! I'm not a total weirdo then. Yeah, it really felt like the same show to me. The characters were consistent, and the show was honestly very self-aware. Admittedly Guillotine Gorilla was a big big shock, but it all made "sense" (or maybe I just have an unquestioning mind).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was weird and crazy but the only time I was really surprised was when Gorilla came because no one else had been killed throughout the show so that was big.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I'm with you. I liked it *because* it was more grounded than other animes. Then it went off the wall and really turned me off.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, that's an equally important point. Some of the people who actually liked what it was doing and kept watching that long were disappointed when it took a new direction.
>> ARTICLE
Well SamFlam may not have had the most followers but for those that did follow it, almost half of them thought it was a "Top Show" as the Transference shows, so it shows most people who watched it also loved it as well.



>> ARTICLE
yeah it's the latest hidden gem type anime since so many people dropped and it and it wasn't terribly popular to begin with but everyone who stuck with it loved it. It was one of my favorites this season and definitely should have been a contender for AOTS
>> ARTICLE
Man the lack of Ippo on this list is fucking depressing.
>> ARTICLE
I've heard very good things about it, it's just that I've never had interest in reading/watching it, mainly because I'm not a huge fan of boxing. I'm sure I'd like it if I started watching it, since I understand that boxing is just a medium, and the real draw to it lies in other elements. But that whole "starting" thing can be half the battle sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
i felt almost the same way about chihayafuru before tiring of it midway through s2.
>> ARTICLE
I had literally 0% interest in boxing (or sports anime in general) before watching it, I picked it up and it has become one of the few tens I've given out.

Not trying to over hype it, but you should definitely make that first step to see if you might like it.
>> ARTICLE
I'll give it a try at one point. I do love me a good underdog story.
>> ARTICLE
Only ~30 said they'd watched it in the survey, so it didn't make much of an impact, but more than half the people who did watch it also selected it as a top show.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it and thought it's damn good. 

Do people not watch it because it's a sequel, repetitive, or am I missing something?
>> ARTICLE
The more seasons you go, the less watchers you have.

Sports shows are in general very popular, but less so on this subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
Well it is a Season 3, so its limited to those that have seen the first 2 seasons is most likely one main reason. Another is that sports animes generally arn't that big on here. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, a few of the graphs link to the wrong things, I've let him know.

Anyway, here's another thing of interest:

The most over-represented "liked shows", that is to say, the shows with the highest jump in position from how many watch them to how many voted them for top 3/5, after removing all shows watched by under 50 people. 

Another way to say it would be **"Most underwatched shows"**:

| Title  | Difference  | Change from W9| Change W6 > W9|
|:-----|------|--|---:|
|Gin no Saji - Silver Spoon Season 2|	10|+0|+2|
|Buddy Complex|	8|+4|-4|
|Kuroko no Basket S2|	8|N/A|N/A|
|Magi: The Kingdom of Magicl|	7|N/A|N/A|
|Wake Up, Girls!|	5|+0|+1|

Note "Buddy Complex", the +4 means it is *farther off* from where it "should be", the difference between its position in how many watch it to how many think of it as "Favourite" grew from 4 places to 8, from week 9 to season finale.

Kuroko no Basket and Magi didn't appear during the seasonal surveys, so there's no past data.

---

And the most negatively represented shows (meaning "**most over-watched shows**", that many more people watch them than those who think they should be top 3/5 material):

| Title  | Difference  | Change from W9| Change W6 > W9|
|:-----|---|---|-----:|
|Hamatora|	-16|-14|+6|
|Pupa|	-10|-7|-6|
|Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai Season 2|	-13|-13|+6|
|Onee-chan ga Kita|	-10|-3|+4|
|Wizard Barristers: Benmashi Cecil|	-8|-5|-2|

Note Pupa, as weeks went by, the amount of people watching it may have decreased, but people's appreciation for it fell in a much steeper curve than the rate of those who could take no more of it :P

Chuunibyou... very popular. People *really* did not like the ending. Hamatora wasn't as popular, but I guess people also didn't care for the ending. Note, since this data is only based on "Favourite", it can mean people liked a show fine, but they didn't *love* it.

Week 6 to week 9 change for both Hamatora and Chuunibyou put them closer to "0", "0" in this case meaning a show is watched proportionally to how much people like it.

---

Of course, since you have the percentages, it doesn't really matter, if all had been "equal", it wouldn't matter how many people watch each show, but those who find a show favourite would be equal across the board. In a perfect world each show would be watched by the same amount of people (the average), and if a show is the most watched show, then it should also rank at the highest of those who think it's "really good", or so the argument goes.

Sorry, a bit rambly, again.

This time because it wasn't me tracking the changes across the season, and because the data was already tabulated for me, it was pretty easy going. I've worked about 2 hours on some of the weeks' results. Hope you people found them interesting :)

did hamatora wrap up?  i noticed that there is a s2 announced for summer.

No idea. Dropped it once they introduced the villain.

wait, someone voted mahou sensou as their AoTS?

or am i reading that wrong.

5 people did, in fact.

I guess they really loved the OP/ED.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, it did have AWESOME OP/ED to work with.
>> ARTICLE
True. I watched all of the show, and that's really the best thing about it.
>> ARTICLE
holy shit! I kind of want to have a discussion with them, just so that I might be enlightened as to what they enjoyed about it so much, because I hated it (and i finished!)


>> ARTICLE
You can start a thread and hope they'll see it.

Out of the 5 Mahou Sensou voters, we also have:3 Log Horizon votes, and 2 votes each for Tokyo Ravens, Strike the Blood, and Buddy Complex.

If anything, it's surprising how little of the top favourite shows they voted for: Only 1 Noragami, Kill la Kill, Golden Time, Nagi no Asukara, or Witch Craft Works.


>> ARTICLE
I would, but if they did come out those poor people would get trolled right off of reddit in this sub, if it were /r/trueanime then I might have.

JoJo only at number 7 for the top continuing shows.

It was decent, however sadly these 4/5mins shows don't gain a lot of attention.

..unless they star HanaKana..

Oh yeah, forgot about Tonari no Seki-kun, that HanaKana power... and there is Mangaka-san to Assistant-san as well which is gaining quite a bit of discussion.

7 and 10 minutes do a lot more than 3-4.

Also, skits work better in short form, as each is self-contained. Pupipo tried to tell a continuous story in a short time-frame.

Huh, I missed out on the poll

I see, it was linked to in the End of Season discussion thread for the whole week, next time.

Gotta say not surprised at all with these results, I think KLK is way overrated though
>> ARTICLE
I'm really happy that favorite show transference allowed both Samurai Flamenco and Sekai Seifuku to get into the top 10. 
>> ARTICLE
Man onee-chan ga kita deserves better!
>> ARTICLE
I have to say that I'm surprised to see both Hamatora and Gundam Build Fighters score so low.
>> ARTICLE
Do I need to give golden time another chance? I got to episode 12 and couldn't handle the stagnant plot anymore so i dropped it.
>> ARTICLE
Right around episode 13 is actually where, as the sage of the squared circle would put it, bidness just done picked up. When Golden Time did the end-of-cour break, it gave us the cliffhanger that made the entire show really make sense. It moves forward for another few episodes after that, goes stagnant for a couple, and then starts whacking people's tear ducts with a rubber halibut for the rest of the show.

Then again, things go forward with a plot even when a show looks like it is stagnant. A lot of the things in episodes 9-12 were plotbuilding devices for the second cour. Without those being shown, the second cour would never have made much sense. That's why I rarely complain about a show that starts to drag... I actually force myself to pay closer attention, because that is where the writer starts telling you the stuff that is about to happen.

But that's just me.
>> ARTICLE
No-Rin deserves better, it was one of the best!
>> ARTICLE
>Gundam Build Fighters not number 1 or even in top 10

GG /r/anime confirmed baddie Mecha haters

True, but Captin Earth seems to have potential to end up in the Top10 this season.

ToAru KoiUta really shouldv'e been higher IMO. I personally loved the story.

how is mikakunin and d frag not top 2????
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain to me why Log Horizon is good? I watched the first two episodes and it didn't really live up to the SAO name.
>> ARTICLE
> it didn't really live up to the SAO name.

Well. THERE's your problem. (Someone do me a favor and find me a damn gif for that? Preferably one with Adam Savage.)

It wasn't part of SAO. It wasn't even billed as SAO. There was one major similarity between the two: people trapped inside a computer game. Everything else was different. So if you were expecting SAO to come out of Log Horizon, you would naturally be disappointed. And that would be on you for having unreasonable expectations rather than the show for not meeting them.
>> ARTICLE
It's best not to compare it to SAO at all. Other than the stuck in a game premise they are completely different.
>> ARTICLE
Still. What's so appealing about Log Horizon?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the better question is, what's so appealing about SAO? 
>> ARTICLE
To each with their own opinion I guess. That's why I'm asking, the first two episodes of Log Horizon were pretty *meh* and I'm not attracted to *meh*.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I thought it was pretty weak, it was boring throughout and at the end it even degraded into a lot harem shenanigans. I'd say the target age group for SAO is lower than LH's but even then Log Horizon just leaves much to be desired and would've fared so much better as a single-cour anime. There were good episodes, but the ones with the younger kids and other useless episodes eclipsed those that were actually productive and interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
Someone mentioned that Log Horizon was actually a morning show while SAO was aired in the evening suggesting that the target audience was much lower for Log Horizon (the light novel was for older audience compared to the anime). I mean SAO is currently rated "M for mature" on some sites. Not too sure about Log Horizon, haven't seen any sites giving it a official rating yet (I think MAL may be "14" like some sites rate SAO).  
>> ARTICLE
LH airs at 5:30 pm. That's an evening to me
>> ARTICLE
Really wonder why someone said it was 10 am, I'll try and look for the post. 
>> ARTICLE
That (plus or minus a couple of hours) was when the streams went live on THIS side of the Lake. In Japan, it aired in late afternoon. Here, it hit mid-morning.

Time zone calculations are always what confuses these types of posts. 
>> ARTICLE
I stuck with Log Horizon until episode 16, but I just got bored. It could have really benefited from more action scenes. At least SAO did action scenes well. Not that SAO should be compared to Log Horizon, I'm just saying that a anime inside a MMO should be more action, and less "playing house"
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely slower than SAO, but it's more focused. There aren't a lot of random side-stories that string into nothing (from what I remember of SAO). If you're looking for constant action though, that's not Log Horizon.
>> ARTICLE
You shouldn't compare the two they are nothing alike except they are both trapped in a game.

Log Horizon focuses more on portraying MMO's and teamwork/learning, while SAO is more about the action, drama, and romance.
>> ARTICLE
I am suspecting that Selector Infected WIXOSS & Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou will be dropping off that Top10 Spring list as we go through the season.

>> ARTICLE
I understand totally. I have it hard enough finishing one show at a time and waiting till a show is complete to finish it while still watching shows from last season or two seasons ago. I did watch some every week though 
>> ARTICLE
Forgive the super late post! My parents came by this weekend so I was ~~too busy hiding my porn stash~~ shopping with them and forgot to post it earlier. 

I got really into *Shiki* this past two weeks, despite having so many misgivings about it earlier. I found that episode 7 was a real turning point in terms of how the plot began to pace itself and how everything has started to come together towards a head-on collision between the villagers and the vampires. 

In some ways, I'm reminded of my thoughts on *Steins;Gate*. For as "slow" as the beginning portion was (which, in an apparent bucking of the /r/anime trend, I quite enjoyed), it was necessary to provide set up for the latter half. In doing so, it created greater immersion when shit finally hit the fan, making each visceral globule of poop hit ever harder against each fanblade. 

tl;dr if you like atmospheric horror (don't worry, its not too gorey, I wouldn't watch it otherwise), definitely check out *Shiki*. 


>> ARTICLE
Thanks, that makes me more eager to watch it. I think I remember trying Shiki a long time ago, but I couldn't get into it. I look forward to the globules of poop hitting the fanblades and smacking me right in the face.
>> ARTICLE
> In some ways, I'm reminded of my thoughts on Steins;Gate. For as "slow" as the beginning portion was (which, in an apparent bucking of the /r/anime[1] trend, I quite enjoyed), it was necessary to provide set up for the latter half.

I never really understood this complaint. I was drawn in from the very beginning of Steins;Gate, as were all of my friends who watched it with me. I didn't hear any of the slow pacing complaints until I discovered this sub. Just because there's no action doesn't mean that the pacing is slow, you know?

Shiki has been on my backlog for too long. I'll have to start it soon.
>> ARTICLE
I tried to watch it but couldn't. but that's cause I think I'm a backshift worker and was trying to watch it like at 5 in the morning where I generally need something to really draw me in.

It's something I will def revisit when I have more time though.
>> ARTICLE
That's certainly understandable. I wouldn't want to watch anything at that hour, let alone Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
When I first introduced one of my friends to Steins;Gate he was on his phone for a few episodes before it finally interested him, so he could be immersed in it. Now he loves it.
>> ARTICLE
"not too gorey" eeeeeeeehhh your standards may be a little lower than the norm, take heed fellow readers.  :3

Do you mean my standard for "not too gorey" is way gorier than average? Because believe me, it's the opposite; I still feel physically ill thinking about the *concept* of *The Human Centipede*.

**Sakamichi no Apollon - Kids on the Slope (12/12)**

At a recent 'Rate my MAL' thread someone recommended me to watch the show as it was in my 'plan to watch'. I had postponed watching it a lot for a stupid reason and I'm glad I finally did watch it. 

I love anime about music but it exceeded my expectations. All the characters were so good, the story was great and the music was glorious. I enjoyed the animation and characters design, it was also pretty unlike most recent shows. The setting... It kind of made me yearn for a time without computers and all that. You'll probably understand what I mean if you've watched it. 

I rated it a 9, it was very good all-around and right up my alley genre-wise.

[Monogatari Series: Second Season \(1-13/26\)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17074/Monogatari_Series:_Second_Season)

Was not expecting Araragi to [](/s "AFK for the first few episodes.") Thanks to that though, we see some character development as well as some interactions we wouldn't see in a standard harem. Still the same series, however it does seem like the stakes have risen somewhere along the point, with some of the new characters introduced. I haven't watched past 13, but I have a hunch that two of the new characters [](/s "The Gaen lady +hit team and Oshino Ougi, especially as both appear to "know everything"")will clash directly by the end. There were some heart wrenching moments (already yea), and overall its the best of the series so far. Also slight change in my preference, shinobu is now best girl.

Kara no Kyoukai Ep 1


...I have absolutely no idea what is going on. Might have to watch that again to see if I missed anything...

Animation was as expected by ufotable though, the fight scene was glorious. And also [this](http://i.imgur.com/V9KfHgF.png)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I was exactly like that when I finished the 1st movie. It'll explain everything as you watch the next movies. 

Btw awesome, awesome series. Shiki is best girl

I'm the same with Kara No Kyoukai. I've only watched the first movie. It was very confusing. But my god, [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANlBf9TbFN0). It's perfect in both animation and soundtrack. That piece of music that begins at 0:58 gives me chills every time I go back to listen to it. The composer is the same one that composed the soundtracks for Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero. She also set up the group Kalafina, who did [this ED for Puella Magi Madoka Magica](http://www.pideo.net/video/xuite/8afef8193bb8fb64/) (careful, some ad's on that page might be **NSFW**) among other things.

**Hunter x Hunter- 1-77** (over the past 2 weeks but I want to talk about it all now)

So I saw this being mentioned a crap ton on here so started watching it on Netflix a few weeks back.  I originally just watched a few episodes at a time while doing other stuff, and while I didn't find it super deep or anything at first it wasn't bad, and I watched the first 2  (3?) arcs with nearly no expectations and was pretty chill with them.

The Hunter Exam arc was a neat intro to the variety of characters that become common throughout the series.  We met our 4 protagonists, the best guy that is Hisoka, and were introduced to the idea that there would be no fair fights, only brutal curbstomp battles.  However, there was nothing too deep or interesting here, and it was pretty damn cheesy at parts.  The final battle was pretty sweet though, and I enjoyed that thoroughly.  7/10 for this arc.

I basically skipped the Zoldyck arc, and feel like I missed out on little.  I watched the first couple episodes and the last few to get a gist of what happened and was fine with what I saw.

Heaven's Arena was pretty cool, and I really liked the design of Nen.  It was a power that was based on one's own skill and attitude that didn't seem super cheesy or blatantly overpowered.  Other than that, more of the same in terms of battles, besides the [HxH](/s "Hisoka vs Kastroh fight, which was super cool and a great intro to the power of nen.")  Other than that, the arc was satisfying and kept me interested.  8/10

Yorknew City, on the other hand, was a completely different animal.  The Phantom Troupe were just nameless evil group 134 before, being mentioned by people but not seeming like the most interesting or deep villains.  And for a few episodes that was the case, with little to no motivation being given to them and me finding no reason to like them.  However, as the arc went on, i found myself [HxH](/s "empathizing less and less with a more rage diven Kurapika (who was a total badass) and more with this bizarro murder/thief family who I intuitively knew were evil but found myself believing that they were more the protagonists than Kurapika at more than one point.  Kudos to the author for that.")  Also: nen, and Hisoka.  I like Hisoka. 9/10

Greed Island I marathoned a little on Friday but mostly all of Saturday, and found it comparable to Heaven's Arena.  Nothing super deep, but plenty of cool stuff, and more Nen and Hisoka. 8/10

So far Hunter x Hunter has been a solid 8/10 for me, and I hear that the next arc is supposed to be the best, which I'm looking forward to. Hoping for more Hisoka, Nen (lol like that'll not happen), and more battles that are slightly even, as those have all been my favorite fights.  That said, [HxH](/s "Killua passing the Hunter Exam in one event was pretty freaking hilarious.")

**Steins;Gate** (2/24)

Time to see what all the fuss is about! Two episodes in, and I already am loving this show to death. The script is absolutely fantastic, probably the best in any anime I've ever seen. J. Michael Tatum is an amazing voice actor, I can't get enough of Rintarou! I was practically sucked in the second he started talking. And now I finally know where "Tuturu!" comes from, I've always wondered about that. I can already tell Steins;Gate is gonna be every bit as good as it's hyped up to be. I'm not one for prematurely rating a show, but if I don't end up giving it a 10/10, I'm going to be shocked.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (52/64)

This show getting good! There have been a few moments in the story where I've gone "Holy shit." And you gotta love Ed constantly referring to Father as "That bearded bastard." I can totally see why this show is so highly rated. Now I just need to wait for the last twelve episodes because whoever was in charge of the show's upload onto Netflix is an asshole, though luckily my library has the Part 5 DVD.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion** (26/26)

So that was an interesting watch. It was good and I definitely enjoyed it, yet I felt sort of underwhelmed. The first 16 episodes were good. Then it got really good for the next 8. And I downright hated the last 2 episodes, am I alone in that? Overall, NGE is good, if somewhat overrated. I liked it enough to get the first two Rebuild movies (because holy shit, is the original show expensive!), and I look forward to End of Evangelion. I give it a 7/10 (though episodes 18-24 are definitely an 8/10).
>> ARTICLE
I was the same as you with Steins;Gate, watched it to see what the fuss was about, and instantly fell in love with it. If you're already in love with it 2 episodes in, you're in for a journey. Seriously is a 10/10 show. Oh there's a movie aswel btw,I didn't notice till a week after I finished the show

Watch End of Evangelion. Seriously good stuff. The last 2 episodes happen during the movie. It all makes sense if you've seen it.

Also, make sure you watch the end of Brotherhood. Such a fucking great ending to a fucking great show. Really. I didn't want to watch shows anymore after I finished it. I just felt like I'd be okay ending my tv show watching career with Brotherhood. Of course that is considering the show as a whole. Once you finish it, and start looking back on all that happened throughout, shit, I remember feeling just how good that felt, knowing I was "there" through all of that. So much awesomeness coming your way, like some of the best parts of the show

>it all makes sense once you have seen it

Yeah, maybe not all of it, but I'd still say watch it.

EoE is pretty much necessary after watching NGE because it happens simultaneously with eps 25 and 26, which occur inside Shinji's mind, and EoE is what happens outside.

So I started **Hunter x Hunter** last Monday.

You know you always hear that people start it and end up watching all of it in a matter of days? Yeah, that nearly happened to me if I hadn't had to spend a few days preparing for a job interview. Currently on episode 87 and am completely loving it so far.

The sudden dark turn in the Chimera Ant arc really shocked me, the series has had a few dark moments so far but the Chimera Ant arc really does put them to shame.
>> ARTICLE
Oof I feel that.  I did 125 episodes in 6 days.  I envy you my friend, some of my favorite episodes are still ahead of you.  I hope you don't hear back from the job interview for a couple of days because I guarantee you are gonna wanna dedicate your life to finishing the show asap.

Yeah the Chimera Ant arc get so dark so quickly. The Yorknew city arc wasnt all that dark but more of how smart Kurapika is.

**Gatchaman Crowds (Complete)**

---

I don't even know where to start with this thing. Internet culture? Subverting Super Sentai shows? The unflappable belief in the goodness of human nature? The god-tier OP? The fact that I really should have taken better notes?

Let's start at the beginning. What the hell is Gatchaman? Well, Science Ninja Team Gatchaman is an old Super Sentai-style anime from the 70s about a group of heroes with science-themed powers and bird-themed costumes. Okay, then what the hell is *this thing*?! GatchaCrowds retains some of its predecessor's trappings, but ditches the narrative, setting, and tone for something *completely different*. So what is it actually about, then? Why, the internet of course! Yeah, GatchaCrowds is a weird show. It's also a smart show. And that has everything to do with how GatchaCrowds ties its two disparate motifs together. How do you make a Super Sentai anime also a meditation on culture and human nature in the digital age? As it turns out, it's actually quite simple: you just personify the pros and cons of unlimited information and connectivity as respectively the hero and villain of the story. Our principal heroine, Hajime, is a living advocate for transparency and open communication. She believes in the power for society to be more than the sum of its parts. She is endlessly optimistic, and constantly asserting her identity with refrains of "I'm Hajime". She believes in peoples' base nature to be essentially good. One of Hajime's first acts as a Gatchaman is to befriend the mischievous aliens known as "MESS" via their common interest in arts and crafts, much to the dismay of her new colleagues. In an era of unprecedented human connectivity, the kind of heroism the Gatchaman embody is obsolete, argues Hajime implicitly. But heroism isn't the only thing that has changed in the digital age. Bad people willing to do bad things have also gained a nearly unlimited platform and the power of anonymity. Enter our villain, the alien Berge Katze(voiced by the fantastic Mamoru Miyano). Berg Katze is basically what would happen if The Joker's twitter account magically came to life. He is the living embodiment of an internet troll. He cares only for discord and self-satisfaction, and he gets them by literally stealing other people's identities. Not content with simple destruction, Berg Katze prefers to light the fires and watch as the people he manipulates fan the flames. Some men just want to watch the world burn, and Berg Katze is literally flame-baiting. This basic premise robs both Hajime and Berg Katze of a certain level of nuance, though. They play out more like forces of nature than actual characters. In another story, Hajime would suck tension and relatability out of a narrative like a Mary Sue Black Hole, but GatchaCrowds is not just another story. 

As I said, it's a smart show. And it balances out its monolithic non-characters with an equally compelling cadre of supporting characters. Chief of whom is Rui, creator of a massively popular social networking app called GALAX. The slogan for GALAX, "It's not heroes that will update the world. It's us.", is probably the closest thing to a thesis statement that GatchaCrowds has. So how great is Rui? Rui is pretty damn great, and he can rock a skirt and opera gloves like nobody's fucking business. Rui essentially occupies the fallacious middle ground between Hajime and Katze, deftly grounding the show's high-concept ideas in a relatable human conflict and tying the show's myriad themes to a central core. Rui uses GALAX, and his own eponymous Crowds power, to compel individuals towards a selfless horizontal society. And given an entire society of Hajimes, maybe that would work. But the dehumanizing and anonymous nature of GALAX ultimately proves to be a double-edged sword for Rui's ideals. People are individuals, and will always assert their personal understanding even in a faceless crowd. Rui's unwillingness to rely on "heroes" simply creates a power vacuum that nearly brings his ideals crashing down around him. 

The Gatchaman themselves(including Aya Hirano as a talking Space Panda), while not quite as prominent in the narrative as Rui, are explored well enough and play at interesting take-downs of standard Sentai Hero archetypes for those familiar with them. I could probably write a paragraph about each of them, but I'd be here all night. So just trust me when I say that the characters are good in just about every way I think characters should be good. They're dynamic, nuanced, well-realized and well-utilized. 

If I were forced to address GatchaCrowds' weaknesses, they would most certainly be its technical merits. While the show is bursting with style and aesthetic flair(the bird-themed Sentai power-suits all look rad as hell), this was clearly a show with a very limited budget and production schedule. The use of CG is pretty liberal and not exactly outstanding. Character models seem a little more fluid and abstract than they probably should, and the actual animation can be stiff and lifeless. The show also includes an unfortunate recap episode, though it is admittedly used to brilliantly poignant effect. 

Gatchaman Crowds exudes the air of a passion project. It's messy and loud, and packed with interesting ideas and thoughtful themes. I have the sneaking suspicion the initial pitch for this show was just a generic original Sentai show, and the Gatchman name was only attached arbitrarily to pull in more financial backers. Still, however or why-ever this show exists, I'm glad it does. Equal parts stylish-as-fuck Super Sentai anime and optimistic rumination on internet culture, Gatchaman Crowd is a hell of a lot of fun.
>> ARTICLE
Great read as always. Definitely bumped the show up in my nonsense PTW queue. 

Also I totally have you tagged as "Senpai" now.
>> ARTICLE
I've been looking into Gatchaman Crowds recently. I have rather fond memories of the US-ian bastardization of Kagaku Ninja-gai Gatchaman known as Battle Of The Planets, but I already know that the two have very little to do with each other.

I may have to put Crowds on the Watch Sooner part of my List.

Really good read, GC is one of my favorites. Fun characters, good humor and story, and that god-tier OST.

**Bakemonogatari (15/15)**

I absolutely loved the character interactions, it is probably the one of the most enjoyable ones I've seen in a long time. The biggest gripe I had with the series is that the plot did not seem that interesting to me overall. 

**Tokyo Ghoul (3/12)**

I've been holding off on this since I've recently finished the manga and was waiting for the BD releases so I could watch it in its uncensored glory. Without even comparing it to the manga, it generally had some weird pacing and felt really rushed. On its own however, I thought the series was actually not too bad,  [Tokyo ghoul EP. 12 spoiler](/s "especially the parallels between the first episode and the end scene of the last episode where in the first episode he was forced to eat, but in the 12th episode he chose to eat himself."). The switching of the arcs was also kind of weird too from what I could tell. The plus side though is I love Sora Amamiya as Touka, she fits perfectly to what I imagine Touka to be. 
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari has almost no plot, it's an extremely character-driven narrative. Though SS has more plot stuff than the other seasons.

Eureka Seven 13/50.

I finally started this show and oh man do I ever love it. 

I can't get enough of it. I heard to stay from AO though.
>> ARTICLE
First time doing one of these.

[Please play this music while reading to get the full experience,^bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJr82_VZoQc)

**Boku No Pico**

Man, this OVA. I was recommended by my friends at /a/, so I knew I was in for a treat.

If I could pinpoint what this OVA is about, it's about *finding yourself*. By the end of the OVA, Pico has truly found himself. Sure, a cliche, but Boku executed it flawlessly.  You can really tell how much passion [Katsuyoshi Yatabe](http://myanimelist.net/people/11333/Yatabe_Katsuyoshi) put into directing it. The OVA contains quite a bit of symbolism. For instance, the cactus. The cactus is a symbol of Pico's trust(or lack of trust if you wanna look at it that way) of his lover, Mokkun. Pico is shown to be enjoying himself all throughout the scene, while still being somewhat not trusting of Mokkun. This type of shit continues throughout the OVA. There is a ton of symbolism in the first half alone, but I need to watch it again a few more times to fully grasp it.

The sex scenes are more like *love making* scenes if you ask me. Some of the most passionate scenes in animation are in one single OVA, *holy shit*.

The music is nothing short of AMAZING. OP/ED are great. I have them downloaded into my iPod touch. the voice acting is some top notch shit. Truly this is [Mariko Sakou's](http://myanimelist.net/people/28445/Mariko_Sakou) best work. She nails down the whole "boy who looks really fucking feminine that a grown man wants to fuck him" thing. 

What can I say about the animation? Possibly [Natural High's](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?p=266) magnjum opus. Goddamn, [Redline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t26m_Q6ENo) ain't got shit on Boku no Pico.

Enjoyment? I enjoyed every minute of this masterpiece, no doubt. **FUCKING 10/10** 

I'm looking forward to watching the sequels.

P.S. I finished watching Mushishi Zoku Shou, it's pretty good.

>> ARTICLE
I don't even know how I'm still sane after watching these shows.

**Strike the Blood (ep 10-24):**

I hate this show. Not for the sole reason that it's bad, but because it's so bad that it's actually really fucking good. I hate a lot of things about this show, but at the same time I can't help myself but be entertained. This is one of those shows that you just can't take seriously. Heck, even the show doesn't know when it wants to be serious and when it wants to be silly. 

I honestly stopped caring about the plot and just kinda watched over how the harem grows (in a sense that Akatsuki's juggling romantic scenes between the girls). The girls, [the occasional shenanigans](http://i.imgur.com/UK0eDVa.png), and the [final arc (SPOILERS)](http://i.imgur.com/dQTkMTp.png) were the only things that stood out for me. In the end, I ended up liking this show a lot and I felt sad when I finished it. Definitely one of my guilty pleasure shows. **8/10**

--------------

**Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara:**

This show. I don't even know what just happe- wait, hold on. 

> *"I don't even"*. 

That pretty much sums up my experience watching this beautiful trainwreck. I was expecting a Moe/Harem/SoL show but it completely [180'd my expectations](http://i.imgur.com/qCtErCZ.png), which in itself wasn't really a bad thing but you can tell that they're trying too hard to be different. I really can't say much about this anime. I really like the OP, one of the best I've ever listened to. I think I like the show because I don't hate it, but if you'd make me explain the plot at gunpoint I'd probably grab your hand and pull the trigger. Other than that, the harem was good, being supportive of each other and all. Apparently the LNs are still ongoing and there's an OVA coming up which I'm looking forward to. Hopefuly it's nothing like the second half of the series.

Plot twist. Plot Twist! PLOT TWIST. Plot twist? Fuck it. **8/10**

----------------------

**Seikoku no Dragonar:**

I'm going to be completely honest. I didn't like this show. StB and KGFWO had their fair share of problems, but despite that I enjoyed them for what they are. But this one? I think I spent more time letting out disgruntled sighs than paying attention to my screen. Art, animation, writing, and soundtracks are all mediocre at best. Also, this show is like 30% tentacle rape which is more than enough for anything that isn't a H-title. 

Anyways, there are only few things worth mentioning about this show, like [based KanaHana's](http://youtu.be/fNJDOHku4tA) [aggressive oujo-voice](http://youtu.be/9hvtrmIQT1I) (slightly NSFW), revelation of Veronica's secret of being a [ ](/s "hardcore closet Sis-con."), and some legitimately funny moments which are extremely occasional. Most of the VAs were really good too. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you're in it for the Ecchi and girls blushing. **5/10**

------------------

**Kyoukai no Kanata (ep 1-6):**

I just finished the [ ](/s "Idol episode") and I don't even know what to say. I haven't laughed so hard at something so absurd and adorable in a long time that I completely forgot that this show had plot for the past 5 episodes. I'm pleased by this. Other than that, this show has been pretty interesting story-wise regarding both MC's pasts and how the world works around them. KyoAni's art and animations are stellar as usual, but I did catch some  la Kill la Kill still frames which didn't bother me that much. OP and ED are gorgeous. [This show](http://i.imgur.com/4DjkJTE.jpg) is gorgeous. [These guys' moves](http://i.imgur.com/8hSpWNk.gif) are gorgeous. And this [rat-thing](http://i.imgur.com/XDEO3Mg.gif) is gorgeous too. **~9/10**

I started reading your description of Kyoukai No Kanata with "Kara No Kyoukai" automatically in my head (since it's late, and I'm tired), and then I read the following lines:

Someone else who likes Kyoukai no Kanata, whoa. The plot's actually really good imo, more solid than other stuff that's out nowadays.

I gave it a 9/10, [PLOT SPOILERS ACTUALLY DON'T MOUSE OVER THIS UNTIL YOU'RE FINISHED](/s "ending ruined it, needed to be either she really did pce out or imo if her glasses were on the roof that would've been the perfect ending")

It wasn't an episode of *Kanojo ga Flag* without at least 3 plot twists per episode. And I'm pretty sure that final episode threw at least half a dozen around. It's such a wild trainwreck that I couldn't help but enjoy.

You might wanna check out *Rokujouma no Shinryakusha*. Similar kind of harem set up with it's fair share of comedy harem hijinks, but it actually knows how to balance it with a good serious story and pretty solid character development. Definitely hoping for a season 2 with that one.

No Senpai, this is *our* guilty pleasure!

Had a tough time trying to decide what I wanted to watch. Finished WIXOSS and haven't had much time to watch the non-weekly stuff before this past week.

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (2/27)** - Started Gurren Lagann. Liked what I saw, saving it for a future date

**Future Diary (1/26)** - Watched the first episode of Future Diary while trying to decide which series I wanted to watch next. Liked what I saw, definitely going to come back to it.

And the winner is...

**Baccano! (5/12)** - Started Baccano on Halloween night and I've fallen in love. I love the 1930's mafia setting, with all the alchemy stuff about the wine of immortality mixed in, and I love the characters.

YES! A new Baccano! fan. Don't forget to watch the OVAs after the original 13 eps. They're kind of necessary.

[Durarara!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6746/Durarara!!) **(5/24)**  - Trying to start and finish finish it in prep for S2 this winter. 

It's been kinda slow going so far through 5 episodes. The narrating/flashback stuff is starting to become a bore, but I hope it picks up soon.

Also, [Code Geass R1](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch) **(15/25)** - in between. 
>> ARTICLE
My biggest issue with Durarara is that it's so hard to recommend to people who aren't dedicated to just watching all the anime they can or who weren't already Bacanno fans because it is so slow and jumpy in the beginning. It really *does* pick up towards the end though. And I think the season 2 material will be worth the watch. Hang in there!  
>> ARTICLE
I just got stuck on Durarara too. I'm on episode 21. I get frustrated when conflict in the story line is essentially the product of miscommunication. It's almost like Watamote for me when I have to keep pausing because it's too annoying/ cringe-worthy. 
>> ARTICLE
Picked up Durarara Today, episode 4. I'm really digging it. It's a lot of fun, and the storytelling is very strong. Characters are great, but there's a lot of them and characterization is a little slow so far. As in, it's taking time to get to know them. But they're all having fun, except for suicide-chan. And Celty I guess but I dunno, she's interesting. She's almost okay with being who she is. She does good. I'd be cool with that. 

I really enjoyed how the first two episodes were woven together. Is that what good directing is? I dunno I'm no film critic. 

Looking forward to this ride.

I completed both Kill la Kill and Full Metal Panic this week. Also I started Bakemonogatari this morning and I think I'm going to finish it today... so this has apparently been a productive week.

I also did Kill la Kill this week and I really enjoyed it! It was well animated, had excellent VAs, was funny, kind of sexy and made me seriously consider how Mikisugi's nipples were glowing. I decided he must wear glow in the dark pasties.

Kill la Kill broke every expectation I had. It's now one of my favorite shows. Still coming to terms with that.

Me too. At times their low budget showed, but the designs were fantastic. What sold it for me though was the story, most shows trying to be serious don't pull off something that good. Also Satsuki was really well written, I loved her plans. But yeah, I am eagerly looking foreword to more from them.

I didn't watch anything not currently airing until Friday when I watched:

**Hanamonogatari** Whole thing in one sitting, though I had to take breaks for trick-or-treaters.  I'm a fan of Monogatari and I enjoyed it.  I love Kanbaru and was glad to see her after how scarce her appearance was in SS, and it was cool seeing Araragi's flowing locks.  A solid story, more of Shaft's artsy-fartsy though it seemed they toned down some things and tuned up others.  Looking forward to Tsuki and Kizu when ;-;

**Evangelion and EoE** I can thank /u/DrJamesFox for finally getting me to watch this.  Started it late Friday night and just finished EoE.  I really enjoyed it and can see why it's a classic.  It's unique and it makes you ask yourself some important questions.  That being said I have some serious issues with it.  One is that I don't like ambiguity, which is how both the series and the movie ended.  I understand that it let's you draw your own conclusions and because it gave me that freedom this is what I've come up with.  Also there comes a point where IMO you get into the range of too much symbolism.  Symbolism needs a solid base, it can't stand on its own and symbolism for symbolism's sake is hit-or-miss.  Maybe my opinion would change if I watched any of the Rebuilds, but I'll probably always think of it as influential but to me it'll never be a masterpiece.  I'd love to read a critical analysis on it by someone more inclined to literary critique.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Neon Genesis Evangelion for the first time.  I watched up to episode 24, then went over and saw EoE.

For me, it was like reading a book like...The Jungle or the Invisible Man or The Scarlet Letter; I wasn't entertained by it as much I was just in awe of it. I thought the whole thing was amazing. 

-- I don't know if I enjoyed it, but I thought it was amazing and that was enough for me.

I decided to watch FMA Brotherhood randomly.

Back a few years ago, I kind of avoided it because I thought the MC was a bit overbearing sometimes (when I was younger, I always wanted the MC to be cool in some way, and Edward wasn't that cool of a MC at times).

This is a terrible reason to not watch something though, so off I start
>> ARTICLE
[Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5682/Phantom:_Requiem_for_the_Phantom). Holy shit. I'm only like 8 episodes in but so far this show is pretty amazing. It's about a Japanese tourist who after witnessing a murder is kidnapped and has his memory wiped and then is forced to become an assassin. Lots of crazy action and gunfights, but also a lot of psychological bits about what it really means to kill someone. It seems like a lot of shows tend to glorify murder to an extent so it's interesting to see a show that explores how terrible it really is not only for the one in front of the gun but also the one pulling the trigger. I highly recommend you guys give this one a try.

Let's see here.

**Persona 4: The Animation**  
Status - COMPLETE   

Honestly, I stopped paying attention after a while. I was excessively bored throughout the entire show, and I would rather have never picked this piece of crap up to begin with... But it's cleared now after almost a year on my Dropped list. And having an empty Dropped List is a reward in and of itself, so I don't regret a single minute.

Actually, I do. I've just become a *lot* more picky about the anime I pick up. Nothing is worth sitting there bored off my ass. While not comprehending anything at all that is going on is not my idea of entertainment, it might have been redeemable if they had given me a reason to care about the characters. But they didn't, so it wasn't. 

Score: 3/10  
Recommendation level: Ask someone else.

**Le Portrait de Petit Cossette** 
Status - COMPLETE

Normally, I don't like this kind of thing. Yet it was Halloween, so something a bit more on the spooky side is called for. Yet I would call this one more Lovecraftian suspense than straight horror. There was a *lot* of blatant headfuckery involved here, and that's as close as I'm going to come to a spoiler here. 

Score: 8/10  
Recommendation level: Happy Halloween  

**AD Police**  
Status: COMPLETE

I'm slowly but surely working my way through the entire Bubblegum Crisis universe, and AD Police was yet another excellent example of how to do police anime right: three OVA episodes that kept you deep in the dirt and grime of civilization and never let you come up for a breath of fresh smog. 

Even if you can't stand older anime, keep these in mind. Because they are *all* worth it.

Score: 7/10  
Recommendation Level: It's the best of the 80s.

**AiKa**  
Status: COMPLETE

Oh. Hell. Yeah. One of the anime titles that epitomizes the phrase "tits and ass". And there is plenty of it to go around. If you don't like fanservice, pantyshots, bouncing boobs, and short short skirts, then you will not like AiKa. If, however, you're a dirty filthy letch like myself, keep it in mind.

Score: 6/10  
Recommendation Level: Self-evident.

On-Deck: Chuu2 Ren or Kyousou Giga

**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun**
This might be a little late to the party but I just want to talk about this show. Holy Shit this show is pretty amazing. I just got back into anime after taking a seven year break because Naruto left a bad taste with all of the filler episodes. I have been watching exclusively action anime's with humor (Space Dandy, FLCL, Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Redline). The only reason I heard about this anime is because of the post of the Japanese guys dancing to the opening and thought it was really catchy. I watched the first episode and fell in love. The story is amazing, the dialogue is absolutely superb. This show made me cry of laughter and cringe so hard it was an amazing experience. This show could not have come at a better time for me personally because I was kind of getting burnt out. But in conclusion this show is amazing and I hope to God they do a second season.

**Code Geass R2** (Dubbed) (25/25) - I watched season 1 and decided to not go straight onto R2 and left it a couple of weeks to watch other shows. (Guilty Crown and Psycho-Pass 1) I gave Season 1 an 8 but this season deserves a 10, better English VA direction this time around, more epic plot twists than last season, even more epic mecha battles.  An excellent story with a surprising ending. 
I prefer shows where the first half is good, but the second half is freaking awesome and this show delivered compared to others where the first half is awesome but the second is poor. (Looking at you Guilty Crown.)

**Death Note** (Dubbed) (22/37) - Currently drip watching this on Netflix. Enjoyable but not on the have to keep watching level of other shows. Hope it picks up when I get to the next arc.

Started watching White Album 2. Really liking it so far, even though i'm only 4 episodes in. 

I'm waiting for Touma's loner attitude to crack is exciting and I can't wait to see how her repeated slips of trust to the other two end up letting her open up. Setsuna is great too. She understands a lot about herself and just hesitates at reaching out and I think its a great way to show a confident character but one that still doesn't know how to act towards friends. Loving ti so far.

I marathoned [Yowamushi Pedal](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18179/Yowamushi_Pedal) over the last two days. It's incredible. No other anime has left me with a constant shit eating grin like this one did.

After a break from anime (didn't watch any since mid summer) I decided to marathon anime when I had free time until I got bored. That started 2.5-3 weeks ago. Came on reddit and just starting putting random things I hadn't seen yet into my favorites bar folder for anime.

2-3 weeks later I've gone start to finish on Fate Zero(both seasons), Pet Girl of Sakurasou, Spice and Wolf(both seasons), All Monogatari series, Sakura Trick, Black Rock Shooter, Melancholy of Haruhi (both seasons+movie), and some of K-on! on top of currently a couple airing shows.

This broke my non-stop 5 week destiny obsession, wonder what will break this one. Although these are all pretty popular around here so they probably didn't help people find anything new to watch.

**Wolf's Rain 18/25** - I think this is the third time I've tried to watch Wolf's Rain. Both the previous two times I believe I just lost interest about half-way through, not consciously dropping it, just forgetting to pick it back up. This time I'll probably end up finishing it. I don't think it's a bad show, even if it took me three attempts to finish it. The setting is interesting, the animation is gorgeous. The main problem I have is that I find the main wolf quartet to be quite uninteresting. The humans, the nobles and the episodic characters are all interesting. I just can't bring myself to like the main wolves.


This isn't precisely an anime, but I'll include it since it is a very anime centered show. I've been watching the live action adaption of **[Blue Blazes](http://myanimelist.net/manga.php?id=25292)** these last couple of weeks, and I'm honestly quite impressed. I haven't watched many live action adaptions of manga/anime before, but my general impression of them was that they're for the most part all pretty bad and cheap looking. Blue Blazes is legitimately funny and surprisingly well made, you can tell the ones involved had a blast making it. I also find it interesting from a historical perspective. Blue Blazes takes place at Osaka University of Arts in 1980/81 with Anno Hideaki, Akai Takami and Yamaga Hiroyuki being side characters and classmates of the main character, and you're witnessing the foundation of Gainax happening in the background.

Also you'll learn [everything you'd ever want to know about the opening of Cyborg 009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16PAGIcIf9g).

x-post from /r/TrueAnime thread:

**Durarara!** Rewatch: E7

Heiwajima Shizuos up to bat. And he says he hates violence.

He cant control his rage, and when he snaps, and he [literally snaps](http://i.imgur.com/MR86N4Y.png) whatever hes holding and crushes it underfoot, his adrenaline rush takes over and wreaks havoc. Also his bones snap. Lots of snapping. The visual cues in this show are very well timed, and there are subtler ones too for those rewatching.

Shinra knew Shizuo as a kid too, another interesting connection. 

Shizuo chose to stop trying to control his Hulk transformation since its uncontrollable anyways and he just accepts it. He still doesnt understand why hes like this, since as he says, there was nothing special about his upbringing and he has no trauma.

Shizuos relationship with Kasuka is nice, and it explains why he always wears bartender clothes. Kasukas deadpan outward demeanor contrasts with Shizuos random outbursts of anger. 

Now we know why he has a grudge against Izaya, who was a huge jerk to him. 

The irony of Shizuos situation is that he [says he] dislikes violence but his identity to most of the Ikebukuro residents *is* violence. 

Kasuka is what keeps Shizuo grounded. Shizuos story shows how those close to us have a big impact on our lives and how we live and rely on others to keep moving forward. He's similar to Celty and the others because he is also trying to find his own place in the world, which is shown to be difficult in how his Hulk-mode ruins his efforts at working any job. For now he is content to work as a bodyguard.

**Clannad** Rewatch: E7-12

Fuuko arc ended, Kotomi's arc starts. I question the decision to put so much time into the two weakest characters, but what's done is done. The beginning of Kotomi's arc feels awkward and shoehorned because it's just Okazaki barging in on her life and helping her make friends on a whim. I don't remember much of Kotomi's arc so this is sort of fresh to me. I enjoy the comedy a lot which probably helps me stay invested through the meandering pace. Don't really have too much to say at this point. There's bits and pieces of foreshadowing that I didn't notice the first time around.

**Revolutionary Girl Utena:** E4-6, x-post from /r/anime thread since I think my E5 thoughts are actually decently organized.

*****

**E4:**

This is something different. Starting with the beginning of the duel, and then flashing back to whatever started it. Mickey wants to finish his piano piece, but hes stuck at the same spot and cant find the right note to move forward. Looks like the song is for/about Anthy? 

Stopwatch, how does it work. Yep, seems like Anthy is what lets Mickey move forward in his music. Pretty clear that it represents his feelings. Interesting how he uses a stopwatch, and he himself is sort of paused or stopped in his music/progression. 

Mickey seems like a decent fellow compared to the other members weve been introduced to so far. 

He says he wont duel Utena but we know that turns out to be untrue. 

Nanami is comically insane what the hell woman. 

That stopwatch again he seems to be clicking it everytime he either makes an appearance or is about to say something important. Dont know if the number it stops on means anything, but its different each time. 

So Anthy knows the piece that Mickey is trying to remember/write. And it reminds him of his sister. We know why he wants to duel now. 

*****

**E5:**

It opens with fencing, Mickeys other talent. Hes all motivated from finding his shining thing in Anthy. 

Caged bird motif going on in the flashback with his twin sister, representing the sisters feeling of being obligated to hold the concert against her wishes. Mickeys looking at Anthy for a replacement, but at the same time Utenas comment about not accepting a system that takes away personal freedom wouldnt let him do something like forcing Anthy into such a role just because. 

Repetition in narrative works is important as it draws attention to it, so when themes, motifs, and word choices are repeated, its probably important. As in Penguindrum, there are a few scenes that are repeated basically verbatim textually and visually, so these are important. The one about revolution ties into the title too so its obviously a big deal. 

More stopwatch. Mickey wants to stop the duels, stealing Utenas lines. 6 rabbit apple slices at the end. I dont know what that means. 

Seeing creepo Pres in the piano room causes discord in Mickey. All this talk of people as possessions is icky. I suppose thats sort of the point? That this system is bad and the only one who can win is one that wont actually make use of it? Well well have to see if Utena wins ultimately first. 

Mickeys stuck in the past. Might be related to his stopwatch habit. Now hes being the unwanted knight in shining armor for the damsel not in distress. If the other two were just straight up creepers so far, Mickeys the unneeded White Knight type. He isnt actually doing this for Anthys sake, hes doing it for his own selfish reasons. 

Shadow puppets talk of pirates and what you really desire. What Mickey really wants is his sister to play again, not a replacement. 

I didnt mention in last time because I dont really know jack-shit about biblical references, but the tower evokes that of Babel, which was supposed to reach heaven or something. Since the power to bring revolution is the power of Dios, which means God in pretty much any Romance language, it could be the path to God, or Gods power to change anything in the world.

Mickeys got his priorities all backwards. He wants to protect a single aspect of a whole person while ignoring the rest of this person as a person, which is pretty demeaning. HIs misunderstanding and hypocrisy is revealed and he loses for it. 

Oh man that revelation at the end was good stuff. Completely changes the way you look at Mickeys motivations, while not invalidating any of the things that happened. 

*****

**E6:**

Nanamis got a stalker. Miki and Utena seem to be on good terms despite the duel earlier. 

Pres and Anthy are probably talking about weeds or pests but Nanami thinks they want to kill her for some reason. Elaborate delusions. 

Even if youre the student council president, you cant just kill your own sister oh lordy lord, I love how they dont seem to be as outraged or horrified as they should be. Then theres the runaway horse. And the chickens.

The person who saved Nanami is probably the stalker. ...And this Tsuwabuki character doesnt look like the same guy, did she not see him? Or did we not get a reliable view of him either?

Dunno how camping and uncooked rice and watered down curry is supposed to relate to this. 

Shes treating him like a servant instead of a boyfriend what is going on in that mind of hers. 

Saionji shows up to voice his weird abuse/Stockholm syndrome fetish and gets denied hard. That awkward silence was greaaaat. 

Ahh here we finally get to the crux of this episode. Nanamis treating Tsuwabuki as a possession she can do whatever she wants to with because thats what everyone on this show does, treat their partners as possessions. And the show obviously disagrees. 

Nanami seems to have a tendency to almost get run over by things, car, horse, and bull. 

And Tsuwabuki joins Miki to the list of people who put the cart before the horse, except Tsuwabukis way farther gone than Miki is. Cause Nanami trouble in order to save her from trouble, damn bro that doesnt even make sense. 

Nanami stealth mode managed to sneak in a full set of archaic recording devices without anyone noticing. 

OH MY GOD NOW ITS A KANGAROO. WITH BOXING GLOVES. 

That was utterly ridiculous.

I finished up ***Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann*** this week and its a real good anime like everyone says. Kinda felt the Ending could been different but it was still good. I guess the [](/s "7 years time skip") would be my least favorite part it just felt different then where the anime looked like it was heading. Still a good show overall 8.5/10

Been watching ***Gintama*** lately too. Simple comedy and no 4th wall. only 10 eps in but it has been good so far. The one ep 9 was prob the funniest of all 8 ep i watched. Gintoki panicking how his theme song didnt start was funny. The episode wehre they meet sadaharu was pretty funny too

Also been watching ***Bleach*** as well since i got the first few volumes of the manga and decided to start watching it along with the Manga. SO far its ok and im watching it dubbed. 7 eps in so far. 

Thinking about starting Steins;gate or NGE soon since this sub hypes them up so much.

Golden Time - Status: **Complete** - I'm glad I just went through this in one day. I don't think I would have been able to deal with all my feelings if I had to wait week after week. I can see why this series had so much hype at the time. Everything was perfect about this series. I understand that the final volume of the LN was 400 pages and the it was quite hard to put that in 40ish minutes, but I think they did it amazingly. Banri x Kouko OTP.

Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru(My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU) - Status: **Complete** - I loved everything about the MC in this. Hikigaya gives no fucks about saying the truth and what's on his mind.

I enjoyed all the characters immensely...even Totsuka...the ultimate trap.

**Angel Beats! 8/10 **

Had an awesome concept, however the show introduced way to many characters for the few episodes it consists of. I personally felt no real emotional connection to the characters by the time the show ended [Angel Beats! Spoiler](/s "and by the time they all started disappearing it meant little to me") The show would have gained much by either cutting down on some of the characters or added more episodes so the viewers would get more attached to the characters. Angel Beats! also had some of the best in-show music IMO, GirlDeMo FTW.

**Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica 8/10**

The show in itself was pretty well made, it had a nice story and you managed to get attached to the characters even though there were so few episodes. However I really had some issue with the art style used in their animation, neither on the characters or the world in general and especially not when it came to the witches. But one thing Madoka Magica had going for them was the soundtrack and the ending theme especially.

**Kanon 2006 9/10**

Wow, I really have a soft spot for Kyoto animations big 3 it seems. Kanon was great! I love how they presented the story and the characters. Unfortunately since there were no After Story like in Clannad, the show didn't get me nearly as hard as Clannad AS. But it's still a really solid work by Kyoto. I generally love all the characters and each story arc they get. However I feel like Yuuichi doesn't get affected by each arc nearly as hard as he should [Kanon Spoiler](/s "not counting when Ayo disappears, however I feel like it should hit him way harder then it did when Makoto dies.") The animations and soundtracks were really good and I feel like there is nothing bad I can say about them. All in all a really good story by Kyoto.

Currently at **Steins;Gate episode 8** right now sitting at a **6/10**

I'm still not convinced Steins;Gate is worthy of the kind of praise it's getting from the community, however I have heard it's after episode 9 or something that it picks up and gets awesome. As of right now I think the story is OK, I have a minor problem with the somewhat grainy animation. What I do like about the show is the sound and some of the characters, those being Okabe and Christina, or Makise Kurise, because got to love them tsunderes.

I finally got around to watching both Madoka (including Rebellion) and Bakemonogatari (13/15) this week and holy shit.  Why didn't I watch these sooner?!  I, for one, welcome my new Shaft overlords.  

I loved both, and I was very surprised and impressed by just how good Madoka was.  That experience certainly taught me to never judge a book by its cover.  

And, although I know this topic can be very dividing, I actually liked Rebellion's ending (although at first I was severely tempted to scream "What the fuck?!" at the top of my lungs) and thought that it actually made a lot of sense.  [Madoka and Rebellion] (/s  "Depending on how many loops Homura went through (which I found several people claiming that Gen Urobuchi said she went through approaching 100 loops, an estimate of 11-12 years worth of time), it could be pretty easy to believe she felt somewhat desperate after so many terrible things happened to her.  I know for a fact that I never would have had the strength to go through all of the shit that she had to, including, but not limited to:  spending years lost in time, losing Madoka forever, and having no proof that her best friend ever existed in the first place except her own memories (which she would likely start to doubt).  Along with the fact that she believes everything she has done was in the best interest of Madoka, I find it very easy to understand the actions that she took.")  I actually really enjoyed the series and, although part of me would love to see more from the series (a Madoka v Homura fight would be amazing to see), I also would be perfectly fine with it ending with Rebellion.

As for Bakemonogatari, I'm not entirely sure what to say about it.  It just feels like absolutely everything was done right.  The visuals, sound, atmosphere, and characters are wonderful.  The only fault it might have is that there is a ton of talking in this anime and not much ever really happens, but I wasn't personally bothered by this.  It's been great so far, and I can't wait to finish the last two episodes and watch the other anime in this series.

TL;DR:  I watched Bakemonogatari and Madoka.  They were great.  All hail Shaft.  That is all.
>> ARTICLE
Yes I can finally rant about **[Mahouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20785/Mahouka_Koukou_no_Rettousei)**.

Ok, so the show isn't very good. Tatsuya is *too perfect* and I like OP MCs. Let's take my favorite anime, One Outs, and its OP MC, Tokuchi. Tokuchi is OP smart and you never doubt he will lose. But the way he wins is actually well written and actually gives the viewer a chance to solve the problem beforehand. Tatsuya just steamrolls everything he does. He doesn't look like he has fun doing it so I have no fun watching it.

Miyuki is extremely annoying. I think it's something to do with her annoying voice combined with the other characters never calling her out for being weird. I've never heard another anime character call their brother "Onii-sama" and yet no one thinks it's weird.

The student council is overpowered even by anime standards. Also there are no teachers or staff at this "high school", so the students solve every problem. Oh and the students address each other absurdly formally which is a bit weird.

The only saving grace has been reading through the past /r/anime discussion threads since they're hilarious.

I think I was fairly general, but if there's something you think I should spoiler tag then let me know.

**[NouCome](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19221) (1-10/10) + [OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20939)**

*Recommended by: /r/anime*

Before I begin, [you guys]( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1o2uuk/spoilers_noucome_ore_no_nounai_sentakushi_ga/ccogaee ) make for [some interesting]( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1olep0/spoilers_noucome_episode_2_discussion/cctdw70 ) and [truly funny]( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1qk4y8/spoilersepisode_6_discussion_noukomemy_mental/cddo7kg ) commentary to go along with this series.

NouCome is a light novel adaptation and harem VN parody wherein the mechanics of a VN define the premise of the show itself. Its goal is to inflict pain and embarrassment on the MC through a series of ridiculous missions mandated by God himself with only [this pet girl]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBYHf00ALgA ) there for assistance. Along the way, every clich that you can possibly think of is prodded for observation and thrown into this chaotic narrative for comedic purposes. Spastic and eager to please is how Id describe the energy that the show gives off. It is [self-aware]( https://i.imgur.com/9J3IAgC.jpg ) enough to give some bite and wit to its jokes, especially when the pace stays quick and the nature exaggerated, but indulgent enough to parade around its set of fetishized girls, camel toe shots, and general lewdness that a fan of the genre might want. Finally, [Loli-sensei]( http://i.imgur.com/IQGF9gP.gif ) is the best thing ever. I *will* fight you over that.

 As a comedy, NouCome fell flat for me. Its sense of humor is too juvenile, goes for the easy punchline too often, and drags certain exchanges out to the point where I wanted to skip forward in the episode. It even bordered on the [obnoxious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJKgfvtCAGw) with its character gags over time. At a certain point it felt like the show just fell into the trappings of its own lineage and was unable to do anything to escape it even with the novelty of its premise and the refreshing nature of a few characters as strengths.

Technically, the show feels low-budgeted. Movement is clunky. Set pieces are distractingly static. The music sounds washed out. The opening theme is especially guilty of this, where the instrumentation feels more like an indiscernible backdrop for generic gang vocals than anything more pleasant. There are scenes midway through the series where a set of shots will rest on the characters eyes while a conversation takes place, which gives the viewer no sense as to whats actually happening. Looking at the BD comparison reviews, most of this was corrected and moved the camera somewhere more reasonable in these offending scenes, so favor that over the broadcast version.

Im personally filing away NouCome as trash, but if youre looking for a light-hearted parody of harem VN romps that celebrates as much as it pokes fun of the genre, it may well be worth your time. *ERABE* wisely!

**[Into the Forest of Fireflies' Light]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/10408)** 

*Recommended by: Relative*

Captivating. Lovely. Straight-forward, but well-crafted. A tightly-knit romance narrative hosted in an understated fantasy realm of sorts. The interactions of Hotaru and Gin were a treat to watch and the gradual compounding of their feelings for one another culminated in quite the emotional climax.  You only get so much time with someone. Say what you need to say and make the most out of that time.

This movie worked as a teaser to [Natsume]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/4081/Natsume_Yuujinchou ) for me, which I will be jumping into after Mushishi draws to a close. After seeing IFFL, Im fairly confident that Yuki Midorikawa can tell stories of the same god-tier quality using similar mechanics and modes of presentation.

Watch it.

Do it.

Seriously.

> Into the Forest of Fireflies' Light

This movie (?) killed me because it made me so attached to the characters and their relationship, even though it was only a little over a half hour long. The art was so beautiful too. 

I'm glad you're picking up Natsume Yuujinchou though! I'm sure you've heard from people before, but it's a really cathartic series. I don't think you'll be disappointed! It's episodic, so it's almost like every episode is a Hotarubi no Mori e in itself.

I too was wrecked by the movie. Went back and watched the ending again. Got wrecked again. [Vicious cycle](http://i.imgur.com/9UbYdax.gif).

**Nodame Cantabile (12/23)**  
Picked this show up as it was similiar to Your Lie in April, its better than what I expected judging from the MAL description, the characters are more mature and are quite lovable, although not as heavy on the drama so far, the music is relaxing, starting to further appreciate classical music too.  
Overall its worthwhile if you want to see a mature relationship with a good insight of the workings of an orchestra the romance is in there too and the ED is really nice.  
Theres 3 seasons so hopefully I will enjoy it, please tell me its a full story  too.
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea if the full story was adapted, but all seasons are pretty funny and the music is nice. Keep it up.

In the spirit of Halloween, Ive tried to watch some horror anime over the week. Howeve,r I had already watched some of the more well-known horror anime (Higurashi, Shiki, Another, Hellsing + Ultimate, Perfect Blue, etc.), making this especially difficult. However, looking for some lesser known horror brought me to the gem that was Denpa Teki Na Kanojo, so just goes to show there is ALWAYS amazing anime that you just havent watched yet. 

Denpa Teki Na Kanojo: HOLY. This show the animation is gorgeous, the characters are well fleshed out and the story telling is tight. My only regret is that its two 42 minute OVAs, and since there have only been 3 LNs that had last been published 8 years ago, there is no chance of any additional episodes. I cant really go into too much depth on this since there is so little material and anything can be construed as a major spoiler. All I can say is if you liked the general feel of the Kara No Kyoukai movies, you should certainly give this a chance. It isnt quite the same, but I got the same general feeling from the overall environment depicted. I had a hard time thinking about either a 9 or a 10 for this show. If there were a few more episodes of the same quality as the first two, it would be an unquestionable 10 in my books.

Mnemosyne: As I watch this anime, I feel like Ive jumped into a different era of anime. While the anime was made in 2008, the pacing of the story hearkens to an older time for me. Not necessarily better or worse, but it made me nostalgic of the older anime. As a warning, there is a TON of nudity, and  graphic violence.

The anime itself was overall enjoyable. I felt that the sexual scenes were entirely unnecessary and were done just because they could, since it was an OVA. But the changing settings from the time skips between episodes was a very interesting mechanic, and every episode was very refreshing. Ive had mixed opinions over the course of the entire series in terms of whether I liked it, or didnt, and at this specific time Im leaning on liking it.

Jigoku Shoujo (Season 1): This show is completely episodic. Every episode paints a picture of how a character is put in a difficult position, how they first call out to the Hell Girl, and the ultimate circumstances that pin them in a corner, where they are put into a position where they have no choice but to condemn themselves. While the overall structure of every episode is extremely predictable, its the nuances of every story that kept bringing me back for more.

Where the story ultimately shone was once the reporter started to interact with the Hell Girls activities, in much the same way that the detective lifted the story in Zankyou No Terror. Thankfully there was no Five in this story, and the final arc was really the icing on the cake for this one.  The introduction of the reporter really helped to elevate the show past its typical episodic progression that I had become accustomed to, and frankly, started to get bored with by that time.

I personally am really not fond of stories that involve peoples suffering, as I find myself immersing myself too much in their circumstances in a negative way, but I still very much enjoyed this anime, and very much recommend it. 

Servant x Service: while keeping with the anime tropes, it really captured the charm of what an office environment was like. When Lucys bra broke, and everyone was struggling to tell her while at the same time too scared to tell her, that felt exactly like something that would happen in the workplace. A problem with a lot of slice of life anime is that there really isnt a whole lot of character development to be had as there isnt normally too much of consequence going on. However, this anime varied it well with a wide cast that helped keep the minor character development in check by alternating between the different characters. Laughs were had, would definitely recommend. 

Goku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei (OVA after S2): As I go through the SZS, Ive found every season to be a consistent level of quality. I found that from S1 to S2, it was just as good, with no real fluctuation one way or another, which is a good thing. This OVA did a lot of brilliant things, and I absolutely loved when the animation quality reset to 80s level, and slowly improved over the course of the episode, absolute genius. Cant wait to get to S3 after hearing general comments about it. 

Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2: I absolutely loved the first season. The jokes were aplenty, minor feels the end the season, all-around amazing. I wasnt sure how they were going to approach this season, in terms of if they would go for the rapid-fire jokes of the first season, or if they would try to expand on Kens prior history with each of the student council members that had been alluded to at the end of S1. It went through the jokes, but also went and built up each individual girl in the harem anime way, but unfortunately didnt really expand on what was touched upon earlier. 

I would have preferred if they went straight for the jokes personally, but this season left me wanting. A step back from s1, but I certainly didnt regret watching it.

Rozen Maiden 2013: To preface this, when it was first airing, I really tried following it. At the 3rd or 4th episode I just put it on the shelf indefinitely. In watching it start to finish now, it definitely took a good 5 episodes before it got interesting. In a 13 episode series, I think thats way too long before I actually start caring, but lends itself well to marathoning and not well to weekly viewing. That being said, I completely understand why it was necessary. The suffering of the unwound Jun made the payoff of his character development much more rewarding, its just it also lent itself to being dropped.

It took a good 8 episodes before it got itself to the point that I loved so much in the original Rozen Maiden, but once it got there, wound or no wound, I had a good time. However, given a second chance, I likely wouldnt have watched this one.

Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou: Absolutely hilarious. Theyve done away with a lot of the RIDICULOUS scenarios from Nichijou (PRINCIPAL WRESTLING DEER?!?!), and instead incorporated a lot of your typical slice of life scenarios carried through the wit and timing of the cast. I personally liked the format of Nichijou more, but really its an apples to oranges preference in comedy. It would be a great show to watch an episode or 2 while kicking back after work/school (although of course I marathoned it like a fool).

Rewatched Kamen No Maid Guy in one sitting, still liked it but didnt seem as funny as I remember.

**[Hanamonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21855/Hanamonogatari) (4-5/5)**  
6.5/10. These two episodes were a lot better than the first three but I still didn't really feel like I enjoyed watching this series, it was alright.

**[Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=13601) (22/22)**  
8/10. I caught up so that I can follow season 2, I really enjoyed it, much to my surprise, I usually don't go for cop/investigation-type shows. There were definitely some cheesy moments but I can't complain!

**[Ano Natsu de Matteru Special](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23447/Ano_Natsu_de_Matteru_Special) (1/1)**  
7.5/10. I just loved this series so seeing more from the characters was great. It's not essential that you watch this but if you liked the series it's worth watching, I teared up again, not gonna lie.

I think now as the semester progresses though I'm gonna try to just pick ~4 airing shows to follow, hopefully it will moderate my anime-watching haha.
>> ARTICLE
Took me over a month but I finally finished Psycho Pass a few days ago. I liked it, more so the first half of it than the second half. That could probably just be because I watched the first 12 in about a week and then spread out the rest of them over a month. Not really sure what I wanna do with the second season, whether I wanna catch up with or just wait till it's finished and watch it to get ready for the movie.

This week I finished Madoka... IMHO I think it's a really good show,but it didn't lived up to my hype. Planning to watch Madoka:Rebellion pretty soon.

Blitzed through Yozakura Quartet: Hana No Uta and loved every minute of it. It seems a bit slow but since there's a fair amount of manga material afterwards I forgave it. Loved all the characters different powers and how they interacted with each other. Also having Ono Daisuke made it even better. Also the soundtrack is absolutley amazing and the really distorted sound effects added a lot of weight to the fighting.

I finished watching Nichijou this week.  I had previously watched about 13 episodes or so and then stopped for whatever reason.  I'm glad I finished it.  I didn't find it always laugh out loud funny but I did enjoy the characters and their over the top reactions.

I didn't really watch anything else (save for airing shows) because I started chipping away at the VN for Grisaia after the anime made me feel like I was missing a lot of story.
>> ARTICLE
**Gosick (1-17/24)**

I love the Sherlock Holmes-y nature of Victorique and I also got to see a more human side to her at times which brings out a certain humor to the show. The characters are really likeable for me and how they have a love/hate-ish relationship is quite interesting.

All in all I love the show, I hope the romance aspect of it is really good towards the end and resolves itself.

**Nisemonogatari (Completed) Nekomonogatari (2/4)**  
I'm just going to talk about the Monogatari series as a whole here. It's a very ... different show. The storyline is pretty straightforward, with most of the focus on the conversations between characters. Of course, the Shaft visuals help make all that dialogue a lot less boring. All the characters are pretty interesting too, which is kinda necessary for a show like this. All in all, I guess I like it, if not to the extent that others on this sub do. Nise is a little weirder, with less character development and more incesty fanservice, which isn't too bad ^^if ^^you're ^^into ^^that ^^sort ^^of ^^thing. Neko is pretty decent so far, since it provides some backstory on Koyomi and Hanekawa. I quite like Hanekawa as a character too, so there's that.

I've been watching **Dragonball Z** recently and am now at episode 57. It's going to be a long haul but so far it is very fun and has some cool characters. Loving Vegeta and his badassery, even if he does get his ass whipped sometimes. I really like Gohan too. He was really well developed and the beginning was pretty crucial to getting to know him. Of course Krillan has to be mentioned because he's the real MVP. 

The girls are crazy in this show though. Chichi is particularly crazy based upon the beginning of the show. I realize her son disappeared for a whole year which made her anxious but still she is a bit impulsive. She can be cold-hearted too. Bulma is pretty awesome though. She's crazy too but better. I guess I like her engineering abilities and generally higher intelligence. 

In general it's pretty cool and hope to see more.

I haven't had school this week so I've watched a lot of anime, well actually I've mostly been continuing my quest to catch up with One Piece.
I know One Piece is still airing but as long as it's not episodes from the current season it should be fine, right?

**One Piece** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21/One_Piece) | [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/one-piece)

I've been watching this a lot so I'll divide it into the different arcs I've seen.

**Post-Enies Lobby (313-325)**

The Enies Lobby arc was probably my favorite arc this far. Post-Enies on the other hand was not much more than okay, and that's to be expected as it's kind of a "calm-down" arc, I would call it. A few interesting things happened though: [](/s "Garp is reveald to be Luffy's grandpa"), we get to see Coby again, we get to know who the man back in Lougetown was and the crew gets a new ship! **(7.5/10)**

**Thrillerbark (337-381)**

This arc had some of the funnies moments, that scene when Luffy pushes a zombie back into it's grave had med laughing for a while, and the second best character in the anime so far is introduced: Brook! YOHOHOHOHO~ Also it is home to the weirdest laughs in anime this far. KISHISHISHISHI~ FOS FOS FOS FOS~ HORO HORO HORO~ Also [](/s "Nightmare Luffy is BADASS!") **(10/10)**

**Spa Island (382-384)**

The third filler arc I didn't skip (the others being the first and G8). The two first episodes were okay, they were funny and the action was good but they also had Foxy who I hate. The third episode I found hilarious and made Brook even more likeable. **(7/10)**

**Sabaody Archipelago (385 - 405)** 

This was the first time EVER that I've teared up while watching any kind of media, tearing up not actually crying I'm too much of a man for that... It started of really funny and slowly became emotional. The scene when you see how Kokoro is being erased from Zoros memory when he sees Camie was absolutely hilarious but the funnies scene I think in the entire anime this far must be Duvals reveal, it had me laughing way after the episode ended. Also this made me happy that I read the cover page stories as I recognized Camie at once. Then there is [end of Sabaody](/s "the crew getting scattered which made me tear up a bit"). **(10/10)** 

**Amazon Lily (408-421)**

At first my reaction was something like: So Luffy got blasted of to a land of women? Feels like Sanji should have been, not Luffy. Oh, they all hate him? Kk. Who is thi Boa Hand-cock? I hate her. Then as the arc goes on Hancock becoms more likable and the arc turns out great in the end. **(9/10)**

**Impel Down (422-456)**

I loved this arc. Seeing [](/s "some old characters again like Buggy, Bon Clay and Crocodile") was awesome. I liked the "villains" a lot especially the Anubis dude. Then there was the scene where Bon Clay is "praying" for Luffy to survive which felt epic for some reason and the "bring me food" scene after was really funny. Overall, great arc. **(10/10)**

**Marineford (457-489)**

[Ep.487](/s "AAAAAACCCCCEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :'( He was going to join the strawhats after Whitebeard's death and everything would be awesome and then... he just died"). **(10/10)** 

**One Piece 3D: Mugiwara Chase** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9999/One_Piece_3D:_Mugiwara_Chase)

I liked it, it was good. It felt kinda like a really well done filler. It was funny and had a good story or quest I suppose since the story is still the One Piece story. When I first decided to watch it I thought it would be pretty bad as it is in 3D. But I was wrong. As I said it was really funny, the story/quest was good too and the 3D didn't bother me at all. The only complaint I really have is that it sometimes felt like I was watching a cut-scene from a game, espacially around 18 minutse in where I actually put my fingers on WASD and hand on my mouse as if I was going to start playing. **(9/10)**

**Naruto: The Cross Roads** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7367/Naruto:_The_Cross_Roads)

Like Mugiwara Chase is this a 3D version of it's parent anime. Although this one was much worse. That might have been because I couldn't find a high quality stream of it. It really felt like I was watching cut-scenes from a video game and the story/quest was, IMO, shit. [Haruka Kanata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ6A6GC_ki4) was the ending theme so it has that going for it, and I also really liked the after credit scene for some reason. This was actually the first Naruto movie I've seen which is weird since I've loved Naruto since I was 9. **(6/10)**

**Deadman Wonderland (4/26)** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland) | [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/deadman-wonderland)

Watched it for SourcefedNERD [Anime Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LwPDLtUTl4)(A week too late) and it was okay. I like the premise and it has potential. I might finish it after finishing Naruto. Mainly because I want to know who this Shiro is, even though I think I have a pretty solid theory about who she is: [Theory:](/s "I think she's the Red Man. If you think about it it makes sense"). **(7.5/10)**

**School Days (4/12)** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2476/School_Days) | [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/school-days)

I checked it out because I wanted to know why people hate it so much. Of the four episode I watched it's not terrible just incredibly boring. **(6/10)**

**Corpse Party (2/4)** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15037/Corpse_Party:_Tortured_Souls_-_Bougyakusareta_Tamashii_no_Jukyou)

Watch this for SourcefedNERD [Anime Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUhnf-eHDTM) again. This anime made me realize how much of a fucked up person I am. The story is okay, the characters are good and the animation is great. There is a scene in the second episode I loved, and this is when I realized I'm a fucked up human being, where the girl who is moving away talks to two kids and one of them have his/her face slashed of and the other have no eye and when the teacher tries to "take her back" they start to drag the girl in the air, dragging her across the floor and end up smashing her against the wall. I'm fucked up, I know. **(8/10)**

 

I haven't finished Deadman, School Days or Corpse Party so take those scores with a grain of salt.

**Kaze Tachinu/The Wind Rises** (movie)  
Very intersting story. Typical Ghibli/Miyazaki work when it comes to quality of animation/art and the sound. Anno's voice is something you have to get used to but it kind of fits.
Overall a really good watch but I can't see it in my personal top 3 Ghibli/Miyazaki movies. (Rating: 8/10)

**Sword of the Stranger** (movie)  
Amazing samurai action movie with extremly dynamic and lively fights. The story is kind of dull sometimes and for some reason I can't sympathize with Kotarou. The soundtrack is a big plus though.
(Rating: 8/10)

**Guilty Crown** (ep4/german dub on tv)  
I still don't understand Shou's behavior in some situations and I personally don't really like Inori so far. But like I said in last weeks post the visuals are extremely well done with a fitting soundtrack.
I really want to know where this is going since a lot of things are left unclear and unexplored (just 4 episodes in).

I really liked this show! I'm glad I didn't hear about it last season, so I could marathon it!

The show was humorous at times, but also serious. I really liked how a lot of the events are based on history. I found myself Wiki-ing the names of every character as soon as they were introduced. It was a great way to learn about Nobunaga and the Warring States period.

Second season please! Even if the Wikis spoiled everything!

**The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (2009) (23-28)**

Managed to finish it and my opinion of it hasn't changed. I still liked it and definitely didn't regret watching Endless Eight, though I think they went overboard with it and could've done more with the story. Ending was lackluster though to a TV series.

**Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya**

I usually avoid watching stand alone movies because I can't get fulfilled in any way by the time the movie ends (I prefer series of movies if I would start watching), but this movie, wow! It felt so different from what originally TV series were, yet it still fits in marvelously. The change of theme, the soundtrack, the story were all gripping and perfect, and it kept me guessing till the very end. Absolute must watch IMO, although requires watching TV series to get the full picture.

**Watamote (1-12)**

I somehow managed to watch the whole thing in 2 days, and I've never felt so embarrassed watching anime, in a good way though. I can relate to like 60% of situations Tomoko was in, and even then, I think she managed to make things even worse for her. This is were I can feel sorry because some things she came up with, I wouldn't even think of, which is why I think I got out of that "closed personality" a bit.

I wish the story went somewhere, even though opening lines of the 1st episodes pretty much describes what the anime is about. I did enjoy 10-12 episodes where it seemed something might happen, but it didn't unfortunately, which is sad, because I kind of want to see how Tomoko manages to get out of her disastrous status and become at least socially acceptable. I also kept wondering what happened to her, because in episode where we saw her and her brother play together, she was open and cute. Although, I think I know the answer, I'll still wonder what exactly happened.

Also, OP and ED rocks.

Beelzebub. Loving it.

RWBY. When I first loaded up the first episode I thought the animation was horrible. Thought I was on newgrounds about to watch some animated porn. But by the time the episode ended I knew I had to watch them all. Awesome action. Art style turned out to be great, even better in season 2. Great everything coming from Rooster Teeth. 

Can't wait for season 3. Hopufully we'll get 30min episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't really call RWBY anime despite the influence being there. Yeah RWBY definitely picked up in season 2, especially in terms of episode length and animation (no silhouettes walking around). 

You're lucky you picked it up after season 1 though, because imagine trying to watch it week by week only to receive 5 minutes of entertainment.

**Spice & Wolf s1** 13/13

Was bored most of the time. I don't know, I didn't expect any action show but more witty dialogue, not just "blablabla my life is boring, I'm a great merchant but this wolf-girl is far better than me". Also, apples.

**Utena** 20/39

Each episode, a new duel, with the same 10-min-long-exposition-scene before each duel. How insipid.

**Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita** 3/12

Very fun and out of logic.

Binbougami Ga!
I don't know where this was my whole life. It became an instant favourite when I saw all of it this week, Momiji is such an entertaining character who mixes very well with the other MC Ichiko who actually gets alot of development throughout the series and the comedy made me laugh way more that it should.
Too bad there isn't a second season because it didn't sell so well and honestly I have no idea of why it didn't. I'm reading the manga and I just keep liking the series more and more.

I've been casually watching Lucky Star, Yuru Yuri, and, uh... Black Lagoon. So yeah contrast. 

Last Weekend I watched  The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. Wow, that was a trip.
>> ARTICLE
Disappearance is  one of my favorite anime (if you count movies as anime). I probably liked it better than the actual show.
>> ARTICLE
I finished Angel Beats. I tend to turn off critical thinking and just go along for the ride, but things felt off. The visuals were excellent, I loved the OP, and the characters seemed interesting at first. It turns out they are a bunch of cardboard cutouts, and the show felt rushed. TK (the character who spouts random English but doesn't truly speak it) was hilarious, and had NO development, by design. Even characters that actually seemed to have something going on went nowhere. 

The plot was absolute garbage. It stank so hard I had to become even dumber to tolerate it. Logic was inconsistent to non-existent. The ending was a cheesy cringe-festival. Not to mention what appears to me to be a one-sided romance that felt tacked on. 

The worst part? **It had potential.** It could have truly been something wonderful. I checked out MAL after watching it and looked at the user reviews. #84 and all the reviews were ripping it to shreds.

That said, I still felt feelings. It succeeded at playing my heartstrings, though I suspect that has more to do with me than the show.

I also watched episode 1 of Barakamon, had a pretty good laugh with my girlfriend!

Trucking my way through Aquarion Evol currently - this aired in 2012, and I gave it a miss because I didn't love Sousei no Aquarion - it was a little too goofy, even though it did a good job of scratching my Escaflowne-like itch (focus on romance, magic, etc).  

I'm 10 episodes in and I definitely like this series a lot more than the original.  The art is beautiful, and the music remains some of Yoko Kanno's best.  I've been able to loosen up a little and enjoy the goofiness without letting it ruin the show (and it has some genuinely funny lines, like the "bros before holes" joke in episode nine...).

**Tokyo Ghoul** (12/12)

One of the better animes I've seen this year. I really enjoyed the development of the series so far with only 12 episodes and only to be left with a huge cliffhanger. I can't wait for the new season starting next month. Also that opening has been stuck in my head for the better part of a week now, it's just so catchy!

I wish I didn't, finding work is a bitch where I live.
>> ARTICLE
seriously, there are many shows with strong first 3 episodes (jojo, mushishi, haikuu!!, ping pong, isshuukan friends, no game no life) and also many shows with a lot of potential (Bokura wa minna kawaisou, black bullet, mekakucity, wixoss, brynhildr, mahouka koukou), then there is nisekoi and tonari no seki-kun
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if that was the reasoning behind changing from Top 3 from the Winter season poll to Top 5?
>> ARTICLE
The reason was last season I did 3 for the weekly and 5 at the end, so this time I am trying to remain consistent and just have 5 throughout all of them. 
>> ARTICLE
5 at the end was also due to having all the 2-cour, which we didn't have during the season. Less of an issue this time around.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I hope it continues to season end. Sometimes I have the same problem early on, then when week 9 rolls in I have a hard time finding more than 3 ;-)
>> ARTICLE
Man, I have dropped a whole lot of shows this season. Still pretty easy to reach five favorites, though. We're getting spoiled this time.
>> ARTICLE
I went for brave and gave Mushishi's spot to Majin Bone. 

The other fours were easy: JoJo, Hyakiu!, Isshuukan Friends, No Game No Life.
>> ARTICLE
Someone actually likes Majin Bone? Don't get me wrong I have watched all four episodes but I didn't think anyone was really that into it
>> ARTICLE
There are many technical aspects of the production that I'm digging, specially considering it's a daytime anime that's aimed at children. It's rare for those shows to get such a well crafted animation.

The effective use of many camera angles, the high quality key frames, the use of silence, the natural voice acting, the fighting choreography, the karate/capoeira/etc.

The facial expressions that capture exactly what the characters are feeling: http://a.pomf.se/gmxbeb.webm

How easily the director manages to change the mood and create suspense, just using the camera, facial expressions and silence: http://a.pomf.se/oowylw.webm (there are more scenes like this in EP1).
>> ARTICLE
Wow, you make some very good points. I guess I will have to give that show a little more credit in the future
>> ARTICLE
Damnit, I think I forgot Isshukan Friends, must have went right past it and not noticed
>> ARTICLE
I think out of all the shows to forget, Isshukan Friends is the most apt one.

>> ARTICLE
Haha yeah, didn't even think of that.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see these are continuing (I missed the pre-spring one so I wasn't sure if you'd keep doing them). They're quite fun, even if I don't always agree with the rankings.
>> ARTICLE
No problem, the pre spring one was added to the [Winter 2014: End of Season survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/22coee/ranime_winter_2014_anime_of_the_season_spring/), so it was part of that one, which may be why you missed it.
>> ARTICLE
Ah yes, I must not have/have not noticed it in the thread post. Ah well, keep it up!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I had no idea Mekakucity Actors was that popular, even before it aired. 
>> ARTICLE
There must be more than one person like me who couldn't vote cause all the shows are in japanese... which one is Nanana's buried treasure? It's one of my favorites.

>> ARTICLE
Oh dang it I totally forgot to add that one, your not alone man. Hopefully on the next survey we can get the English names along with the Japanese ones. Ive been using chrunchroll so i don't often see the Japanese names.
>> ARTICLE
Yea me too. I only watch anime on crunchyroll ^_^
>> ARTICLE
Next time i'll include english names as well, in this case it was Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin.
>> ARTICLE
I think the first word for Nanana's buried treasure is Ryuugajou or something similar. Second word is Nanana, which should help. Sorry I haven't just given the full name of the show, not in a position to easily do that at the moment, my apologies. 

Also, I, too, think it would be helpful to give the translated title along with the ones currently in the list.
>> ARTICLE
**Mekakucity Actors**, **No Game No life** and **Isshuukan Friends** are probably gonna take the top three spots for nonsequels this season. The other spots are hard to predict.
>> ARTICLE
I'm expecting Selector Infected WIXOSS to be pretty high up there.
>> ARTICLE
Idk about Mekakucity Actors yet tbh but it's very possible, the other two are super likely though.
>> ARTICLE
Dunno why but /a/ seems to shitting on Mekaku on how shaft is ruining it.
>> ARTICLE
Not just Shaft, the writing is just piss weak in general.
>> ARTICLE
I think the biggest problem is that it's so chock full of Shaftisms without anything to back them up. They use head tilts and weird angle poses so much without really any narrative impact. It's like they are just using them to fill time/space.

That said I'm not even close to quitting it. I'm intrigued by the premise enough to give it some more time to develop. Hopefully the narrative picks up soon.
>> ARTICLE
I think the problem is that there really isn't a clear, definitive narrative for the show. It isn't a manga adaptation like Nisekoi or a LN adaptation like Monogatari. So Shaft has to work a bit harder in terms of pacing - Kagerou Project *does* have a plot, but how that plot is delivered is up to Shaft. The first two episodes felt a bit slow due to pacing issues, but the third one really picked it up a bit.
>> ARTICLE
The main problem is that I still have no damn clue what Mekaku City Actors is trying to pull off. Why are they so focused on helping other kids with 'special powers'. What's in it for them? I'm pretty sure they're not some altruists looking to make it easier for random strangers.
>> ARTICLE
I was about to mention this, and I kind of want to start telling people to stop comparing it to the Monogatari series because the only thing that's really similar between them is the art style. The Monogatari series was written by NisiOisin, who has nothing to do with Mekaku City Actors. Naturally, it follows that the dialogue will be written entirely different as well. *I think*. I could be totally wrong somewhere, but I believe my information is correct.

That said, I enjoy the art style enough that I probably will watch the whole of Mekaku City Actors, possibly even regardless of the narrative content's quality.
>> ARTICLE
I actually think that Mekaku City Actors will rank quite low. At least in this one. I'm actually betting on No Game No Life, Ping Pong the Animation and either Black Bullet or Chaika taking top three spots (although I hope Isshuukan Friends will bump out any of them but Ping Pong).
>> ARTICLE
My money would be on NGNL, Mahouka, Ping Pong and Isshukan being in the top
>> ARTICLE
yeah mekakucity had a really weak start, It still has a lot of potential tho, so I'm expecting shaft to blow me away.
>> ARTICLE
I can't say I know which ones are going to take the top three, but I'm hoping Nanana's Buried Treasure and Chaika are going to be in the top five/top ten.
>> ARTICLE
Nanana is actually really good, sadly I really think there are better shows this season for the top 5. Chaika is boring, only good thing about it is eyebrows.


>> ARTICLE
You mean better shows that aren't Isshuukan Friends and Ping Pong the Animation, right? Because those two are simply so well-built so far that they're solid choices for watching all around, possibly even regardless of personal preferences, so I didn't feel like bothering to mention them.

I'd have to disagree about Chaika being boring, but it'd turn into a debate of opinions, which I'd...er... rather not get into.
>> ARTICLE
No Game No Life and Haikyuu!! are easily Top 2 of this Spring Season with Tonari no Seki-kun completing the podium. 
I don't know why but I find this season (except for 3-4 shows) weaker than last Fall/Winter. I went from watching 20-30 to fewer than 10. A little too many mediocre shows I'd say, sad.
>> ARTICLE
I just picked up Haikyuu yesterday and I really enjoy it.  I think I might go on a sports anime binge.

Can I ask why people are hyping up No Game, No Life?  Everything I've read about it reads trashy escapist power fantasy.
>> ARTICLE
Genius duo of MC, great use of colours and lots of references to anime/vg culture. If the story follows the same craziness shown in EP3, it could be an 8 or 9/10 easily.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu!! is really good... most of the people doesn't even give it a chance because of the sport theme, like me for example, I read a couple of comments about the show and I was like "welp let's see what's the deal with this", really surprising how good it is. It gave me the same feeling I got when I watched Slam Dunk long time ago


>> ARTICLE
I think one, if not the main reason of how great Haikyuu!! is lies in the superb animation IG has done. If you like Haikyuu!!, I would recommend you Kuroko no Basket s1/s2 since it's from the same studio if I'm not mistaken.
>> ARTICLE
Nanana's Buried Treasure needs way more attention. It, so far, is a super fun ride. I can only see it getting better too, what with how last episode went off.

Any reason why Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san is not included?

I'm going to take a wild guess and say that No game no life will be at the top for popularity.  And I'd say that it deserves that spot and will keep it so long as it doesn't stray from its current path and continues to be both funny and intelligent.

I know this is really not the place to be asking questions but to watch fate/stay night do I need to watch the first fate show that was out in 2006?
>> ARTICLE
Before I get into this, there's a [guide here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate#wiki_where_should_i_start.3F) made by /r/anime, so assume that that is correct. I'm going to do a bit of background on the series here as well. 

To my knowledge (please correct me if I'm wrong) the Fate/series all started with the [Fate/stay night](https://vndb.org/v11). The series escalated from there, having a ton of spin off series including [Fate/Hollow Ataraxia](https://vndb.org/v50), [Fate/kaleid liner PrismaIllya](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14829), [Carnival Phantasm](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10012) and probably a few I'm either forgetting or never even heard of. 

So, the general series starts with Fate/stay night. The original anime adaptation was considered trash, but at the same time, ufotable (the studio behind the newer anime like Fate/Zero and the TV version of Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works) assumed that you've already seen it and dipped right into Fate/Zero. I personally started with Fate/Zero and I don't really recommend doing it that way, if for no other reason than [vague F/Z spoilers](/s "the ending is either really really confusing or doesn't make any sense"). I haven't finished *any* part of Fate/stay night though, so I might be wrong. 

Anyways, getting to the order. The Fate/stay night VN is split up into three routes. The first is called Fate, second is called Unlimited Blade Works, and the third is called Heaven's Feel. In order to play through the second part, you have to play through the first one. So in other words, you can't just start with Heaven's Feel unless you find a version of the game that has it unlocked, you have to play Fate and then UBW first. Since the LN (Light Novel) for Fate/Zero came out after F/SN, it's generally agreed that you should check F/SN first. 

Here's the most popular/best order. 

>Fate/stay night visual novel (full) > Fate/Zero anime > Any F/SN anime or spin offs you're interested in.

If you're not totally against VNs but prefer anime:

>Fate/stay night VN: Fate route > Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works anime > Fate/stay night Heaven's Feel Movie(s) > Fate/Zero anime > Spinoffs

If you don't want to do a VN at all, use the same one as above, but cut out the Fate route altogether. There is no good adaptation of it yet.

Here's how I did it:

>Fate/Zero anime > Fate/stay night VN Fate route > Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works Anime > Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel Anime movie(s) > spinoffs

The reason this way is frowned upon is that Fate/stay night and Fate/Zero actually spoil each other, so F/SN spoils Fate/Zero and vice versa. Fate/Zero spoils more of Fate/stay night than the other way around, if that makes sense.

You might be asking yourself, what's the difference between 'Best animation' and 'Best Art style?'

Well, the main difference is that the art style goes by how good a still image of a certain show can look, both stylistically and graphically. Animation goes by how good or bad that looks *in motion*. A show like Ping Pong, while a lot of people dislike the art style, could definitely be a contender because of how smooth the animation was... Just as an example. :)

Kaguyahime Monogatari - 2 votes

Now I know why most artistic awards are handled by a group of judges. 

I thought that /r/anime's public opinion was pretty below average with Tokyo Ghoul winning best opening. But letting this Ghibli movie go unnoticed in the animation department is a crime against humanity. The whole subreddit should be shut down.

So I think that a selection of users can pull out a better Awarded selection than the popular vote. Take 5 or 10 users from each age group and have them vote on the best shows of the year. 
>> ARTICLE
> In the next year, people should vote on candidate anime and also select 10 or so users for them to decide which shows get the awards.

its a pretty episodic series, even if you watch it 'wrong' you will most likely get the gist and general experience of it. It matters a lot less than other series.

edit: all i mean is you cant really go wrong picking a place to start for mushishi

The first season is available from Funimation on Youtube. Afterwards, OVA -> Zoku Shou (follow the episode order on Crunchyroll)
>> ARTICLE
With MushiShi for the most part you can jump around anywhere with just a couple of exceptions (there's like one or two 2 parters I think). Crunchyroll doesn't have the first season because Funimation has the rights for it. I HIGHLY recommend it though. It's easily in my top 5 anime because it's just so beautiful and unique. 
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Psycho-Pass (22/22)**. I wasn't entirely impressed with the first half of the show (too many detective cliches, felt too episodic), but holy crap. I guess I should've learned not to doubt Urobuchi.

Intellecutally, this might be my favorite of his shows, which I wasn't expecting. His usual theme of [spoilers](/s "anti-utilitarianism was handled a lot more fairly than I was expecting, showing how effective it was at actually keeping peace and governing people despite dehumanizing them at the same time. Akane's speech about what the law really means actually floored me - it was intelligent yet passionate, a way to reconcile the greater good with human validation. Sybil might be the letter of utilitarianism's law, but Akane felt like the spirit of what that philosophy aims for.")

But the best part came towards the very end: [last episode spoilers](/s "despite Akane's best efforts, Kougami *doesn't* change. Akane's viewpoint might be wonderful, it might be correct, but not everyone is Akane. Even considering his usual bloodbaths, that seemed like one of Urobuchi's darkest moments - admitting that for all the good that comes from humanity, a large part of it is also deeply flawed and irrepressible. But, of course, the show ends on an optimistic note with Akane standing up to Sybil. While Kougami's final action in the show represents the bad side of human nature, Akane's represents the good, the drive to find a better way.")

This is one of the few shows I've walked away from feeling like I've learned something. The first half didn't grab me, but this ended up being one of my favorites. Consider me surprised. **9/10**
>> ARTICLE
I really liked it too, I just wish that the characters were more compelling. Also, the philosopher references felt a little ...*referential*. They weren't always pertinent to the theme at hand and seemed like insertions or afterthoughts at times. 

The antagonist of the show, however, is endlessly compelling and in my opinion possibly as "flawed" as you say. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I agree about a lot of the characters. They're pretty endearing and fun to watch, but they're more representatives of different viewpoints and philosophies than fleshed-out human beings (something that also happened in Fate/Zero). That said, I thought Akane was a ridiculously good MC. She reminded me a lot of Hajime from Gatchaman Crowds, except better because there was actual *character development*.

Also, while the philosophy references were just sort of there to be there at first, they seemed to get more purposeful towards the end. They're one of the many little things that improved in the show's second half.
>> ARTICLE
I'm at episode 13 right now, and the episode with "the hunting game" was pretty amazing. Really digging the antagonist so far, excited to see what's to come. 
>> ARTICLE
The antagonist definitely elevates the series. The rest of the stuff is good, but he really steals the show.

Starting this tonight, glad to see some praise on here!

Just finished Kill la Kill this week after having dropped it two times before. 8/10 

I didn't really like the premise of the show during the majority of the first cour, but I'm really glad I finished it through this time. At the beginning it just seemed like Ryuuko was just mindlessly fighting and beating the crap out of people for 8 episodes, but MAN did it get intense during the 2nd half. Marathoned the last 10ish episodes for a great finish!
>> ARTICLE
This is exactly how I felt. First half I was starting to feel like it was turning into Bleach-style "must go defeat the next enemy!" but KLK really made all of that worth it. Every character mattered and the plot was really interesting. I'll definitely rewatch it, very enjoyable.

I have a few comments on your opinion on Suzumiya there (Suzumiya = the show), and most of them are not good.

Suzumiya is definitely NOT a slice of life. Seeing it as such is reducing it to something it isn't. It is much more than a "slice of life with a twist". I see a slice of life show as something that can happen IRL, and this certainly cannot.

Also, the only "filler" episode is the last episode, Someday in the Rain, since it wasn't in the original Light Novels. Everything else is perfectly canon, and happens in the original material as well. Calling it "filler" is again demoting those episodes to something there aren't, and since the majority of the show is made from those random arcs that don't actually contribute to the bigger story, saying that might make some people not watch the show, when they really shouldn't because of that reason. The only exception is the EE, and even then I think that everyone should watch it fully at least once, although I can understand if they don't.

Finally, the Kyon theory. Recommending this show because of that is something that is honestly a bad idea. It creates confusion where it doesn't need to exist to a first-time watcher and it, so far, isn't canon either, so I believe everyone should get their own conclusions about whether they believe in the theory or not after watching the entire show.

The conclusion I get is that you didn't understand this show. I know I'm being a little self-centered here, but Suzumiya is much more than simply a Slice of Life with random episodes. It is an anime that can barely be compared to any other in equal terms. 

Watching it in broadcast order is also not a good idea for first-time watchers either, since it again confuses more than it should and it actually only applies to the first season's episodes. It isn't the real way to watch the show as you said, it is an option that only someone who is familiar with the show already should take in my opinion.

I'm sorry if I was a bit aggressive there, but this is my favorite show and seeing someone not getting it fully makes me a bit sad.

It is a bit hard to explain Suzumiya, but I'll do my best. 

First, the thing that grabs my attention is the setting, the first 6 episodes (chronologically, that is, the "Melancholy" part of the show). God lives in the physical world but doesn't know about her powers, she can destroy the world at will, the other members of the Brigade are all some sort of supernatural beings (and she doesn't know it) and she needs to have a reason to not destroy the world she finds boring. This setting is absolutely brilliant. My favorite episodes of the show are these first ones (mainly the 6th), because they set up everything else that happens or will happen in the show. Everything else happens because of one or more of these reasons, so that may make those next episodes more boring at first glance.

But then come in the characters. And this is where this series truly shines in my opinion. Those episodes are not about the story itself, since it has already "ended", they are about the characters and how they evolve and interact in that setting. 

Kyon is my favorite character. I love his comments and his entire "normal" view of the situations, and how he, slowly, begins to like the situation he found himself in. The fact that he is so normal in the midst of that freak show is what makes him such a good character. He essentially serves as a balance to the rest of the cast.

Haruhi is such a charismatic character (like her or not), and pretty much everything in the show revolves around her, but it is really interesting to see her grow, also slowly, as a person ; as the series goes on, she becomes more and more willing to accept the real world. Also, the things she comes up with are just hilarious for me.

The rest of the Brigade is a bit less prominent, mostly serving as a plot lines, but Nagato deserves a special mention, since it is very evident that she becomes more "human" as the series goes on as well. 

I also like the entire dynamic of the characters, and that dynamic is also a big part of what makes the show so interesting and those "filler" episodes so fun to watch. These are the reasons why watching it in broadcast order is not a good idea, because it is very difficult to actually get the growth of the characters.

Disappearance is another story altogether. I watched it much later than the rest of the show, and still haven't re-watched it. It is not the reason I love the show so much, since it was already my favorite before watching the movie. It has a very different passing from those random episodes I like so much for the reasons I stated above. It feels like Suzumiya, but at the same time it has a very different and refreshing feeling to it, being much more heavy and dramatic. It nevertheless complements those episodes beautifully and expands the character development already in the show. It is a great movie, you should watch it ASAP.

I think that is basically it. Essentially, the growth and the dynamic of the characters, complemented with such a good story, is why I like this series so much, and why it is such a special show. A normal Slice of Life (I've seen a lot of those so I can argue) doesn't typically have the character dynamic and the interesting stories this show is able to produce, since it tries to be realistic. This show, however, is much more bold, throwing all kinds of weird ad interesting stories at you, but at the same time developing its characters in its own special way. And it does it really well, for me at least.

I think that is the biggest post I've ever written on reddit, but it also helped me understand why I like the show so much. Thanks.

I didn't really thought much about the rating you gave, since everyone gives ratings in a different way. I give it a 8.5/10 (or, in my system, a 17/20), because it has some problems that keep it from really deserving to be on the top (18 and above). In a side note, my rating system is universal, so things Slice of Life shows tend to have worse ratings than, say, an action-packed show, although some of them are my favorite shows. However, if the show does its characters really well then it will deserve a good rating (like Clannad, despite me not liking the show).

I kind of understand now why you didn't like the show that much. It doesn't have an underlining story past the first 6 episodes, returning each time to a more or less status quo which is typical of slice of life shows, though in this case the status quo changes ever so slightly like I mentioned. If it is a matter of personal taste, then I have no objections.

Now, regarding the broadcast order vs chronological order. I think I watched the show years ago, the first season, in broadcast order (I was quite young so I honestly don't remember), but after that I watched it in chronological order every time. Although I still believe that chronological is the better option for first time viewers, I know very few people who actually watched the show the first time in the broadcast order, so I can't exactly tell you the advantages of the it. I can see that the show is tightly written, which allows for the broadcast order to exist in the first place, and the LN are also very random in their stories (the recent post here about Suzumiya's timeline is very good in explaining the order of the arcs), so maybe the best way to enjoy the show is the broadcast order. Like I said, I can't tell you unfortunately. If you didn't find it an obstacle and could understand the character growth and dynamic then I have no objections either.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I love the series also but I honestly completely disagree with a lot of your opinions. 

I would definitely say Suzumiya is a SOL. This isn't a bad thing. SOL can easily be just as well-written/meaningful/etc as any other genre. Therefore, saying so doesn't "reduce" it to anything. A SOL is just a genre category. The series may cover other genres as well but a large portion of it most definitely fits in the SOL category (note: I think you are misdefining SOL by saying it needs to be something that can happen IRL - it is a very hard category to properly describe but I can think of numerous shows that wouldn't fit that description - the best way I can think to describe it is as shows that simply has characters living life in their own world, supernatural or not).

I agree that the show should not be recommended based on a theory, but I completely disagree with watching in chronological order first. I actually prefer chronological now but broadcast order allows for the viewer to get used to the characters before hitting the first climax of the show with the end of the melancholy arc (the character growth in chronological is probably superior overall, but I think it is more detrimental to have better character growth that largely takes place after the climax than still good but slightly worse character growth that takes place before the climax if you are a first time viewer). IMO, chronological only starts to be better after you've seen the shows so you can bypass this as you already know the characters. Also, as vafrous said, broadcast makes the show seem like a mystery as you try to figure out what is going on (the fact that it may be a little confusing is not necessarily a bad thing). Watching in chronological order takes away this factor (but if you are rewatching the show it isn't there anyway, once again making chronological superior for rewatches but not first time viewers).

As a side not, I agree that the show shouldn't be called filler. I do find it amusing that Someday in the Rain is the only episode that could be called filler since it is one of my favorite episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok, the Slice of Life thing might be my own wrong view of what it means, but I always believed that it meant a story that could happen IRL. Something that relates to living the daily life of the characters would be a genre of itself. Aria the Animation is a perfect example of this. 

Anyway, that matter aside, I didn't meant to say that slice of life shows are bad. In fact, I love many SoL shows (Haganai, Chuunibyou and many others). The thing is, if you brand Suzumiya as a SoL without any mention to what actually makes it special, most people will not pick it up precisely because it is just a SoL.

The broadcast vs chronological is a very complex subject. I still believe that the best way to enjoy the show is the chronological way, but broadcast is fine as long as the person who is watching knows it is being aired out of order on purpose to put the climax in the end, and can understand everything about the show anyway. It does make the show really special, so I'm all in for it to be an option. I also don't like the broadcast order since technically only the first season has the broadcast order, the second season aired with its episodes chronologically, so watching it in broadcast is just slapping the 2nd season episodes after the 1st seasons'.

Oh, Someday in the Rain. I hate that episode so much. It is completely useless, boring, and it doesn't even appear in the LN. I praise it for being bold by making me sitting there watching someone reading a book, but it really doesn't add anything to the overall experience (unlike the Endless Eight). I've already heard any argument regarding this episode so you don't have to bother. I do find it amusing that so many people like this awful thing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, SOL is very difficult to define. People seem to constantly define it differently and it's impossible to say what is the right way (there probably isn't one). I agree with the conditions for watching broadcast order. If someone has trouble understanding the show at all because it isn't chronological it obviously wouldn't be the way to go. I always find it amusing how people can love the same show but have entirely different opinions of it.

What are these commentaries?  This is the first I've heard of them 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
What really makes it special is that the author himself wrote the commentary which is why they're so in character 
>> ARTICLE
The endless eight was made because the studio got the budget to make the Disappearance movie, which was originally going to be part of the series, so they replaced those episodes with the endless eight.
>> ARTICLE
The commentary is probably one of the best features of the Monogatari series - It's really unfortunate that it wasn't included with the english releases outside of Bakemonogatari.

The Nisemonogatari commentary is slowly being translated, but it's a fair amount of effort, so only the first 2 episodes are done just yet.(those 2 episodes in particular are special in that they feature two commentary tracks - so it equates to 4 episodes worth of commentary)

As to the whole endless eight debacle - A fair few people seem to think it was to make Disappearance able to be made into movie format, as it wouldn't have been anywhere near as good in the serial format.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion [26/26]** Well, I finished it. I have to say that I'm really impressed with how the story was constructed. While the last 2 episodes were confusing as fuck and difficult to keep track of, in the end, I understood what NGE was trying to say. 

And strangely, I didn't find Shinji annoying at all. Asuka was the most annoying, but her attitude was explained well, so I can forgive that. All in all, I think NGE is a great show and I don't regret watching all 26 episodes in the slightest. 

Sure, the show can get a lot if flak for its presentation of the show's message. Pretentious? Maybe. But I found something deep within NGE and because of that I have to make this show one of my favorites. 

**Puella Magi Madoka Magica [12/12]** And with this, the Urobuchi Trifecta is complete. 

I want to tell a story. A year or two ago, DutchFarmers decided to check out Madoka Magica. He got to the first witch scene and said "What is this surrealist bullshit. Dropped."

Needless to say, DutchFarmers was wrong about Madoka Magica. This show is without a doubt one of the most riveting things I have seen. Pacing, atmosphere, and story were perfect. While I didn't find it as thought provoking as NGE, Madoka Magica is a show that deserves the praise it gets. 

**Bakemonogatari [7/15]** I know a lot of people like this show. I like it too. But I don't like how SHAFT throws in a head tilt whenever it can. Also, I don't like how the city always seems lifeless. Still, it's a good show. I just don't think it'll end up being one if my favorites.

Man you're king on a classic marathon
>> ARTICLE
It's really weird that the first witch scene, one of the most interesting things to happen in the early Madoka episodes, is what turned you *away* from the show. I think most viewers find that scene pretty cool. I still remember the first time I saw that scene, it was interesting enough to leave an impression.
>> ARTICLE
Something was really wrong with me that day
>> ARTICLE
Glad you liked NGE, but did you watch the ending movie, End Of Evangelion? It replaces the last two episodes and gives a clearer ending to the show as a whole, and is an excellent movie in itself, in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't EoE really depressing? I plan to watch it, but I'm not sure how satisfied I'll be.
>> ARTICLE
EoE is more mindfuck than depressing. Do not watch if you need to any math or shit within the next few dayd.
>> ARTICLE
~~It depends on how you want to take it~~ It probably is pretty fucking depressing for most, but it was a satisfying ending, for me anyway.
>> ARTICLE
**NGE** - As others have said, End of Eva is quite necessary to complete the series. Simply put, it's what episodes 25 and 26 could have been if Gainax hadn't run its budget dry. It also incorporates Shinji's decisions in those two episodes with physical results.

**Madoka** - The movie series is well worth the watch if you enjoyed the series. The first two movies are basically film-length showings of the 12 episodes, which may be fun to watch if you're looking for a  rewatch with some Shaft edits. But if not, the third movie Rebellion has a very interesting presentation of a continuation.

**Bake** - Of course everybody has their tastes for animation direction, I would just like to point out that the Monogatari series loves to play upon character perspective. The first season is almost entirely Araragi's, but it may give subtle insight into his mindset when seeing the lifeless city, beautiful Senjougahara, even the those [black screen] blinks of his eyes.
>> ARTICLE
I recommend not watching Rebellion. I'd go into details but it would be spoilers. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't recommend against watching something simply because of my subjective dislike of it. Sure Rebellion was controversial, but who's to say that /u/DutchFarmers won't enjoy it?
>> ARTICLE
Just some questions about the Madoka movie. 

Is it absolutely necessary that I watch this to experience Madoka Magica in all it's glory? I was pretty happy with the show's conclusion. 

Does the movie mess with the time line? I watched 3 min of the opening and was confused why they were showing Madoka's home life especially because of her wish
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I loved Rebellion. It was a great movie. A lot of people did not like it for some very big reasons. It basically comes down to the way you interpret one of the characters.

Otherwise it is a beautiful movie. Excellent action scenes, a lot of good character development, and an excellent twist. I personally think that it should be seen.
>> ARTICLE
The third movie flows perfectly with the timeline of the series. It is a little confusing in the beginning, but it becomes clear later on what is happening. 

As for whether or not you need to watch it, it seems about 50/50. Some people love it, others hate it. There's not really a general consesus from what I've seen. Without getting into spoilers, personally, I liked the end of the movie, but I could see why it'd make some people mad. I'd recommend it, but cautiously.

> Puella Magi Madoka Magica

I just watched this yesterday in a single sitting.  I wasn't planning on it, but once I got 6 episodes in I needed to know how it ended.

I have to say, the character development of Homura is probably one of the most impressive developments I've seen.  For most of the series, I kept thinking, "Ugh, Madoka is so weak.  She just follows everybody around and cries a lot.  Why is Homura such a jerk?", and then episode 10 hits and *everything* is explained in such a satisfying way.

The ending was confusing and I think Madoka could have used her wish better, but overall it was a great series with surprising plot twists.  It also did a good job giving the viewer a constant feeling of dread for the characters.  "Maybe things will get better for them in the next episode.  Shit, it's worse.  Well maybe things will be better for them in the *next* episode.  Shit."
>> ARTICLE
[Madoka Magica](/s "In case you're interested in my input, I actually think that Madoka used her wish pretty damn well, all things considered. After I finished the series I was thinking "wow, did she need to do that? That seems awfully extreme, surely with as much power as she had, she could have used a much simpler wish that just fixed the problem without this crazy sacrifice"").

[cont.](/s "But then I remembered the law of equilibrium that Kyuubey lays out earlier on: Whatever amount of hope your wish spreads, it'll cause you to spread an equal amount of despair as a witch. In other words, Madoka had to be very careful not to just create a horribly powerful witch that destroys everything. This immediately disqualifies any of the obvious wishes she could try, and it also means that if she's around as a magical girl after the wish is made, it's going to end badly").

[cont.](/s "By wishing to destroy all witches with her own hands, she allowed herself to paradoxically destroy her own witch. Her wish was going to have a big cost, and she found a way to inflict that cost on herself rather than on everyone around her the way most magical girls do when they fall").

[cont.](/s "Could she have just wished away the hope/despair equilibrium law? Well, if so, then yeah, maybe she could have done better, but given that the hope/despair balance thing was thematically central to the story, eliminating it wouldn't have been very satisfying").
>> ARTICLE
[Well](/s  "what if Madoka had said, 'I wish that in the next timeline Homura jumps too, the Kyuubey race doesn't exist' and then had Homura jump through time?  That would make the new timeline void of witches, and Homura would get to start over again with Madoka without worrying about the whole witch/kyuubey thing.  Sure she would still die and the current timeline would remain fucked, but the other timelines that Homura left would still be fucked despite the wish Madoka made in the show, so why not go for just *one* timeline where everything is fixed?")
>> ARTICLE
[Madoka Magica](/s "Part of what Madoka wants, and I feel she states this more clearly in the manga than in the TV series, is that she wants magical girls to be able to trust in their own wishes right to the end. She wants them to be content with the fact that their wishes and all their effort really did improve the world around them, and that their struggles aren't futile by design. As such, I don't think Madoka wanted to eliminate magical girls. Their trials and tribulations, especially Homura's, meant something positive and powerful to her, and she wanted to preserve that").

[cont.](/s "That being said, if you consider wishes where Madoka lets herself and her timeline die, but sends Homura to a new one that she alters for the better, I'm sure there's a way to do that, it's true. I hadn't considered that. It wouldn't have been a bad ending either, because it would capture Madoka's selflessness very well, but I guess even selfless Madoka has a survival instinct in the end").

**Yu Yu Hakusho** - (34/112)


I'm finally in the Dark Tournament arc, my favorite! Seriously, the Dark Tournament arc kicks ass. I love seeing all the new characters with their unique powers. Even though I know exactly what's going to happen having read the manga several times, it's still pretty interesting.


**Fullmetal Alchemist** - (1/51)


I'm only one episode in and already I'm in love with this show. Edward is sort of a cynical dickhole, but I like him anyway for some reason. I think it's interesting they got an actual kid to do Al's voice rather than just a woman doing a kid's voice, like they usually. He's not half bad, either. The whole world they're setting up is pretty awesome. I like the way they're explaining alchemy as a science and all the laws and rules that go with it. Being interested in science, I guess it's only natural I'm drawn to something like that.


**Death Note** - (3/37)


I decided to give Death Note a rewatch now that it's back up on Netflix. It's actually better than I remember it being. The art looks amazing and the voice acting is pretty damn solid. Of course, the story is fantastic, but that goes without saying. Light's cheesy "I will be a god! Justice!" lines get on my nerves a bit, but thankfully they're not too frequent. Overall, Death Note's still as solid as I remember it being three years ago, if not even better.

Oh boy, you are gonna love FMA! But don't expect Edward to be a cynical dickhole the entire time, he is that very often, but he is actually a nice guy.

If you like Fullmetal Alchemist, I would recommend checking out Brotherhood afterwards. Some people prefer the first series, Fullmetal Alchemist, but IMO Brotherhood has a much stronger story, since it follows the manga. None the less, both are really great. :D
>> ARTICLE
So is Brotherhood essentially a remake of the first series?
>> ARTICLE
Not really, no. They're quite different after around the tenth episode. The reason they made brotherhood, was due to how different the first Fullmetal Alchemist series was from the manga. That was due to it still being ongoing and unfinished, when the first FMA was running. Once the manga was done, they decided to make new series that followed the manga's storyline. :D
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I would strongly recommend that you first watch FMA: Brotherhood instead of the original. Basically, the original series had to improvise a lot and come up with its own ending since it surpassed the manga, while FMA: Brotherhood follows the manga the whole way through. This is essentially the defining difference. 
>> ARTICLE

What I meant is you should watch FMA: Brotherhood before watching the original, since it is the follows what the author/mangaka had in mind. Also, if you only want to watch one or the other, definitely watch FMA: Brotherhood.

>> ARTICLE
Well, that is an opinion. But I think that FMA: Brotherhood is overall preferred by most people, considering that its rank 1 on MAL, and also people tend to prefer the author's original vision.

It's a remake until the point where the original anime split off from the manga.

Taken from the /r/TrueAnime thread:

***The Tatami Galaxy*** (9-11/11)

I got into a brief conversation with /u/Vintagecoats after finishing episode 11, and I think I came up with the most succinct way to describe that finale: 

*["It felt like a phenomenal punchline to the set-up of a really long joke that I wasn't sure was going to deliver."](https://twitter.com/cptngarlock/status/479726534966927360)*

Because each episode prior to episode 10 was a story that, as far as I could tell, was a repitition of the same themes, merely placed into a different story and rotating the cast of characters, I have to admit I started to get a little tired. Shows like *Mushishi* didn't cause that problem because, despite similar premises, the themes differ constantly, and I think I prefer that set-up than the reverse. Furthermore, I could roughly predict what the ending was going to be because of how hard the show hammered in certain ideas; this meant that a great ending would have to rely solely on great execution rather than the introduction of a new idea or some surprising conclusion. 

Thankfully, I needn't be worried. The ending went roughly exactly as I'd hoped, but also much better than I'd expected. Watashi came to the conclusion he needed to, Ozu's role in the story was shown from a different perspective, and Watashi grasped for the opportunity he needed to. Honestly, it was as perfect an ending as I could've expected, and I expected quite a lot. I'm very happy to add another 10 to my list (and two in one day, too! I finished the finale on the same day that *Ping Pong the Animation* ended; I'm quite a lucky guy.)

Still...I'm a little saddened that I didn't get the opportunity to get to know the rest of the cast better. We were shown different "faces", but I don't feel that I got to *know* them very well. Perhaps the specials will fix that?

***[Wandering Son](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko)*** - (1-5/12) 

This show has taken me completely by surprise. An adaptation of a highly acclaimed manga, it deals with transsexualism, gender identity, regular old growing up and the onset of puberty. Thats a lot of interesting, and quite frankly difficult, material to handle. Given anime/mangas predilection for fetishizing transsexualism and cross-dressing, a show like this is an extremely welcome breath of fresh air. 

But its not just because of it intelligently tackling LGBT characters that makes *Wandering Son* so amazing (although it certainly helps!) Whats amazing is  how sensitively the show is treating its characters, and how easily the show makes you care about them without resorting to crying festivals or early drama to make you care. In fact, its kind of amazing how muted the shows dramatic moments can be, given who its screen composer is, the (in)famous Mari Okada. Clearly, this isnt another *NagiAsu* or *AnoHana* - this is a *Toradora* or a *Hanasaku Iroha*, a case of strong dramatic material being adapted by someone who clearly has writing chops but needs good material to restrain herself.

Were not given massive info-dumping either; instead, were allowed to piece together information from offhand clues dropped everywhere, letting viewers come to their own aha! so thats whats going on! moments on themselves. Given how rarely anime respects a viewers intelligence, this is *again* another welcome breath of fresh air. 

Although not everyone gets a big spotlight on them, the show takes the time to flesh out even the support and background characters, and makes them feel alive and real, not merely as support for the main characters. One thing that many single-cour dramas do terribly is simltaneously juggling multiple dramatic sideplots along with a main one. That rarely works - you just dont have the time to develop enough audience investment to be able to handle so much drama and not make it look cheap or have to use the *Clannad* style of dramatic storytelling aka *THESE GIRLS ARE CRYING, DONT YOU FEEL BAD FOR THEM*? Again, the show handles the drama very deftly so far, and Okadas great writing skills are allowed to shine without imploding into a simpery mess. 

If theres one things resembling a flaw with this show, is how unbelievable its premise is. These kids are first year middle schoolers, and yet they are as calm and adult as youd expect a college kid to be. Frankly, they seem almost TOO emotionally sound and stable. On top of this, we cant forget the series premise - almost every central character is LGBT in some way, and its not like Japan is known for their sexual progressiveness. Why is there so little bullying? This kids dont seem nearly insecure enough to feel like middle schoolers discovering that their sexual and gender identities arent exactly typical. I guess, though, its needed, otherwise the show would get bogged down in dealing with external conflicts rather than the conflicts between the characters and their personalities (which, I repeat, the show handles *marvelously.*)

To be quite honest, Im extremely surprised that the show has flown below so many radars. Ive barely heard anyone talk about it, and the only one I can remember is /u/violaxcore. It seems so good that I can only guess that 1) it was advertised for shit or 2) people got uncomfortable with the premise. 

Gaaah fuck. This is such a good show. [*Such a good show.*](http://i.imgur.com/1coFybi.png) Im already giving this a 9, and so help me god I dont know if I can handle giving out another 10 after giving out 10s for *The Tatami Galaxy* and *Ping Pong The Animation* this past week.

Hells. I had a massive internal debate when ***I*** gave Hourou Musuko a 10/10 perfect score [11 weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/22chrm/spoilers_so_what_did_yall_watch_this_past_week/cglujmd), and I had only given out a grand total of ten of them before this one finally appeared on my radar. (Although it looks like you're a bit tougher on anime ratings than I am. Just a little bit, though.)

As to why it isn't on everyone's list, I think it is because of the subject matter. Given this sub's average age, I don't see many of them lining up to watch a title that involves legitimately transgendered characters. Moe-as-fuck crossdressers that make people laugh? Absolutely. But this one would be too far outside people's (read: straight sexually-insecure teenage males') comfort zones to be very popular. 

But gods, that ED can still make me cry in only seconds. So. Damn. Good.

To be honest, "calm and adult" is the last thing I would use to describe most college kids I've seen. But for middle school kids, that is still above what I would expect from them too.

>If theres one things resembling a flaw with this show, is how unbelievable its premise is. These kids are first year middle schoolers, and yet they are as calm and adult as youd expect a college kid to be.

Heh, that's the same point of criticism that I made, and from what I've seen, it seems like most other criticis also notice that. The characters are so so good at handling middle-school life that they don't even seem human anymore. You say their mental ages are on the level of college kids? Hell, I say they're 90-year-old Zen masters. 

Not that I mind too much(as I also mentioned in my post), because the show is just so amazing to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it does seem to be the big flaw here. And it's a surprising one, too - typically, we complain about characters not acting mature *enough*, but here we're complaining about them being *too* mature. 

Although honestly, I prefer "little brats being too mature and emotionally stable for their age" over "adults being to immature and emotional unstable for their own good" haha
>> ARTICLE
>Although honestly, I prefer "little brats being too mature and emotionally stable for their age" over "adults being to immature and emotional unstable for their own good" haha

Yeah, exactly. It's unbeliavably pleasant to see the other side of it for a change. I've frequently had the "frustrated viewer" response and gone "God, just say it already!", only to have the character actually do exactly what I wanted them to do. It's so satisfying.

And somehow, the show only gets better with each episode(on average).
>> ARTICLE
**NHK ni Youkoso!** (Completed) - I really liked this show even though it seemed to throw everything for loops. It was really good at disclosing that most dreams do not come true. Most of the things you wanted to do in life fail and you end up with pain, suffering, and shit. But life is about overcoming that and becoming satisfied with the path you have taken. This show did a great job of making the main character utterly disgusting and honestly pitiful while still maintaing a balance of not entering cringe humor which I absolutely cannot stand. I was a bit bored at the beginning and was thinking why did I start this stupid show but it rapidly picked up pace. All in all it felt very real (most parts anyway) and presented a very good show about interpersonal relationships, life, and being a shut-in. I want to give it a (9/10) but I am really not into these kinds of shows so a (8.4/10) will suffice. 

**Kimi no Todoke** (13/25) 

Honestly I was a bit doubtful coming into this show. I was gonna watch **Katanagatari** but my friend told me this was amazing. I have heard that it is basically one long drawn out episode that includes a kiss. I have also seen the art style and am not really attracted to it. But, I watched Ping Pong and Sidonia so there really is not a reason art should detract me from it. My friend told me to watch it and so far I am enjoying it. I dislike how so many of the characters are outright bitches though. There is an extent to how exaggerated high school girls are. A lot of them are bitches but this show just overdoes it imo. The goal of this show is to basically make you get a heart boner while you watch Sawako makes friends and progress her love life with Kazehaya. There was an arc that was dragged out because of exaggerated miscomprehension that I was not really a big fan of and the first episode was honestly extremely cringey but I cannot help but like this show. It does exactly what Isshukan Friends does for me but to a lesser degree. I am currently looking at a 7.4 which is pretty high for me since my mean score is like a 5.7. I am a fan of the comedy and for some ungodly reason, one of shoujo as well so this show lines pretty well with my tastes. On the other note, Ryu is best girl.

**Gintama** (12/201) - More character introductions! I'll admit that it's a fun show if I'm in the mood for it. Otose has more depth to her than I expected, and she's my favorite character so far. Sadaharu's cute, though I'm wondering what his (her?) story is.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (4/64) - Ah, Scar and Shou Tucker. It's like uncovering buried memories from the original series, and again I don't mind it at all.

**Baccano!** (6/16) - This is starting to feel like a series I should marathon rather than watch a couple episodes every week. Good show, but I'm having difficulty remembering all the connections between the different groups of characters.

**ef: A Tale of Memories** (4/12) - Conflict between characters, right on schedule. Still a refreshing contrast to the other series I'm watching.

**Attack on Titan** (2/25) - Started watching this because a friend just jumped into part of the fandom. Whee crapsack world. I'm trying to figure out how there's been a stalemate for 100 years.

**To Aru Kagaku no Railgun S** (1-17/24)
____

In quite a shift from Index II being a huge step down from Index I, Railgun S is actually a kind of amazing step up from Railgun. It started off with the first couple episodes being pretty standard fare I expected from the series, but once the Sisters arc got rolling it got to a whole new level. The atmosphere was fantastic, the action was gorgeous, and I would honestly have a hard time finding anything done wrong with the story. If anything, I'd complain that it was tied down to Index which it can't do anything about (which means it fell from phenomenal to just entertaining in the steps toward the conclusion of the arc).

Anyway I can't see myself giving it anything less than an 8/10 when I finish it later today unless this last arc ends up being the worst Railgun arc yet. 

PS. Episode 5 is probably on my personal list of best individual anime episodes. Such a fantastic mix of positivity, melancholy, and inevitable despair. One of the few times where they really took advantage of the fact most viewers had seen Index and knew how things had to end.

"unless this last arc ends up being the worst Railgun arc yet"

Which is unfortunatly the case. After the absolutely amazing Sisters Arc it's really impressive how laughably bad the filler arc manages to be, especially considering they had perfectly fine material they could adapt to fill the remaining episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I know people tend to hate that arc but I actually really enjoyed it despite being silly. I appreciated having something more popcorn-y and less dark after the sisters arc, as good as it was.
>> ARTICLE
The whole arc was just so badly written, I couldn't even enjoy it in this "so bad it's good" way. The antagonists were pathetic, and Misaka suffered from one of the worst cases of plot-retardation i've seen in a long time. Also, it directly contradicted Misaka's stance on involving her friends with the Darkness of Academy City (if those wannabe-Kiharas can even be considered part of it). The whole Tree Diagram Remnant Arc was about nothing but what happens when they get involved, and here this suddenly isn't a big deal at all.

Regarding something more popcorn-y after the Sisters Arc: They literally had a story about a summer vacation that could have been adapted instead of writing a filler arc. It would have brought the possibility for a light-hearted filler beach episode, while showing off some cool new sides of Misaka's skills in later episodes. It also would have introduced magic in the Railgun series. Even the length of the arc was optimal for the number of episodes remaining. All in all it was the obvious choice for a change of pace after the Sisters Arc, but it seems that Nagai can only be happy when he fucks Railgun up.

I actually really liked Index II due to how much we got to see of Accelerator and Last Order.

**Kimi ni Todoke S1 (18/25)** (Watched 2-18 this week)

Crunchyroll omitted the 16th episode because it was a recap apparently, but yeah. I don't know why I like this so much. I feel like my masculinity is being ripped away every time I watch another episode, but I can't stop. I already know I'm probably going to keep watching this until I finish it next week or the week after, but I can't quite understand why I like this so much. Everything is just so heartwarming. Plus, I'm not into dudes, but Kazehaya is just so dreamy. I'd do him. *No homo*

**Monster (35/74)** (Watched 21-35 this week)

This is really dark. I love the characters though, even the ones who are after Tenma, like Lunge. The entire premise is great so far and once I start watching it it's kinda hard for me to put down, despite it being almost unbearably slow. It's great though. I stopped at the part where [Monster spoilers](/s "Tenma is setting up on top of a book case in the library, getting ready to shoot Johan.") Can't wait to see what happens next. 

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (12/27)** (Watched 10-12 this week)

I never thought I would be able to watch this again. Thank god my brother finally decided to, I was *just* about to give up and move on without him, so he had great timing. If you can't remember, these episodes  [TTGL spoilers](/s "were the ones where Simon was just finishing 'getting over' Kamina's death.") 10 and 11 were great, but 12 felt like a major filler episode. I laughed pretty hard at Yoko's swimsuit being less revealing than her regular outfit.

**Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 (12/25)** (Watched 12 this week)

I never thought I would laugh so hard at this show. Lelouch commanding [R2 spoilers](/s "where his double should go") was like pretty much like a war scene he was commanding. Obviously it didn't matter as much because, well, it wasn't a war scenario but a game. I enjoyed this episode, but I need to focus on one or two anime instead of jumping around all of these shows I'm watching.

**Oreimo S1 "True Ending" (4/4)** (Watched 1-4 this week)

I actually really preferred this to the original ending. I liked the extra arc with Kuroneko and how they [Oreimo spoilers](/s "had to make friends with the new girl (whose name I forgot) to overcome the problem of the deadline for Kuroneko's game"). I feel like we had more development with Kyosuke than before because of [Oreimo spoilers](/s "him losing his sister for so long.") Since I liked this more than the main series, I gave this part a **8.5/10** as opposed to the 8 I gave S1.    

**Mushi-shi (1/26)** (Watched 1 this week)

I watched only one episode of this but I have to say it was awesome. I don't know why, but the atmosphere in this show is just amazing. I can't wait to watch more. It also genuinely made me feel *happy,* which is something not many anime have done for me, yet. Sure I've laughed, but I've never really sat down after watching an episode (or even a series) of anime and said, 'wow, this made me happy.' So, I'm definitely going to come back to this one. Too good. 

**Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Rebellion** (Movie watched twice this week)

Watch 1: Okay, I love the TV series and the first two movies. I'm sure I would like this if I had some sort of idea about what I just watched. Must.. rewatch.

Watch 2: I think I totally understand this now. I really liked pretty much every aspect of this film. The only downside to me was that the art style was really crazy during certain parts, but that's not really enough of a downside for me to knock it down from a **10/10.** Also, I think it would be stupid for Shaft to not make another TV series or film in this series. I feel like there would be an uproar if they didn't with that ending. ^^^^^^^^Homura ^^^^^^^^still ^^^^^^^^best ^^^^^^^^girl!

Well, next week is movie week for me! Watching **Redline**, **Ghost in the Shell**, **Wolf Children**, **Colorful**, **Paprika**, **Garden of Words**, and **The Girl Who Leapt Through Time**. Gonna be a fun week!

**[Guyver (2005)](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=1374)** - Typical henshin hero anime,  but with enough darker twists and actual character development that it stands out among them. Unfortunately it fails to fully distinguish itself and falls into a lot of cliches. The one that made me give it a 6 was the "girl who exists just to object to everything and be emotional." 

**[Kimera](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=2592)** - I grabbed this thinking the shounen ai tag on anidb was more of a minor element, but was (pleasantly?) surprised that it was actually one of the few shounen ai anime I've seen with a real plot and adult characters. Others making this same mistake is probably what caused the extremely low rating on MAL, because other than being a rushed adaptation into an hour long OVA, it's not *that" bad. Even then, the rushed exposition and ending can be accepted if you think of the story in a more small scale, humanistic way - not everything can be explained, not everything will make sense, and not everything will end up how you want it to. I felt that the ending was unique enough to give it a 6, and I wish there was a better adaptation. Androgynous space vampires should be the new Twilight.

**[Youjuu Toshi](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=1107)** - Better known as Wicked City, this lovely 80s gorefest is unique in that it could actually be played straight and adapted to a live action film. There's a lot of sex and weird horrible shit, but the plot (man meets woman, man must save woman and so save the world) is pretty standard and almost wholesome. Well, if you ignore all the rape... and tentacles... and vagina teeth.

**[Photon](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=1944)** - In search of more distilled 90s to consume along with Tenchi Muyo, I picked up Photon. It's a short, very silly sci-fi/harem/comedy that is just what you need if you're feeling down. Like Tenchi Muyo, there's a rich world full of weird technology powered by weird things, several girls orbiting the protagonist, and at least one trip to the bath. The main difference here is that unlike Tenchi, Photon is mentally something like 5, and physically not much older. He rarely speaks, is incredibly strong, and really just wants to protect the girls around him, and eat. I feel like this is a much better alternative to a generic harem protagonist, since he has some personality but still manages to be unobtrusive in the story and still allows it to be largely about the girls. I gave it a 7 for making me laugh.

I stopped watching non-airing shows for a while, so I haven't posted in these threads in the past month or so, but this time I have a lot to talk about, so I hope at least someone will be interested in what I have to say. To avoid spoilers, I will be pretty vague in my descriptions, so if you, the reader, want me to elaborate on something, just ask.

**Tasogare Otome x Amnesia (Dusk Maiden of Amnesia) (11/12)** - I am so torn when it comes to this show. It's a romantic comedy/drama, but it has a twist as well as the wonderful visual style characteristic of its director, Shin Oonuma. In addition, the aforementioned twist is used in a way that I hadn't seen before, and in the first few episodes, the twist was thematically very important to the show. Because of all of these reasons, I loved it during the first few episodes.

After that, the execution unfortunately began to unravel. The show tended more and more towards melodrama intertwined with regular anime comedy, and the plot started going in circles(or more specifically, cycles). This might have been meant as some sort of "mindfuck", but I personally didn't care for it. When I got to the end of the 11th episode, which was surprisingly interesting thematically, I decided to just stop and leave it at that, since the episode had a decent conclusion. I will probably watch the 12th and final episode at some point, but at the time I left it for the future because I had more interesting stuff to watch.

**Ga-Rei Zero (12/12 finished)** - Now this is a good show! This show is probably most famous for its first episode(for reasons that I will not explain due to spoilers), but I liked it in its entirety. It has action(which is very well animated at times), romance(though it should be noted that platonic love is a strong theme), comedy(not too much, just enough to provide a breather after some of the heavier stuff) and drama. It's not a lighthearted show, which made me very happy. Due to the structure of the storytelling, the story has a sense of urgency that I found enjoyable, but it could also be a dealbreaker for people who like their stories told in a certain way. Also, the OP of the show, which is first heard in the 3rd episode(for a good reason, so don't watch it before watching the show if you want maximum mystery), is kick-ass. It's also not terribly difficult to sing along to.

In my opinion, the shows biggest weakness is that it's an anime-original prequel to a manga. It forces the ending to be fairly unsatisfying and non-conclusive, and if one has read the manga, it also puts constraints on what exactly can happen in the anime(luckily, I hadn't read the manga, so I had no idea what would happen). However, I also think that the fact that it's a prequel is the show's greatest strength, for many of the same reasons that I mentioned above. The things that force the aforementioned constraints are stuff like the characters and the setting already existing, meaning that the writers of the show had time to work on more intricate details such as character interaction and action scenes, both of which I thought were excellent. In addition, while the ending wasn't the most satisfying or conclusive, it was also not terrible, which I guess is a plus. Well, not that I was concerned about bad direction at any point, since the show is directed by Ei Aoki(of Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai 1 fame).

**Hourou Musuko (Wandering Son) (8/11)** - Speaking of Ei Aoki, here's a show he directed that could not be further from Ga-Rei Zero, Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai in terms of its story or genres. This show caught my attention when I read its synopsis and saw that it seemed to be tackling gender identity in a non-humorous and extremely direct way, which is certainly very unusual in anime. At first I didn't even notice that it was directed by Ei Aoki, and why should I? The possibility never even crossed my mind before I saw his name in the credits. As I said, this is not like the other shows directed by him. This is a story about middle-school children who wonder about who they really are, what they really want and how they should communicate with other people. And in some ways, it's darker than Fate/Zero, Ga-Rei Zero and Kara no Kyoukai 1 put together. The themes surrounding gender identity come so close to stories I've heard from real people as well as my own experiences that at times the show feels frightening and dominating. It's like it's assaulting my self-perception and it makes me anxious. I am actually slightly afraid of continuing it for fear that something will happen in the show that I can't process either rationally or emotionally. 

But man, that fear and that dominating effect, they feel absolutely great to experience. This show feels great to watch, because it's unlike anything I've seen before in terms of how directly it addresses its core themes. This show uses very few metaphors, if any. When a girl says that she doesn't want to wear a bra, that's because she truly doesn't want to. When a boy says that he wants to wear a dress, that's because he really does want to wear a dress. And that brings me to the greatest thing about this show, and the reason that I'm still entertaining the possibility that I fell and hit my head 4 days ago and that this show is just a figment of my imagination:

I think the characters are perfect. No, not in the "MC-kun can do everything and he gets all the girls" kind of way, I mean in terms of writing. First of all, every character serves a purpose, but it doesn't feel like they were created from the ground up to fill very specific roles. Instead, it feels like the original author wrote a bunch of middle-school kids, made them part of the same group of friends and let the characters fill the different roles in the group dynamic naturally. And indeed, some of the characters feel very natural all around. They have their unique characters, but they all feel the full range of emotions felt by humans. In addition, the characters in this show are just as direct as the show's themes. They are very honest with both themselves(to a certain extent) and others, and most characters rarely hesitate to say what's on their minds. But, to counteract this almost unnatural openness, most of the characters are also capable of lying. Basically, none of the characters are extreme(except maybe for one). For all of these reasons, I find the characters in this show to be perfect in the sense that I don't know how they could be improved. They're wise and mature in exactly the ways that I like my characters to be, and I absolutely love it.

...Except for one thing. The characters being wise and mature is awesome, right? Yes, but they're pretty much 12 years old, an age at which very few children are wise and mature. My greatest criticism of this show is that I feel like the characters are not immature enough. They shouldn't be so quick to forgive. They shouldn't be direct and unhesitant all the time. They shouldn't be so understanding of each other. And this is causing me a terrible headache, because I never thought I would encounter characters like this: They're so perfect and I love them all and this show so much, but for the same reasons, the character writing is flawed. 

Well, not that it matters to me too much, I still think this is the best anime I've ever seen, at least for the moment.

**Now and Then, Here and There (1/13)** - I have only seen 1 episode of this, so I can't say much about it, but so far I like it. It's a breath of fresh air compared to the kind of show I usually watch.

Yeah, I had the same WTF moment when I checked the staff list. At least, given how good this is, I don't feel so cautious about *Aldnoah.Zero* sucking. Of course, that's an original series and this is based on an award-winning manga, so....
>> ARTICLE
>I don't feel so cautious about Aldnoah.Zero sucking

Yeah, I have a feeling that the quality of Aldnoah.Zero won't be impeded by the style of direction. If anything, it's up to the writers(Urobuchi, don't screw this up) to write interesting characters who can actually be utilised fully.

Also, I noticed an interesting coincidence: This will be at least the third show directed by Ei Aoki where the title of the show has "zero" in the title(The other two being the ones I mentioned earlier in my post).

Marathoned through all of Mirai Nikki in a couple of days and absolutely loved it (always enjoyed that type of "survival game").

I just finished Eva too, and immediately watched EoE. It is very easily my favorite anime now. I loooooved the ending. In both the show and the movie.

It clears some things up, but leaves you with some questions too. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Eva, but the general opinion is that you should watch The End of Evangelion now that you've finished the series. It replaces the last two episodes of the series and gives it a different ending if I understand correctly.

The Rebuild movies (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) are a sort of alternate retelling of the series and you can watch them at your leisure after EoE.

I also started watching [Macross Frontier](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3572/Macross_Frontier) and I'm not liking it very much. I've reached episode 20 and there isn't any character that I particularly care for and most of the characters' actions and interactions get on my nerves for some reason. The action isn't any better either but I've yet to watch the ending so I'll see how that plays out.

**OreImo (31/31)**

I'm not sure why I decided to pick this one up but I marathon'd the whole thing this week.  I think the show gets a lot more hate than it deserves because it deals with something that's pretty taboo as well as the fact that some of the characters sacrifice likability for realism (mostly Kirino).  I really enjoyed the show, it was funny, it has an absurd premise (Brother and Sister bonding over Siscon Eroge lol wat), lots of great characters and top notch visuals.  That being said, it has one of the worst endings of any show I've seen, I though people were just being dramatic but it honestly is a big slap in the face.

**Inferno Cop (13/13)**

It turns out that Trigger actually saved anime before Kill la Kill.  I was intrigued by the amount of praise Inferno Cop gets on MAL so I decided to check it out and it did not disappoint.  For a show which only runs about 25-30 minutes total, I laughed harder and had much more fun than pretty much any other show.  Its a shame that we can't rate it Inferno Cop/10 on MAL so we have to settle for 10/10.  If you haven't seen this show do yourself a favor and watch it right now, its well worth the 30-ish minutes of your time.

**Bakemonotagari (6/15)**

I honestly don't know what to think of this show, I really like the visuals and music but the show feels extremely dense with the amount of dialog in each episode.  Put this together with some pretty complex language, random cuts to kanji and other words on various colored backgrounds and the show quickly becomes very hard to understand what is going on.  That being said I'm still enjoying the hell out of it, the dialog is really good, I absolutely love the visuals, and the story is pretty intriguing so far.  I think I'm going to have to watch this one a few more times to figure out whats going on because there is certainly a lot going on that isn't very obvious at first glance.
>> ARTICLE
I agree on Bake. It can be very painful to watch just by the sheer mass of informations. I personally can't watch more than 2 or 3 episodes at once until I need a break to gather what happened and what was talked about. That said I still enjoyed it very very much and liked it for what it is. If you enjoy it by now, you are going to like the rest of it too!

I watched all of **Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei** this week, what a fucking trip. That show has all the head tilts and text cut away's you would expect from a SHAFT production, but with a lot more creative liberties taken than in any of their other shows. Half the show is self referential humor, the other half is social commentary on modern japanese society being done by sociopathilogical high school students. All in all, the show has kept me in stitches since pretty much the first episode of the first season, and the third season so far is more of the same. Glad I stumbled upon this one when I did.

E7: Pretty impressive characters, story and universe. It started off slow but I really enjoyed the various events in Gekko-go. However it did get a little dull in the middle, nothing else to complain apart from that.

HxH: I really enjoyed this one, they didn't drag things too much, it's fun to see Gon and Killua interact and of course the action (DAT hisoka vs gon scene in ep35) but I was kind of disappointed to see the pacing in the chimera ant arc, it ended up like most other shounen action on those grounds otherwise that arc was pretty awesome too.

Its my first time watching the movie and apparently its a year after the events so I would say yes its worth watching
>> ARTICLE
I'm split on the movie. It does great things with the characters, but the underlying storyline isn't nearly as well constructed as the series was. I enjoyed it, but more as a side-element to the series. I think the OVA ending was the best way for the series to finish.

I started watching **Bakemonogatari** this week as it's one of the big shows I have yet try. I'm only two episode in and so far it seems to be, well different is a good word. Not to say that it's bad, but the fan service is extremely overwhelming (panty shot in the first 10 seconds, really?), and the visuals are the Shaft usual. The dialog definitely is entertaining, and I'm excited to see the exchanges been different characters and Arararagi in the future. So I guess you could say my opinion is reserved but optimistic. 

I'm also 1 episode into **Jormungand: Perfect Order** and my big problem with the first season was the lack of any overarching plot and it seems like this time there may be one. Same old same old for everything else, awesome action and Koko is still loko. 


>> ARTICLE
Just FYI, the pantyshot in the first 10 seconds of Bakemonogatari is there for a very good reason. Japanese fans of the light novels (which is most of the viewerbase in Japan, I'm sure) would recognize the scene as being an important moment from Kizumonogatari, so it's a really good and relevant hook.

Unfortunately, if you're a North American/European viewer who has never read the novels, it's just a gratuitous pantyshot for no reason.
>> ARTICLE
**Little Princess Sara 9-28:** It looks like I was right on the mark about the foreshadowing. With the sudden change in the tone of the show, I've been blown away by the quality of it. I'm just so surprised that I haven't heard anybody ever mention it outside of talking about WMT anime in general.

The core strength of the show lies in the characters. Well, mainly Sara. *Ace wo Nerae*'s Hiromi either just took bullying and felt somehow responsible for it, or she was ignoring the existence of it entirely. Sara has a lot of internal conflict regarding it, but outwardly takes all punishment she recieves. There's a moment earlier in the series where she imagines herself hitting Lavinia, then forgiving her. Hiromi didn't do any of that. 

The OST works well enough that I barely know it's there. Except for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeP9n1_JLRk), which usually plays near the end of sad episodes. It gets my every time, even though I know it's coming.

One thing I find strange is that even though the series is centred around the suffering that Sara (and to a lesser extent, Becky) have to put up with, almost all the characters are fundamentally good. Good people, I mean. Not just those that were enchanted by Sara when she was rich, but random people on the street, too. All the people in the market, all the girls in the school (Lavinia aside). I suppose they're all like that just to show how despicable Miss Minchin and Lavinia are. 


**Ie Naki Ko 3-6:** The past few episodes haven't been as tragic as the first, and I lost a little interest. I can certainly see things going wrong again in future, but I feel that otherwise it'll be a fairly standard coming of age story.

**Jewelpet Happiness 1-5:** [A](http://i.imgur.com/MtG6xgs.jpg) [proud](http://i.imgur.com/NoC1cdr.jpg) [member](http://i.imgur.com/JDBYk90.jpg) [of](http://i.imgur.com/Uq8ldX8.jpg) [the](http://i.imgur.com/BFARpYX.jpg) [silly](http://i.imgur.com/50ZOXb1.jpg) [faces](http://i.imgur.com/gpQPiGp.jpg) [genre](http://i.imgur.com/Scwwcyu.jpg). Of course, this was pioneered by *Highschool Kimengumi*, which coincidentally was also animated by Studio Comet. The director has some pedigree too, having directed Cromartie Highschool.

It's a lot funnier than *Lady* already, because it's 90% pets. And when the pets aren't onscreen, there's a main character almost out of *Milky Holmes*. The only thing I can see lacking at the moment is the lack of a tsukkomi, but maybe it'll work.

[Merchandise](http://i.imgur.com/YzY5IbM.jpg) was sold in the first scene of the show, which explained just how happy it would make everybody. I'm quite alright with self-aware advertising like this.

The second to fith episodes haven't been as funny as the first, but Angela and Garnet have gotten more screentime. It's nice to hear Hirano Aya being a main character again.

I've been rewatching a bit of **Blassreiter**. Fairly mature series, early Urobuchi (although he was not the lead writer). It's not truly awe-inspiring by any means, but the writers do a damn good job making you hurt emotionally along with the characters. You also get a very unique sci-fi concept and absurd amounts of movement in the action scenes. Beginning is a little slow, but about halfway through, things kick up a notch.
>> ARTICLE
I made my roommate watch hxh, and in exchange he made me watch the Monogatari series. But he got bored while rewatching it with me, so I ended up just watching Monogatari recaps (in the order: 11, 16, 6) and then watching the first 3 arcs of the show (ie up til episode 15). 
I'd say it's pretty good, but I have yet to see what's so hyped up about it. Maybe not watching all the buildup might have sacrificed some of the awesomeness. Solid 8/10 so far.
>> ARTICLE
Daily Lives of High-School Boys was pretty fantastic

**Gundam Unicorn** - Definitely one of my favorite Gundam series now. Not as good as 08th MS Team, but it felt like a proper continuation of the UC timeline.

**Mushishi** - Japanese John Constantine is a lot better at not getting everyone around him killed. Episodic plot works really well, though I wouldn't have minded a story arc lasting two or three episodes once in a while. Looking forward to watching the currently airing season. 
>> ARTICLE
If you want something similar to Mushishi but darker and with 2-3 episode long arcs try [Mononoke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2246/Mononoke).

Started and finished all 12 episodes of Another, much better than I was expecting. I legitimately got creeped out at times and the story was great, the cliffhangers were awesome and the twists were excellent! Also i started angel beats, Angel academy (I think that's the name), Trigun, and Madoka Magica.
>> ARTICLE
The past weeks I haven't watched anything not airing because I've been busy with work and games but this week I got around too it.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai** 12/12

Damn it's a shame I couldn't get around too finish this earlier because it was TERRIFIC! I love the mix of comedy and seriousness they accomplish with the series and they make the romance between Yuuta and Rikka seem so natural.

I loved this season but from all I've heard I'll atleast for now stay away from season 2.

**Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin** 26/26

Rainbow has a kickass OP and a great MAL score so I figured I'd give it a shot and after the first episode I was really hyped up about it and it seemed great but overall I'd say it was.... good but not great.

It's definitely worth watching at some point and it was a pretty good series with deep meaning and some real feels (even if you might find that hard too believe in the beginning). All of the main cast were great and the villains while being good characters were the kind of villains I hate XD.

I had a fun ride watching it and I do recommend that people watch it but it's not a 10/10 worthy anime.

**Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya** 2/10

With it's second season coming up in the summer I felt like I needed too check this out as a deciding factor on whether or not I should watch S2 and thus far I think Ilya is really cute and is one of those characters that makes you say "I wish she were my daughter" but aside from that the series haven't been anything special yet.

Planning on finishing Fate/kaleid and Hataraku Maou-sama for next week.
>> ARTICLE
You can watch Chuuni Season 2, but just be aware that's it's basically a silly chuuni comedy and character service show, not the solidly-told and powerful story of the first season.

Prisma Illya is a personal favorite of mine. It's simple and straightforward but very well executed in my opinion. I might rewatch it before season 2 starts airing. I hope you enjoy it!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the comments, I hope I'll enjoy Illya and I might get too watching Chuuni at some point but it's not very highly prioritized right now.

**Shinsekai Yori** - (25/25)

It might be one of my new favorite shows, but I'll have to think about the story a bit to see if it should be. It's really hard to talk about without spoiling it. 

I still have a couple of questions after watching this show, so if someone could answer these for me, I would be very grateful. 

[spoilers](/s "If Tomiko was 267 when Satoru was 14, and Satoru is her grandson, when did she have kids?" )

[spoilers](/s "What happened to all the other queerats during the last few episodes? I know they were ordered to kill any and all queerats, but the only human-friendly one who showed up was Kiroumaru. Did the Giant Hornet and other human-friendly ones just not come to help or were they slaughtered when they tried to? ")

[spoilers](/s "I know Shisei was killed by subconscious Cantus leakage, but how? Was this just intentionally not explained? ")

Finished Guilty Crown and Strike Witches 1/2. 

For me, Guilty Crown would be somewhere around 7.5-8/10 as although the visuals were amazing, I couldnt stand Shu. 

For Strike Witches, I would give it a 8/10. Hartmann and Lucchini best girl. :P

id give guilty crown 10 for sound, 9 for visuals but only like a 4-5 for story. I kinda enjoyed it, but damn the concept was so good, they could've done so much more >_>
>> ARTICLE
**Cowboy Bebop**

Holy crap I loved this show. The filler, the characters, the plot...

The one thing I found really interesting was how each of the characters dealt with their past. [Cowboy Bebop](/s "Spike tries his best to ignore it and shut off his current life from his past. Faye is the opposite of Spike. She wants to connect to her past, but she can't no matter what. Jet has a more healthy relationship with his past, using it as an asset sometimes and dealing with problems from the past in a healthy way. Ed's past is just as mysterious to her as it is to the rest of us. The one moment it shows up in the form of her father, it disappears again without a glance back. At the end of that episode, she goes off to chase it, not sure whether or not if she'll ever reach it.")

I also loved Spike and Faye's relationship. [Cowboy Bebop](/s "It's wordless, they don't acknowledge that they're even friends, and yet, it's so much more. One episode, Spike asks her if she'll come save him if he recklessly charges into mortal danger, and that same episode, she does exactly that. It all makes the last scene more moving - Faye telling Spike that the past may not be important anymore, that nothing good came out of her regaining her memories, Spike telling her he needs to see whether or not he's alive, Faye's psuedo-gun-salute...")

I'll definitely be getting and watching the movie. Really wish we could have known a bit of the afterstory.

Nearing the End of **[Saki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5671/Saki)** (23/25).

/r/trueanime is leaking. /s

I've been watching **Watamote**, currently at episode 7 out of 12. The premise of this show is that the main character is a socially awkward high school girl, and she goes through various cringe-worthy moments each episode. Although I was never that cringe-y when I was younger, I still found her character very easy for me to relate to which is why I enjoy the show so much.

[Ping Pong](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22135/Ping_Pong_The_Animation) **(11/11)**  
  
I didn't watch this while it aired, to be honest the animation style was the reason. Funimation ended up uploading it to youtube and I was kinda bored so I gave it a shot, and wow, it was actually really good. Yes, the animation style was weird, but it made up for it by being a really fun anime to watch. I ended up watching the last 8 episodes in one day, I just had to know what happened next, pretty good for an anime that is exclusively about Ping Pong.

I can only agree with you on Usagi Drop. Finished it at something like 3 am today, it was amazing.

I finished **Kimi no Todoke** early this week, since then I've been catching up with all my currently-airing shows.  
I thought **Kimi no Todoke** was great, sweet with lovable characters, art, and music.  A good romance without boobs jokes or anything pervy seems rare unfortuneatly.  It could get frustrating at times watching the characters miscommunicate and such.  It also got the comedy side of things down.

The main character is Kuronuma "Sadako" Sawako and is one of the genuinely sweetest girls you will ever see in anime.  Thing is, she's kind of awkward.  She can't force a smile so whenever she tries she ends up scaring people and the way she tries to force herself to talk to people just enforces that.  But things start changing when the most popular guy in class (typing that feels stupid but I don't know how else to describe it) talks to her and starts helping her.  The show is about how she perceives others' feelings while trying to get them to understand her own.  It's about a loner finding out what it's like having friends.  It's about love - both lost and found.  It's also about realizing you can't expect others to do everything - you have to make the effort.

I'd say if it sounds intriguing it's worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. That's exactly why Kimi ni Todoke is my best-of choice for all romance anime and why Kuronuma Sawako is my choice for best-girl-of-all-best-girls. 
>> ARTICLE
Watched the last episodes of Higurashi, and I must say I am utterly dissapointed with it, I'm not even conflicted, and I won't say it was bad either, there was just some parts I outright disliked, not to mention I was a bit hyped about it.

I don't know how or why this trend of being obsessed with female characters started (okay, I guess I can have a small idea given the main demographic of this subreddit and the anime community in general), but to be honest I find the VAST majority of the best anime characters to be males, so it's a bit sad when they are overshadowed due to shallowness.
>> ARTICLE
Part of it might be because a good amount of male MCs are boring, generic self-inserts or the occasional whiny Shinji-type. Of course they're not all like that, but I'm sure this also contributes in some way.
>> ARTICLE
Most popular shows have many more female characters than male (SAO, Akame Ga Kill, Steins; Gate, and the entire 'harem' genre come to mind) so theres  significantly more competition in the female character bracket.

Edit: After I posted this I started thinking of all the immensely popular shows with predominantly male casts, so allow me to modify my statement: Most shows which are popular *on this sub* have more female characters than male.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is that it's usually the females that are the "gimmick" or more unique in those series. There are simply more fun female archetypes that they are willing to play around with compared to male archetypes.

Gilgamesh? Isn't he from Fate/Zero or something?
>> ARTICLE
He's also in Fate Stay Night but only very very briefly.
>> ARTICLE
He's one of the main antagonist in 2 out of the three routes, including the one that's getting adapted now, (UBW), so he's a pretty major character. 
>> ARTICLE
I think he meant he's in the first part of UBW that aired in 2014.
>> ARTICLE
Kiritsugu and Gilgamesh? Seriously??

Gilgamesh only had brief appearance in UBW and I don't even remember whether Kiritsugu actually made an appearance or not.

I also like them but this is some extreme fanboyism you have there.

I didn't pick the characters. I didn't realize they didn't show up much because I haven't seen F/sn yet.

Wow someone actually nominated Slaine, that bastard.

No Inaho? I know /r/anime is hating on Aldnoah Zero right now, but Slaine is on there, so why no Inaho? 

Edit: Not sure what the downvotes are for, but whatever.

Well, he wasn't nominated. I can't tell by your comment if you're a fan of Inaho, but if you are, you can submit him for my wild card experiment. Read the bottom few paragraphs of the post if you're interested:)

Sorry about this roundabout way to tell you guys about this, the character count was too high to fit it in the OP. As usual, the names and anime names in the post are clickable to go to their MAL pages.

It might be obvious already, but this is the setup yet again for the polls:

>Character 'necessary-for-identification nickname' name (anime name)

 I decided that since we will be having a poll thread at the end now with the winners of each poll thread anyways, I'll hold off on the best overall MC poll until we get there, and just include the top 5 or 10 from each poll. 

Here's the links for the last threads: [OP/ED]( http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2sqbsd/ranime_awards_poll_thread_1_best_op_and_best_ed/) | [Anime of the year by genre]( http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2stqvy/ranime_awards_poll_thread_2_anime_of_the_year_by/) | [Best Male Character]( http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2sy35q/ranime_awards_2014_poll_thread_3_best_male/) | [Best Female Character]( http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2sy3i0/ranime_awards_2014_poll_thread_31_best_female/) | [Best Character Development](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2t1p5k/ranime_awards_2014_poll_thread_4_best_character/)

Uhhh yeah, check out the wild card thing. Or else. I probably won't respond to any 'my character isn't in it, wtf bruh?' type comments because I put the whole idea first and foremost in the post. 

Let me know if you're willing to help me collect ab/muscles or boob pictures for tomorrow's 'best chest' thread. (mainly need help with ab/muscles)

Shaba-da-doo.

Hehe I would but I gotta show some other characters some love :)
>> ARTICLE
>ctrl + f

>no matches  

Literally why?
>> ARTICLE
saber isn't the heroine of unlimited blade works. Rin is.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't matter. Saber is obviously better than Rin.
>> ARTICLE
Subjectively, I much prefer Tohsaka myself. 
>> ARTICLE
Then why is Archer on the list? I know he's important in this route, but he's not the main male protagonist, Shirou is. I'd say Saber's character alone is at the very least equally as important as Archer even in this route. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I dunno why archer is on that list since it does say main characters...
>> ARTICLE
The main characters of UBW is Archer and Shirou. Rin is the deuteragonist of the series overall, but she's behind those two in her own route
>> ARTICLE
Sure. 
>> ARTICLE
JoJo, Killua, and Favaro
>> ARTICLE
Our lord Onii-sama will win.

Miyamori at least deserves a notice for all the hard work she puts in.

DAH MEN:
1. Killua
2. Levi

4. Aomine
5. Twelve

DAH LADIES
1. Hiyori
2. Riko

Surprised to see Aomine on here but not Kuroko, same with Saber not being there. Tons of great choices though!

Wild Card test

This is specifically for the people that didn't see the nomination thread. Basically, I'll be doing this for the rest of my threads. Each thread, I will have a maximum number of wild cards (for this one, it's 5). The top 5 (or other amount for another thread) will get a second chance and be in the final vote which will be held sometime after the end of the other polls, which is Wednesday, February 4. I'll probably end up posting it the 7th or the 8th. 

TL;DR, if you want characters added, comment them here.

Simon, specifically adult Simon (post time-skip), from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

EDIT 2: You know you guys could have just told me what I was doing wrong like /u/UgotMAL, instead of silently downvoting.

>> ARTICLE
Any characters that are upvoted less than this comment will NOT get into the competition with the wild card.

Edit for clarity: if this gets the same amount of points as a character, the character is allowed in still. If the character comment has more or the same amount of points but is still 'under' this comment, they're still allowed in.

Saber from F/SN: UBW.

I was tempted to add her myself,  actually.  Best girl. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope she gets some love.
>> ARTICLE
What would you count as a "main female character" in a balanced harem series like Trinity 7. None of the females stand out too far above the rest, so I'm not sure who of the series you would classify as "main".

If you think like I do then I would say that several of them, at least, could be considered main based off of the anime due to their near constant prevalence in the series.

In particular, I'd like to nominate Levi from Trinity 7, because I think she's more than prevalent enough in the series to be considered a main character.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't personally finished Trinity Seven yet and I haven't watched in a while, so bear with me.

[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25157/Trinity_Seven/characters) has 8 characters listed as 'main.' I would go ahead and include any of those. I assume the MC Arata is in there and then the other 7 are the 7 girls. I don't go off of just the MAL thing, unless I haven't seen the series and don't know any better.

So, a safe bet would be MAL I guess. If I've seen a show, I'll use my own judgement. Levi is fine.
>> ARTICLE
Aight mate. Now I just have to pray for /r/anime to develop my God-tier taste and vote Levi to the top.
>> ARTICLE
> Now I just have to pray for /r/anime to develop my God-tier taste

Yeah... good luck with that one.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, upvoting the "nothing under here" comment has to be cheating right? I call rigging against our glorious leader Levi.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, that's kind of the point of it. If it gets upvoted more than a character, the character obviously wasn't popular enough to win anyways.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, it must be another one of those evil conspiracies to crush my hopes and dreams of best girl winning.

Never fear, Levi's charm will surely win out. Maybe. Hopefully.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure it will. I liked the character, so I upvoted it for you!

I'll give it a shot; Yuuki Yuuna from [Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25519/Yuuki_Yuuna_wa_Yuusha_de_Aru)

She deserves to be in the competition for being the Madoka we all wished Madoka was.
>> ARTICLE
>for being the Madoka we all wished Madoka was.

Someone hasn't watched Symphogear for the true "hot blooded" Madoka experience (Not comparing Hibiki to Madoka, but they have the same VA and all...)

Anyway, if not for Sonokawa my vote would probably go to Yuuna for female lead
>> ARTICLE
My vote goes to Momoka Sonokawa.
Best MC in a good while
>> ARTICLE
Agreed she's awesome 
>> ARTICLE
I think next year we should find a team to make this whole thing better. Don't get me wrong, you're doing a wonderful job. But I can only imagine how much time you spend doing all of this and considering everyone's opinion.    

It may be a little confusing for new people that want to come and vote. I was thinking of an automated database year that adds all shows that aired in a respective year to the categories we decided on.(and maybe a strict number of categories, not so many)   
 
From there, everyone can access it and pick the show that they think it should be nominated. (it would look somewhat like [AniChart's interface](http://anichart.net/spring) )   

I guess this doesn't help that much now, sorry.
>> ARTICLE
That's okay. It's always good to get more input. I do spend a lot of time, and I kind of wish I had a group working instead of just me, but that's alright because I'm having fun with it and it's fun to add ideas specifically to each thread. 

The only thing is, if that type of thing happened next year, I probably wouldn't be involved or as involved. I'm not good with coding or making a website or anything else. Plus I enjoy making the crazy threads, even if it takes forever. 
>> ARTICLE
That's where animebracket.com comes in :) (just as soon as I'm done testing and open it up to all, probably in a week or two).
>> ARTICLE
Oh, cool. I'll have to check that out when I'm home. I don't know if it'll be necessary to do all of the threads on the site next time but I might delay this one enough so I can do the anime of the year award in it, if you don't mind. :)

It's kinda unfair letting characters of a character drama compete against... well ordinary shows. I mean, it's just the inherent nature of a charater drama to put all it's work in characterizing its charaters. 

Well, anyway, congratulations to Smile and Peco for being the best characters of 2014. You deserve it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to go ahead and call a win for Koyomi or Okabe and Kurisu, because of the /r/anime Steins;Gate and Monogatari fetish outweighing good taste, as seen by the best girl contest.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, any best character contest on this sub is a joke.  Who will stand victorious amongst the circlejerk this time.
>> ARTICLE
Its never a best anything. It only popularity contest. It doesn't matter if everyone who watched Ping Pong thought that Makoto Tsukimoto was the best male MC. If 3 times the people watched Hunter x Hunter and half thought Killua is the best male MC of the year. Then Killua would win even though a higher percentage of people though Tsukimoto was the better MC

Yes they are.

IRRC the Anikore rank is based on popularity and not score, so I'm not sure how much it'll be directly comparable.

Well, it will at least be including the total score number. And those at least seem to be following the rank number so far...

What's kind of interesting is that compared against MAL, you'd need to skew these scores up by 0.15 to 0.25.  I'm curious about their overall average score, and the number of anime on their list.

Some changes are nice, like not having FMA:B as an absurd 9.25.  But then again, Gintama is still up there, so wamp wamp.

Poor MAPPA , they did a pretty good job.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this really sucks. Shingeki no Bahamut is actually a great show and I consider it one of those of higher quality. MAPPA are generally a pretty good studio, so I do hope the sales for this show escalate.
>> ARTICLE
They were pretty late to announce BD sales. In fact, they originally weren't planning to sell any.

Maybe by the time they decided to do so, a lot of viewers already pressed the preorder button on other shows, not leaving much money left to marathon the Bahamut BDs. I still think they did a pretty good job at 3k. Not bad at all.

Watanabe making scraps. I haven't seen Space Dandy, but his direction saved ZnT so hard. That's kind of upsetting.

Wow, Denki-Gai did not sell well.

Yuuki Yuuna's second volume almost hitting 10k like the first one, it probably won't tough, but its good to see the drop was not sharp. I can see the series averaging at 9k which is pretty great, specially for a studio whose previous best selling work averaged at 6k
>> ARTICLE
The most over-represented "liked shows", that is to say, the shows with the highest jump in position from how many watch them to how many voted them for top 5, after removing all shows watched by under 23 people (5% of the voters). 

Another way to say it would be **"Most underwatched shows"**:

| Title  | Difference  |
|:-----|-----------:|
|Ace of Diamond	|14|
|Mushishi Zoku Shou|	12|
|JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders|	10|
|Sidonia no Kishi / Knights of Sidonia|	8|
|Fairy Tail (2014)|	8|


Note Mushishi's +12, that means that its relative position on how many watch it should be 12 higher, to catch up with how much people appreciate it. tl;dr? Everyone should watch Mushishi.

This chart is dominated *very* heavily by continuations/returning shows. People who pick up a returning show or stuck with it for quite some time are more likely to be ones that like it, so here is the top 5 "underwatched shows" without accounting for returning/continuing shows:

| Title  | Difference  |
|:-----|-----------:|
|Sidonia no Kishi / Knights of Sidonia|	8|
|Ping Pong The Animation|	5|
|Baby Steps|	5|
|Isshuukan Friends.|	4|
|Haikyuu!!|	4|
|Kamigami no Asobi |	4|

---

And the most negatively represented shows (meaning "**most over-watched shows**", that many more people watch them than those who think they should be top 3 material):

| Title  | Difference  |
|:-----|-----------:|
|Seikoku no Dragonar|	-14|
|Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara|	-12|
|Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of Dusk|	-10|
|M3 ~Sono Kuroki Tetsu~|	-9|
|Hitsugi no Chaika	|-8|
|Selector Infected WIXOSS|-8|
|Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to|-8|
|Mahou Shoujo Taisen|-8|

These shows are interesting. We don't have Pupa, but I guess M3 is the equivalent, of people wanting to see just how bad it is. The other shows, it's not that they're bad, but people watch them as filler, I guess, without thinking or desiring them to be anything special?

---

Of course, since you have the percentages, it doesn't really matter, if all had been "equal", it wouldn't matter how many people watch each show, but those who find a show favourite would be equal across the board. In a perfect world each show would be watched by the same amount of people (the average), and if a show is the most watched show, then it should also rank at the highest of those who think it's "really good", or so the argument goes.

Sorry, a bit rambly, again.

The average number of shows a respondent watched this survey was 10.6 shows. Down from  12.35 shows per respondent at week 6. Guess people are getting behind and then dropping shows/waiting for them to conclude.

I gave the Familiar of Zero a 9/10 though. It's pretty easy to see that Dragonar Academy is a notch down in quality but still hard not to enjoy when you like those types of shows. 

I think I tried to promote it in /r/trueanime monday minithread but apparently they don't like this kind of show to begin with >.>

Oh you, ignoring Ace of Diamond on purpose in order to push up Mushishi more. Favoritism!
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I actually chuckled to myself (or should I say "Cackled"?) as I ignored Ace of Diamond for Mushishi! More to the point, Ace of Diamond just barely made it into the charts, with only 31 watchers. Had I gone with a cut-off of 10% of the watchers, which I was tempted to, it wouldn't be there at all.
>> ARTICLE
Knights of Sidonia not winning every category as it rightfully should is disappointing. I'll forgive /r/anime for Mushishi ranking #1 in top 10 favorites though.
>> ARTICLE
> Knights of Sidonia not winning every category as it rightfully should is disappointing.

I'm enjoying Knights of Sidonia, but so far it has been very action orientated while the scenes themselves don't look impressive, mainly due to the CGI. The Gauna really looks poorly done. The animation on the other hand is fantastic, I'll certainly give the show that.

But even so, it looked like they want to make the clash of classes a big deal with all the discrimination towards Nagate but it hasn't really come through yet, and neither has the world building even though there is a whole lot to talk about the infrastructure, science and architecture of Sidonia.

It has more or less the same problems Black Bullet has without being as ridiculous. It can do better than just action, but so far it hasn't acted on the possibilities.
>> ARTICLE
I'm quite the opposite. I think the action scenes look phenomenal. I really like how they've used the CGI, something I wouldn't normally say. The only issue I've had with the CGi so far is the character CGi. They're a bit lacking in detail and their movement could be a bit better, but even then it isn't even much of a big deal. I still really like the character designs and all the other implementations of the CGI that they've done so far. I don't think it would work as well with other shows, but for Sidonia I'm loving it.
>> ARTICLE
Sidonia is full CGI, everything. And that's what I meant by animation being fantastic. The movements are fluid and solid, but both the characters and Gauna look like crap.
>> ARTICLE
The characters aren't the greatest looking, but I think the guana look pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
The lighting on the tentacles make them look like pastries
>> ARTICLE
It's alright,Sidonia is highest rating show in niconico currently(episode 4,96% give it 5 out of 5)
>> ARTICLE
I'm waiting on the blurays in the hopes that they fix the framerates.
>> ARTICLE
The framerate in episode 4 is a lot better then the first but it is still noticeable.
>> ARTICLE
If only I had your patience.
>> ARTICLE
I've got another 18 shows each week, so it's not too bad.  Sidonia seems like it'll be better when marathoned anyway.
>> ARTICLE
If I remember correctly, I don't think I chose KoS/SnK for one of my top picks at the time of the survey since I think there were only two episodes out then.  Those two episodes weren't bad by any means, but they were kind of a slow burn.  I wasn't sure what to expect from it, but if the next week or two is on par with the latest episode I very well may have Knights of Sidonia in my top picks for Week 6.
>> ARTICLE
Man, more people need to watch Nanana's Buried Treasure :c 

It's a really really fun action/popcorn-y show, the characters are ALL very likeable [especially the detective loli], the visuals are quite pretty, particularly the shots of the island, and it's seemingly getting more serious/an actual plot if you look at the recent episodes. 

The OP is kinda bland, but ehhh... the rest is highly enjoyable imo.

>> ARTICLE
I get my loli fix from Chaika, Black Bullet, and Fairy Tail in that order.
>> ARTICLE
Heck yeah! I know there were some complaints about too much going on last episode, but the plot twists! *The plot twists!* Plus the Indiana Jones sections. Some people don't like the CGI, but it's not featured everywhere, all the time, so I don't consider it as much of a problem.
>> ARTICLE
The plot twists are *crazy.* Especially last episode, jeez. I will admit last ep was a bit confusing but it was still awesome.

And yeah, the Indiana Jones sections are SO much fun. You sorta don't notice the CGI after a while, imo.
>> ARTICLE
If I'm not mistaken, it seems to be 13th in the most watched category, at 40.7%, which is fairly high, I think.

Even so, I agree that more people need to watch it! It's one of my favourite shows this season (albeit, I feel like there are a few of them) but it's one that I've actually gone back and watched episodes of, because of how much I enjoyed it (which I pretty much never do). 
>> ARTICLE
People are already watching most of the shows I'm impressed by (**Ping Pong**, **Mushishi**, **One Week Friends**, **JoJo**), so I guess I should just rep the outlier - **Knights of Sidonia**. I know, the CG's terrible. But you kind of get used to it, and if you can look past it, Knights of Sidonia is a gritty, thrilling action-drama in a very rich scifi world.

Ping Pong is easily my personal top pick, but I think Knights of Sidonia is the show that the most people *aren't* watching who really *would* enjoy it - if you liked Attack on Titan, you should like Knights of Sidonia.
>> ARTICLE
I generally like experimental art styles, but I can't bear to watch three minutes of Ping Pong. I'll try again a bit later because apparently it's a good show and it makes me mad I keep turning it off.
>> ARTICLE
The lack of a simulcast is probably hurting Sidonia.  It's definitely a great anime.
>> ARTICLE
But I like SnK for the MMA
>> ARTICLE
JoJo and Mushishi at the top of Top 10 Favourites are right where they should be...

Dear /r/anime, go watch them.

What happened to Akuma no Riddle "pre season" chart bar?
>> ARTICLE
Both of them are sequels. Some people might not have seen the originals.

Also, another way to look at it: people who won't like JoJo and Mushishi already dropped them in the first season, meaning that the people who really enjoyed JoJo and Mushishi will increase the favorite show transference percentage.

Not that JoJo and Mushishi are bad by any stretch of the word. I'm in the middle of watching season 1 of JoJo and liking it pretty well, but it helps to keep the above paragraph in mind. Favorite show transference for sequels is slightly biased.
>> ARTICLE
>Favorite show transference for sequels is slightly biased.

Yeah, but sometimes you get something like Chu2 which comes along and although being a sequel to a popular show, drops quite dramatically.
>> ARTICLE
I watched like the first and second episode of Chu2 and decided I wasn't really interested. From what I heard in /r/anime, there were like legitimate reasons to dislike the sequel. Partly on the basis that it wasn't anything as meaningful as the first season.

Not to say that you're wrong, because you're completely right, but as more of a specific discussion on it, Chu2's case is a bit different in my opinion because it seemed like it was written for the sole sake of a sequel. Mushishi and JoJo are both manga series which had continuations after the anime ended, meaning they maintained much of the same feel as the first series through following the source material. If that makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was the lack of coherent progression and unfulfilling conclusion that I feel let it down.

In Chu's case, it was based on a book, the first season covered the first book pretty loosely and the 2nd season was based on the 2nd book which KyoAni completely butchered. 

So like JoJo and Mushi there was also a pre existing source for Chu2.

But you have a point, since Mushi and JoJo are based on Manga which is more accessibly rather than LNs so a larger portion of the fan base knows what to expect.
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, but sometimes you get something like Chu2 which comes along and although being a sequel to a popular show, drops quite dramatically.

That took quite a few weeks to happen, though.
>> ARTICLE
True, didn't really happen till Week 9, but I guess it goes to show whether people who are highly interested in the sequels stay highly interested in it all the way throughout.

>> ARTICLE
> Favorite show transference for sequels is slightly biased.

Yes, which is why I've provided numbers without them in the above chart, and in my comment for "underwatched" as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I figured that was why those numbers existed in the first place!

However, he stated that JoJo and Mushishi were topping the Top 10 Favorites, and I was like "Well, yeah, kinda. They're already really good, so it just takes a bit of a push from the sequel bias for them to reach the very top," implying that the numbers for Top 10 Favorites Including Sequels are accurate, but slightly over-representative for sequels.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, as /u/tundranocaps said it wasn't in that poll, I was shocked when I couldn't find it, seem it may have just been confirmed after the survey was held. 
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't in that poll. Not sure if it was a late announcement or what.
>> ARTICLE
Damn right no game no life is at the top. Black bullet not doing half bad either. 

Brynhildr in the darkness barely made it on the last list too, but it's my personal favorite. 
>> ARTICLE
Well this survey was done when most series where at episodes 2-3, and Brynhildr saw it's spike in episode 4 so it may do better in Week 6.
>> ARTICLE
Brynhildr's 3rd episode was the best one though, people complained about the pacing in episode 4. 
>> ARTICLE
We got Kazumi in episode 4 though.
>> ARTICLE
true, kazumi and booby fees
>> ARTICLE
There are 57.4% too few people watching *Hitsugi no Chaika*.
>> ARTICLE
You have good taste my friend.
>> ARTICLE
The first 2 episodes of Chaika weren't great, imo. The characters were really flat - they didn't come into their own until episode 3. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm very behind on the show. Worth watching?
>> ARTICLE
Best per capita entertainment I am getting this season, but it lands in basically the perfect genre/attitude/vibe quadrant for me.

I've seen people say that episode 3 is where things got good for them, so as someone who has loved every minute of every episode thus far, I guess I'd recommend doing that, since it came from people who aren't quite as in love with the series as I am.
>> ARTICLE
It did a good jump though, from pre season at only ~11%.
>> ARTICLE
Biggest surprise for me is how little Captain Earth I see on here. I thought a lot of people were watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Well it makes sense to me. If I was busier I probably would have dropped it by now. It's not that great. The writing is pretty shoddy, the characters are very flat and it's really fucking awkward (Libido charge? orgone energy? belly button forte?). Like I said, I am still watching it, but I am not really enjoying it, I just watch it because I have nothing particularly better do
>> ARTICLE
It's 12th most watched show on /r/anime according to the survey, only about 1% below Hitsugi no Chaika.  41.4% of respondents isn't bad!
>> ARTICLE
I'm waiting until it ends to marathon it. I'm fairly certain there are a few others doing that as well.
>> ARTICLE
I am. Just seems like a show to marathon rather than watch weekly, to me. Gave it 3 episodes weekly.
>> ARTICLE
I thought so too, but after a few of the discussion threads, it felt like there were less people discussing it.

Actually, I just looked it up and it does seem like there are quite a few comments in them. I think I was just showing up fairly early to the threads, which is what gave me the false impression.

I don't think I've seen much talk of it in general on this sub, though. But again, this is just my feeling, which probably means the opposite is true.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it felt like there was way more comments, perhaps people were more likely to discuss it, theres lots to talk about.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is doing work, and I love it! I sincerely hope that it keeps up to this fantastic level all the way through.
>> ARTICLE
So I suppose HxH and the like weren't included.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a little surprised at how much No Game No Life is kicking Mahouka around in terms of popularity here, both in number of viewers and favorite picks.  The disparity between how many are watching each isn't *that* great, but considering how much talk there was about Mahouka being the hot shit of the season, it's interesting to see three other shows solidly above it on the viewers chart.
>> ARTICLE
Most of the entertainment in Mahouka is seeing just how horribly bad it is.  Gary Stu MC, transparent right-wing propagandizing, the writer obviously being super bitter about having gotten bad grades in high school, and most importantly, a complete and utter lack of WRYYYYYYs.

No Game No Life, in the meantime, is basically in it for shits and giggles most of the time, with occasional truly fantastic moments shining through.  That speech last week was fabulous.  You don't get nearly as much of the feeling that the author thinks he's the elite of the elite.
>> ARTICLE
At the same time I feel like NGNL dropped the ball when it tries to act smart. The "chess game" was a "I make the up rules as I please" shamble, and the speech is so laughably bad and selfjerk on the level of Mahouka. 

This show is so much better when it doesn't treat itself like it's a smart show and do more self deprecating jokes, because face it, there's very little wit in the games themselves so far.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm looking forward to better games.  But that speech was nowhere near Mahouka levels.  Yeah, I'll agree that it was sort of a selfjerk, but it was a *hilarious* selfjerk.  [](/s "We're awesome because we suck") is an idea I can get behind, and it's far less common than dry libertarian talking points.
>> ARTICLE
it's wet and sappy, and just boring in general. I'll agree it's not as dry as Mahouka. Looking at the comments in that episode thread I laugh at those who actually bought into the idea in that speech.
>> ARTICLE
Same, I did not expect NGNL to blow up like it did seeing as it had no pre season hype like Mahouka did. But after a few episodes of NGNL you see why as it's just a more fun series to watch.
>> ARTICLE
It's simple:

    Underdogs > Ubermensch
    Shiro > Miyuki
    Sorasplanations > Tatsuyasplanations
    Steph > Mahouka's entire harem
>> ARTICLE
Really though, this anime has 3 really amazing characters, and the way they use Steph as a method to explain all the game stuff is fantastic and feels just right. 

Even if there are more or less only 3 characters so far.
>> ARTICLE
Why is it surprising that the show about an overpowered shut-in geek kicking ass in a different world is the most popular? Looking at previous trends, this show was definitely going to be very popular.
>> ARTICLE
Based on discussion since the season started, I'm not surprised at all.  People have been raving about No Game No Life almost non-stop since the first episode aired.  Prior to that, though, I don't really remember hearing much about it, especially compared to chatter centered around Mahouka.  Maybe I just skimmed past the NGNL hype or something since the synopsis kind of repulsed me, much less failed to interest me.  In any case, it was shocking when it exploded on the sub.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for doing these. Really interesting to look at and I am curious as to how things will progress over time. Judging by the "favourite show transference" list, I really should get around to finishing the first season of Mushishi and also get started on JoJo.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is great. Was a contender for AotY before it even began airing, and then 2 other shows this season are giving it a run for its money, which shows how strong this season is :)

JoJo is very enjoyable, once you hit episode 9-10.
>> ARTICLE
Up to episode 18 of the first season, and I love it. Although, for some reason I don't think I've watched an episode for a while :(

Well, I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow.

I think I might wait until I've got a bit more free time (after exams) to watch JoJo. I just personally don't really want to start it until then. After hearing amazing things, I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
I think the best part about Mushishi for me is I've been watching it over a span of time, throwing it in-between work, other shows, and games (Child of Light is incredible I recommend playing it). The episodic nature makes it easy to dive right back into all it's glory.
>> ARTICLE
So much for international pre-orders, my copy of Child of Light still didn't arrive :(
>> ARTICLE
I'm personally watching JoJo, Mekaku City Actors, Ping Pong, Kenzen Robo Daimidaler, and waiting to marathon Mushishi. Good season.
>> ARTICLE
Marathon Mushishi? That's a show I always recommend people to *not* marathon :<
>> ARTICLE
To me, Mushishi is more enjoyable if I can watch it in large quantities. I watched S1 in about a week, and am looking forward to doing the same with S2. It's an absolutely amazing anime, but that's how I prefer to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
B-but where is DAL 2??? Shocking Truth!!!
>> ARTICLE
If I may ask a request, or at least, bring up the possibility: if possible for the next survey, could it be possible for the English names to be given as well as the ones currently given? [I feel like my wording here isn't quite as clear as to what I'm trying to say; but I can't think of a way to improve it, my apologies]

I'm mainly saying this because I think I remember someone bringing that up previously, and it seems like it might be helpful in avoiding confusion. 

However, to me personally, it doesn't seem much of a problem, as it doesn't seem too hard for people to figure out the name if people are having confusion. I'm merely bringing this up so as to try and bring attention to the possibility of confusion in the survey.
>> ARTICLE
I think it depends on the show, for some, such as JoJo, I'd present only the English name, for instance. Brynhildr and Chaika are split. Akuma no Riddle isn't really at all mentioned by its English name.

Personally? I'd rather whatever is added to be added *after* the current name, so it'd be [current name] / [alternate name].

Last season orders had been changed between polls and until I realized what messed up all my data, it cost me about 2 hours of work.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I wasn't clear in my post, I agree with your view on the [current name] / [alternate name] format. It seems like the most efficient /clear way to me, personally.
>> ARTICLE
Sure that would be possible to add the English name besides the original for a few of them as I don't think it's necessary for all of them.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you, I agree that it's not needed for all. Thanks agains for these surveys! 
>> ARTICLE
My favorites so far have been NGNL (who doesn't love this show at this point?), Brynhildr, and KoS so I am decently pleased with the results.
>> ARTICLE
So, I have about a week on Thursday to marathon Golden Time, Nagi no Asukura, Strike the Blood, Samurai Flamenco and Log Horizon before next season starts? Great.
>> ARTICLE
My humble opinion, you can safely drop strike the blood. After a strong start it becomes more boring and vanilla with each episode. You should check out Noragami instead if you aren't already watching. It's amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah definitely need to watch Noragami.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what you're talking about.  Strike the Blood is a hilarious self-aware stupid harem show.  It's constantly making fun of itself, and my weeks are going to be a lot more sad and empty when it's over.

You're *really* not supposed to take Strike the Blood seriously.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying it's a terrible show by any means. I just don't think it's worth investing 24 episodes in IMO. I loved the beginning but half way through I found myself not caring about any of the characters or the story.
>> ARTICLE
*Challenge accepted*
>> ARTICLE
I just started to marathon Log Horizon, Noragami, Samurai Flamenco, Nagi no Asukara, Kill la Kill Strike the Blood, Nobunagun and Tokyo Ravens so I can be caught up in time for the finales. Good thing my spring break starts tomorrow otherwise I probably wouldn't be able to find the time
>> ARTICLE
You are now in line for, "Emotional Roller Coaster."  Please do not attempt to leave line under penalty of death.  Enjoy your ride!
>> ARTICLE
Everything ends in 9 days.
>> ARTICLE
this comment changes meaning significantly without context.
>> ARTICLE
I've been doing that with Toyko Ravens when it had only 22 episodes. Realized its going to end on March 25th 2014. I'm on episode 20 right now. Saving 3 episode to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I started watching Tokyo ravens weekly but with the rapid addition of new characters and being slightly confused when remembering exactly what happened the week before. I put it on hold and will marathon it when its finished!

>> ARTICLE
Oh crap...I forgot about the shows that were only Simulcast on Funimation. 
>> ARTICLE
is tokyo ravens good?  should i pick it up quickly?
>> ARTICLE
Yes it is. Yes you should.
>> ARTICLE
dammit, and i was going to catch up on sam flam today.
>> ARTICLE
It's decent, nothing you won't miss by not watching it imo


Then again I'm about 3-4 weeks behind so I'm not entirely sure how it is atm
>> ARTICLE
It is so good right now, I would definitely catch up.
>> ARTICLE
AWESOME list.  I have added the day of the week these shows begin airing, assuming that they will stay on that day, and the planned number of episodes where that information is available.

>> ARTICLE
I do not even know why I am keen for Date A Live 2.

That aside, spring 2014 looks great!
>> ARTICLE
Right? Date A Live isn't great at all. But... there is something with it that makes you want to watch it.

.

.

.

Tohka best girl.
>> ARTICLE
Origami doesn't get enough love! Watch the OVA!
>> ARTICLE
> there is something with it that makes you want to watch it.

Come on, that [Date-A-Live](/s "date sim at the end of episode 1. With the blatant Kotori insert and Shidou giving the biggest "are you serious?" face is proof enough the whole thing was a parody.")
>> ARTICLE
I was about to roll my eyes at yet another "upcoming season thread" (there are tons more to come), but a list of airdates is actually pretty useful, so I appreciate the effort!

Winter season has been kinda lackluster.  There's a lot of solid humor, but nothing particularly meaty like the Kyousougigas and Uchouten Kazokus of seasons past.  Spring looks like it's going to have more in that regard, while still having some good comedies.  So I'm excited.

- **Ping Pong** is a definite frontrunner, in my opinion as a raving Yuasa fan.  A lot of people are immediately writing it off as yet another sports shounen but with weird art... those people must not be familiar with Yuasa or Matsumoto.  This ain't gonna be your average sports anime.  My most anticipated of Spring 2014.

- **Mushishi** is another big one.  I've yet to finish the first season, but it's a really special show.  And before anyone asks, I've never seen Jojo.  I know, I'm sorry.  A big ORAORA MUDAMUDA for me.

- **Mekakucity Actors** is getting a lot of buzz, mostly because it's SHAFT and the source material is a little unconventional.  Apart from that I know nothing about it, so I'm tentatively excited.  **Isshuukan Friends** is another that I've heard good things about, but am otherwise unfamiliar with.

- I'm not *huge* on action, space, or mecha, but I also won't write them off on principle - so **Captain Earth** will get a look for its studio pedigree, and **Knights of Sidonia** for the novelty of CG.

- As far as comedies go, **Kawaisou** is from the mangaka who did Love Lab, which I totally loved.  Heard good things about **Mangaka-san**.  Will probably check out **Gaworare** and **No Game No Life**.

Others that I'll probably give 1-3 eps: Akuma no Riddle, Black Bullet, Gochuumon, Gokukoku no Brynhildr, Hitsugi no Chaika, and probably a few more.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is looking to be my top pick as well. Great piece that could certainly stand to benefit from an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, you might be one of the first I've heard *not* checking out *Mahouka.* It seems like, for better or worse, it's probably the big new property being adapted and I suspect a sales leader.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I'll probably end up peeping the first episode, but it really doesn't seem like my thing at all.  This isn't based on *too* much evidence, but I'm imagining a relatively by-the-numbers fantasy tale with some teen melodrama and romance, and the occasional action scene and comedic relief peppered in.  Just a gut feeling.  I guess we'll see.

edit: [PVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKmVmadbrfI) more or less uphold my suspicions, but I'll probably watch the first episode just because of the hype.
>> ARTICLE
I think Mahouka is a bit different from most anime fantasy, in that its fantasy system is described in a very "scientific" (in-universe, of course) manner. I'd compare it to something like Toaru Kagaku no Railgun, actually, in that it feels a bit more sci-fi than fantasy, despite the fact that magic is involved. So yeah, not the most original thing, but I've enjoyed the LNs.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with your sentiments cus I've read the source material and it's alright, but not really anything to write home about. I feel this way because I feel the in the source material the characters aren't really making decisions, they only react to what's happening to them and not really dealing with the consequences of those actions. Also, I feel that the characters are too good in that when ever they need to solve a problem, they can do it immediately and so I can't really get a good sense of the character's flaws and their strengths.
>> ARTICLE
In terms of sales, Mekaku City Actors actually could easily sweep the season if Aniplex plays their cards right. A concert ticket bundled with a BD volume would easily net 60k sales. Hell it doesn't even have to be on the scale of a concert. Even some goodies like posters, art, nendroids, etc,  would make vocaloid fans go nuts.

God I read all the translated manga and my body is so ready for what magic shaft will work with it. I can't even imagine what it'll be like

What about Stardust Crusaders? Don't think I see it on your list.

Oh right. I'll just add that in after Jojo.
>> ARTICLE
I'm super excited for Haikyuu!!
>> ARTICLE
I'm trying out thirty shows and will probably drop 15-20 of them.  I'm looking forward to a lot of the ones with buzz, but no one seems to be talking about Locodol.  I'm really looking forward to that one, because low-budget idols on a crappy town salary dealing with town drama and bad stages?  That has all the makings of something great.  I don't usually watch idol shows, but this seems like a sufficiently decent break from the trends.  There are lots of interesting things they can do with the whole local bit, since they're actually representing the town, and some people might take issue with the ways they do things, or with the idea of having town idols to begin with.  They'll probably be pulled into doing lots of crappy advertisements for local business, show up for school and senior center events, and get none of the really big popularity or glamor that a regular successful idol might (though they have it rough too, in different ways).  Basically, I think it's a super interesting concept to see explored, and I hope they do it right.
>> ARTICLE
I'm wary because of 4-koma source material, plus a studio + director combination most well known for ecchi shows like kiss x sis. I'll definitely check it out, but I don't have my hopes up at all.
>> ARTICLE
I like lots of 4-koma adaptations, and I enjoyed Yuushibu and Imocho for their stories, so there shouldn't be anything that puts me off the show.  Ecchi can't support a series by itself, but it's not a dealbreaker for me.  We'll have to see.  My numbers for dropping includes several of the shows I have high expectations for, since I expect a certain percentage of those will unfortunately end up being lackluster.  For all I know, Locodol will be one of them.  Gotta do the buildup first to get the soul-crushing disappointment later, though!
>> ARTICLE
can't wait for black bullet!
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if I'm ready for Ping Pong yet.
>> ARTICLE
Mekaku City Actors, Black Bullet, Gokukoku no Brynhildr.

Oh man, Atelier Escha & Logy is going to have to work extra overtime to heal all that SUFFERING.

Definitely gonna have to balance out those shows with some JoJo's and Captain Earth in between. This season is probably my most favorite in a while though. I know the source material of pretty much all the shows I'm watching so no broken dreams and false hopes this spring. :D
>> ARTICLE
Some of the ones that really draw my attention:

**Seikoku no Dragonar** seems interesting...a dead ringer compared to the Familiar of Zero, which I loved. 

Plot of **No Game No Life** is interesting, sounds like Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They. 

**Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san** will be this season's Sakura Trick?

**Mekaku City Actors** sounds like it'll get really intense, and it's animated by Shaft. The plot description is comparable to that of Welcome to the NHK. 

**Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin** yet another NEET anime. Wow, NEET/Hikikomori related stuff is really popular this season.

**Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara** a dating sim/visual novel anime like the World God Only Knows? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm really looking forward to **Fairy Tail** and **Date A Live 2nd Season**.

Added to the list will be **Ping Pong The Animation**, **Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei** and **No Game No Life**. I've never read their source material but people seem excited for them so I may as well give them a shot.

**Black Bullet** also looks interesting.

I'll also be watching any Slice of Life and Ecchi series coming out since I really enjoy those genres and I'll probably add more shows to the list if they grab my attention.
>> ARTICLE
I'm looking forward to Black Bullet. It's gonna be like Zetsuen and Guilty Crown '.'.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the links. Better to add them now than look for them separately later.
>> ARTICLE
Giving any interesting ones the 3-episode rule.

...

Date A Live 2nd Season, Mahouka, Black Bullet and No Game No Life are exempt from this rule.
>> ARTICLE
Is this all the shows coming out this season?
>> ARTICLE
27 new series, 7 sequels, a few shorts. Pretty much in line with the usual numbers really.

2 weeks til knights of sidonia... As a fan of the manga I hope it goes well. Thing is I don't know where they would end it if it were 13 episodes... The best spot seems to be chapter 20 but I don't know if I like them cramming 20 chapters worth of material in 13 episodes. It could work, depending on how they do it obviously. Personally I'm hoping its 2-cour

Soul Eater not and Dave a live 2 I'm planning to check out. can't recognise anything of the rest from this first skim. Will have to read in depth and decide. Any of them look good for chill slice of life fans?
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi. It's straight up magic. 
>> ARTICLE
cheers
>> ARTICLE
A lot of these look really good but the ones I know will be good for sure are the sequels of Mushishi, Soul Eater, and Fairy Tail. I will probably watch at least like a fourth of what is on this list or at least give them a try.
>> ARTICLE
Soul Eater Not is a spin off, not a sequel
>> ARTICLE
Really excited for Jojo and Love Live. A lot of NEET anime this season...
>> ARTICLE
For me I'll be watching:

Mahouka: Its by Madhouse and backed up by Aniplex which generally means good animation, not to mention that magic system sounds interesting. Just hope there won't be too much info dump.

Black Bullet: Many have been saying this is like Shingeki no Kyojin in the future so I feel I must give this one a good (considering that I thoroughly enjoyed SnK). Main character looks like a badass, there is a villain that reminds me of the Joker in a way and its looks like a gritty sci-fi anime (which my enjoyment of Psycho Pass is starting to make me crave more of). 

Captain Earth: I hope this is more Eureka 7 than Star Driver. Plus Bones always means amazing animation (one of the reasons I watch anime for). Just hope they can deliver on the story because unlike FMA, ZnT or Noragami this is an anime original. 

Haikyuu: Production IG nuff said. Might give it the 3 episode rule but the animation looks appealing to me.

Jojo: Once I finish the first season that is.

Mekaku City Actors: Shaft visuals sometimes annoy me (ala Nisekoi) but their work on Madoka Magica was amazing in my opinion (probably because it didn't have blank screens with text every few minutes). Anyways I heard the source material is pretty good, I like the character designs... 
>> ARTICLE
As somebody who is more into Slice of Life and comedy type of stuff, anybody have any good recommendations on this list? I was going through a few:

Selector Infected WIXOSS: looks good, even though it's not normally what I watch. 

Isshuukan Friends: Also caught my eye.

Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka: Wanted to ask about this one. The genres match up to what I normally like, but the anime seems a little weird just based off the summary. 

Futsuu no Joshikousei ga [Locodol] Yatte Mita: Last one I wanted to ask about, seemed good up until that last sentence. What. 



>> ARTICLE
Been waiting for a Kagerou Project adaptation for ages, I'm so excited for this, and its also going to be from SHAFT so if I don't see atleast 3 head tilts in the 1st episode I'll be pretty upset.
>> ARTICLE
This was so helpful. Thank you! So many good shows are ending next week now I will be able to find some good replacements.
>> ARTICLE
Seikoku no Dragonar sounds like a copy of Zero no Tsukaima.
>> ARTICLE
For the first time there's not a damn thing that interests me in a season. Neat.
>> ARTICLE
I don't have time to look at all the genres and story lines of these shows, but does anyone have any idea which shows I like based on:
Favourite genres - Horror, psychological, thriller, mystery (still like everything though)
Shows: Railgun/Index, Shinsekai Yori, Higurashi

Just a general idea of shows I may like this season based on those things (if possible, if not just tell me what is hyped)
thanks.

>> ARTICLE
Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei definitely has similarities with Railgun and Index, especially Railgun.
>> ARTICLE
Just look through [this chart](http://anichart.net/spring) instead.  Easier to sift through, and includes genres and synopses.

Thanks for the chart friend.

**JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOJOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!**

Unbelievably excited for JoJo. I cannot wait. April 5th GET HYPED

**Mushishi: Zoku Shou**

Mushishi S2. Not much to say, other than it will be amazing. I think its adapting the rest of the manga, which is very exciting. I have no worries that it will be just as good as the first season.

**Mekaku City Actors**

No clue what this ones about, but it looks cool and its SHAFT so I'll give it a try. I had a couple friends tell me it'll be something to look out for, so why not?
>> ARTICLE
Alright, let's go down the list of shows that catch my eye/interest;

- **[Break Blade](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22433/Break_Blade_%28TV%29)**: Doing some digging reveals that this is a story about a person who, initially, can't pilot a mech while everybody else and their grandparents can. Alright, you've got a small amount of my interest *Break Blade*, let's see what you can do in your first few episodes.

- **[Captain Earth](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21677/)**: Man, I don't even remember what happened in *Star Driver*, but I'm super-pumped for the creator of that series coming back to do more mechs. *Star Driver* was an explosion of color and enthusiasm, something I hope to see continued in *Captain Earth*.

- **[Brynhildr in the Darkness](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21431/Gokukoku_no_Brynhildr)**: A nice premise, but I'm not expecting much. The director's only noteworthy credit is *Hitman Reborn* and Studio Arms is responsible for *Ikki Tousen*, a series I've heard nothing good about.

- **[Hitsugi no Chaika](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20853/Hitsugi_no_Chaika)**: Based solely on the show's description I *maybe* would have picked this up, but after looking around I found that the director of this series also directed *Scrapped Princess*. In comparison to *Ikki Tousen*, I've heard a fair few good things said *Scrapped Princess*. I guess I'll give this series a shot.

- **[Isshuukan Friends](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21327/Isshuukan_Friends.)**: Man, the premise of this series is downright *tragic*. And for some reason this show is listed as a comedy. I would prefer if this series didn't take that route.

- **[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure - Stardust Crusaders](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20899/JoJos_Bizarre_Adventure_Part_3:_Stardust_Crusaders)**: ...Dammit, I still need to watch *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* from last year.

- **[M3 - Sono Kuroki Hagane](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23133/)**: From the director of *Sailor Moon* and *Princess Tutu* comes...DARK AND ^(maybe) GRITTY MECHS!!! Other than that, I have literally nothing to say about this. It seems like there's literally no other information about the show other than the facts that it has to do with mechs and that Satelight is handling the production. What's up with that?!

- **[The Irregular at Magic High School](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20785/Mahouka_Koukou_no_Rettousei)**: Seems like this will be the "Big Hit" of the Spring 2014 season. The premise sounds interesting with the whole magic-is-like-technology thing and I've heard people say good things about the manga, so I don't see myself actively avoiding this series.

- **[Mekaku City Actors](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21603/Mekakucity_Actors)**: Having watched the entirety of *Bakemonogatari* and having found it to *not* be one of the best series ever, I find myself not caring about whatever projects Shaft is involved in. However, I will give this show a shot because the premise of the original music-video-series-thing actually seems to fit the style of Shaft's works better than...well, all of Shaft's other works.

- **[Mushishi Zoku Shou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21939/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou)**: ...Dammit, I still need to finish the original *Mushishi* series...

- **[No Game No Life](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life)**: Being a video game player, this immediately grabs my attention. Unfortunately, everything I've seen of this series has been alarming. The art style unnecessarily utilizes bloom lighting, the rather strange lack of other male characters doesn't sit right with me, and I've heard that the source material is not worth much time or thought.

- **[Ping Pong The Animation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22135/Ping_Pong_The_Animation)**: Considering the sheer talent that's behind this project, I wouldn't be surprised if it became the first "Critical Success" of 2014. I'm definitely planning to watch this. Also, I kind-of want to see this series get popular if only to see a parody of "Are You Ready For Some Football?" with ping pong.

- **[Nanana's Buried Treasure](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21561/Ryuugajou_Nanana_no_Maizoukin)**: I don't know why, but for some reason I *really* want to see this series. I mean, I know nothing about it other than the synopsis, but the promise of a group of friends/wacky characters going on small-time treasure hunting has grabbed my mind and won't let me go.

- **[Selector Infected WIXOSS](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22273/Selector_Infected_WIXOSS)**: The director of the *Steins;Gate* adaptation gives us girls in a dangerous game. Considering that I have yet to watch *Steins;Gate*, I honestly don't have any thoughts or opinions about this series other than the title seems somewhat stupid.

- **[Knights of Sidonia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19775/Sidonia_no_Kishi)**: I was expecting a show about an antihero cowboy in the futuristic mid-West, but this will have to do. If memory serves me, this show is going to be a majority CGI, so it'll be interesting to see how the production company handles that.

>...seems to fit the style of Shaft's works better than...well, all of Shaft's other works.

What's 'other works' i wonder ? You said that you don't care much about Shaft after Bakemonogatari, but you sounded like you know them well.
>> ARTICLE
I probably should have said "Shaft's more popular works". I've watched a bit of both *Madoka Magica* and *Nisekoi*  while having seen snippets of all of Shaft's other Monogatari series. In all of those shows the Shaft style of direction has, in my opinion, been ill-equipped in portraying the subject matter or overused for only the sake of style. And while I'm no Shaft expert, I will say that at the very least those directorial styles have heavily dissuaded me from continuing those series.
>> ARTICLE
It's a shame then, i recommend you to continue Madoka (assume that you have only watched 1 or 2 episodes), in term of direction, art, character, hell everything about that show is awesome imo. If you look around some Madoka thread, you'll see lots of people praising Madoka's direction and story with coherent reasons or discussing in-depth its story which always results in long posts, something you don't usually see with a typical anime.

As i said in my other posts, Shaft's direction differ with each anime, they do have some similarity but that's all. So even if you dislike Monogatari, you might enjoy Madoka, it was somehow the case for me at least, i don't like Monogatari *that* much (i still think the direction is suitable for it though) but Madoka is my most favorite anime ever.

Why are you listing bunch of sequels? This is not where newcomers should start.

Nisekoi: under drama and feels? I disagree, the first season 1 maybe. Food Wars is a battle shounen with food and echii, not a SoL.

Overall a shitty list. The category action is way to random and useless.

Everyone give [Knights of Sidonia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19775/Sidonia_no_Kishi) a try. 

I was hesitant at first because of the CG, but I decided to might as well give it the 3 episode rule. After 3 however, I couldn't stop and caught up to episode 7. 

I still find the animation to be pretty brutal, but it has it's moments in the action scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
Shocked not to see Sidonia in the top 5

Its easily the leading candidate for anime of the season
>> ARTICLE
> easily

I would not put it above Mushishi or Ping Pong, hell maybe in between if the plot continues to be so kick ass. Looks like a lot of other people seem to value NGNL/Isshukan  above it as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Listen to this guy, Knights of Sidonia is amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, show has a smaller viewer ship percentage compared to Week 3, but has had a nice increase in the favourites showing that those who kept up with it are enjoying it.

Not surprising to see NGNL's numbers mostly go up since everyone had episode 6 fresh in their minds. Nothing is really too different than the previous surveys overall, though.
>> ARTICLE
True no really big changes yet, that normally happens in Week 9. The 4 most noticeable changes are that Chiaka, Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou and Nanana are rising and Captain Earth is falling quite a bit.

Doesn't surprise me one bit that Captain Earth is falling, it's becoming a more and more generic mecha show.

Well ive watched it twice already (re watched it when the rebellion film came out) and it is still my equal favorite for that year of anime (tied with Steins Gate).
>> ARTICLE
You are not actually serious, are you?
>> ARTICLE
I am absolutely 1000% serious. I loved Madoka last year, but now that I've seen better and acknowledge its flaws(fast pacing, not character development), I can say WIXOSS does a much better job of fleshing out it's characters in the *1st episode* and doesn't rely on shock factor, it's honest about its intentions as well, not holding back for *the shocking dark twists oh my*.
>> ARTICLE
**WIXOSS Spoilers of course**

> I can say WIXOSS does a much better job of fleshing out it's characters in the 1st episode

I could and was about to write a 4000 character response with why I disagree with that, but it would only be bashing the show. I'll just go over the few points in a nutshell.

I disagree, I can't be asked to care for any characters in WIXOSS. I think they're stale and lack any form of depth and development past what is necessary for progressing the story.  
Everyone knew there had to be a catch to everything after we've seen Madoka so the 3 losses rule wasn't a surprise either.  
The only genuine surprise came at the end of episode 8, but even then I can only wonder why they didn't ask their LRIG's more questions. The characters lack reasoning and emotional depth in order to keep the plot from becoming stale and hard to progress without cheap ploys.

Madoka, in my opinion, did everything better. The build up was more solid, the main character reacted in a more reasonable way and the side characters weren't just there to distract you from how self-pitying the main character is, as is the case with WIXOSS.

If you like WIXOSS, all the better for you and by all means enjoy it. But I can't agree that WIXOSS trumps Madoka on any aspect. I'm not saying Madoka is without faults, it's just that WIXOSS shares the same mistakes as Madoka for some part (and are worse offenders than Madoka's) on top of other problems Madoka didn't have.
>> ARTICLE
It comes down to preference then.

> I think they're stale and lack any form of depth and development past what is necessary for progressing the story.

Yes, you're right, they are plot devices really and I actually like that, it keeps things *simple*, because otherwise the show would have too much a of burden to cram in development in its 12 episodes(why isn't there a 2nd season?!). I see them as archetypes of ideals, not as much as characters, which can also work. It's the themes and subject matter(no, not the card game, even if it's appealing to me) that carry it for me. So was completely wrong about the characters.

> The characters lack reasoning

When it comes to desire, I don't think your mind would be working properly at that age as well.

> side characters weren't just there to distract you from how self-pitying the main character is, as is the case with WIXOSS.

And that's actually something good IMO because that allows that 1 character to have *some* depth. Ruko self-pities herself for not having any dreams, yet she *wants*, she **needs** to fight. And its handled with *some* subtlety, just enough for even kids to grasp.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't a second season announced already?
>> ARTICLE
I think that the last episode (8) has really picked up the show. Before this I always felt it was a bit melodramatic.
>> ARTICLE
Do the characters ever become more than tropes? I watched the first 3 episodes but I thought the characters were insufferable. I can't handle that shit.

WIXOSS has been my surprise pick of the season. Did NOT expect it to be anywhere near as good as it has been, def worth picking up

Nanana's Buried Treasure was one that I only started watching last week and I definitely found it to be better than expected.

Aw jeez, shooting [one for five in my top five](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/05/14/spring-2014-first-half-in-review/
).

Check out Ping Pong and Mushishi, you guys! Ping Pong's actually far more of a character drama than a sports show, and it is a *really good* character drama. And if you like the creepy/beautiful nature parts of stuff like Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away, you will definitely like Mushishi.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, not a whole lot of people watch either of them, but they do stand high in the favourites.


I've seen some people on here hesitant to start Ping Pong due to it's peculiar art style, as for Mushi it suffers a bit for being a sequel.
>> ARTICLE
The most over-represented "liked shows", that is to say, the shows with the highest jump in position from how many watch them to how many voted them for top 5, after removing all shows watched by under 31 people (5% of the voters). 

Another way to say it would be **"Most underwatched shows"**:

| Title  | Difference  |Change from Week 3
|:-----|----|-------:|
|Mushishi Zoku Shou|	14|+2
|Ace of Diamond|	12| -2
|JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders|	12|+2
|Kenzen Robo Daimidaler|	10|+7
|Ping Pong The Animation|	7|+2
|Soul Eater Not!|	7|+6
|Yowamushi Pedal|	7|+5


Note Mushishi's +14, that means that its relative position on how many watch it should be 14 higher, to catch up with how much people appreciate it. tl;dr? Everyone should watch Mushishi. The +2 from week 3 means it's even less watched, or more appreciated, than it'd been back then.

This chart is dominated *very* heavily by continuations/returning shows. People who pick up a returning show or stuck with it for quite some time are more likely to be ones that like it, so here is the top 5 "underwatched shows" without accounting for returning/continuing shows:

| Title  | Difference  |Change from Week 3
|:-----|-----|------:|
|Kenzen Robo Daimidaler|	10|+7
|Ping Pong The Animation|	7|+2
|Sidonia no Kishi / Knights of Sidonia|	7|-1
|Soul Eater Not!|	7|+6
|Haikyuu!!|	5|+1

Sidonia getting -1 change from week 3 *could* mean it's less appreciated than it's been at week 3, but it's not, it's actually jumped 4 positions higher in how much it's watched, meaning it's closer to the aimed position, by a bit - that it's appreciated in a manner close to how much it's watched. Whereas Soul Eater Not is getting farther away from being as appreciated as it is watched.

---

And the most negatively represented shows (meaning "**most over-watched shows**", that many more people watch them than those who think they should be top 3 material):

| Title  | Difference  |Change from Week 3
|:-----|-----|------:|
|Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to|	-18|-10
|Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara / If Her Flag Breaks|	-17|-5
|Seikoku no Dragonar|	-12|+2
|Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san|	-11|New
|Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? / Is The Order A Rabbit?|	-6|-7
|M3 ~Sono Kuroki Tetsu~|	-6|+3


These shows are interesting. We don't have Pupa, but I guess M3 is the equivalent, of people wanting to see just how bad it is. The other shows, it's not that they're bad, but people watch them as filler, I guess, without thinking or desiring them to be anything special?

The drops from week 3 as well - people stuck with them, but are even less fond of them? Or that they are fonder of other things more, with other shows stepping up to the plate *more*.

---

Of course, since you have the percentages, it doesn't really matter, if all had been "equal", it wouldn't matter how many people watch each show, but those who find a show favourite would be equal across the board. In a perfect world each show would be watched by the same amount of people (the average), and if a show is the most watched show, then it should also rank at the highest of those who think it's "really good", or so the argument goes.

Sorry, a bit rambly, again.

* Average number of shows watched: 9.48 shows. Down from  10.6 shows per respondent at week 3. As weeks pass, people drop shows, unsurprisingly.

* Average number of shows voted for top 5: 4.2

To all of those who picked up **Haikyuu!!** and noticed that they might enjoy sport shows: **Yowamushi Pedal** has the same feeling to it. It's not purely action orientated and focusses on the characters just as much as the sport itself. Sure, there still is the occasional typical sport-moment in which they do 20min over a sprint of 400m, but it's filled with characters instead of endless shots of them creeping forward 1m at top speed.

I'm glad to see **Sidonia** rise. It's a natural reaction it looks to me, as it isn't a show that has an immediate pay off right off the bat. Its most distinguished feat is world building, and by God have they nailed that so far. Characters alternating action scenes in a splendid fashion give the show the development and pacing it needs to keep you interested. I'm not a fan of the art by a long shot, but it's far from unbearable and the story is more than worth the it. 

Not surprised to see **Ping Pong** go up. Everyone is praising it on both /r/anime and the same goes for some of the more popular bloggers. What does surprise me is **Black Bullet** going up, as it is turning a pandering loli-harem. I guess I should've expected it with how popular loli things are on the subreddit though.  
What I also noticed is that **Nisekoi** keeps getting more popular. Didn't everyone *already* jump on the SHAFT hype train?

Overall I'm happy. No Game No Life is still on top, something I'm okay with as I don't especially hate it, and Ping Pong, Isshuukan Friends, Sidonia and Haikyuu!! are still doing well. Add in Yowamushi Pedal and you have my top 5 of airing shows.

**Best animation of 2014 : Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works**

Nothing surprising really. ufotable just does a great job at animating action scenes. The choreography of the fights are amazing as well.

**Best anime of Winter 2014 : Nagi no Asukara**

Beautiful visuals, amazing soundtrack and strong cast of characters along with good world building and great character development.

**Best anime of Spring 2014 : Ping Pong The Animation**

Didn't really expect this to be amazing. The art feels odd until you get used to it and the premise wasn't exactly interesting either. However, the character development was just perfect. The soundtrack is great and the matches were hype as fuck. It concluded very nicely as well.

**Best anime of Summer 2014 : Barakamon**

Very relaxing anime. The OP and ED kicks ass. The kids were adorable and Handa's development was great to see. It was funny at times too.

**Best anime of Fall 2014 : Parasyte -the maxim- (EP 1-12)**

I loved how it explained things logically and didn't feel "forced". The way it showed how Parasytes were trying to learn from humans is great too. It displayed Shinichi's growth very well and the emotional scenes actually had an impact on me.

**Best Animation: Fate/Stay Night UBW** (I think this ones undisputable, Fate/SN introduced animation quality that we've never seen before, it was just breathtaking watching the actions scenes.)

**Best of Winter: Nisekoi** (I find Nisekoi to have top-notch comedy and very interesting characters and as such warrants a very high grade, I had a lot of fun with Nisekoi and it had brilliant use of separate art-styles.)

**Best of Spring: No Game No Life** (People may say what they want but it's as hyped as it is for a reason, NGNL had very interesting plot-twists and an element of cool that none other did during it's airtime, it had a fantastic colour palette and the story went in very unpredictable ways several times during it's air-time, shout out to Mushishi for being a close second.)

**Best of Summer: Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** (I believe that aside from Tokyo Ghoul all of these nominees were brilliant but amongst them Nozaki-kun stands out, it had a unique twist of the shoujo genre and great comedy, coming out as a show with no expectations it truly turned out wonderfully.)

**Best of Fall: Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** (Parasyte is my personal AOTY, it has a great main character and a very interesting plot, I do wanna mention that it's premature judgement as the series is still going though. Also twintails wtf?)

I fear that there's not much you can do there. [The Hunter x Hunter subreddit has a thread that asks everybody in there to vote for HxH](http://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/2vzpku/you_guys_did_it_once_now_to_push_hunter_x_hunter/), and now that they're aware of this poll going on, I'm pretty certain that the results wouldn't change even with a repoll. Which is sad, because it should be about the best anime, not the most popular one.
>> ARTICLE
Still the best anime.
>> ARTICLE
While I agree with you, that's still for the voters to decide, not a single person.

Yeah. I think I'll redo it once anyways though. Hopefully that one will be slightly more popular and everything else will at least have a fighting chance.

**Best animation of 2014**: Fate/Stay Night UBW Hands down, ufotable makes some beautiful scenes.

**Best of Winter 2014**: Space Dandy, honestly it came down to a comedy match between this and Kill la Kill. And Space Dandy had me laughing a lot more than Kill la Kill, though I may've enjoyed Kill la Kill more if the dub was out when I watched it. Everything else in that season I wasnt into.

**Best of Spring 2014**: Ping Pong the Animation, again I wasnt interested in any of the picks in that season except for mushishi and Ping Pong. I gave NGNL 3 episodes but honestly didnt like it too much.

**Best of Fall 2014**:This one was a tough one, I loved Parasyte, and I loved Fate/Stay Night. They both did what they did pretty well, but in the end I have to give it to Fate/Stay Night just based on enjoyment and I may be a little bias because i'm a type moon fan. 

**Best of 2014**: Ping Pong, I couldnt give it to anything else. The animation and art may not have been my favorite, but the characters were amazing and the story it was telling hooked me from the beginning when we see Kong. The soundtrack was also really great, and had no real issues from what I remember.

<puts NyaaFlame down for ME!ME!ME!>

Jokes aside, what do you think should've been on there instead?
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong, SAO II, Haikyuu, ME!^3, Madoka, and Nisekoi.

ME!^3 should win, hands down. I get it's a short but that animation is fucking god-tier, and we're not looking at how much money someone could throw into it or how much time it took, we're looking at animation quality.
>> ARTICLE
>I get it's a short but that animation is fucking god-tier

Absolutely. Got my vote at the very least.

(for some reason I thought Ping Pong *was* on there. :/)

Surprised by the SAO II and Nisekoi picks - not because I disagree but rather because I didn't expect them. Good choices.
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong, I fucking hate both the shows, but I'm not going to discount the fact that they're both very well animated.

Sidenote: Monster Musume anime adaptation when?

^^^not ^^^soon ^^^enough
>> ARTICLE
I remember a couple months back crabman made a tweet asking followers what character they liked best and what scene they would want to make sure didn't get cut from an anime, and then he fucking left us hanging.

[Here's an article on it.](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/09/15-1/monster-musume-polls-fans-about-anime-adaptation)

I hope them leaving us hanging doesn't mean that they decided against doing it. Miia best girl and she deserves to be animated. Hell, I'd be happy with just the first scene, with them in bed and her crushing him.
>> ARTICLE
>No Game No Plot

Uh, plot has literally NOTHING to do with animation. 

I am disappointed in the lack of Ping Pong in animation, but those three are actually my other top picks. The 4 you mentioned are my top 4.

Edit: before he had 'No Game No Neutral Colors' he had 'No Game No Plot.' 
>> ARTICLE
Ping pong's animation is awful, pleeeeaaase. #grrrr

In terms of animation, Rebellion or Unlimited Budget Works, no contest, with Zankyou trailing not too far behind. Both insanely high production values and it shows.
>> ARTICLE
In terms of animation ME!^3 wins, no contest. It has the advantage of being short, so it's got incredibly high quality animation to the point where none of the other shows in the competition could possibly hope to beat it.
>> ARTICLE
Me!Me!Me! has advantage of being a short, but Rebellion has advantage of being a very high budget film, the animation sequences especially between a certain fight beats that of ME!ME!ME! by a large margin.
>> ARTICLE
Rebellion might have sequence of high quality, but ME!^3 is 100% high quality. The entire thing is excellently animated and the margin even for that one sequence isn't that large.
>> ARTICLE
What i'm saying is, rebellion had consistently fantastic quality animation, like ME!ME!ME! however it had moments and scenes that clearly surpass that of ME!ME!ME! too.
>> ARTICLE
> no Ping Pong

Let's be real here. Animation isn't where Ping Pong shines. Art =/= animation.

I thought people hated the art for Ping Pong, but that the animation was great? 

I personally thought both were good,  so I don't care either way.

Can Ping Pong and Jojo's BOTH be AOTY? ^(I'd really like for that to happen..)
>> ARTICLE
I don't suppose anyone knows anything about the song used in the Captain Earth PV. The voice of the singer sounded really familiar, but I can't place her.

Edit: As an aside does anyone know what this season's Kana Hanazawa count is? I have only watched a few of these PVs but so far I've only seen her in Mekaku City Actors. She will almost definitely be in Break Blade as well since she was in the movies and they seem to be keeping the actors the same. So at least 2, probably a bunch more.
>> ARTICLE
According to her [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana_Hanazawa), looks like she's going to be in at least five - Bokura wa, Mekakucity, Gaworare, Nanana, and Mahouka.  Add to that Break Blade and the two-cour Nisekoi, and that's seven.  Eight if Adelie makes a comeback in Space Dandy.

And Seikoku no Dragonar (a.k.a. Dragonar Academy) as Jessica Valentine.

Space Dandy's not coming back till summer so lets call that 6-7 depending if leftovers count. There are still several shows that have not disclosed their cast at all, so the number may still rise.

Is it true the premise combines sci-fi with samurais? Oh did I get that wrong? 
>> ARTICLE
well in theory yes, it's sci-fi with samurais. but it's much more. It's the comedy that makes the show, so the setting doesn't matter all too much  (it's still very well used). So you see loads of aliens showing up in feudal japan with spaceships. Just see for yourself, it's tough to describe.

Do you mean like in the case of Gintama where only 28% of the users that have it on their list have completed while 51k (Also 28%) out of 178k people are planing to watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, seems like an interesting measure, Legend of the Galactic Heroes has more people who plan to watch it than who have actually completed it, for example.
>> ARTICLE
It should be possible but kinda hard to pull off since not only is the data on the website really off sometimes but you also can only sort by a single field. 

I've tried limiting the number of members that have the shows on their list as well as limit the complete and plan percentage so it kinda looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KW8wFUU.png) but then you've to deal with the wrong data like in Jinsei and M3's case.

Scraping the data from MAL directly might yield better results but I've no idea how to do that. You could try playing around with the settings [here](http://test.animeadvice.me/#state/plantocompleteratio) to give you a better list but it won't be really 100% accurate.

Yeah was suprise to I see alot of people talking smack about psycho pass season 2  and log horizon 2 right now how its bad compared to season 1  so was shocked to see them above UBW considering its popularity. My guess is people are confused on the order of the fate series so alot dont watch it yet

Hellsing: Ultimate in the put on hold top 10 when it only consists of 10 OVAs. No surprise, though. That series is insufferable.

It's melodramatic, poorly written at times, and crawls at a snails pace. The flashbacks that repeated the same thing over and over triggered my GGO PTSD. It's a good show, and I'm certainly enjoying it, but calling it a masterpiece just devalues the shows truly deserving of that title, IMO.

I had a similar thing done in excel while bored, just by rank, was thinking about making a self post but that would be redundant by now, I'll just post it here. What I found was the top 15 most karma for ep 1:

1. No Game No Life
2. Mekakucity Actors
3. Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei
4. Isshuukan Friends.
5. Black Bullet
6. JoJo
7. Hitsugi no Chaika
8. Captain Earth
9. Gokukoku no Brynhildr
10. Ping Pong The Animation
11. Akuma no Riddle
12. Mushishi Zoku Shou
13. Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin
14. Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou
15. Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to


And then the top 15 most karma for ep3:

1. No Game No Life (0)
2. Mekakucity Actors (0)
3. Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (0)
4. Black Bullet (+1)
5. Isshuukan Friends. (-1)
6. Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin (+7)
7. Hitsugi no Chaika (0)
8. Ping Pong The Animation (+2)
9. Gokukoku no Brynhildr (0)
10. Akuma no Riddle (+1)
11. Jojo (-5)
12. Captain Earth (-4)
13. Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou (+1)
14. Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to (+1)
15. Sidonia no Kishi (+3)

The only things notable bellow the top 15 is  Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii going up six ranks and Soul Eater Not! going down seven.

Also sorted by percentile of karma between ep 1 and ep 3:

1. No Game No Life (125%)
2. Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin (111%)
3. Black Bullet (99%)
4. Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii (96%)
5. Ping Pong The Animation (92%)
6. Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? (90%)
7. Hitsugi no Chaika (88%)
8. Gokukoku no Brynhildr (84%)
9. Baby Steps (84%)
10. Sidonia no Kishi (80%)

Note that I'm using the post karma and not upvote count so the numbers are a bit different. Well, anyway, back to studying for finals...

Mushishi is probably not there because it is really "hype." All the top shows have loads of action, comedy, or romance whereas mushishi is just incredibly atmospheric. I still find it to be one of the best if not the best show this season, but there is not much to talk about on the weekly discussions.
>> ARTICLE
Is Mekakucity Actors that popular? It hasn't been very impressive so far IMHO.
>> ARTICLE
Like someone else said, the other medium makes it popular. I watched the first 3 episodes and enjoyed it, so I dove into the manga and the songs. Holy shit, it is nuts, in the best way possible.
>> ARTICLE
Latest episode was really good. Finally got some backstory on what the fuck was going on.
>> ARTICLE
Next Episode is probably the best song, IMO. I'm excited 'cause I don't know if the episode is going to follow the manga or the song.
>> ARTICLE
SHAFT is popular
>> ARTICLE
While the show hasn't been amazing so far, the series already has a huge fanbase from the songs/manga/light novels. If you ask any of them they'll tell you, "Keep on watching, it's about to get AMAZING!" which is why so many people are sticking around. I happen to be one of those people. As long as Shaft doesn't do a head tilt so far back that they stick their head up their ass, it should be a great show. 
>> ARTICLE
I want to see Sidonia get more views.  It's the best action series this season, aside from maybe JoJo.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is that it doesn't have a simulcast.  It'd get more attention if it was on Crunchyroll.
>> ARTICLE
On top of that, it's released in the middle of the night for Americans.  I'm guessing it'll get some real hype in 3 months when Netflix releases it.
>> ARTICLE
I almost gave up on it right away because of how the CGI characters looked and moved, but stuck with it and I'm glad I did. It still bugs me a bit but the scenery and the action scenes still give it an eye-candy value. Plus a pretty decent, if confusing, story so far.

>> ARTICLE
The faces are definitely mediocre, but I think the battles more than make up for it.  They just wouldn't be the same in 2D.  The camera direction is simply spectacular.  [SnK Ep.4](/s "The way the Gauna dodged in the opening scenes... mindblowing.")
>> ARTICLE
I'd have either done it via excel, or broken down the comments and upvotes for each episode, so it won't go down to another line in this manner that distracts the eye. Edit: Cutting out the English names or Japanese might have given it enough room.

I don't track upvotes, but yeah, I have a file for tracking comments. Mushishi has a very high upvote>comment ratio, there's not a lot to say - or there's *too much* to say. I watch it and force myself not to take notes for it.

Episodes based on popular pre-existing material and/or where shipping is to be had tend to get more comments, which sadly also often comprise of numerous spoilers.

First episode is almost always the most popular (and the finale), I find tracking change from 2 to 3, or 3 to any episode onward to be more reflective of how a show is doing.
>> ARTICLE
The only shows that gained more upvotes were:  

* Black Bullet +1
* No Game No Life +155
* Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin +26

There aren't that many surprises in my opinion other than NGNL. Nearly all shows I like to watch stayed pretty consistent. A show that in my opinion more people should give a try is Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii. It's certainly not perfect but I enjoy the two main characters and the storyline so far a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Are you counting the total # of upvotes, or the karma? Doesn't Reddit automatically add a certain percentage of downvotes for every upvote?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I was using the values from the original post. It said 'Upvotes' rather than 'Karma' before.
>> ARTICLE
I personally think that the number of comments reflect more the popularity of the show than the number of upvotes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I think you're right. Even then the numbers are still close (relatively) to eachother though.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps the two metrics work together to form a whole picture.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually thinking this here. I don't think it's a positive sign when an anime has more comments than upvotes. Look at Blade & Soul. I'd say that's almost a certain sign that the anime is rather unpopular. Karma is fairly straight-forward, but comments can swing either way.

I think I'd judge it more along the metric of how much neutral discussion that an anime promotes and compare it with the karma it generates. Upvotes are inherently easier to do than actual discussions, so I'd say it's generally a bad sign if the comments outnumber the upvotes in terms of how well-liked the show is.

That said, /u/Red-San did say that the number of comments reflect the popularity of the show, rather than how well-liked it is. Mahouka generates so much discussion that even if it isn't particularly well-liked, it still is popular.
>> ARTICLE
> I'd say that's almost a certain sign that the anime is rather unpopular

Or that Reddit is not representative of a shows demographic. My daughter loves Fairy Tail as do a couple of her friends, but at 9 years old, they are not posting here!

Eheheh, yeah, I should've specified /r/anime. Whoops! Although, maybe I kind of didn't need to because we were using metrics specific to /r/anime in the first place, but whatever.
>> ARTICLE
Some shows are just easier to discuss, for example:

Mahouka is...controversial?  There's a lot going on and it produces split opinions and hypotheses which fuel massive discussion.  It's like discussions in literature courses where everyone gets together after each chapter.

Mushishi is episodic and simple.  You don't often see people discussing the intricacies of one bedtime story in a book of bedtime stories.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's dubious, anyone can comment as much as they want but there's only one upvote per person. Maybe the number of people commenting would be better? Arunno...
>> ARTICLE
I think counting these numbers after the third episode isn't really indicative of a shows popularity. A lot of people use the 3 episode rule and so I think counting the drop off from the first to the 4th episode would be a better indicator of a shows popularity. 

Also episodes where something big happens tend to get a lot more comments. An example would be Valvrave episode 10, which had nearly twice the comments as episode 9.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you, the 3 episode rule is way too popular for this to be accurate though NGNL being the most popular one is a fairly certain bet.

The hype train doesn't stop for No game no life. 

Nanana's buried treasure thread is getting  more comments because it's an interesting show with lots of twists. Black bullet and mekaku city actors are also getting good.

I don't mind the small threads with only 10-20 comments like dragonar academy or comic artist and assistants. It feels much more intimate and the high upvote ratio on the thread still indicates that people are paying attention.

The consistency for some of these shows is quite good. I feel like I am missing out on No Game No Life. My God, the interaction with that is very high in comparison to everything else.

Edit: Well, now I am wondering what is happening to The Irregular at Magic High School. It was the most hyped show coming in this season, yet it despite high comments, which doesn't say much since the same people just mass replying in the thread, I expected the attention for that to go up. The hype seems to have shifted more to No Game No Life.

I find it sort of generic. I am watching it, because I like some aspects of it, but there are still a lot of things I don't like about it. I like that it is a sort of "battle of the minds" type deal, but then it starts doing what shounen shows do, which makes it boring to me.

Kinda funny to see this with negative karma when [this subs current top post](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/24jp0t/mahouka_in_a_nutshell_according_to_2ch_reposted/) is mostly just people criticizing Mahouka. I mean, they do give reasons beyond just "shitty" but still, it's okay to have an opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Because calling it shitty just to state your opinion with nothing more is just as good as giving reasons leading to discussion. Sure, let's go with that one.

If I called him a fucking douche for saying it, I would get downvoted. Of course I would. But how is that any different from what he said about Mahouka? I'm entitled to an opinion, right? It's okay to have an opinion. No one is saying it isn't okay. It's about being smart enough to say it in a way that that doesn't get negative karma.
>> ARTICLE
We never ask people to for justifications when they have a positive opinions. Had he said "Mahouka is so great, glad to see it up there" that's fine but because he said something about as constructive but with a negative opinion he's "not contributing to discussion" and has to justify his opinions. It's like having a negative opinion gets interpreted as being rude and you need to be extra diplomatic about it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying we need justification for everything. I don't think positive opinions should get positive karma as well, because it's just a statement. I don't think negative comments should equal negative karma, but I'm saying that people should understand why he gets downvoted.

But come on. It *is* rude if you just call something other people might like shitty out of nowhere, just like it's rude when you call a person shitty with no real reason. If he said something good, it's not hurting anyone. There's nothing bad and we're all happy. But we're a society that gets hurt real easily. We curl up in a shell when we hear things we don't like, and we demand reason for it. So it's not "like." Having a negative opinion *does* get interpreted as rude.

If he wrote "Mahouka is so generic and gary stu that it's shitty," that might have been a bit better (although *that* would probably get negative karma as well). If people don't understand why these kinds of comments get downvoted...come on. That's all I'm saying.
>> ARTICLE
> If people don't understand why these kinds of comments get downvoted...come on

I get why they're downvoted, I just wish they weren't, it discourages people from talking because everyone who has been here long enough knows negative opinions tend to be received badly so they just don't comment.

I'm not sure if I would even call it rude, aren't we're here to talk about these shows? Is there something wrong with just being honest and blunt? Is it really hurtful or insulting that someone thinks an anime you liked is awful? Do we really have to bring our egos into this to that degree?

I know I'm kinda rambling here, I just feel the downvote mechanic has been abused on this sub against negative comments. I do think it's been getting better judging by the most recent discussion threads though.
>> ARTICLE
> I just feel the downvote mechanic has been abused on this sub against negative comments

It's abused pretty much everywhere on reddit.

As far as being honest and blunt goes, I think it's more accurate (or perhaps less charitable) to call those comments lazy and relatively low effort. I guess most people think that low effort comments deserve a low effort dissent in the form of a downvote. Is that the right way to use the voting system for comments? Probably not, and it's unfortunate that people who aren't familiar with it will probably be driven away from contributing because of it.

Date A Live needs more upvotes. Gj no game no life and black bullet btw.

Durarara has like 60 some odd episodes with Shou, Ten, and Ketsu.

Lots of shows do.  I crammed in as many episodes as I could to stay under 40, but still give the show an appropriate rating for the content.  Mushi-Shi's entry also doesn't have the full amount of stuff, but that's the point.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, it would be better if you filtered them out as well. Makes no sense for people who search for short shows to watch only half the series just because it is divided by more seasons.

Code Geass has 50 eps, Bakuman has 75eps, Major has like 129 episodes, Monogatari has ~83, Clannad has 47, Ghost in the Shell SAC is 52+2hr movie, JoJo is 79 episodes and counting (will be 115 by time Part 4 ends).

Hellsing Ultimate is more like 30 episodes with its 1 hour runtime, same with Katanagatari and 24 eps.

> Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, Gintama, HxH, FMA:BH, Monster, DBZ, Bakuman, Code Geass, Durarara are among my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Did you read the rules I used for the list?

Half the point of the list was to remove second seasons of things from the top, because they require the time investment.  If the first season still does well then it's in the list because it's standalone, which second seasons are not.  
>> ARTICLE
But then, why would you include second seasons for some shows but not others? At the point, the 40 episode thing becomes a very arbitrary guideline.
>> ARTICLE
You're not even following your own rules m8
>> ARTICLE
> Rule 1: No anime longer than 40 episodes. Period.

Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show. 
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show.

I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point.  If people want to continue after that, that's their decision, but all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.  But that's ok.  I'm going to remake the list taking into account all this stuff.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point. If people want to continue after that, that's their decision,

truly, if this is your interpretation of your rules then your list doesn't make any sense. Everybody can continue or stop after ~40 episodes of anything (first season or not), they don't need your misguided list for that.

>  all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.

> Code Geass, Attack on Titan, Chihayafuru on the list

ok, so what you do is claiming it's enough to call something a 'first season' to make it stand alone. Because these three very clearly don't have any resolution in the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Well is certainly my fault for not explaining the purpose well.  The overarching goal was to remove incredibly long running shows, but more importantly to remove sequel bias within the context of show length.  So all these shows that are not only long, but also contain a huge score jump in the second season tend to dominate the list quite a bit. A guy a while ago made a combined season list which averaged scores, and that was awesome, but didn't necessarily remove what I feel is the heavy score bias from familiarity that plagues the top 100.   But anyway, is a moot point now. Intentions are meaningless.

>Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, absolutely. Except for Hyouka, all of my top 5 shows have more than 50 episodes. I also freaking love JJBA, One Piece and a lot more.

I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

Longer shows have a better chance to properly explore the setting and the characters and you can get easier attached to them as well. I also prefer slower pacing way more than to fast pacing, but that's just me.

Anyways, thanks for the work.
>> ARTICLE
> I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

I was having a discussion with a buddy of mine about this.  We've both read the Wheel of Time series, which is good, but a massive time investment.  There are a lot of good, long running shows and if I'd started them at the time it would be fine, but trying to jump in now...not sure it's worth the time.
>> ARTICLE
When i was new to anime, i was actually sad that there were so few long shows. I was in Post Anime Depression after FMA:B was my first proper anime(that i knew was anime and intentionally sought out), worse was it after doing HxH up to the airing episode (119 iirc.) in a week. Felt like i'd never find anything like them again, and i really haven't had a lot anime past that point be either. So long ones are good, as long as you don't get stuck in Naruto/Bleach fillers. Skip those if they don't please you, that's what i do. 

HxH probably has the best pacing imo. (Chimera arc exempt, that one was a bit slower IIRC.) To me, the first 20 episodes felt like 50, and in a positive way. For some reason, the 2 minute episode situation that a lot of good shows have didn't happen in HxH, though i'm not sure why. It's wasn't a bad thing, i enjoyed those long good paced episodes because they felt so filled. 

As a side note, to me, HxH was great from the beginning, so i understand that for those that didn't like it as much at the beginning, might have felt different about this.

Cool list! I'll have to get around to watching Rakugo sometime...

On a side note though, Gundam 00 is standalone. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the other series.

Higurashi (when they cry) has a second season which pushes it to 50 episodes total. (+ several ovas, 6 of which counts as a third season)  
  
I guess you can see the first season only, but 90% of the plot of the first season is explained in the second season. It's a bit weird to only include the first season on the list, since the story doesn't make much sense without the second season to back it up. 

If I was to pick anime from a list like this, I would rather have all the shows included be 40 or less, including all relevant sequels. If I want a short anime, I don't want to discover later that there are actually two more seasons that weren't listed just to keep the episode count down. 

That's just my opinion though!

I am not an anti-circlejerker against YLiA or OPM (I hate Code Geass), in fact I enjoyed both for the most part. But putting them into top 5? Hah, nope. It is actually sad to see how Ping Pong and TTGL lower than them. And by god, Berserk and Tatami Galaxy are low.

I never realised how many long Anime there are in the top 100 before seeing that just removing the 40+ ones moves Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso from #14 to #2. That makes me happy.

So you don't like lolis, incest, big breasts, and fan service. You don't like "bland" art and you don't like art that's different. You don't like mecha, sports, comedy, and slice of life. Are you sure you like anime? These are anime standards.   
   
Is this your first time watching anime as it airs? Watching airing anime is a different experience than normal anime viewing. It's like drinking from a water hose. Tons of shows come out, and only one or two per season actually resonate with the viewer. Normally, when you watch anime, the shows are filtered by the test of time, and you only get the best of what's out there. There is going to be a lot of crap, every season is like this. The key is to  find those few that do hook you. You also have patience with mediocre shows in hope they will grow to something amazing.    
      
On another note, I think you are too influenced by hype and other people's opinions. From your MAL, it looks like the shows you rate high are /r/anime regulars, and nothing else. Most of these complaints are the standard elitist reasons for not liking any show. Also, you like Ping Pong even though sports is all it has going for it and you complained about the other sports shows for being sports. I'm guessing it's because the /r/anime regulars hyped it.

Just b/c you have something as a standard doesn't mean it's 'acceptable' or 'good'.

Sorry btw. I'm updating my fucking MAL page which I didn't update for almost a fucking year. Now you can look at my damn scores. 
>> ARTICLE
Standards meaning common traits. I'm not saying that those things make something good, just that they are normal. The overwhelming majority of anime panders to otaku with fan service and fetishes. Hell, look at the shows you listed, you can see that fan service is a common thing for anime.  
   
**I'll reiterate what I said before. It's like this is your first time watching a season of stuff as it airs. 90% of every season has crap. That's how it is, that's how it has always been. Of the 10% decent stuff, only a few a year are memorable. When you watch airing anime, you endure that crap in hope that one or two will be good. When you are watching non-airing anime, you are watching the best of best, the shows that survived time, you aren't flooded with stuff that doesn't interest you.**   
   
From your list, you should really watch Knights of Sidonia. Sure it's CG, but it's not horrible, and the manga is amazing. It fits right in line with the other stuff you enjoy.    
   
Sure not every show is for everyone. Sure you don't have to like everything. But people are pointing out the inconsistancies. It feels like you just took all of the elitist comments from threads and listed them.    
   
For Ping Pong, for instance, you said "VERDICT: Yes. Probably one of the better animes this season.", but criticize Baby Steps for being about sports. There is no reason I can see why this makes this show a better anime this season according to your standards. I imagine you bought into the hype that a few outspoken people jokingly hyped.   
   
For Mekaku City Actors, you say "i hope it doesn't become pretentious and boring like the sequels of bakemonogatari", but rated Bakemonogatari a 8, and Nisemonogatari a 9, Nisemonogatari being one of those "sequels of Bakemonogatari". Furthermore, Araragi is the biggest Loli lover of them all, and you still highly rated the Monogatari series.   
    
For Isshuukan Friends, you say "Slice of life bullshit anime about a girl with 'tsundere' elements and the slowest story with characters that aren't likable", but rated Toradora, Gosick, and Kore wa Zombie Desuka an 8, when all three have tsunderes, Loli tsunderes at that! The girl in Isshuukan is barely even tsundere anyway.    
   
For Captain Earth, you say "This anime could not have been more dull and cliche", yet you have 5 mecha rated 8 or higher. And there has only been two episodes, you say he has powers for no reason, could it be that they just haven't revealed it yet, like any other show with superpowers?    
    
For Kawaisou, you say "Another one of those crappy god damn slice of life romance moe moe bull shit." yet you have 15 slice of life romances rated 8 or higher.

You sir, make a very strong point. Hats off to you my friend.

I agree with OP. I've been watching currently airing anime every season since winter 2011 (and following along on /r/anime), and I'm thinking that this is quite possibly the worst season I've yet witnessed (taking season for this purpose to mean all shows airing during that 3 month period) yet. A large part of that could be there may have been a worse season at a time when I was very busy with school, but other than that, the previous 13 seasons look like they will have been that much more enjoyable for me. 

I've seen my share of what is considered "standard" fare in anime, and I've grown tired of much of that by now. So often, I get better results from watching things as they air. At least with some series, they may "stand the test of time", but I can not know for sure if *I* will like it until I try it. Additionally, what people say about one of those "best of what's out there" series may give me unpleasant thoughts of it and sour my experience of it or want to not watch it altogether. I'm glad that I watched Steins;Gate as I did, as I could at least appreciate it for what it was back then, whereas the community's transphobic joking ("DAGA OTOKO DA") would have gotten to me too much later, especially out of context.

Time to watch some old anime then.
>> ARTICLE
Why do you honestly watch anime if you're just going to shit over absolutely everything you watch?
>> ARTICLE
I fucking watch anime b/c I love to be entertained. But what's SHIT IS SHIT. As I repeatedly go over the fucking seasons, all I see is shit and  few rare gems. I can't fucking stress how bad anime this season is. I mean what the fuck? Almost all of it is shit. 
>> ARTICLE
I find it funny that you have written off Black Bullet and Date A Live 2 for being otaku bait loli fanservice, yet say No Game, No Life has promise.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah b/c it does fucking show promise. It's fucking interesting. Date A live 2, I KNOW IT'S GOING TO FUCKING SHIT CUS I WATCHED THE FUCKING FIRST SEASON JACKASS. Also black bullet. Oh my fucking god, it's the same shit as Mahoka. I can see shit everywhere. Didn't you fucking read everything i wrote on No Game No life? I fucking criticized it 
>oh wait but it has needless fanservice and a creepy sister brother relationship
Don't fucking put up words that makes me sound like a Jackass and makes people misunderstand this shit. Fuckers like you don't even read all my criticism and don't even give sound arguments? 

>> ARTICLE
I did read your criticism of No Game, No Life, but nowhere dd you say it was loli otaku dickbait, just like you think DAL and Black Bullet are. Also No Game, No Life is shit.

You are only making yourself look like a jackass in this thread with the way you're responding to everyone.

Swearing does not make you sound more mature, y'know

Sudden Death didn't even air.

> Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei - 1 word. INCEST! 

AHahahahahahahah

1. [LN spoil](/s "Not gonna happen")
1. you rated AKI-Sora 7 on MAL

actually so was HSDxD for all you complain about fan-service

you say you don't like sport anime but rate redline 10 and say that ping pong may be best anime this season

You spit on slice of life anime whenever you can but Clannad are noted between 7(film) and 10 (after story) kanon (2006) you rate 9 and Kino no Tabi 9 among other

and I am not talking about 
> Gokukoku no Brynhildr - Bad writing, bad art, bad everything. Manga was shit and anime is shit. VERDICT: NEVER WATCH THIS PIECE OF SHIT 
when you rated Elfen lied 8, and lest be honest you could make the very same comment on the first 2 ep of EL...

So question : Do you know what you like? Was it your little brother who made the rating? or THEN WHO WAS PHONE?

Then you listed 29 anime and said yes to 10 of them (with some reserve) which is a third of the season... not that bad after all? certainly not horrible.

I think all of that makes no sens and that you may be trolling consciously or not but I would advise you to read /u/some_baneling comment [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/231u7t/spring_season_anime_impressions_are_horrible_for/cgsn6wm) as he may have a better insight than me. I am very confuse by all of this not making any sens whatsoever.


>> ARTICLE
Now that I think about it. I didn't update my MAL fully yet. I mean holy fuckin' shit your opinions and tastes change over time. I noticed most of the scores I put up there in MAL were incorrect for me, I mean holy fuck, DID I FUCKING RATE Busou Renkin 7? HOLY SHIT, how i was fucking naive then. I am much more fucking critical on all of the fucking asspulls like fanservice, writing, etc. Also is that all you are going to fucking say? 
>> ARTICLE
I said your MAL and your post together did not make sense. you noticed, and I was actually talking in an other thread of how quick a rating I put on a show while watching or just after watching can seem off .

also you did not answer the other strange thing in your post which is that you say the season is horrible but a good third of the show you said you enjoy enough if not a lot. have you already change your mind there?

I indeed will not say more mainly because speaking to people who shout and swear is annoying. swearing every ten word does not further your point, it lessen it, and you with it.

Do you browse 4chan's /a/? This is almost exactly the hivemind's taste there.
>> ARTICLE
But /a/ loves No Game No Life.
>> ARTICLE
Now they do, but early on in the season there was a ton of shitflinging and shitposting in the NGNL threads. Same for everything else except for Ping Pong, the most circlejerked anime this season.
>> ARTICLE
Why is everyone flipping out. I like this guy. I was entertained and laughed quite a few times reading through his impressions, agreed with him a lot and disagreed with him a lot, so what? Keep em coming OP. Did you watch Nanana's Buried Treasure? It may have been my favorite ep.1. It did have a little bit of needless fan service but not unbearable. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah thanks for not being such a hard ass and yeah I did watch NANANANANANNANANANANNANANANANANANANANANNAANANNANA. I would say it left an average impression on me. Story seemed alright in a sense, but thinking about teenagers fucking around with treasure chests and shit made me kind of turned off.

>Sidonia no Kishi - Full of cgs and nothing else! Similar to aku no hana style in a way. First episode looks interesting and promising at the same time, but can lead to a road of dissapointment in the future. VERDICT: yes sure if you have the time for it.

>Sidonia no Kishi - Wacky and unbelievable characters and almost rape? IDK mixed opinions. Half of it makes it look like shit and half of it looks like false expectations VERDICT: No 

Do you mind linking a list of shows you've watched so far? (Like MAL, etc)
>> ARTICLE
hmmm will take some time, but i'll try to do it. Thanks for your suggestion! 
>> ARTICLE
He's trying to point out you accidentally used "Sidonia no Kishi" to describe the following show as well, which isn't Sidonia no Kishi.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i'll edit it right now. Didn't notice it. Here's my MAL page. Not everything I saw, but close to it. http://myanimelist.net/profile/proxyunited

I think we might have similar elitist tastes in anime :) Some of my favorite anime have been Usagi Drop, From the New World, Hourou Musuko, Maoy Ma Ysha, Birdy 02, Koi Kaze, Freedom, and Boku no Pico. I suppose I've become rather picky in that stuff that's particularly elitist often doesn't grab my attention so well, but I'm fine with incest and pedo stuff as long as it's done well.
