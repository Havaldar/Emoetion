The last scene with Ginko and the Mushi is just too good. Need to see more of him interacting with Mushi.
>> ARTICLE
Typical Ginko. I was expecting him to kill the mushi or mushi-banish it in some way, but instead he befriends it. A good example of his character, and how he views mushi and people and two entities living in the same world. 
>> ARTICLE
Why would you expect Ginko kill it? Throughout Mushishi S1 he's adamant in not kill the mushi unless required.
>> ARTICLE
You're right, I just think this mushi in particular is pretty dangerous. The girl almost dies here. But I guess it is out in the wilderness where it's mostly animals that it encounters, and that's just nature happening. I'm sure Ginko brings it someplace even more out of the way. 
>> ARTICLE
Hell even when "required" he didn't do it sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
What this girl really needed was some of that lake water because she was thirsty as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
Dealing with loneliness, huh? There's definitely something here everyone can relate to on some level. This was really good as a bit of an inspiring story about how not to forget how much we have going for us just by being alive when swamped with depression, and moving on towards the future. To just be alive as a person is truly wonderful.

It's also nice to see a somewhat comical moment in Mushishi, since I feel like we haven't gotten a good one in a while. The expressions Ginko had when Masumi said he wasn't bad looking were great.

Ginko's "huh?" expressions are always the best.

It's official I'm obsessed with this show. I have a question for manga readers. Does it look like they're going to cover everything in the manga this season? If not about how much do you estimate would be left?
>> ARTICLE
I'm trying to find the source, but I can't seem to find it at the moment. Will update when I do, but I believe this season (which is split into 2 cour, the second cour being the Fall) will cover the entire manga.

>> ARTICLE
I think so, if i remember correctly there are 10 volumes of the manga, each volume has 5 chapters which as an episode worth in the anime, the first seasons covered 5 volumes worth of material, they have 5 more to go which gives us a full 25 episode season 2 to completely finish off the material. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't season 2 meant to be 12 episodes that's what MAL says
>> ARTICLE
It's split into two cour. The second cour of this season runs in the Fall.
>> ARTICLE
Damn I didn't know that. I'm so excited now!
>> ARTICLE
It's hard to say, because they don't animate it in order which stories are presented in manga. It doesn't matter though, because stories aren't really connected (there are exactly two characters other than Ginko that appear in more than one episode, not counting TV special), and sometimes one episode spans through year in-universe, during which we can assume Ginko is doing other stuff than "exorcising" Mushi Of The Week.

I'd give manga a go anyway, even though I think anime is the superior version (that soundtrack...).
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to read it anyway I was just hoping to see all the content in video form first

You may want to start with manga. I think anime is the superior version, so save the best for last.

I've already seen everything that's out so far I even own the DVDs for season 1 and I never buy DVDs

I'm going to be self-obsessed for a moment and say that from last week or so up until the night before last, I spent my nights being angsty over death when, as young as I am, I have no place feeling that way. I got a pep talk two nights ago and it's left me feeling a lot better.

With that in mind, this episode was exactly the kind of reaffirmation I needed of the views that I was presented with. We're lucky to be alive, even moreso to lead normal lives that come with both happiness and sadness. There are people and beings in the world that're much worse off than ourselves, no matter how much we might not think that when we're down in the dumps. This was such a wonderful episode with the kind of simple but often-overlooked message that everyone should think about.

1. Yes, Mushishi cares less about its people, [but the backdrops are gorgeous](http://i.imgur.com/oDGlCF0.jpg).

1. The original ends up being replaced by the mirror-image, literally a changeling!

1. Mirror, and the mirror-lake. Her beau wanted her to be gentler, and the mushi makes her weaker. To combat him she'll have to polish her mirror, which is to accept her beau's departure.

1. Also, she contracted the mushi cause she went to the lake, unwilling to give up on her beau and polish her mirror.

1. [Having hope again, only to have it dashed](http://i.imgur.com/f5HBv2d.jpg). I wonder if we're going to get a "Non-happy ending" in this episode.

1. But there, on the verge of losing herself, she reached for the mirror, and crawled with all her strength towards the light. The urge to preserve herself had kicked in.

You say that (and yes, they are gorgeous) but I really think this new season is not at all deserving of that characterization. The first season, definitely, but I'd say that S2 has really been about people and personal journeys and development, compared to S1. I'd say that applies to all the S2 episodes, but episodes 2 and 3 especially spring to mind, and this one was hardly an exception. I've been pretty much blown away by how much more I like season 2 because of this, considering I adored season 1.
>> ARTICLE
I meant art-wise :3

Oooooohhhh. Actually I've been impressed by the visual distinction of the characters this season compared to S1 as well, but S1 only had like 6 different character designs so that's not really that impressive yeah

I almost marathoned the first season to do the same. So worth it for this amazing series.

You should just watch it. If you've already seen at least a few episodes of the first season, you know what's going on. The show is so episodic that you won't be missing anything by picking up the second season now. There's no sudden 10-episode story arch in season 1.

That recommendation is just for people that want to join in on the discussions of course. 

I'm looking at you /u/bobduh

>> ARTICLE
Ginko as a character has the capacity to be an amazing mc even if he is not the main focus of the episode, which is what the new season has been doing. I'm loving this. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope I came early enough to get an answer. I haven't watched the first season. I tried to, but I got bored with the first episode. It seemed like nothing was happening, and that nothing was going to happen. Like a slice of life show.

Is that true? Or does the first season get better? What is it **really** about anyway? The summaries don't tell me anything at all.

Do I even need to watch the first season to try to watch this one?
>> ARTICLE
The series is episodic which means you could jump into any episode any part into the series and understand everything that is going on.
>> ARTICLE
Even in the first episode there's stuff happening.
>> ARTICLE
> Do I even need to watch the first season to try to watch this one?

Nope. There's like one episode that go over Ginko's past and things like that, but all of that is insignificant in the grand scheme of things if you ask me. That episode does help explain why Ginko does what he does and acts how he acts, but the show doesn't necessarily feel lost without it. Don't get me wrong though, that particular episode was a really good episode and a nice, welcome addition to the series.

The series, both season 1 and season 2, is just a collection of short, isolated stories with virtually no common factor except for our main character who serves as the catalyst to move each story along. The only other recurring characters are one of Ginko's friends who collects mushi artifacts (and he's not even in the show that much) and arguably the woman who does the voiceover at the beginning of each episode. You do find out who she is in one episode though.

If you want some grand, over-arching story, this isn't the series. You could probably watch any episode in any order and everything  about the show would still make 100% complete sense to you.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, you answered my questions *very well*. This, being a collection of short & *isolated* stories, is certainly not the show for me. I gave the first episode of season one a go, but if I do try to watch the show again I'll bear in mind that I can jump in at any point.
>> ARTICLE
This is the only show that leaves me consistently unable to articulate how fantastic it is. I loved the atmosphere in this episode. It was pretty dark, but the ending can be considered either happy or sad depending on how you look at it.
>> ARTICLE
I did not expect Ginko to do that, once again a great episode.

Also apparently there's a *special* episode next week, looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
What do you mean by *special*?

EDIT: Oh, I just saw the end of the episode, I guess it announces it there.
>> ARTICLE
I guess its time for the mushishi hype train till next week.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Ginko surprised me with that reaction. Especially since all the books were also burned :\
>> ARTICLE
That kick was too lame to call it surprising.
>> ARTICLE
That too. I think they really botched that scene up. Could have been much more emotion packed.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair its arguably one of the few times hes had his life directly threatened, let alone the drugged girl. The only other episodes I can remember him taking such big decisions were again threatening ones, the island with the aging and reviving girl, and the plant/children hivemind one.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting linguistic note: the Japanese verb "moeru" has two different meanings. One, written as , means "to burn or catch fire," and the other, written as , means "to sprout, bud, or bloom." I don't think this dual meaning was actually incorporated into the script (The gardener uses the verb "moeutsuru" () which is only used to describe spreading fire), but I thought it was neat that one verb in Japanese can be used to describe both the tree burning and the tree blossoming.
>> ARTICLE
Ginko is a traveler, he loves the land, and that's how people behave, so it makes sense for him to observe the local famous spots, even if he doesn't think mushi will be involved.

The famous cherry tree that wasn't the king's new clothes! :o

"We are not doctors, but mere gardeners. We graft from a beautiful tree to a resilient one, to form a resilient one which blooms beautifully." And he asked the girl whose mother is ill if she is healthy. Does he also graft health between people? Hm.

The talk of the graft indeed. Saho draws sustenance from the tree, but the tree also seems to mirror her health, so perhaps when another eats the foam, Saho and the tree can then mirror *their* health, to get energy back Saho is the beautiful cherry tree, and this girl is the resilient one.

Ginko, taking a moral stand! Not only telling someone that what they are doing is wrong, but moving to stop them!

The travelers, is it that when you let nature run its course, it will find a way, and remain beautiful, or perhaps that the danger still lurks close by?

It surely felt like a *different* sort of Mushishi episode. Though it dealt with the same issues, and in a similar way, just having Ginko take such decisive action make it feel different.

>> ARTICLE
What a fantastic episode. It's interesting that we have our first villainous character that I can remember. Most of the cast of the show fell into a neutral-good demeanor but the gardener's actions were the first to border on evil. It's an interesting addition considering the antagonist are usually mushi, and not humans. 
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of how morally wrong what he and his family did I wouldn't call it evil since it's for the sake of protecting Saho. I would only really consider hurting people for the sake of hurting people to be evil. 
>> ARTICLE
What the hell is wrong with you.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Uhm... well... I see you hadn't considered having eternally young, beautiful, alive fuckdoll.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if you could consider Mushi evil, though. The way they're portrayed, they're more like parasites at worst - out for themselves and their own survival, and if people are harmed because of that, then it comes across as very incidental. I'd put that also as neutral rather than evil, if people *weren't* harmed then the Mushi would be dead. They don't have much other choices available, and in the vast majority of cases, don't even seem to be sentient enough / have the intellect to pick a different path.

Humans, on the other hand, are always shown to have more agency - I'm not sure if Mushi have enough of that to actually be evil. It's very much about intentions, I'd figure, like 'you didn't HAVE to hurt that person, you would have incurred no personal loss if you hadn't hurt that person, but you hurt them anyway for your own (not entirely necessary) self gain'. 

Based on how Mushi are portrayed, I don't think they're actually able to do that sort of thing. At least in the stories that Ginko finds himself in, it's always very - 'they can't help being that way'. Even with the hivemind plant, that was just how it propagated / grew. While it did act as a parasite off humans, what it was actually doing was no more inherently evil than a human couple also propagating and growing their own family - and at the end of the day, the stronger species wins. 

It's all fun to think about. 

**Edit:** Oh - also this dude isn't the first villainous character. Pretty sure the dad from the episode from S1 with the girl who aged and died every night and who was born again the next morning would count as evil too! Especially because (similarly to this one) he was kind of forcing stuff onto people. 
>> ARTICLE
I knew I was forgetting a human antagonist, thanks for pointing it out. Also I never meant to say that Mushi are evil, they are the perfect embodiment of neutral imo. They just exist how they are supposed to, and that can sometimes lead to problems for humans. 
>> ARTICLE
That was darker than I was expecting. I was expecting dark but not the level of decapitating innocents to swap heads levels of dark fuckery. 

And despite all that the episode was beautiful with the scenery and the music 
>> ARTICLE
I loved the little bit at the end that accentuated the beauty of cherry blossoms. Truly the trees in full bloom are a fantastic sight...
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this episode brings about an air of ignorance and the unknown. Even for Ginko who is a Mushi-shi that researches these unknown creatures  called Mushi, there are also the unknown actions that the more familiar humans can take. 

There are people out there that would make sacrifices and put burdens on themselves and others in order to preserve that which they are accustomed with as shown as the man's family killing people for generations to keep the woman alive. 

This is what I love about this anime. Ever since the first season, this anime has gotten me to think more about what I don't know as well as ponder on what I do know. It's a mind-blowing experience and I love it.

I agree with this wholeheartedly. And damn, already the midpoint? I'm sorta sad now. All the eps so far have been beautifully done though.

This was one of my favorites so far. Can't put my finger on why, just thought it was really interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn it, I want to watch it now but it's past 12am. Every single time I've tried to watch Mushishi when it's past midnight, I fall asleep halfway through. I'm familiar with the chapter from the manga, though. It should be interesting to watch - this is really an adaptation that adds a lot to the source material. Guess it's worth a try at least, though. Maybe this time I can stay awake!

Also, funnily enough, I was thinking about it the other day - Mushishi feels a lot like some kind of super tranquil mashup between The Twilight Zone and X-files for me. I was a huge fan of both of those when I was younger, so that's... not a bad thing at all, actually. The twists and plots are very Twilight Zone, the persistent protagonist who researches on ~~aliens~~ Mushi and the consistent world with its own set of rules is more X-files. 

I'm going to miss this when it's over. 

**Edit:** Managed to stay awake this time. The scene where it flowers before it dies was very nicely rendered. And as far as cherry blossoms go, one thing that struck out to me when I first saw them in real life is how transient they were. It was kind of startling - in anime they're all over the place to the point of appearing like some sort of weird permanent mental landscape fixture, then in real life they all bloom at once, then are gone in a couple of days and everything looks boring again. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow the discussions for this show are pretty low. I am oddly surprised by that.

This episode definitely feels more decisive than usual. Ginko was put in a situation that called for response and he did.

I am curious how the first generation knew if they put her head on another body it would let her live... 
>> ARTICLE
The scene with the flowers floating off her body reminded me of a similar scene at the end of Mawaru Penguindrum.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, for once I expected Ginko to bust some moves (manga be damned, I consider Mushishi anime to be a superior version), knock the nutter gardener down and escape with the unconscious girl.  
Instead I got the lamest kick in the history of animation.

Great episode, as always.
>> ARTICLE
The music in this anime is amazing manga only readers are missing out big time
>> ARTICLE
He was taking the smartest action, getting the girl and getting the fuck out. Attacking the gardener could have cost him his life and the life of that innocent girl.
>> ARTICLE
The *real* issue is why didn't the gardener attack Ginko? Animation budget ran out? I was hoping for gardener to jump at Ginko with an axe, Ginko flooring him/stunning him for a moment, grabbing unconscious girl and bailing out. But let's suppose kicking the fuck out of a lantern was a better choice.  
Why did the kick looked so slow, lame and impotent? Ginko might be a stoner, but lugging that huge, wooden backpack must have trained all of his muscles.
>> ARTICLE
It wasnt a trained soccer kick just "Ack look fire!" The gardener is crazy, his thought wasn't I have to kill that Mushishi instead all he could think about was getting his plant woman away from the fire.
>> ARTICLE
Well, this episode was certainly straightforward. While *Mushishi* is often a little ambiguous on its ideas, this episode presented itself as a fairly clear cut parable on acceptance and forgiveness. An issue with many parables is that their ideas and execution are often a little predictable, making them less interesting.

The episode did a good job of stepping around that- the red sea was a unique, unexpected parallel to the previous accident and really drove the point home. Although I'm a little less convinced regarding the pearl and I felt that episode was somewhat forgettable, at least the ideas came off clear. I'm satisfied.

The sequence with the birds at the end was terrific, so let's have a webm (warning- there's audio):

1. [**21:34.436 - 21:47.751** - Migratory Birds](http://a.pomf.se/wccpev.webm)
>> ARTICLE
I think you missed a large part of the episode then. The man on the cliff was advocating the ethical view that since society didn't save his wife, he has no cause to be a part of that society. As society is only good so long as each villiager is treated equally. Problem was, the elder saved his wife first. He immediately changed his life two following the womans death and started the fish farm, ensuring that in no way such an event will ever occur again. 

The episode itself in the "present tense" was expressed that they both agree on the same thing: Needless death(suffering) shouldn't happen if we come together. If we don't come together, then needless death will occur. So like the man on the cliff said, if such was the case we could only rely on ourselves. 

therefore, the elder crying at the end was not ONLY because of forgiveness, but also the realization that the man on the cliff never truly disagreed with the elder at all. The man on the cliff only wanted to guarantee that "his own" was protected. This gives great honor to the man on the cliff, and now the village is duty bound by his sacrifice to uphold the same principles that the elder was doing all those years. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to assume that you're responding to "I'm a little less convinced regarding the pearl". Here's how I saw the episode:

Sakichi chose to evacuate the village because, as you said, he felt that the only definitive person capable of protecting himself and those he cared about is himself, a product of guilt for not being present to save his wife. He showcases this by instructing Mina this exact lesson a couple times throughout the episode. The village elder, who also feels guilty for electing not to rescue Sakichi's wife, claims the opposite by warning Sakichi how dangerous his isolation can be, especially for Mina. Ginko further justifies that claim with his advice on dealing with the songbird mushishi.

With the coming of the red sea, Sakichi comes to an epiphany and asserts that "there was nothing that could have been done", accepting that, well, there was nothing that could have been done to save his wife (thus the aforementioned parallelism). In pretty much the next scene, he offers the pearl to help save the village in trade for his reentry to it, effectively forgiving the man riddled with guilt for not rescuing his wife. 

It was never a matter of honor, equality, or social policy- the episode ran on the same theme that runs through most of Mushishi: **the acceptance of fatalism and only doing what can be done**.

As for why I didn't like the pearl? It was written in to purely serve the role as a plot device for resolving a conflict. You could have swapped it out for buried underwater treasure or stashed valuable paintings and it would have had zero difference to the narrative. If that isn't a deus ex machina, I don't know what is.

I thought it was a rather memorable episode, if for no other reason than that scene.  It was really beautiful and one of those little things that make Mushishi so amazing.

Ginko has western clothes, not just that, out of time, to show how he is an outsider, how he doesn't belong. I always wondered at that, especially since the timeframe is all wrong for the way he's dressed as well.

Ginko, always curious what is going on in every place he visits, but will not pass judgment, will not tell a father how to raise his daughter. He's less of a people person, and more of a *communities'* person.

And that's today's message, delivered with a phenomenon looking the same - We are small, and nature is big and powerful. Things happen, and we must keep on living.

And of course, the message about joining power, protecting your own kind, versus only protecting yourself.

Not the best acting. Almost as if some of the actors here are just people pulled from the street. [This felt *so real* ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/pjRM8LQ.jpg)

[And here it is, little wonders.](http://i.imgur.com/XRGIEbZ.jpg)

It's Ginko (the first sentence). Unless you're referencing something else.

It is, fixed. I even got it right the next time I've used it.
>> ARTICLE
w.r.t. Ginko's clothes, while I do agree it's used to mark him as an outsider and an observer, there's more of a background to it than that, apparently:

>Mushishi-writer and -artist Urushibara actually planned to have the story take place in a contemporary setting. Ginko's rather modern clothes, which do not seem to match the time period reflected by all other characters, still reflect this.
>> ARTICLE
I always assumed he got got them at a larger city through a merchant with western clothes.
>> ARTICLE
Oddly enough Ginko's clothes never seemed out of place to me. Maybe it was because early on I assumed it was more of a contemporary setting. The first few episodes show isolated houses rather than whole villages and its hard to get a feel for the exact setting. By the time I got shown places that were obviously less developed than what Ginko's clothing would imply, I was already so used to his clothes that I never gave it a second thought.

Same boat as you, didn't realize at first it wasn't a contemporary setting.  Although I did think it was odd eventually, it never bothered me.  I guess for the same reasons tundra mentioned, he never fit in anyway.

On the acting:

I loved the 2 little girls voices,

and the moment you highlight there I thought was not that bad it is the cry of mixed relief and pride and shame from a hard man that has his village saved by the woman's husband whom he felt responsible for the death of. (is this making sens grammatically?)

I also think that all the acting is played very low key on purpose and it was also the case on the first season. this might very well be a conscious directing decision and I for one like it.
>> ARTICLE
> I loved the 2 little girls voices

Me too, but I have no idea why I thought they were so much better than voices from other series.
>> ARTICLE
That's because Mushishi casts real children instead of adults emulating a children's voice. The real thing sounds much more natural.

Man, this show just operates on a whole other level. That was great and the ending scene was pretty amazing stuff.

Fucking gorgeous

One of the thing that I find incredible about this series is that it can make me actually care about the characters and story line in only one episode. That's really tough to do in episodic anime, but this series does it every episode. Hell, some anime can't even do that in an entire series. It just shows you how brilliant the storytelling is in Mushishi. Also, LOVE that OP. It's so perfect for this series.
>> ARTICLE
>Also, LOVE that OP. It's so perfect for this series.

Yeah! It's quite distinctive, and she has a great voice.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the feelings of foreboding this show gives me are great. The messages this episode sent were all about protection. Everyone's doing their best to protect what they can - Sakichi and his daughter, the elder and the village, all of the Warbling Shells, and later, Sakichi and the village. It's these kinds of messages that make me love this show.

Guys, I don't know if everyone realizes how amazing this is, but holy shit.  Like, this is REAL.  This is HAPPENING.  It's like when fans of Star Wars waited years for new a new Star Wars movie.

It's so late at night that it's early the next day and I can't sleep because it rocks my mind that we're getting more of one of my top5 favorite shows of all time.

When I was watching the first episode and the OP song came on, I had that feeling wash over my entire body. Like, a "Life is so good right now" kind of feeling. I don't even remember feeling that way about anything else except for this show.

This has got to be one of my favourite if not my favourite (One-Eyed Fish in Season 1 was awesome) episode of Mushishi ever. The story was on par with a lot of the better ones, but it was the animation that really caught me. Of course animation quality will have gone up over a span of 8 or so years, but this was incredible. The sunset scenes were so nice, and I feel they animated the clouds of all things really well. Almost like Air (the anime/VN)

On a side note, I LOVE the new OP.

Communication, forgiveness, connecting with others and reaching out - man, this episode was legit like a fairy tale this time.

So to those who have seen the first season, would you consider it a prerequisite to watch the first season before watching this?
>> ARTICLE
Nope, but there is also no reason to not watch it.

I imagine that we will eventually run into the couple of re-occurring characters in the series. It would probably be in your benefit to knock out the first season and OVA before coming back to this season. Otherwise you wont really understand the relationship they have with the Ginko.

You don't HAVE to, but episode 12 of the first season is highly recommended for Ginko's story.
>> ARTICLE
Not a pre-requisite, really - the plot of either is episodic and there's no overarching plot which requires prior knowledge. I highly recommend it, though - at least watch episode 20 of the first season, so you know who Tanyuu is.

The first season also gives you a little backstory on Ginko, so while not necessary I'd highly recommend it.

i'm just really glad they still make things like this

Hmm, it seems the theme for the first few episodes are centered on human interaction, rather than Mushi's interactions with humans and how Ginko solves them.
>> ARTICLE
You're totally right, and I think this would not be a positive for the show IF they changed the formula too much. I like that even though Ginko has sort of taken a backseat role so far, he is still present and that he sets up the human interaction.

Good thing this season changed how characters looked, in the first season they all looked the same and had the same haircut.

Another week, another beautiful "story from grandpa". I would have liked a more concrete explanation as to why all the fish in like a 1 sq. Km area all suddenly bled out, but really that's my only complaint. The artwork was once again beautiful, especially when all of the mushi flew out of the shells at the end of the episode.
>> ARTICLE
The didn't bleed out. A [red tide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tide) is an algal bloom that can kill marine life when in high concentrations.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I didn't even think of that. I suppose I was trying to equate the fish dying with the shark attack, so I naturally assumed blood. Thanks for that.
>> ARTICLE
Parallel imagery. Sakichi comes to understand the futility of both events because they produced a similar picture.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. This was one of the interesting examples of a Mushishi episode wherein the main danger was something that actually exists in the real world. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved the happy ending. It was very satisfying to have them finally reunite and be on good terms again. From every tragedy there is something to be gained and that is certainly true in this case
>> ARTICLE
My God, the ending of the episode with all the Mushi flying away was just amazeballs and so majestic in such a subtle manner. I wonder why I'm so in awe about something as simple as that. Maybe because I was wondering throughout the episode why they were birds inside a seashell, but at the end, it just made *so much* sense on why they were birds. Mushishi is totally the shits.
>> ARTICLE
With each episode comes a new soundtrack for the ending. And I love it so much. How I've missed it, and how I can't wait for the next OST release.
>> ARTICLE
beautiful episode like usual. like the dvd says for the first season this anime really does show What a great anime can be.
>> ARTICLE
This isn't my favorite episode - I feel like Mushishi has already told several "death and resentment" stories, and better ones at that.  I prefer it when the show narrowly focuses on one or two episodic characters, so the slow, muted storytelling has time to really delve deep into their psyches.

But even when Mushishi isn't in top form, it still manages to tell a more nuanced tale with better character development in twenty minutes than many anime can manage in an entire season.  The episodic nature of the show with its Twilight Zone-y old wives tales give it freedom to tell a huge breadth of stories, none of which live long enough to unravel into a jumbled mess.

I was expecting something a little more peculiar and relevant than a pretty pearl to save the town, especially with the way they built up to it earlier on.  Perhaps it could have been his wife's ring or something.  But I guess what's important is that it indicated his forgiveness and willingness to reintegrate with the village.  I also wish they'd focused a little more on the girl who went mute, whose story seemed sidelined and concluded without much fuss. Loved the ending scene with all the flying mushi, that was beautiful.



If I may pose an open discussion question:

 - Would you want a more continuous storyline to develop in Mushishi - say, more exposition on Ginko's background, or the return of characters from previous episodes?

I ask because I was just thinking about how much I loved that the OVA brought back [Tanyuu](http://myanimelist.net/character/13714/Tanyuu_Karibusa) (the mushi scholar) and the short scene depicting all the characters from season one.  Secretly I want Tanyuu back as a love interest, but that could easily hamper the integrity of the story.  Thoughts?
>> ARTICLE
Tanyuu is my favorite character (aside from Ginko of course) so I would love to see more of her, and the OVA hinted that we would. I personally think it would feel odd for this show to suddenly develop a continuous storyline despite my normal dislike for episodic shows. However I would definitely enjoy more and more relations to previous events building up to some kind of multi-episode finale.
>> ARTICLE
Edit: true I answered the wrong person... I'll put this to the correct place and take off what was here.

also I would just like you like to see some more of the back story but it is still possible, it did not come right away in S1 either
>> ARTICLE
I think you meant to reply to tundra, not me. :P

I like the subtle voice acting, especially for the children (which are usually voiced by actual child VAs - ex. [1](http://myanimelist.net/character/16810/Miharu) [2](http://myanimelist.net/character/16881/Ito) [3](http://myanimelist.net/character/16882/Aya) [4](http://myanimelist.net/character/16887/Toyo)).  Sounds much more natural than having an adult woman attempt a cutesy child's voice.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, I actually kind of like this change of pace. Despite beginning as a "death and resentment" story, the show ended on a much, much more positive note. Perhaps it's just because I'm biased towards it's message - forgiveness and reconciliation, communication, and that people need to come together as a community and share resources if they want any chance of "fighting" nature. Many episodes of *Mushishi* sort of end on a "well, that's just life" note, that nature is nature and you can't fight it, only hope it doesn't get worse - the humans usually come out a little worse for the wear. This episode told me "well, nature *may be* nature, but that doesn't mean you don't fight back - but it only works if you work together" and there was a lot of positive change compared to the beginning of the episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's fair, I like both aspects of Mushishi.  It might just be because I recently marathoned the first season, so some of the similar episodes are getting bunched up in my head.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, same, and I know what you're talking about. We haven't had a psychologically-focused episode like that in the new season, but I'm sure it'll pop up soon enough

As for your discussion question, yeah, I'd like to see that. I've thought about it before, and I think having Tanyuu be "cured" for the finale might be an interesting idea. Perhaps have the final few episodes be one arc? Problem is, as much as my inner shipper might *love* to see Tanyuu travel with Ginko (huehue), having Tanyuu complete the sealing of the forbidden mushi would be awfully convenient. Still, the only one I could see being a recurring character with any significance is her - Adashino isn't that compelling of a character.



>> ARTICLE
I hope and suspect they'll bring her back for at least a little bit, but I can't help but think that making her a full-blown love interest would feel like cheap fanservice - not in a pantyshot/boobgrab kind of way of course (save that for the cash-in spinoff *ChibiMushi: Rabu-Rabu*), but in terms of giving the audience exactly what they want.  I'm sure they'd be able to pull it off tastefully though.

Here's what I got out of the story (it's long, sorry!): 

_____

Ibuki's mom died at one point, and his father remarried into a women with children. He began to feel neglected and distant in his household, and began to yearn for his new mother's acceptance and love that she gives to her other children. He became a sailor in order to make her happy and accept him. The gift was a mark of his new job, since he bought it with his own money. Probably to give to his step-mom. When he returned home, notice how she treated him like a stranger. The conversation about him crashing seemed impersonal, almost like they were only neighbors. Even if she's suppose to be his mother, she doesn't treat him like her son.

When Ibuki showed her his shell or whatever thas was, she passed it off as an expensive thing to be sold, and told Ibuki to get rid of it in order to feed her children. She didn't care if he was a sailor, only if he brought money.

Then, when he tells her about the ship crashing, she only cares about the pay. She sees the thing he bought and tells him to sell it, asking why he even had it. The only thing she worries about is her other children, Ibuki doesn't even get the chance to tell her about his new job.

Ibuki becomes resentful. When he was excited about going home and talking to her, he was punished for it. He doesn't think that it's his fault. The conversation Ginko has with him is about how he shouldn't turn his hate into something that will eventually destroy him - that it's not worth it. If something doesn't make him happy, he shouldn't dwell on it. He's old enough to escape a situation like that. That's why he leaves at the end. The stone can be used for both destruction and creation, just like himself. Of course, a lot of this is speculation, but I think it makes sense.

TL;DR: Ibuki wants to be accepted, he's not. He becomes resentful, but then lets his hate go and leaves home.

_____
 
Correct me if there's something I missed or if you think I got something wrong. Either way, fuck yeah! I really liked this episode. Subtle and a bit disjointed, but still really nice. Adashino was a great touch, and the mushi were interesting. I love that kind of light/dark imagery. Flying and slithering creatures make everything better.
>> ARTICLE
I think the last part isn't correct.  [Spoilers](/s "He actively tried to kill his family in the end but only destroyed their house and this maybe the last string in an already failing household.  I don't think he let go of his hate, I think it is just brooding inside him after he ran away.  If he let go of his hate then there was no reason to leave or destroy the house.")
>> ARTICLE
I generally agree but I don't think he was trying [](/s "to kill them") thats seems like a exaggeration it was just a very strong wind.


>> ARTICLE
But he controls how strong the wind blows, he used the max strength whistle.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was more symbolic than literal. Ginko already had the chat with him after all. 

Maybe the wind symbolized a sort-of 'wind of change.' Even though his dad is an asshole, he still goes through with saving his step-mom,. because he knows that his 'needs and wants' will never be met any other way. He also likely sent home pay to pay for the house. I bet he upped the wind level cause of his dad's 'ingrate' comment, though.
>> ARTICLE
**Things in the episode that I liked:**

* Ginko's face when he realized that his best friend is a black market dealer.

* The ability to control the wind and also make holes all over the place. What shall we name this ability? 

* I bet those mushi birds were pretty happy eating those mushi eels.

*Other stuff:*

* what kind of broken home did that sailor come from?

* how expensive was that damn flower?

* Can people be taught that whistling, because if someone just catches on, then thats a whole new bag of worms.
>> ARTICLE

>     Ginko's face when he realized that his best friend is a black market dealer.

When does that happen exactly? Didn't get the vibe that he is selling it on a black market.
>> ARTICLE
"Black market dealer" was more of joke if anything since he is very sneaky and mischievous.

...Well in the first season he was explained to be a collector of mushi artifacts and he would sometimes trade things with Ginko. So I don't think he is particularly selling the items as he is trading them with other people. And Ginko has items(like the whistle) that can be misuse. Maybe he is more of a customer then a dealer Per Se.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I though I missed a reference to that :)

He seems more like a mushishi pawnshop kind of guy. Buying things cheap and selling them at a slight premium to other mushishis.
>> ARTICLE
I think he is more of a collector. I think this was mentioned previously in the last season.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I got the impression he said he was a "collector" aka. reseller.
>> ARTICLE
He probably does sell of some things to keep himself afloat. But keep the more fascinating things for himself.
>> ARTICLE
Seems like a lot of people didn't like this episode, but I really enjoyed it. 
>> ARTICLE
I am with you on this, I like that most of the episodes leave some questions unanswered, letting us wonder what really happened, like the family issues here. I especially liked the whole idea of mushi's being like the wind 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I thought it was a really good one. I think a lot of people just didn't like it because they thought the sailor needed more backstory to explain his motivations, but I felt everything was pretty strongly implied.

Honestly I think this was among the better episodes, but different people have different priorities.
>> ARTICLE
Her mom's character was basically summed up in just 1 dialogue. When he comes home, she says "Oh, you are alive"

Couldn't be more obvious than that.
>> ARTICLE
So weird that people are not liking this episode. I thought it was one of the best. 

The entire torikaze / mushi eels (don't remember their names) was a great juxtaposition. Loved how the eels loved the sound of whistling because it reminds them of the wind in their holes, when the torikaze themselves (that eat them, thus the mushi eels ignoring the whistle in the day) are basically a mushi version of the wind. It's nothing really insightful, but it just feels incredibly well thought out and well-crafted.

Come to think of it, *Mushishi* is almost starting to feel like modern day myths in the way it describes the mushi counterparts of natural phenomena. I wish I could elaborate more on the show, but I guess part of its charm is the simplicity of its ideas at their core
>> ARTICLE
>  counterparts of natural phenomena

After watching the episode last night I was able to take some pictures of [Yobiko holes](http://m.imgur.com/a/kzLmo) in my backyard this morning.

Welcome back Mushishi, you were missed.

I liked how the common superstition that whistling at sea will bring forth a wind was explained with Mushi :)

Does anyone know why the show is absent every other week?

The first time it was absent was because of the special episode that came the week after. The week after the special episode there was no new episode because they re-aired the special episode. From now on it should be back every week again.

That's good to hear. Why would they re-air the special though?

In any case, you asked relevant question, showing an attempt to pick up the pieces to the puzzle, and therefore should not be downvoted in my opinion, keep the discussion alive ^^
>> ARTICLE
He was just a kid who was all depressed about what he had done. That is why Ginko gave him that coming of age speech. 

From what I could tell the kid thought since he screwed up he might as well go all the way cause he is just a stupid failure anyway. You know, teenager crap. 
>> ARTICLE
You shouldn't be downvoted for your opinion.

I think people covered it more or less. You could tell he wanted the approval of his stepmother and she didn't give it to him. She was actually rather curt to him. Furthermore, given his father's reaction to his whistling in the morning, his father also wasn't very fatherly or warm---this could be attributed to feeling like his son from another marriage is almost a burden to his new life. (This might be a bit of a stretch since it's intentionally  ambiguous.)

In any case, the idea of the episode is that he realized his home wasn't really his home anymore. He probably thought if he let his stepmother die by calling the eel mushi, he might get his old life back. When Ginko convinced him otherwise (interestingly, appealing not to the guy's humanity or compassion  but rather his understanding of the mushi), he let the family be happy without him and set sail by himself.
>> ARTICLE
He probably grew up in a broken home, without his real mother. Perhaps his stepmother treated him poorly, we can definitely suspect that they have some tension between them, sadly it wasn't really elaborated much upon in this episode. His father also wanted him to stop whistling because his stepmother was sick, which could be seen as his father prioritizing her needs over his. I am pulling at straws here, since the episode didn't choose to focus on this ^^ But I hope my viewpoint helps you.
>> ARTICLE
A pretty underwhelming episode for Mushishi standards, however still very enjoyable. Interesting that this episode shares some of the theme with the previous one to some extent, both having people dealing with having powers. I wish they gave the sailor boy more backstory or something, without it he just came off like a selfish asshole. The Torikaze scene at the end was pretty nice. [Here's a .web of it.

And the award for the most badass mountain lord goes to the turtle.

Man, I am amazed at how easily mushishi surprises us every week.

It's been so long since I seen season 1 (which is when I assume this was brought up) can you please remind me wtf a mounain lord is? Did it have something to do with that episode Ginko meets the old mushishi on the mountain who can't leave or something? I really need to rewatch season 1 some time.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, the Giant snake on the episode you mentioned became the mountain lord.

Even I don't remember much of the details, but they are basically kings of the mountains and maintain/balance the energy level and flow of kouki.

That episode was really enjoyable. The mountain lord just looks so smug at the end knowing he conned Ginko out of his Kouki. I can't wait for the next season

They're going to continue it in the fall of this year. Here's the [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24701/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou_2nd_Season) . They're also doing some special episodes which are gonna air in November this year, [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24687/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou_Specials)
>> ARTICLE
Possibly one of my most-loved episodes yet (and that's really saying something, considering we're talking about Mushishi here). Somehow I just really rather appreciated the tranquil peacefulness this particular story expressed. And seeing the pure vulnerability of Ginko in such a solitary location was really rather lovely too.

I swear Mushishi has become a legitimate form of meditation for me
>> ARTICLE
Only Mushishi can pull off such an amazing, yet quiet episode like this and make it look easy. I'm gonna miss this show next season, but at least we have another confirmed season to look forward to.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed! Very low-key yet very satisfying. Beautiful as well.
>> ARTICLE
I thought this might be Mushishi's version of a nature documentary but instead it's just Ginko getting swindled lol. I loved the folklore vibe of the whole episode.

Also Ginko walking around in circles reminded of episode 14, when he got lost in the bamboo forest. That episode was really sad.
>> ARTICLE
I was kind of hoping that when he got out of the pond, he'd end up discovering that he had slept for hundreds of years to end up in modern day Japan.

Last 2 episodes of this season will come out on BD only. (Which will undoubtedly get fansubbed) Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd season is set to air this fall.
>> ARTICLE
thats good news =) thx
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic end to a fantastic season. The whole feel of this show is in a tier of its own, for me at least. The peaceful tranquility of the setting combined with the thoughtful methods of dealing with mushi that Ginko uses just puts me in a great mood whenever Im watching.

Honestly, watching Mushishi is like the visual form of listening to Arve Henriksen. Just pure bliss.
>> ARTICLE
I misheard some news and thought that this was the last episode, so I legitimately thought Ginko was going to die due to that one line that seemed a bit too much like foreshadowing: "Weaker animals might not survive. It's a gamble." I barely restrained from freaking the fuck out when he went under. 

Either way, what an atmospheric episode that was. Really quiet and desolate. Probably my favorite episode of both seasons. Watching Ginko wander around and not know what to do was really refreshing after seeing him have the solution to every other problem. Really pretty scenery (especially that snow mmm) and nice expressions and motions from our favorite mushishi. The wait for the second half will be agony.

I really enjoyed this Ginko centric episode, the ambiance in this episode was absolutely captivating.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoy episodes with Ginko alone more than when it's focussed on other people.

I thought this episode was great and I can't wait for the specials and the next season.
>> ARTICLE
Best episode of the season for sure.

Although the others were good, this felt more like the first season. I enjoy the time with Ginko more than the interactions of mushi with regular people.

The scenery was particularly well done.
>> ARTICLE
Incredible episode, and also the first (I believe) where the only person in the episode is Ginko himself. It dramatically changed the focus of the show from how mushi affect people to how mushi affects nature itself. Easily one of my favorite episodes this season. 
>> ARTICLE
FUCKING THIEVING TURTLE

On another note, why do the mushi seem attracted to Ginko so much, that he has to smoke weed every day? Other mushishi doesn't seem to suffer the same fate. Is it because he smells/feels like kouki, from the incident in his childhood where he got infected with Tokoyami?
>> ARTICLE
Dunno about the smell/feel but it's definitely because of that incident.
>> ARTICLE
That's just my theory, but mushi are extremely simple organisms. They feed on different things, but what lures them pretty much all the time is kouki in fluid form, so in my opinion the only explanation why Ginko attracts various mushi is because of that. It's not as strong as raw kouki, because it would royally screw his job, but it's strong enough to make mushi gather around him.  
Fuck, why didn't Urushibara write more backstory for Ginko? He's a brilliant character! I'll just post [my favourite scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7saaCvHX6Y#t=983). The "Come out, mushi" gives me shivers.

>> ARTICLE
Agreed, it was a beautiful episode, it's nice to see a happy ending in Mushishi every now and then.
>> ARTICLE
So am i right in thinking that the ending implied that he used the mushi purge, or did i misinterpret.

>> ARTICLE
Nah, man. He decided to use that which took life (the mushi) to grow life (his family).
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he used it, rather it shows he's willing to take breaks and eats food now to control the mushi.
>> ARTICLE
It's left a little ambiguous, but I think he took the medicine a few years later.

The snow comes back to the mountain and the fields are mostly bare. Instead of the lush grains the mushi provided, they are scraping by with a few hardy radishes. What's more, you're given the impression that this is a full-family job instead of a 1-man operation before. The comment about being hungry is another clue that he is feeling the normal side effects of hard work.

I think the happy ending was intended to send a message that it wasn't the mushi that made them a happy family, it was each other. Even with it gone, even with the harsh conditions around them, they still laugh and have fun.
>> ARTICLE
> they are scraping by with a few hardy radishes

I don't think they were "scraping by". It looked to me they were just normally harvesting winter or Rabi crops.
>> ARTICLE
You've the hit all the points that make me think that he did take the medicine in the end, also i thought a happy ending would make more sense if he took the medicine since the mushi would have him die from exhaustion and then later target a new victim, the episode hinted that this is not that far way for him, since he collapsed from exhaustion earlier in the episode.
>> ARTICLE
You can't go wrong with an episode of Mushishi every Friday. Once again this week's episode was amazingly beautiful and relaxing, even more because it had a happy ending. Also the ending song was one of the best so far IMHO.

A lot of wintery episodes this season/half of the manga. Maybe that's why the opening is called shiver.

ITTTTS BACK!!!!

I really enjoyed finally getting some more backstory on Ginko this episode. Seeing him not as the rational mushishi we know and love but rather as the young, uncertain, and anxious boy really gave him some long needed character development. 

Cant wait for next weeks episode "The Fragrant Darkness"

>> ARTICLE
It's nice to witness another turning point of Ginko's past, since we haven't seen any of it since episode 12 of the 1st season. You can really see that even though this event had a rather melancholy conclusion, young Ginko took a lot from it. He definitely doesn't have that same wonder and fascination in the mushi that we are so accustomed to, but you can see that his position begins to change by the ending from the initial resent he felt for them.

Despite doing something terrible to the natural order, the mushi still beckon him back, essentially validating his existence and telling him that he *does* have a place in the world. This is something that young Ginko has probably never experience from people before (we hear in the beginning how wherever he goes, he is always followed by rumors of a strange boy that brings disaster with him). Although he's hesitant, you can see how the mushi have given him a sense of belonging and purpose, and rather than seeing them as a burden, he is beginning to become curious.

The final scene where he lightly touches the mushi residing in his eye and falls asleep was a perfect way to sum up all that took place.
>> ARTICLE
and i felt that ginko had a distrust in people at the start because he said that the previous mushishi he had been with took advantage of him to make money then tossed him away when things got hairy.. it was suguro who had no other intention for him other than wishing him well.. the things suguro said to ginko was pretty touching imo.. shed a manly  old tear.. probably cuz i missed the show too much though.. only anime i watch

It was a great way to return to the show. I felt like the themes were very representative of the entire series: there are mistakes that can never be undone, but no existence is a mistake in and of itself.

Mushishi is back, and all is right with the world.

It's back! Seems like it's been awhile since the first part of this season aired. Really glad there was character development for Ginko, there has been so little in this series. 

I guess the theme to take away from this episode is that everyone has a purpose in this world. They just need to find it. 
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the fact that we finally got some more background on Ginko. I think it's a nice followup to the special. Ginko ended up accepting mushi for what they are from his his experiences, and Kumado had the opposite, both flipping their opinions (resentment to attachment for Ginko, indifference to resentment for Kumado) of mushi from the effects of one event. In both cases, the actions of other people had caused their resentment. 

Ginko really pulled on my heartstrings this episode. That part where he started crying and every time he said something self-depricating killed me a little bit inside. The ending was cathartic.

[Anyway, here's some screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/5gkpP) I'm extremely happy Mushishi is back. I'm curious about what the final episode will be. I can't really imagine an 'ending point', but the manga already had one.

this one though requires a little bit a back story though.. like the permadark mushi, the reasons for his white hair and some info about mountain lord in the mushishi universe.. this one is not a straight on hop in episode..

suggest to watch mushishi season 1 "the sleeping mountain", "one eyed fish" and the zoku shou's "banquet of the forest" so you know what mountain lord and the light vein are.
>> ARTICLE
Should be no problem at all.
>> ARTICLE
I have only watched the first season of the 2006 Mushishi and it didn't follow a specific storyline except the ones that explained Ginko's story, can I watch this?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but you should watch the first half of zoku shou before you start the second half.
>> ARTICLE
Generally you can watch Mushishi in whatever order you like, it's very episodic.
>> ARTICLE
does this really count as S2 if this is just the unaired episode 11/12?
>> ARTICLE
No, this is season 2 of Zoku Shou. The unaired episodes, 11 and 12, were released as a  47 minute long special, and can be found here: http://myanimelist.net/anime/24687/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou_Special
>> ARTICLE
Episodes 11 and 12 from the first part of the S2 were aired in August. It was a special episode : http://myanimelist.net/anime/24687/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou_Special  
What we got now is the second part of the S2. I hope it's clear for you.
>> ARTICLE
thanks for your reply! yeah, that's what I thought at first but then the OP has

>Also knows as: Episode 11

so i got confused...
>> ARTICLE
While I was watching, I noticed the episode from the first season, "'Here Comes The Rain, Here Comes The Rainbow" parallels this one at some points. Probably because both mushi are nagaremono, but there's also the rain motif. Coincidently, they both share episode 7 of their respective seasons.

I made a [gifset](http://weleaveshadows.tumblr.com/post/86644338926/it-should-rain-soon) a few minutes ago comparing them.
>> ARTICLE
Man this episode really hit me... First off quotes:

"Water that soaks not into the earth, but instead creeps along its surface is false. You may pursue it, but you can never reach it."

"If anyone could, they would no longer be human." 

"I want to howl and cry, but I can't even shed a tear."

"All I know is that I have no home to go back to, nor place I can make my home. And I don't even have tears I can shed to accept that fact."

"We call such mushi drifters. They wander without a purpose."

"Once the rain stops and real tears can be shed... I will put down roots. Until then with the rain by my side, I will continue to drift like the clouds."

She is unable to deal with her pain and grief. She doesn't even consider herself human; because even babies can cry. She isolates herself from others, because she fears what sharing her pain could do. She speaks very simply and directly. She stays long enough to provide some benefit and then leaves before attaching herself to anyone. Always feeling the weight of the pain she can't get over, carrying that burden and unwilling to let anyone help... Man, Teru reminds me way too much of myself.
>> ARTICLE
It seems like you're carrying a burden. Do you want to talk about it? I'd really appreciate it if you'd PM me.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked that the girl's name was Teru, when the Teru Teru Bozous are those ghost-like thingies people hang on the windows to stop rain.
>> ARTICLE
Bit late to the party here, but they do this all the time.

I remember in the first season, there was one kid named Miharu who could "see spring" during Winter. "Mi" means "see" and "haru" is "spring" haha
>> ARTICLE
...
Such geniuses behind this anime.
>> ARTICLE
I love the use of rain as an analogue for her tears. The parallel between the drifter mushi and Teru's life was also an elegant analogy. Mushishi really excels at these type of things.

There's some awkward editing in this episode though. The way the flashbacks were done was a bit jarring.
>> ARTICLE
I really like this episode. Especially the theme of balance is in my oppinion a great deal in mushishi. The rain in which represent life can be a blessing or a curse if you got too little or too much of it. 
The mushi are are neutral beings that just exist. But human can be both and because of in they can disturbe the balance. I won't say Teru is bad or somekind but since she is human she disturbe the balance with her presence even though the mushishi is the cause. 
So the quote she statted in this episode,"If anyone could, they would no longer be human." was very accurate and somehow sad. Since she must chance her life of being human to a life of being mushi(drifter).
>> ARTICLE
Such a bittersweet episode
>> ARTICLE
Good episode, though I'm not sure what was supposed to be "special" about it, like the ending of episode 6 said.

Also, I'm noticing a bit of a recurring theme here. Tragic event happens to the MC of the episode in the past. Tragic event affects how MC acts. Later, the same event seemingly repeats itself, but it turns out not to be as tragic as the first time. This repetition (along with Ginko) helps the MC understand what the phenomenon is and how to live with it. Happened with the red tide in episode 2, happened with the icy lake in episode 3, and happened again now. Might be more as well, but I don't recall off the top of my head. Makes for a well-rounded story, but I do wish there was a bit more variety.
>> ARTICLE
I think the significance of this episode though, is perspective. She initially sees the rain as a curse, and over time she does start to enjoy the reactions of the people when they see her. But there's always a barrier between her and acceptance. Until she meets Ginko. Once he explains it, he quickly changes her perspective and sees the rain as more of a blessing. Bringing water to people that need it. She even sees hope for herself, planning to set down roots when it's over.

Point is, yeah there's some similarities there, but this one stands out to me. I liked it. Good to be back. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this episode. But it felt a bit "safe" if you know what I mean? I liked last episode a lot, and that felt a bit different than most of the other episodes. It felt pretty original and interesting, especially with how the conflict was resolved. The climax of that episode was pretty exceptionally thrilling for a mushishi episode. If there was more stuff like that, I'd fall in love with this series even more. (I know this kind of goes against my originality comment, but the point is I'd like stuff with a more dramatic climax)

This is still my favorite show of the season, though. Each episode has been really good.
>> ARTICLE
The special episode was last week, it was a some live talk with the creators.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, okay. That makes sense, then.
>> ARTICLE
1. "The water flowing on the water, running away as you chase it is fake" - talking of illusions, which come when you want water the most.

1. "If anyone could make it rain, they would no longer be human." - Which is why she doesn't settle. I wouldn't be surprised if she takes the rain with her, so she must travel around, so every place would get rain, or wouldn't get too much.

1. They're blaming Teru for the lack of rain, but she never told them she will make the rain come, only that she *predicts* it, so why blame her? They blame her because she had given them *hope*. And more than that, they *beseech* her - they have no one else to turn to, so they turn on to her, and on her, in their frustration.

1. Once someone close to her died because of the rain she brought, and once due to her failure to bring rain. Cruel fate.

1. The mushi are "Drifters", wandering without purpose. Having taken them in, Teru must also take their life, to wander around without purpose. She had to shed her humanity along with her tears, and become a Mushi-like existence.

Man, what a beautiful episode it'd been. "Once the rain stops, I will put down roots", when they can no longer be washed away by the endless rain. Also, Ginko is right - even if there are beings *responsible*, it doesn't mean they are to *blame*.

>> ARTICLE
I really liked this ep, moreso than some of the other stories in S2. The problem with Mushishi is that sometimes it is either too blatantly allegorical, or it is structured too much as a high-concept fairytale that it can be really hard to understand.

This episode got the balance just right, like some of the better stories from the series. They don't spell out the metaphor like you're an idiot, but rather ground it in something very relatable (the fickleness of rain clouds and the inability to settle down) where we're free to draw our own conclusions. The metaphor is subtly reinforced throughout the show, and the ending is satisfyingly free of simplistic pat moralizing.

Tl;dr- 10/10 good episode, plz more of this Mushishi.
>> ARTICLE
Is it me or did today's episode have an incredible use of sound?  Especially the silence.
>> ARTICLE
Very few TV anime directors make a good use of silence in their shows. 

Anime has a bad habit of being too loud.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. And it makes sense - snow deadens sound significantly, so silence is greatly appropriate. It also fit the sadder tone of this one.
>> ARTICLE
There's nothing I hate more than shows that over blow their drama with screaming and an overbearing sound track.  The moment when Tae fell into the river was nothing but silence and a quick progression of stills, yet it felt like my heart was being torn apart.  That's some quality direction there.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, did you watch the first season of *Silver Spoon*? There was a great silent scene in episode 4 involving [](/s "Hachiken coming to terms with slaughtering a deer.") That was one of the best scenes of Summer 2013 IMO.

I have not.  I'll add it to my backlog.
>> ARTICLE
Some pretty strong feels this episode. My heart sank a bit when Tae fell through the ice, but I'm glad that she didn't end up like Toki's sister. Although I didn't feel this episode was as visually impressive as last week, I still can't get over how calming this show's atmosphere is. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
You could feel the atmosphere in this one. I heard that the 2nd season is going to be taking a darker tone than the first and you could definitely tell here. That depression and hopelessness after a loved one dies, I know that feeling. 

There was some wonderful wallpaper material, especially with the falling snow on the bottom of the lake holy crap.
>> ARTICLE
>I heard that the 2nd season is going to be taking a darker tone than the first 

If what you're saying is true, that sheds a whole new light on the OP. S1's opening was Ally Kerr's "The Sore Feet Song", and while it was certainly a little melancholic, the lyrics were pretty positive and seemed to indicate the singer was going towards someone they loved.

But then look at the video for [Lucy Rose's "Shiver"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o84y-5-cO0) - it's very clearly about remembering something (or someone) that's long past; it's not just melancholic - it's downright depressing. I can only imagine what's going to come next for us, and I'm actually a little scared what could happen. I would love it if we finally got an emotional arc for Ginko, though.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Ginko has to be the most empty MC ever. I mean the whole show is driven by Mushi and not him so it is okay but it would be interesting if  we had more than just those two flashback episodes about his past. And that music video is really depressing, I got kind of a Ginko vibe from the old man too.
>> ARTICLE
I know it's only 3 episodes in but there haven't been any bad endings yet, so far theres nothing any more dark than the first season which also had dealt with death and depression and had death as a recurring theme. I thinking of the goo babies episode in particular that was pretty fucked up. I'm not saying your wrong, I just don't get that feeling from these episodes alone. 
>> ARTICLE
How was he able to breathe at the bottom of the lake for so long? Did the cold slow down his bodily functions to the point where he just didn't need to? Or is this just one of those questions you're not supposed to ask?
>> ARTICLE
I think Toki was in the process of becoming a mushi, like Hinata from the OVA- that's why he didn't need the usual requirements to survive. The mushi were keeping him alive, but they weren't really protecting him either. What I don't get is why he gets up on his own and returns to the village. In all the other cases of people turning into mushi, someone has to come and snap the person out of it. Toki does this on his own, even though he has no reason to do so- he even likes it at the bottom of the lake. This is also where he thinks his sister is.

A minor inconsistency.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't Toki say that there was a blanket of snow that didn't melt at the bottom of the lake, and that he fell asleep under it?
>> ARTICLE
This episode was a lot stronger on the "Mushi as metaphor" theme, so I'd just not think too hard about the practicalities and instead focus on the other stuff the story was saying (depression following the death of his sister).
>> ARTICLE
And it was a lovely metaphor at that, he literally became cold an analogy for loss of emotion after this sister's death, and he regained the sense of heat (emotion) by the warmth of the human heart.

mushi. The answer to everything in this show.

I'm glad I marathoned the first season.

This show is just so fucking good. And that's without looking into the symbolism and such.

And I just noticed. The first episodes dealt with people drinking kouki, the basic life of mushi.

The start of life in the first episode or the start of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Classic Mushishi bitter-sweetness.

I love the metaphorical use of the cold and snow to express Toki's feeling of numbness after losing his sister. Then use Tae's warmth to express the feeling of caring and comfort that helped Toki to move on. Very simple but well executed.
>> ARTICLE
I just gotta say, Mushishi was one of my top 5 anime before I knew season 2 was coming and now this is like the best season of anime ever. We get Stardust Crusaders and Mushishi *in the same hour*. What a way to start weekend!

That's all I can come up with to say. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some burritos to eat and Startdust Crusaders to watch...
>> ARTICLE
I like the little details in this show. When Toki and Tae were walking to the lake, you could see Tae's breath. Toki was too cold for any vapour to form.
>> ARTICLE
Great episode. It was pretty dark, which I'm enjoying this season. Toki definitely had depression, which the snow was a metaphor for. It kept bringing him down, or falling on him. Toki in turn eventually hurt Tae, which depression can do to loved ones. Very understandable, sometimes it's very hard for someone who is depressed to get help even when others try to help them. It certainly is a struggle.  
>> ARTICLE
I teared up a little when Toki was carrying Tae through the snow. Still as good as ever, Mushishi. This show is kind of like a dream, or its own set of folk tales. It's such a surreal and haunting, yet relaxing experience.

And when he appears before Ginko, the tears on his cheeks had frozen.

Could have sworn I saw this episode before. When he walks in the snow barefoot with his monologue is really where I felt like I saw it before.

It's snowing where I live, fitting.

Last week's was the usual masterpiece storytelling, but this one was a more predictable, straightforward and simple episode. The usually strong convincing pseudo-science took an obvious rest. The the same story about depression and how it hurts, not only yourself but others as well, could have been delivered in a more Mushishi-way... 

yeah... the whole day underwater magic was a bit too much for my immersion.
>> ARTICLE
This episode may have been one of the most well done episodes of Mushishi ever, even including the first season. The story flows so well, and follows its own pace, not revealing anything until absolutely necessary. This pacing engaged the viewer, not explaining what was going on until it was fairly clear to the us.

The presence of Ginko in this episode was fantastic, he was such an important figure but at the same time only spent one night with the family. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I didn't really like Ginko's appearance here. It would have added so much to the mystery and atmosphere if he hadn't explained exactly what's happening and how to avoid it. The writers lampshaded the fact that you really can't know that this mushi exists and I think it should have stayed that way. Where is the quiet magic of mushi if all of them are known? Kaoru's story would have been fine if he had made the decisions he did on his own, with his feelings of uneasiness or his love for his wife driving him to avoid or enter the tunnel.
>> ARTICLE
I think it could have been great either way, but Ginko's presence was important. If he wasn't there than Kaoru never would have discovered what was causing his feeling of forgetfulness, and we never would have had the story switch to his wife's point of view. 

For the viewer, the mystery of the flashbacks generates intrigue, but once the mystery unravels, the story would have nowhere to go. This could have been successful if the episode was paced differently, but they would have had to make the flashbacks much longer in the beginning, risking losing the interest of the viewer. Ginko's interference in the time loop creates a break in the repetition after the viewer has come to understand the mechanic of this particular mushi. This way when Kaoru finally sees things for the first time, the viewer feels the same way, and when the image of his fatally injured wife appears we feel the same hopelessness as Kaoru: The feeling that this wasn't the new world we wished for.

Indeed a great episode. I'm a sucker for time loops. I really like how he gave up on changing the past because it would prevent him from living a peaceful life with his family, but then he entered the loop again to save his wife. 

I also like that you don't know the full extent of things at the end. Does he still remember the looping, or was he swallowed by the mushi and only the wife is looping now? It does not give the answers, which in this case is a good thing.
>> ARTICLE
I think it may have been hinted that he did remember, because of the difference in his expression in the last loop when he's holding the branch for her. He's not in awe of her beauty like he seemed to be the other times. He's just kind of fixed on her, as if he's thinking "This girl is going to be my wife. This time we'll get to the end." When in reality she's going to have to go through the same thing he's had to go through. Maybe that's just me overthinking things.

Time loop episode? Fuck yes! This and the winter mountain god episode are my favorite episodes. 

This episode is what I love about Mushishi. The atmosphere, the pacing, the execution were all perfect. I felt Kaoru's emotions, from confusion (all the jumps successfully confused me despite already knowing the time loop was happening), to worry, to relief (he steps back from the the tunnel), happiness (he sees something he never had before, and hugs Iku), to desperation (when he sees the tunnel carrying Iku on his back, I was yelling at the screen) and then sadness as he walked through. I was close to tears as the credits rolled. I loved the loop from Iku's POV, too. I think it made the ending even more effective. Mushishi is the best.
>> ARTICLE
AOTY
>> ARTICLE
Anybody else think this episode was extremely Nietzschean? The man who walks through the tunnel thinks he has the opportunity to perfect his life, so he creates a "Real World" in his head opposite the "Apparent World" that he sees. In the Real World he never accuses that boy of breaking the vase and his wife never falls. Because he is obsessed with the imperfections of his life he becomes unable to appreciate his life, and in the end he dooms his wife to the same fate, and the viewer is lead to believe that he never really saves her.

So simple but so powerful, fresh, and beautiful a story.

Mushishi certainly is doing way better than the past half of the season. The number one reason I love this anime is not the music or the peaceful settings but the fact that the storytelling always steers away from the cliche and pays respect to the viewer by not taking the direction they'd expect. Time loops/deja vu are certainly exhausted topics in media but due to a couple twists, this episode felt very original.
>> ARTICLE
What a beautiful episode.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely amazing. Probably my favorite episode of all the ones in second season so far. The atmosphere combined with the exquisite story telling and calming OST manages to engage me so well that I'm attached by 5 minutes. I usually like less the episodes that adult Ginko isn't really present but this episode was so compelling that it made me forgive that. The story is a bit cliche and the lack of the usual OP was a bit disappointing but the execution of the episode and how well it was done makes up for that. I couldn't wrap my head around something this episode and I think its that the character designs seemed a little more complicated than usual, or something along those lines. I didn't cry but did get numerous shivers down my spine. Can't write enough to convey how happy I am that this series is back this season.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a little confused at what happened in the end.  Did he join the Mushi and now his wife is the one trapped?  Or do they both just have Deja Vu?  

Also, if she is the only one trapped, I wonder how she would  enter the tunnel again, as she only entered it because he chose not to and then later chose to...so confused!

On a silly side note, that must be the most powerful Mushi able to turn back all of time over and over again! 
>> ARTICLE
Watching it again:

Kaoru got assimilated into the mushi, since he knew about it before going in, and no longer is looping. Only Iku is now.

Makes me wonder how Ginko knows these things that can't possibly be known by anyone not directly involved.
>> ARTICLE
>Makes me wonder how Ginko knows these things that can't possibly be known by anyone not directly involved.

Of course we can't know for sure. But Mushishi is a show that let you imagine every possibility :)

Here's mine : I guess the only way for Ginko and all mushishis to know about this mushi is because one mushishi, in the distant past, has been trapped by this type of mushi. He probably walked through the tunnel at some point, not realizing what he was doing, just out of curiosity. After experiencing enough loops, he could remember enough to realize his condition, and began to "study" the tunnel. In its "last looped life" (whatever that means), he probably sent records to Tan'yuu. However he probably did not send records about his whole (looped) life (it would have been a big book !). He kept it short, because he knew the mushi enough to know there's no easy solution. He might have written the strict and factual minimum, something like :  
"Hey fellows, I found a new mushi. Here are the characteristics : shape/appearance of the mushi ; fragrance at night ; symptoms of "dj-vu" and anxiousness we experience when we are affected. Here's what it means, what the mushi does : time loops ! From now on, you will be able to detect it. However I found no cure, and it's impossible for a mushishi to investigate it more, at least safely (unless another mushishi than me gets trapped). Just stay away from those dark tunnels and be aware when someone talks about dj-vu."

Ginko says "I never heard of a case where someone could change the past". However he can't know for sure, since he doesn't know in details the life of the first mushishi who found the mushi. For Ginko, the first mushishi could not change the past and had no choosing over its life, he was trapped, and that's precisly why its precious records could have been passed to Tan'yuu and other mushishis. For the person affected, it looks like it's possible to make some choices (feeling of free will). For the outside world, it seems that people affected by the mushi only had "one life/one timeline". It's indeed impossible to know everything about their life, you can only have a grasp if they left written traces or testimonies in their last timeline.

It means that the other cases that Ginko talks about are just cases similar to the one we see in the episode. Mushishis are aware of this mushi, so they write about cases of "dj-vu" when they think it's mushi-related. We can suppose that Ginko will send a record of this story to Tan'yuu : "Hey, I found Kairou case ! Here's a brief description of the story". The last Ginko's record that will be passed to other mushishis in the distant future (after Ginko) will be different. It will be the last testimony he will hear and write from Kaoru, or Iku, or both, or no testimony at all in fact. Because we always describe what we feel, the last testimony will not be "Once, I changed the event by walking away the tunnel, and I experienced a life never experienced before". Instead, the ultimate testimony will be tainted by anxiousness : "In fact, as far as I remember, I always lived a life already lived, except maybe for my very first timeline before I crossed the mushi's path at something like 70, or when I chose to walk away the path to increase my total life by 2 or 3 years. But it doesn't matter anyway, in the end, maybe I never realy had a choice. In the end, as of right now, there's not a second of my life that I didn't live already."

And the next mushishi in the future will do the same thing that Ginko did, he will say to the patient "I read some records on this mushi, the last one was from Ginko, and again the report states that it's impossible to change the past. My only advice is to walk away the tunnel when you encounter it, maybe you will get a few more "fresh" years (but only for one or two loops top) before being consumed". Note that the mushishi should not destroy all of the patient's hopes by predicting that he will never get out of the mushi influence and live an unexpected life ^^

This theory holds only if the mushishi (Ginko in this case) does not try to go visit the couple in the future (when they are old). So the question is now why Ginko did not go visit Kaoru more frequently to see how the situation evolved, since he did so in other episodes/cases (like S1E15 "Pretense of Spring" and S1E04 "The Pillow Pathway").

EDIT : TL;DR : Ginko got a record by a mushishi affected by the Kairou mushi. People affected by the mushi have a feeling of free will but for the outside word they can't change the past. What mushishis can learn is only from rare testimonies and sources from the "last timeline" lived by the people affected. There are probably many plotholes and implicit assumptions, and it's just one of the many interpretations we can have with this marvelous show. So don't take it for THE explanation, just my thoughts.
>> ARTICLE
I think they are both trapped. By the time he asks Ginko about the mushi, though, she'll be asleep again. She won't find out, and everything will play out like it did before. We didn't see her really engage with Ginko at all, so she might never ask him about it. 
>> ARTICLE
>Did he join the Mushi and now his wife is the one trapped? Or do they both just have Deja Vu? 

It's left intentionally ambiguous which one of those happened. The show also ends before we see her get to her choice. Will choosing not to enter the tunnel lead to her fall off the cliff? Will the husband still remember everything and somehow save her? We don't know.

 The show is not about the end result of the time-loop, but about the reasons behind his choices. He initially got caught in the loop because he wanted to change his past, however when he gave up on that he was finally able to live further with his family. But when his wife is dying the mushi tempts him again. Are they now reliving their lives over and over again together? Is the wife alone in the loop and will she die when she exists? No one knows. But he chose to try to save her that way not knowing what the results would be, which is why we don't know. All he knew is that she would loop like he did, and even if that meant him becoming one with the mushi he was willing to make that sacrifice to save her.

>> ARTICLE
so this episode is very subtle and powerful.. That's why i love mushishi, it has a very strong philosophy undertone that makes you think.. The superb art and music just enhance the experience.
some questions i have

Was changing the past really impossible? I felt like the scene in which Ginko was asked about Kaoru dejavu happened only once in his numerous loops. Because when he decided to not go inside the cave again, he thought of what Ginko had told him previously. 

Was  Kaoru aware of him being under the effect the mushi the second when he decided to bring his dying wife inside the mushi?

When Kaoru learns about his condition from Ginko, what we see is the continuation of that same timeline. So when he steps away from the tunnel, he essentially continues his life and leaves the loop. Basically he re-enters the tunnel, because that was the only way to save his wife in his opinion since he already knew what the mushi does.
>> ARTICLE
Well done! I mean seriously, well done to the creators because this was brilliant! Not only is it a time loop episode, which can go very wrong very quickly if done badly, but it's coming off the tail of Ginko's back story, something that's difficult to just walk away from.

Man this episode is awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Man, right when I saw they omitted the opening I knew this episode was going to be special.

It was.
>> ARTICLE
Masterpiece. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that was a top tier episode. I mean they're all good, but this was fantastic. If you knew you could go back in time would you? Try to fix your regrets? Or accept them and move on? Good theme this week. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if you were being rhetorical or not, but the episode made me wonder if I would keep on entering that loop or not. I think I would, it'd be wonderful to relive some moments of my life. But that's the instant gratification side of me, and the idea of just being slightly aware that there isn't a single new experience in your life is absolutely terrifying. With every loop getting just a bit more unsettling, that would be complete madness. This episode gave me chills.
>> ARTICLE
That was pretty scary, getting stuck in a loop then having your wife stuck in the loop as well.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. This is probably the best episode of Mushishi so far.
>> ARTICLE
I was expecting him to unconsciously alter the future by saving the kid, which leads to him to not meet his future wife and somewhat *saves* her from her death. He will then live a completely different life with a different family, job, everything. That would have been very bitter sweet.

This version is pretty awesome too though.
>> ARTICLE
I can totally see this plot work in a movie (there has probably been one already).
>> ARTICLE
Just when he made it out of the loop, the future got something else in store for him.Sure, the guy is alive in his wife's loop but I cant help but to feel that the original looping guy is dead, the warning from Ginko pretty much confirms it.Great episode, I knew something good is coming since there was no OP.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know how many episodes this is getting?
>> ARTICLE
This is second cour, so it's probably no more than 13.
>> ARTICLE
he said he wanted to see the future more than altering the past.. then took his wife back to the past.. wot?
this guy basically ruin the lives of hundreds of ppl working in the saki refinery cuz he was being a dick to a kid.. coulda changed that but decided to move on with his life instead..

mushishi created some dude again you dont know whether to feel sorry or not cuz his decision making is completely shit.
>> ARTICLE
You've got the entire thing wrong.

The one who was stuck in the loop was the man only, not the entire village. He 'saved' his wife by making her get stuck in the loop too, instead of dying like she probably would if he tried to get her to a doctor. Also note that Ginko warned him not to go into the cave ever again, otherwise he might become part of the Mushi itself. Thus, we could conclude that he sacrified himself to make his wife live, even though she would live in the loop only. Anyway, we'll never be sure of what really happened, since the episode didn't explain what happened later.
>> ARTICLE
Put yourself in that situation and 99 times out of 100, a normal guy like you or me would probably give into that temptation, not keeping big picture consequences in mind. Also realize that in the episode, those who feel that uneasiness of Deja vu were only those that entered the cave. 

This isn't a case of Mushishi creating a character you're not sure you feel sorry for, it's a case of you as a viewer failing to realize the situation and context that led to the character making a reasonable and relatable decision. 
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting how Ginko can feel really intimidating sometimes, yet without any serious changes in his look, voice or attitude.
>> ARTICLE
Always gotta watch out for the quiet ones.
>> ARTICLE
That was a great episode. Had a dark atmosphere, but a relatively light resolution. I love how this show is able to constantly make up new mushi or mushi related phenomenon and have them all seem logical and believable. 
>> ARTICLE
> relatively light resolution

A guy gets his arm eaten by ravenous birds, narrowly escaping a fate worse than death wandering around a mountain for the rest of eternity. Yeah, light.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the episode was gonna end with his Dad hunting him down from the Mushi world :o
>> ARTICLE
I said relatively. Many episodes of Mushishi end with the person(s) Ginko is trying to save dying or having a fate arguably worse than death. This episode the guy merely lost an arm. Considering the dark tone of the episode, I would say this was a light ending.
>> ARTICLE
*And then* he lives happilys ever after, compared to the real bad ends this was very light

Many shows don't even tell half as good stories in 12 episodes as Mushishi does in 24 minutes. Bravo.

The moment with the crows attacking is seriously one of the freakiest things I have seen in a long time.

I love how they presented a man who hunts in a "wrong" way, but didn't outright say it's wrong to hunt in that way. They only showed the bad consequences of hunting in that manner. The stinking meat, the destructive attitude, and the eventual disappearance were all really poignant little environmental messages.

Wait a minute, these people have [*guns*? With ***laser sights***?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BmFRHRqCAAEOdDa.png)

Anyway, masterful use of silence (again!). They really captured the feeling of being alone in a forest at night - it's not the noise that freaks you out, it's the lack of it. Very good atmosphere as usual.

I was surprised when i saw that, i had to rewind to make sure it was a gun.

So, just a burning [slow match](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_match). Thanks for the link, was confused as well for a moment there. I forgot that early guns used to be like that.

My God, did this episode look beautiful, or did it look beautiful?  The art's always been stunning but some of these scenery pieces, man. I'd love to get some of them framed.

This was a pretty dark episode.  It was incredibly unsettling too.  I'm always in awe at how well the show establishes its atmosphere and tones.  Great, great stuff here.
>> ARTICLE
There was quite a... sickly? atmosphere to that whole thing.

The gun caught me off guard, I was under the firm impression that this takes place before any technology of that kind became prevalent. Maybe it's that fairy tale style that makes it feel like everything is in some kind of microcosm, outside of time.

Guns have been around for a long time, even in Japan. Mushishi is set during the isolationist era so guns would be uncommon, but definitely not a new kind of technology since they were using them in warfare long before the isolationist policies began.

But... I don't think there are any hard rules for timelines here, after all Ginko wears some pretty modern shoes and snazzy turtlenecks. 

>> ARTICLE
He is dressed much more modern than many of the people he helps.
>> ARTICLE
The music while they were remembering the dad's death was awesome.  Mushi-shi always does such a good job setting the atmosphere.

He was damn lucky he only lost an arm by the end of the episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Great episode had a quite eerie atmosphere to it, almost felt like a horror episode. I can't say i remember any other episodes that had the same feel as this one.

>> ARTICLE
The moments where Ginko was being "hunted" were especially tense. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode gave me a "The Most Dangerous Game" vibe and a little bit of "The Birds" vibe towards the end. Good stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Great episode, I wonder why the hunters didn't go search for tatsu-nii though.  Surely they must have realized it was a human after Ginko/younger bro ran up to them.

Also, I thought it was super cool that the [dad not having his shadow](http://imgur.com/XpeEhIT) actually looked different/slightly weird while still seeming natural; a testament to the artwork of the show, if you will.
>> ARTICLE
I think mushi-shi needs little more than 30min, it's a great episodic show, and sometimes the stories (like yesterday's) needs mode time.

To the the episode as always a great story, wonderful art. like everyone here the gun's scene caught me out off guard, it's not very mushishi-ish but it doesn't change much.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the gun doesn't seem very mushishi-ish because its a pretty violent moment, and those are few and far between in this series. Human violence is so rare that it makes those moments all the more effective and alarming.
>> ARTICLE
I loved this episode but I'm noticing a trend in this run which feels different from the first series. In that one it seemed like Ginko was trying to piece together a mystery with figuring out which mushi is causing the problem. He sometimes had a few false leads before figuring it out. It didn't happen exactly that way every episode but I remember there being a number which went like that. 

This season, he knows which mushi is causing the problem right off the bat and the onus is on the afflicted person to overcome their human nature or short-sightedness to remedy the situation. There was some of that there but it's even more so in this season and in many ways darker with melancholic resolutions.

I don't know if it's because of the stretch of chapters they're adapting have this particular tone or what. It's not bad in the least but it's an interesting twist on what I remember of the first run of episodes. Still bringing the tears each time too.  
>> ARTICLE
The birds flying in was one of the most foreboding sequences of the series. Easily.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty solide episode the scne with the gun was the most surprising but also pretty ironic if you take notes of what Ginko said to Tatsu before he depart to get the kouki.
 In my oppinion the power Tatsu gains from the fouki could be seen as arrogance of humanity itself. For instance he feared his father because of it but the moment he get the taste of power he changes. Becoming a mad man who think he rules the mountain. The fouki is being displayed as a metapher for power, which I find most intriguing if you think about it. 
One last thing i want to talk about is the meaning of the birds in this episode. Sure we can say that crows are an omen of death but if you take what Tatsu said himself about bird, which they are mainly lressent at daylight and they are weak. But how do Tatsu meet his dimise? 
Well these are my thoughts on this episode comment if you like and I am sorry for my bad english if there problem with it.
>> ARTICLE
Is there anyway I can get a picture of the ending but without the credits in the way
>> ARTICLE
I love Mushishi, but there is one problem i have with it. Ginko has next to no character progression. As an episodic style of show, having each episode as it's own little story, I would think Ginko would be shown to change slowly as the events unfold, episode by episode. Become more irritable, more distrustful of people, something to show that his life of constantly wandering and close work with mushi are getting to him in some way. But i can't see any of this occurring and think that the series focuses too much on each individual episodes characters, who we only see for a limited time, in comparison to Ginko, the main character who should be the most fleshed out.


>> ARTICLE
Ginko is merely the link between each story, he's not the focus. The author wanted to tell stories about mushi and the interactions people have with them that, like any natural thing, can be good, bad, and neutral, and Ginko exists to explain what's going on and assist these people, and to ultimately provide continuity between each separate story. That's all. Mushishi wouldn't be an award winning series if it dropped this formula in favour of focusing on a character arc for Ginko... who really doesn't need development either way. He's already incredible wise. If he suddenly turned misanthropic it would negate a lot of the intelligent and considered things he's said previously about people and mushi.


However, if you want more personal type episodes, there should be an episode (maybe even a two-parter) coming up that picks up with recurring characters.
>> ARTICLE
That's missing the point of the show a bit. As /r/Ashe_Black says, the main character isn't Ginko, but rather the world around him, he's merely the lens that it's being viewed through. 

And while Ginko doesn't seem to change, part of the idea is not that we see him evolve, but we learn what happened to make him the person that he is, when we first meet him. That involves learning about the world that he lives in, basically.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi isn't about Ginko, it's about the mushi and the people that Ginko meet. Similarly with Kino no Tabi.
>> ARTICLE
There is so many shitty adaptations that serve only as a source material advertisement, they're unfinished, they rush through the material or they get crappy anime original endings.

But Mushishi got a perfect adaptation, from start to finish, with great visuals and sound to back it up, and I love it. Finishing that with a movie is the perfect way to end this series.

I'm going to miss this anime so much, it has such a great atmosphere and is so relaxing, no other anime is like this.
>> ARTICLE
I misread the first sentence and almost had a heart attack and freaking out about what did they do wrong

I feel that lengthy hiatus was ultimately good. Even though it was nearly a 10 year long wait for the followup season.

I just wonder what Artland is going to do now. I wouldn't mind more Mushishi OVAs if there's any new content from the creator.
>> ARTICLE
I totally agree. It really suprised me in a positive way when I found out that there was Mushishi Zoku Shou. 
One of my my favourites.
Will miss you, Ginko.
>> ARTICLE
It was the type of ending that felt right for Mushishi. On the the one hand it was yet another adventure with Ginko and his journey continues on, but on the other hand there was a sense of finality to that ultimate message about beings, nature, and laws being bound together. A beautiful finale to one of the most beautiful anime of all time.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck. That was beautiful. This definitely deserved a full adaptation. Easily the most satisfying anime I've ever experienced from start to finish.
>> ARTICLE
Not one of the best episodes but still really, really enjoyable. 

Sad to see the last book fading away with nothing remaining - no new chapter to look forward to...


This show will be sorely missed by a lot of fans. Least it got the adaption it deserved.

So the anime covered every chapter of the manga now?

Yes. I think the mangaka did write some mushi story set in modern time (no Ginko though), but the main manga has been fully adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Here it is: http://myanimelist.net/manga/12151/Filament

I hope that there will be something based off of this some time

I am sad that it's over, but the satisfaction of finishing an anime and knowing the story is actually over is something I don't get to experience often. So most of all, I'm thankful for the journey. It was beautiful in every way. It was my favourite show I've ever seen since the first episode that I saw of it.

I'd rather see it end as a beautiful piece of art than for it to go on for too long just for the sake of continuing. 
>> ARTICLE
[It got my hopes up for a happy ending](http://i.imgur.com/vauqcpO.jpg) but Nature's Law was not having any of it.

The human drama was a bit emotionally weak compared to other episodes with a similar subject matter dealing with separation. Perhaps because it wasn't a big focus. This two-parter was more about the lore that intertwines the mushi, nature and humans.

A bit sad it's all over. Languid, quiet and atmospheric storytelling and drama is a rarity. The new Aria OVAs should fill the void a bit but I'm holding out hopes for the continuation of Natsume's Book of Friends.
>> ARTICLE
I found the third season overall to be just a touch lower in standard than the first two, in terms of the human/emotional element. Not sure if it was conscious directorial decisions but they didn't seem to quite strike that sweet spot in pacing and development that they did before... it must be hard to hit those notes consistently over ~50 episodes and not get clichd though. I'm glad they avoided that and ended on a relative high. Fantastic show.

And there ends one of the most exceptional anime to ever be created/adapted. Farewell Mushishi, you truly were one of the greats.
>> ARTICLE
I woke up this morning and really felt like watching some Mushishi and started wondering when the movie was coming. Now I've got something to look forward to when I get home tonight.
>> ARTICLE
So, did you get home and watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Yup! I really liked it, though I'm not sure if I wanted some more finality from the series. It seemed like just another episode. I liked this because it fit with the rest of the show, but I still kinda wanted some form of closure.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I see where you're coming from. A little part of me actually didn't mind Ginko becoming the new lord of the mountain and surrendering his humanity or losing the ability to see mushi as the price for breaking the law. It would have made me sad, but at least it would have been...final.

But then again, that's never what Mushishi ever was, was it? It was never a show about Ginko. If it was, it would imply Ginko was "chosen" or somewhat special by bringing characters from his past, like most anime do with their protagonists. I was worried that when Ginko (a human) went into the circle of light willingly, something that is considered a nigh-impossible event, they would make it all anime-ish by having the circle of light exclaim something like "I-Impossible! No human has ever breached this mushi barrier. What special powar?!"

But that never happened, thankfully. In true Mushishi fashion, the entire thing went about it in a matter-of-fact way.

Mushishi was a moving show with a protagonist that was mostly stone-faced, because it wasn't really about the protagonist and it truly wasn't the people that moved me either. It was the world itself that captured my heart. It was a show that simply showcased the world and how humanity, with all its myriad of emotions and decisions, was still just a speck in the grand scheme of things and that nature always was and always will just... *be*.

At the end of the day, it seems Mushishi never attempted to tell one long story, with a beginning, middle and end. There was no hero just as there was no victim because all the stories were never a case of right or wrong as the humans are just as much victims as the mushi themselves. It was what it was - nature, playing its own little game, with no winners or losers. It just so happened to be told through the eyes of an ordinary wandering tradesman. 

That's Mushishi. And as much as I wanted some sort of finality or closure, that's Mushishi. It came, and it left, not with a bang, but with a beautiful hum.

That turned out to be a long wall of text. Just typed as my thoughts flowed. Oh well.

So great to hear that OP again. It's so great to see Mushishi again. I think it's the only show that can be absolutely slow and still manage to keep my attention. The atmosphere was so spot on. The use of silence especially. I really liked the parts with Kumado as a child. 

So hyped for the second cour.
>> ARTICLE
Epic sound direction as usual, the way they use the silence and the music really helps to convey emotions, Mushishi has by far the best sound direction of all the anime I've watched so far. The voice acting was great especially Kumado's grandfather, the scene where he replaced Kumado's soul was very touching and the great voice acting really helped bringing that scene together.   
Overall it was a very good special but it didn't leave me with the usual Mushishi aftertaste, most of the stories in Mushishi have something to teach and a hidden meaning behind them but this story felt almost hollow to me, it could have been an artistic decision by the writer who knows, after all this story was about an empty man.

How so? These are the 2 unaired episodes from the 2nd season thus making them episode 11 and 12.

I always loved how they do character design for kids. I always find them adorable :D

That ending was really beautiful and sad. In the end, she was too kind to step on anyone's shadow. The way these stories end is always just awesome and perfect. It just makes me sigh when it ends.
>> ARTICLE
They are great, but I find most of the character designs are very similar, to the point where I'm thinking this looks just like the guy in another episode.

There's been at least one incident when I got confused in the same episode too, which is bad I think. For this episode it was pretty close considering you don't really get a side by side comparison.

I disagree with everyone saying this was a comparatively worse episode than previous episodes of this season. This is the first episode to make me genuinely cry at the end. Akane's second chance at life constrasting with her inability to step on another's shadow was so heartbreakingly beautiful.

ever since mushishi season 1 ended, the sequels haven't had the same impact on me; however, this episode really brought back those same feelings and emotions. 

this episode was simply beautiful.

Me too! Some episodes have almost made me cry but this one was the first to fully succeed. Where most shows need many episodes of build up to bring out that kind of emotion, mushishi apparently only needs 20 minutes. This episode reminded me why we I love mushishi.

Yes, yes! I just finished watching this episode and I think it may be one of my favorites ever!

My God, this anime is really a fountain of beautiful stories.

Another amazing episode. This last cour is shaping up to be the best of the series. This anime is unparalleled in terms of intertwining human drama and speculative fiction elements. The only ones that come close are Natsume and Mononoke. 

My only criticism of the series is it relies too much on flashbacks to set up the story and characters. It can feel a bit formulaic at times, but the stories are so good that I barely even mind it.

> the series is it relies too much on flashbacks to set up the story and characters

Unfortunately, this is the major problem with series that do stories one episode at a time. You kind of have to use flashbacks to set up the characters or else a lot of precious episode time will be wasted.

Not that I mind the execution in Mushishi though. The show handles it very well and makes the stories so good that the use of flashbacks is alright. Also, the show's direction somehow manages to get the transitions in-and-out of the flashbacks to be very smooth and of sense.
>> ARTICLE
i appreciate you from doing thsi cinematography.. i have been checking them out every episode. short but well done
>> ARTICLE
I get what you are saying with the flashbacks, but I honestly don't think its an issue. This show, with a main character (Ginko) as detached from the plot of each episode (kinda like a spectator), I think it kinda gives the creators license to use those flashbacks. 

Regardless of whether its an issue or not, the show still is brilliant.

I think Mushishi might be the first show where I've been upset that they skipped the OP.

Edit: Fuck me the beginning hit me really hard, this is the second time in a row Mushishi's made me tear up. 

Mikage wanting to go home reminded me of when my grandfather was in the late stages of dementia and would insist he needed to go to his home in Chile even though he hadn't lived there for decades...and now it's getting a bit hard to type through the tears.

Hearing Youkichi and his wife bicker reminds me so much of my grandparents and to some extent my own parents. This weeks episode, I thought, was more impactful than last weeks.
>> ARTICLE
I had a huge lump in my throat at the end there. There's never any happy-ever-afters in Mushishi. Nature doesn't allow for happy-ever-afters.

I like how this show constantly makes you place yourself in other people's shoes so effectively. When Akane's voice is talking about what the other world she found herself in is like, I really got a sense of the slow everlasting dread she must've felt. Was time the same for her? Did she spend 60, 70, 80 years wandering around in a lonely world of constant dusk? That was a little hard to swallow.
>> ARTICLE
the use of music in this anime.... holly fuck.. at the end when he apologizes to the shadow along with that beautiful tone playing in the background... too surreal
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is an amazing show. It's one of those shows perfect for watching before you go to bed - every episode is a self-contained story that manages to do in 20 minutes what many shows don't manage over several seasons. Some of the episodes are heartwarming, some of them are scary, some of them are sad, but they always manage to evoke emotions in me, and they are unusually relaxing... After watching them I can't help but think about the episode, about life, the universe, and everything.

This episode is a perfect example of that - the ending was perfectly bittersweet, I sat there looking at the credits for quite some time with a knot in my throat, just *thinking*. That poor Akane, too sweet to even step on the shadow of the man who married the girl who stole your own life.

Mushishi, never change.

Still no OP. Goddammit... 

At least, we're having great episodes.

I don't remember the first cour being really dark or anything, but man... The first two episodes of the second have been kinda dark/bittersweet so far... I love that, but it's kinda hard to bear.

Seeing Mikage realize what she had done and Akane not being able to steal away someone's life because she's too kind was heartbreaking...

I'm glad for Youkichi that Mikage was not the total opposite of Akane, personnality wise (kinda like Kuro/Illya...)

What a tearjerker episode. She probably followed Mikage for 70 years since she doesn't know what the right choice is. I guess it's Grandpa's turn to be the shadow, but I think there's a way around this.

2.) Step on their shadow

3.) ????

4.) Profit.

Wow all the tragic ends for the episodes shown this cour...
>> ARTICLE
First I was creeped out by the mushi thinking its was just acting like a wormhole, a minor shenanigans in mushishi world to me but then we learned that it actually keep the person inside itself. I cant imagine what will happen if Akane remembers back, was it an accident the guy stepped on her shadow or he did it willingly? Man...
>> ARTICLE
Have to say this week's episode might not have been as strong as last weeks, but still pretty good. I will say, however, the comedy was pretty great today, we had a lot of great small moments that got some genuine laughs out of me. 

The whole "mushi reappearing after Ginko reveals what it is" mechanic was used again this week, and probably lost some of it's impact due the repetition. I also feel like the old man's character's motivation was a bit weak, and it was hard to tell weather he loved Akane before, or if he had gotten over it. It may have helped a bit to make us sympathize with her a little more, to show us  either some more of her life before the switch or some more of the effects of her disappearance. 

Looking forward to next week's episode, "hidden cove"
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure what you're getting at with your observation that mushi (or its effects) manifest itself after it's revealed by Ginko, but Akane appeared several years after Ginko's departure. There was genuine purpose behind Akane visiting Mikage's grave at the end of the episode, it's not just an arbitrary decision by the writer.
>> ARTICLE
I did not think of the mushi (Akane) reappearing at the end to mean that she was visiting Mikage's grave, that is an interesting point. 

I wouldn't say that it was an arbitrary decision by the writer, I was just drawing parallels between this and last weeks episode. In both cases Ginko only dropped by for a day or so, and rather than directly solving it he merely explained the phenomenon surrounding the mushi before leaving. In both stories, after an indiscriminate amount of time the mushi would appear and, rather than Ginko take care of it, the people would choose how to deal with it on their own terms.

 I am just pointing out that to me the two episodes had fairly similar plot structures, and I believe that may be the reason why it was less impactful than last week's episode
>> ARTICLE
Ok, I understand what you mean now. It's true that the past two episodes Ginko was only used as an expository character, rather than a main character.

My counter-point would be this: It was never less impactful when Ginko consistently directly solved problems and mysteries caused by mushi. I don't see why it therefore would be less impactful for Ginko to only indirectly play a part in the story for a few episodes.

I think it's less of it being objectively less impactful and more of it just not being your cup of tea. You like seeing Ginko more involved in the story. That's totally fine, and I got that feeling a little in last week's episode too.
>> ARTICLE
No, that is not what I mean at all. I actually think Ginko's minimal interference in last week's episode improved the story, he didn't need to be there any longer than he was and the writer didn't make him be there any longer than it was. 

I am saying that in both this week's episode and last's, the characters of both stories face similar situations where Ginko's knowledge on mushi ends up being useful much later on. I don't think that Ginko being there or not affects the emotional impact of the stories, but rather the repetition of the pattern where the characters meet the mushi again without Ginko. This repetition in of itself is what I am saying affected the impact, not Ginko's presence or lack thereof. 

It would have been interesting to see these stories in the opposite order to see weather it had the same effect or not. 
>> ARTICLE
The real question is how the rest of the season is going to play out. Is it going to focus more in Ginko or continue what has been happening these past 2 episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
My guess would be a mix of both. Zoku Shou as a whole has has a much smaller focus on Ginko, and a greater focus on how regular people deal with mushi. I would love to see some more of Ginko's past, or possibly some sort of character arc for him, but I doubt that will happen. All I can say is that these upcoming episodes have me incredibly excited.
>> ARTICLE
Nice episode! Personally I think it wasn't as impactful as the last week's episode but considering this is Mushishi we are talking about.. it's still a very awesome episode.

The background music was good, those moments when Ginko goes around curing old people's knees were funny, and that scene when he had to piggy-back Mikage were good too.

I wonder what will become of Youkichi? Will he be trapped in the "other world" forever unless he stepped on another person's shadow too? 
>> ARTICLE
He'll probably decide to stay trapped in the other world. He knows what happens and since he's old, he has nothing to lose by staying in the other world. By doing that, he also lets people live their lives peacefully without having to make a hard decision (stepping on someone else's shadow to live but being selfish or let others live their life but being trapped alone forever...).
>> ARTICLE
To build onto that, I would agree with your assumption that Youkichi won't step on another person's shadow but I think the reasoning behind his decision isn't a "nothing to lose" situation. In fact, he has everything to lose. You heard it through Akane's (or Mikage's? I couldn't really tell by the voice) words about how it felt to be stuck as a shadow. Forever stuck at dusk, representative of a sort of limbo, you'll pretty much wander around forever unless you choose to step on someone else's shadow. I believe Youkichi felt an immense amount of guilt (just as Mikage did) for living his life like he did after Ginko told him about the situation. He's going into it knowing the pain and the everlasting loneliness to come, but he's making a decision (not sure whether to call it selfless because of its immediate consequences or selfish because he went against Akane's wishes) to carry that weight.

Another beautiful, relatable episode from Mushishi. This final season is looking to be the strongest the show has to offer. 
>> ARTICLE
so should you be happy at the end or sad?  confused
>> ARTICLE
When is Mushishi anything but bittersweet?
>> ARTICLE
Very interesting episode. Had a somewhat similar structure to last weeks, but had a totally different feeling compared to most of the episodes in this series. An atmosphere of gentle isolation? Of warming loneliness, or a kind of calming resignation? I don't know, but this show nails it's unsettling atmosphere and manages to intertwine it with so much more. All built on a very human situation of finding out your own happiness was built on another's loss of their own, with a very human reaction based on no ill will.
>> ARTICLE
You couldn't find a better series to bet on as Halloween-appropriate. Disappearing people being replaced by others living as shadows connecting through from other worlds is just perfect.

This episode was just pouring on the atmosphere. I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like this episode has the least amount of music this season. Silence like that allows the voice actors' performances to really pop through and create awesome scenes where the audience is listening in on a real conversation, just wondering where it's going. It makes the audience connect with the characters much more naturally than when music is guiding that process through.

This season, for me, surpasses the first in every way but the fantastical imagery (which isn't a problem since most of the themes of this season don't lend themselves to that as much as the first season's exploration of the Mushi did) It's going down as a definite recommendation for anyone who wants a series that takes them on a journey.
>> ARTICLE
Good episode, and like everyone else has said not as good compared to last weeks. Regardless, it seems they packed onions with this episode. Luckly was not as bad as last weeks, almost dehydrated me. 

The ending was a tad bit too rushed, could have delved into the shadows (Akanes) backstory a bit more and what it was doing all those years, but whats done is done.


>> ARTICLE
Ha! I finally found a flaw in Mushishi's writing!

Why did the old man believe Ginko about that shadow switching immediately? If he had expressed at least some doubt, it'd be more believable.
>> ARTICLE
Not really a flaw , Mushi-shi seemed to be as respected as doctors in this universe. So if a Mushi-shi says something is the way it is , than you usually won't get any naysayers in the show.
>> ARTICLE
There are plenty of episodes (or chapters) where people doubt Ginko. It usually ends in a disaster, but nevertheless.
>> ARTICLE
Didnt the old man mentioned that there was a mushi shi in the village some time ago? In my oppinion the trust in which the old man places  in Ginko comes from the insurance that mushi shis actually makes a difference and solves mysteries or the unknown/unseen. So its only natural to believe Ginko.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention that Ginko had helped his knee, though it could've easily been a placebo effect until the following morning.

AWWW YEAH WE'RE BACK JUST AS STRONG AS EVER BABY.  ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN, CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKERS.

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, fantastic fantastic stuff going on here.  Not only did we get a happy ending this time, we also got to see some old characters again (Episode 20 was my favorite episode of the original series, and seeing Tanyu again made me happier than I have any right to be).  I love the updated visuals and the remastered sound, and while I miss Travis Willingham's wonderful portrayal of Ginko, the Japanese voice actors are more than sufficient.

The writing is as superb as ever, effortlessly entwining powerful emotional conflict with grounded and mature themes.  It captures the evanescence of life while still being hopeful and optimistic about it.  Even though we got a happy ending it feels earned.  Life may be more than willing to give us lemons, but to deny that fact that it occasionally does hand us an apple every now and again is to be needlessly pessimistic.  Our existence is just too short to be worrying about that anyways.

Anyone else noticed the familiar faces during the eclipse? Could someone who maybe just watched the series write down who they were? I remembered a few but I have forgotten the most.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that too. There was the girl from one of the very first episodes, who was stuck in a shed in total darkness.
>> ARTICLE
I'm too lazy to write them down, but they showed every character from the original series in the same order as they appeared (from episode 1-26). The only ones missing were those who died, like that guy who had premonitory dreams and the green haired girl who lived in a swamp.
We can even see that girl who got lost in the uro-passageways back with her sister.
>> ARTICLE
The green haired swamp girl was saved tho, wasn't she? He hair was back to normal tho.
>> ARTICLE
oh you are right, I forgot. She's the last girl being shown watching the eclipse.

If i remember it correctly she was showed as the last one in that scene.She was wearing a white and holding a bucket.

That was beautiful. I love this show so much. And the announcement of another season just made my crappy weekend better.

Loved every moment of this episode. And a second season annoucement \o/. Couldn't ask for a better year start.

Oh my gawd!  That teaser at the end!  Is Ginko going to deliver the core-shard to Tanyuu to help her exorcise her mushi faster??  <3<3<3

I ship the shit out of Ginko x Tanyuu

I do too!  But really though, it's not even necessary to 'ship' them, since their feelings for each other are transparent and out in the open.  That scene though at the end of episode 20?  My heart melted!

the director really knew how to hype up season 2 with that scene at the end with Tanyuu and then Ginko with the core...spring can't come any sooner

I had a fan girl moment when I saw Tanyu at the beginning.  My parents needed to ask me if I was ok.

Just watched it then. Another beautiful story with a soundtrack to match. It was nice to see flashbacks to old characters and then the post-credits announcement of the second season. Years later and they're still producing the same quality. I am damn excited for what's in store.
>> ARTICLE
So, any doubts about the quality of the second season (it's a long time between drinks after all) have been dispelled by this OVA. Bring on the second season!
>> ARTICLE
I really loved this episode. Everything was just so well done.
The music was better than ever. I've always loved the OST, but this was the first time that I felt like I could listen to the music outside of the show. The plot was creative and exciting. The characters were fantastic. If this is a sign of what's to come with the new season than consider me the conductor of the hype train.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is just so damn relaxing. The episode itself was really nice, giving a little glimpse of human nature and lots of flashbacks for the fans. 

Ultimately the story wasn't that intense, but it was still very nice and just straight enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
Welp. I felt like sleeping, but I kept my eyes open, and it was freaking worth it... 

I remember how relaxing Mushihi is. Everything is just so calming. The voice acting is absolutely mesmerizing. It feels soooo much more natural than any anime out there (with the exception of Dennou Coil that had a pretty natural tone in most of the characters' voices). 

Hiyori and Hinata's story as well as Hiyori dilemma about the sun got me by the balls and I felt like shedding a tear or two... Really, Mushishi is beautiful. I want to rewatch the original series so much now...
>> ARTICLE
Finally, some real anime.
>> ARTICLE
Do I need to watch season one to watch season two?
>> ARTICLE
I would say probably not. The entire series is episodic, and there are very few if any recurring characters besides Ginko (the protagonist). I'd recommend watching the old series anyway though, as it's great
>> ARTICLE
I would suggest it, its a very good anime i enjoyed every moment of it when i watched it a year back
>> ARTICLE
Well that was simply amazing. Looks like I'm getting that OST
>> ARTICLE
Enjoyable, but I was hoping for higher stakes than a regular Mushishi ep. given it was a special.  But it was the same as any other ep.  Still good, tho.
>> ARTICLE
Got around to watching it today.

That 45 minutes flew by. I couldn't believe it was over that quickly. 

Such a calm show, I'm so relaxedly excited about the new season.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain this to me: 

The manga for Mushishi is godly. The Mushishi anime is amazing. Mushishi Zoku Shou is also amazing. Mushishi in general is revered and loved by almost all. 

The second part of basically one of the highest quality anime in the last few years, which doesn't comply to a number of tropes that everyone complains about, is currently airing.

But barely anyone in this sub seems to care one bit. The episode threads get tens of comments. It's been an hour since the episode went up and not a single comment. Why is that? I guess /r/anime has shit taste, kappa.

Honestly, it's very frustrating reading so many threads where people are cynical about the current state of anime. Everyone still watches bullshit like SAO, but ignores the high quality stuff that deserves support.  edit. Let's be clear I watch SAO too, lol.
>> ARTICLE

Crunchyroll definitely streams Mushishi, both America and Europe so I doubt that's it.
>> ARTICLE
because people here on this subreddit cant enjoy an anime with beautiful art, music, plot they need overpowered brainless mc's with a 10 girls harem and some quality panty shots go better to mal they enjoy this anime more and the discussion there is better

>> ARTICLE
Dear god this has probably been the most condescending comment thread I've seen in a while. Please refrain from pushing your opinion as absolute while simultaneously bashing on this imagined, mindless fanbase you have in your mind. 

I agree that Mushishi is an excellent anime (one of my favorites) and it deserves more discussion, but at the same time, this doesn't call for starting a rant about "superior" tastes in entertainment. Let people enjoy what they want to watch, and please keep the discussion to the episode's contents. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, this might just be me but I'm saying it anyways. I love the anime, but I'm only 5 episodes in after watching it for like two months because something about watching it is just way too relaxing. 

That's a good thing, and I watch it especially when it's hard for me to sleep, but it's really bad to marathon like you can with most anime. I caught up with Psycho-Pass to watch P-P 2 in like a week, but I just can't do that with Mushi-shi, or I'll fall asleep.

It's the only reason I'm not on these threads, I just happened to look in this one to see how it was going. 
>> ARTICLE
People judges a book by its cover and Mushishi doesn't really ignite that interest on a quick glance unlike SAO. I mean, I've heard about how good Mushishi is for a long time but didn't pick it up until recently. Instead, I watched those high-profile shows like Aldnoah, Nozaki-kun, Attack on Titan etc.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe a lot of people haven't seen Mushishi and don't know this is an episodic anime so they think they can't watch it because they haven't seen season 1.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is Mushishi isn't a type of anime for everybody. It requires a special taste of things, I think. And it's not that much debatable since there's no big plot into it. And I'm not pointing it as a flaw. It's just different. I'm recently new to this subthread although I watch Mushishi for a long time now. I just feel good about watching it, I feel the need to make other people watch it but I don't feel the need to discuss it, you know what I'm saying?
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is more like a cult classic than a mainstream hit. It's one of the reasons why 'everyone seems to love it' but yet it sits as a S.A.V.E. title on [Funimation](http://shop.funimation.com/Shop/ShopProductDetail.ss?itemid=47044).

The only reason it's getting any NE love is b/c Aniplex is releasing BD's at some point. But we don't know if they'll dub it (doubt it tho)
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, there's not a lot to actually discuss in a Mushishi 'discussion' because the show pretty much lays it out on the episode. As they say, the work speaks for itself.

Say what people will about other anime, but they are a lot easier to comment on because they often leave a lot of plot threads hanging (sometimes on purpose, sometimes not) and there's a lot more drama within the premise of the story, characters and the fandom.

It's really not a knock on other anime or Mushishi. It's just how it is.
>> ARTICLE
No clue, I love the single story per episode format it does and still keeping a certain thread across all the stories.

Guess its not for everyones pleasure :\

Edit:

Though this does give one big advantage. I can browse peoples anime lists and find hidden gems that I'm sure I will like. Going though Denzoos list (pretty big anime compatilibly @ 84%) and cherry picking what I have not seen yet :)
>> ARTICLE
I rather like the fact that Mushishi threads don't devolve into what other anime's do - waifu wars, source-adaptation comparison, inane drivel, fawning over certain characters, "X best Y" bullshit, borderline retards quarrelling, gif/screenshot/quote dumps (Hey, we watched *the same fucking episode?!* Holy fuck, what are the fucking odds!), and other mindless bullshit.

Mushishi threads are like its episodes - quiet, mellow, and pleasant.
>> ARTICLE
I never comment on these threads, but I have seen every episode. Mushishi is the kind of anime that is hard to craft a middling response to. Its so enveloped in themes and messages that it takes some actual analyzing to say anything moderately useful on the subject. 

"I liked it, it made me cry/laugh/happy/sad" is not an interesting comment to write, nor is it interesting to read.


I imagine a lot of people watch this, but just don't comment on it.
>> ARTICLE
I agree completely that it's a show that doesn't elicit much interesting response (not like that stops most people in other threads,) but look at the ratings on CR - only 57 ratings for the most recent Mushishi episode, and 357 for the most recent SAO episode. I don't think a lot of people are watching Mushishi at all. It's also very unfair to compare it to one of the most popular anime of recent years, but hopefully you get my point.

I'm sorry for my generally whiny comment on the state of the anime fandom, but where better to express my discontent than the void of reddit.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think a show like Mushishi would be immensely popular in any medium. Mushishi, despite its strengths is not a fun show to watch. That goes doubly so for people like myself that like an overarching plot in my shows. 

I'll be honest. If I were to tell you that I look forward to this show every week, I would be lying. even further, I can't even say that I really enjoy the show all that much, but I wind up rating it high anyways because that was kind of the point of the show. 

Its a show that seems tailored to analysis, which is not going to be your casual anime fan.

>> ARTICLE
I think a major contributing factor in the lack of attention surrounding Mushishi is essentially the manga dates back to 1999, and the first series aired in 2005. With the subreddit every expanding the majority of users now are getting into the hobby through recent series like Shingeki, things that started a decade and beyond ago are out of their scope at the moment most likely. Very little ever touches the front page outside of the flavour of the month mainstream references that garner easy upvotes, that's not much of a help either.

You need to have watched 2 series/2 specials dedicated to Mushishi to be watching this at the moment, and the highly episodic nature of the series means that there's very little opportunity to theorise what's going to happen next or make comment on certain happenings(which is the sum of most discussion threads.) Because each and every episode has a beginning middle and end and no doubt leaves most people satisfied with nothing to say on the matter unless they feel like deconstructing the episode.
>> ARTICLE
We had a [survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2lwkda/midseason_comprehensive_fall_2014_anime_survey/) a few days ago. Out of 3209 people 341 said that they are currently watching Mushishi Zoku Shou 2.

That is still not even close to what it deserves, but 11% is a decent amount if you consider the kind of show that it is. 

Most casual anime fans prefer action or comedy shows so looking at the popularity on sites like CR or MAL isn't really fair.

/u/Advenna64 will make a detailed post about the survey results soon, so if you are interested in seeing what people on /r/anime watch and enjoy then keep an eye on him.

I completely forgot about that survey, despite participating in it! I look forward to the more in depth analysis!

Doubt it because i don't think he could get fake shiny kimono since the glow is from mushi. If he does get a fake one that shiny without the help of mushi then its hella expensive which i don't think he can afford or willing to pay.

I liked this one a hell of a lot more than the last two. Ginko was a more active participant this time, that's a plus. I also liked this episode's characters more, they had clearer motivations and personalities. Felt really nice to see Gen happy at the end.  
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is like a fine wine, it only improves with age.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me, or has it been a long time since we've met people who deny the possibility of the existence of mushi? The first season had a lot of that, while the second seemed like people are starting to accept the fact. I guess this episode felt a bit refreshing in a sense?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe after all the phenomenon that has happened, people slowly learned to accept it. Although, I don't think Mushishi is linear at all. But rumours spread and whatnot. Maybe it depends on the location, some villages may be more inclined to superstitious beliefs more than others. Especially those which actually have designated town mushishis.

Hey dude, you should totally add this [zip file containing 150 background images](http://imgur.com/a/VQmae) that I found on /w/ to your post, that way people can get a good idea what this beautiful show looks like.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks so much man! I added it to the review. And thank you for finding me wallpaper reservoir for the next 4 years.
>> ARTICLE
This show is one of my favourites, which is saying something because I watched a lot of anime. I really recommend those who haven't seen it do so.

However, it is episodic; almost each episode is a self contained story. Furthermore, it is a very 'slow' show, do not expect too much action. So it certainly isn't for everyone. Some people find watching an episode or two every now and then a much more rewarding way to watch the show rather than marathoning it, e.g. when you feel like something very easy to relax to yet provocative and atmospheric, watch an episode and let that digest, coming back to it a few days, a week later. Personally, I just couldn't get enough it and smash it out!

If the review and the above has not made this clear, it is something you must be in the right mood for. So make sure, it is the style of show you feel like watching that is making you check it out and not for the show show itself (because it is so recommended etc). That way you will get much more from it.

I can't put into words how much I adore the first season.

It was a a show I looked forward to after coming home to relax. It's so comfy, intriguing, dense with atmosphere. Hell, I was often thinking abou what ifs and what kind of mushis could exist, I was completely absorbed.

Sadly I found the new season to be just "good", but I doubt I'd even finish it if that was the first season. There were some episodes that were just as perfect(like the OVA between the split cours), but I wasn't a big fan of most of them.

It's focused more on people's issues instead of mushis making it less mysterious and atmospheric. That made it often boring, a chore to watch. Additionally it started having lots of out of place comedy relief, why? It also had less surprising conclusions, but both of those issues were mostly fixed in the second cour


S1 10/10, S2 7/10, must watch if you like comfiness 

EDIT: Oh yeah, the MC is just amazing. Without spoiling anything, besides being chill and fun to watch, he makes some very interesting decisions
>> ARTICLE
Man Rocct I've noticed your opinions seem to be just like mine so I like u haha. U sir got good taste! 

Mushishi is my go to stress relieving anime. Or if I just want to sleep (not from boredom mind u), like once I was flying and wanted to crash put two episodes on left me so relaxed and just dozed right off. That opening is just perfect, fits the theme so well. 
>> ARTICLE
> It's focused more on people's issues

This is the reason why I liked the second season more than the first one, actually. Was never fan of mushi and was more interested in people's imperfection. And I really liked these episodes when Ginko was just an observer and adviser, rather than healer.
>> ARTICLE
Same here.  As we got into the second season we saw more about how the world *is*, not just what effect the various mushi have on the world.  Ginko also takes a less active role but the people he interacts with are more interesting.  All things considered I think I might have liked the second season a little more than the first but both are easy 10/10s.
>> ARTICLE
Not bad for your first recommendation. You focused on the most important aspects of the show and why people would enjoy those elements. As for formatting, like others have said you can bold titles but I would also recommend using the separator like this:
    
      ****

****

This is just me but I would also avoid using scores when doing a recommendation. This is a recommendation so your views toward the anime should be positive anyway. You want to highlight its greatest aspects and why we would enjoy the anime as much as you do. Anyway great recommendation and write up for your first time.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first episode a year so after hearing the description of it as some guy talking to giant ghost bacteria.


It seemed really good but so, so slow. I haven't touched it since. Does it remain consistent like that or does it get more exciting and fast paced?
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen the first season, but it didn't change at all. I personally loved it, but yeah, it's not a very exciting series.
>> ARTICLE
I watched an episode and thought it was good but put it on hold because I'm not really into purely episodic format and the fantasy genre. 

But you convinced me to pick it back up. Great thread.

Hahahha. In my defense they're not as episodic as Mushishi. New characters every episode makes me kinda lose interest

How does it compare to to Natsume Yuujinchou?
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually planning on watching that next! From what I can tell, the anime's share some similarities with the whole secret world of creatures thing. But with Mushishi, the tone and focus is not on Ginko at all, but more on the world, and the people we meet. It seems as though in Natsume Yuujinchou, the focus would be more on the MC's development. I hope that helps.
>> ARTICLE
Natsume Juujinchou has more 'feel-good' elements, as well as being less morally ambiguous to Mushishi. At least, that's what I felt, but I haven't watched the series in years.
>> ARTICLE
That does help quite a bit, thanks! I would say it's probably half and half for Natsume and the side characters. The main theme of the story is loneliness and isolation so he isn't around people too too much, but I feel like a lot of the Youkai or the human side characters are decently memorable. 
>> ARTICLE
I ever so slightly prefer Natsume Yuujinchou to Mushishi. If I had to pinpoint a reason it'd probably be what /u/rajkgambhir mentioned: how both Natsume and his surroundings grow and change over the course of the series, in comparison to Ginko not being the focus of Mushishi.
>> ARTICLE
While they do share some common elements, the two shows are really different theme-wise. Mushishi is about mystery while Natsume Yuujinchou's biggest focus is friendship. 
>> ARTICLE
ALL THE FACES LOOK THE SAME!!! 
Ahem.
>> ARTICLE
This looks promising. A bit afraid of being overhyped though...
>> ARTICLE
Put this on hold a while back because I just had so much stuff to watch. Seeing this thread and hearing that OP again reminded me that I really appreciated each episode, I'll probably have to pick it back up again now, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
The original and Zoku Shou + all the OVAs add up to make my favourite series I've ever watched. People primarily complain about it being overly simple, non-engaging or slow. What I suspect causes these legitimate complaints is the average manner in which people watch anime. This is not a show you gain maximum pleasure from an instantaneous sinking in and speeding through. Watch it when you're tired and comfy, on rainy days or when you want to be in a pleasant mood. It's a show to immerse yourself in. I feel like my style of watching older series, as opposed to most people watch them, allowed me to enjoy it to the fullest.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed anime and also the opening is one of my favourites, but this is the first time I heard the complete opening song. I never thought such a song would continue on with things like "I stole $10,000 pound", "I robed convenience stores, because I thought they make it easier" and that part about killing giant bears. I'm just perplexed; I have listened to this OP at least a 100 times and I never would have thought it would continue that way.
>> ARTICLE
Does the show improve in quality or change much after episode 5?  

Nothing ever actively grabbed my interest in this series, and the themes from episode to episode were both incredibly same-y and uninteresting*, but I might pick it up again if it does something else later on in the series.

*Uninteresting to me that is--the themes are well presented for sure but just haven't been things I'm interested in being shown.  
>> ARTICLE
Honestly in terms of pace and overall quality, Mushishi is a rarity in that it's roughly the same throughout its entire run. I enjoy the kind of interactions the show focuses on, but maybe that's just not for you.

Give it a few more episodes, I suppose? Maybe you'll find one that really grabs your attention.
>> ARTICLE
I think the show picks up steam. You should try again, of you're not feeling it by Ep 13, then drop it. This show is not for everyone. 
>> ARTICLE
The show's really episodic, so it's kind of hard to say if it gets better or worse. Mushishi episodes are really consistent quality-wise, but it has a pretty large variety of themes, and which ones actually resonate with the viewer is going to be different for everyone.  

If it's only the themes that don't interest you, maybe find someone to suggest episodes you might like. There's not too much continuity in the show, so jumping around won't really matter much.

The fact that the mother does not miraculously gain feelings for her son  after she learns that he was only trying to protect everyone is what sets mushishi apart from other animes. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think one good incident will automatically make amends for their past history, but I wouldn't have minded if she started seeing him in a better light. Either way, they will have to learn to live with eachother and accept reality. It just shows that families can learn to improve as with any other kind of relationship.
>> ARTICLE
I can't really see that as a good incident.  She was trying to be a better mother by committing suicide through her son, not particularly caring about the likelihood he'd live through the fact scarred for life.  He pushes her away and denies her of her selfish wish.  She's not happy, he's not happy, no one is happy.

The whole point is that no matter what crazy thing happens, the mother cannot feel anything for her son.  Her son is even less than another person to her, just as her husband is.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm not disagreeing with you there. Either way, the immediate disaster was averted. I think that's at least the good news.
>> ARTICLE
In the end didn't it say that the son went on to live with his relatives.
>> ARTICLE
I think the beauty of its ending is that the answer stays in the air. The son and mother got apart but she took an effort to find an umbilical cord and he holds it. Their relationship is not getting better but doesn't die. It exists like a weak, thin thread, or like a small, dried umbilical cord. No one knows where it goes. It's not black or white as a life is sometimes like that. 
>> ARTICLE
The closer we draw to the eventual completion of the manga's adaptation the more solemn a new episode feels. And that emotion carried through this episode in its exploration of this broken family unit.

I love how the mushi simply leaves of its own accord as an affirmation of the irreparable nature of Reki and Shino's relationship.

I love Reki's challenging stare as a demonstration of his frustration when Shino halfheartedly tried to call him back inside.

I love how Shino will only accept some form of escape as a means to reconcile with her son, coaxing *him* to relieve *her* of her misgivings first and foremost.

I love how Ginko has been referencing data from the archives lately. Every time he breaks out a scroll, I immediately beam with happiness at the thought of Tanyu's pen having graced it. I've always imagined Ginko's narration at the end of an episode as a conversation with her that gets committed to that written base of knowledge that Tanyu spearheads. At the moment she's almost another member of the audience, but one day in the far future they will set out together to live out those stories together.

I really don't want this series to end, guys.
>> ARTICLE
wish i could be immersed in such a great series as yourself

perhaps its the superficial lack of overarching plot to pair with the immense development, but mushishi just doesnt bring me back week after week
>> ARTICLE
I'm of the opinion that each user here has one or two shows that engross them in one way or another. Mushishi is just that show for me. The way it carries itself plays into what I look for in a show of this nature. I can find an endless amount of small, peripheral things that I appreciate and that keeps me invested and excited for a new story each week.

Yup, I always imagine his narration as a story he's recounting for Tanyu to record.

Well, it's hard to not win when your only competition is literally soulless.

I think with Mushishi, at least it feels like Ginko will carry on even if we don't get to see it anymore.

So while it will be sad to see it end, at least it doesn't feel like an absolute finality to me. Because it feels like the lives of the characters will continue onward.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely. The show established everything it needed in order to leave me with that feeling, but letting go still feels like a hurdle.
>> ARTICLE
Is there some Japanese tradition about holding on to the umbilical cord? Why did they still have it after all those years?

EDIT: Actually did some googling. Apparently there is such a [tradition] (http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2002/09/08/general/the-japanese-attachment-to-umbilical-cords/#.VIOYZjHF9tU) TIL
>> ARTICLE
I know my parents had mine as well. I'm white with no association with any oriental ancestry so the tradition carries on in the states somewhat as well.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow every episode of this show leaves me with an empty feeling, a longing for it to continue and never stop. This feeling is one I only ever get from the endings of truly fantastic series, yet every episode of Mushishi gives me this feeling. And somehow, it keeps getting better.

Damn, two depressing episodes in a row.

On a side note, I really love how the scroll is written in feudal-style kanji+katakana, but the grammar is still completely modern :p It's a neat touch.

What was in the boy's hand at the end?

Me think its the remain of the umbilical cord seeing as it is a important plot item with its multiple subtle meanings such as the connection of mother and child.

Mushishi never cease to amaze how beautiful a story can be told in such subtle, gentle and quite way as if whispering a intimate secret into your ear.

Yea, definitely umbilical cord.

I would watch hundrets of episodes if i could.

Am I wrong or did the mother want him to get hit by lightning?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, that was the whole point of this story. The mother was forced into this marriage. That's why she just couldn't love the child she had with the husband she didn't want.
It went so far that she wanted to die herself and didn't care about her son dying or not.

...I really liked this episode.
>> ARTICLE
It was a pretty dark episode when compared to the rest. 

... I liked it as well. Ginko the psychologist.   
>> ARTICLE
You could almost say that he's one of those in most of the episodes, I think. In almost all cases, the mushi causing the problem is merely a reflection of one or more of the characters' mental states being given a physical consequence.

The girl who it rains on everywhere she goes, the boy whose skin is cold to the touch and who is constantly thirsty, the old woman who can't quite remember where she comes from, the child who is incredibly strong and quick to anger.

They're all things related to a mushi who, although being neither good nor evil, causes problems for them that manifest in ways that are almost always completely interlaced symbolically with what the characters of each particular episode are going through.

Then Ginko comes along and usually finds a way to cure them or exorcise the mushi in some way, which in turn resolves the psychological struggle which is occurring in those people. There are some blatant exceptions to make it clear that sometimes life is just a bitch, and that no matter how you try sometimes things will go wrong that can't be fixed. But there's always a meaningful psychological lesson that it brings for the people involved, usually but not always from Ginko.

...sorry for the long-winded necro post, I should've just said "Yeah!" That's enough ranting on from me.
>> ARTICLE
No problem. I loved the ending with the time loop, when the man decides to be devoured by the mushi, but his wife is then then locked in the time loop and they can spend at least one more iteration of time together.

Onions.
>> ARTICLE
This episode had Ginko display a lot more emotion than usual, which is a little bit weird. Yet, it added to the raw emotion of the story. The raw emotion that has Mushi-Shi to entail the audience, makes Mushi-Shi one of the best anime of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
FYI this is not "Also knows as: Episode 18", but rather 20. Just thought I'd mention since I accidentally read spoilers.

*WHAT A BIIIII*^*I*^^*I*^^^*I*^^^*T*^^^^*C*^^^^^*H!*

Seriously, fuck that woman. I get that she's unhappy because she got forced into arranged marriage, but a) she could have eloped, it's not like that hadn't happened back then, and b) leave the kid out of this, you stupid, petty cunt. I like how even animators have drawn her as physically unattractive. Just compare her to any other young-to-milf girls in Mushishi. Her turtle face betrays her character - that of a reptile that would eat its young. Who gives a fuck if she's haunted by the memories? She deserves worse. God damn it, usually Mushishi soothes me, but this episode just pissed me off.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think her character was drawn to look unattractive, it was a pretty standard looking face for the series. Also she is in the depths of depression and has limited free will, it isn't her fault that her family sent her off to a place she didn't know to be married to a stranger. I am pretty sure the woman wouldn't just run off with a man in this setting, seeing as it would be looked down upon by the society she was raised in. Sure it isn't the kids fault, but she can't force herself to feel an attachment to him.

Good episode as always. I'd like to see more Ginko action tho.
>> ARTICLE
This episode really reminded me of the yuri genre. Not only the fact that there were two females who are deeply emotionally attached to each other, but the societal pressure forcing them apart, as well as their own guilt regarding their relationship. In the end the solution to the girl's problems was right in front of everyone, but no one wanted to acknowledge it. Did anyone else get similar vibes, and do you think it's intentional?
>> ARTICLE
It did, but at the same time it was more of a little girl with a huge mother's complex instead of a romantic relationship. So the dad's solution made sense had the mushi not been there. At the end of the day, the girl still rejects others and is just as clingy as before though. Just goes to show that Ginko can't just come in for a few days and fix long-time issues other characters have, which is a good takeaway from this episode in my opinion.

**Mind-dump**

> I've known that old man since he was a young one

For some reason I feel I laughed way too hard at this line.

A true testament to Mushishi's storytelling is how it weaves an otherwise straightforward tale into something more enriching. The episode starts simply enough. Kanta seeks to remain untethered through his work while his wife, family, and village both express and represent a force exerted on him to settle down. After consuming the fruit of the entity that solidified the stability of the village that would welcome him should he choose to stay, he is forcibly bound by that entity and shown the history that it has recorded. Kanta doesn't take this well at first. He's shown to be haggard and deflects his daughter because he feels that he has no value in this state. But the knowledge that he is bestowed ends up saving the village *because* the villagers still hold him in high regard and work with him to minimize the damage of the earthquake/mudslide event. He seems to accept his new role in the final scene after his prior skill set ironically becomes needed when Kanta no longer possesses the capacity to perform that work.

**Things I appreciated**

* The amount of detail in some of these shots was staggering, especially in shots where the camera focused toward the ground or on the wildlife that the Eternity Tree saw.
* Ginko basically querying the collective of Mushishis for some form of remedy. Again he passes no judgment on the inflicted, perhaps merely nudging Kanta in his acceptance of his new role.
* Nui describes the tree as "watching", not interfering. It is said to be immune to the actions of man, but both neglecting it and venerating it are shown to have negative effects.

**Thoughts**

In a way, I'm relieved that I don't have to say goodbye to Mushishi for a while. Knowing that the conclusion has yet to come softens the blow of its departure for the time being. The movie was teased for all of 2 seconds and the prospect of checking this out in a theater entices me to no end.
>> ARTICLE
Great summary, and I agree about your analysis. I also can't wait for the movie to air...since it's Aniplex maybe we'll get a small theatrical run here in the states.
>> ARTICLE
> since it's Aniplex maybe we'll get a small theatrical run here in the states.

I wish I could be optimistic, but really, I see no chance of this happening.
>> ARTICLE
The distributor is Aniplex?! I feel silly for not noticing that on the Crunchyroll page. There is hope! I had the good fortune of getting to see [Expelled from Paradise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13391) - also Aniplex - in a theater not to far from me so fingers crossed that this increases the likelihood of a foreign premiere.
>> ARTICLE
derailing from mushishi, how was Expelled? It screened close to where I live but the CGI looked pretty bad from the PVs I saw. The only hook for was the Butcher's name on the poster. Was it any good?
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed it. It sells itself through high-intensity action, light mystery, and the unlikely-duo-settling-into-each-other dynamic. It had an interesting take on the tragedy of the commons and future of humanity at large. If you expect fun, you'll certainly get it here.

From the director himself [paraphrased], the visuals are "3DCGI meant to mimic cell animation". You'll only ever notice any awkwardness when the characters are moving mid-range in the depth of field and a few lip movements from Angela that felt akin to South Park. Otherwise, I thought it looked really good.

On the Urobuchi front, there is one conversation between Dingo & Angela in which they debate the implications of two different societal models and it's pure, uncut Butcher philosophy. Human Spirit. The ruthlessness of utilitarianism. Very keen and insightful with its application of technology in that regard. Otherwise it's absent for the most part.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked this episode. The characters Kanta and the tree contrasted very well. And as Mushishi often does, it balanced a sense of despair beautifully with a sense of hope.\\

I had resigned myself to Kanta's fate as Kanta did, right before he noticed the red flowers. And then I feared for Kanta in particular, either because of a kind of organ rejection like scenario caused by the mushi, where either his body or the mushi rejected the other enough to endanger both. But it ended up being the salvation of the village. It wasn't a joyous ending; the village was destroyed and Kanta still has to live with his legs, but the events weren't devastating, as I expected them to be. I thought this was a great episode to end the second season with (even though I feel like the movie will be the official cap).\\

I like that Mushishi bounces between happy endings, unsettling endings, and balanced endings like this one. The entire series has a balanced feeling that way, and I feel like that balance touches deeper emotions than those that are stirred by shows that reach for passionate emotions. They're emotions that kind of sit in me, and aren't swept away after the moment is gone. Great things come from both sets of emotions, but Mushishi is one of the few shows I know that goes for the deeper set, and I really appreciate it. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's interesting that this series Ginko has been less involved in the story and more of an informer and observer than a fixer of problems.

Is it just me being picky, or do they use one same character model for every man and one for every girl?

It's just the art style of the manga artist. She has shown that she can design dynamic characters, so I believe that she keeps her Mushishi off-character designs simplistic in order to reflect simple Japanese pre-industry living.

The plum was well worth it, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Overall, this season had a complete different feel than the previous seasons. I'm not sure how I feel about Ginko having less of a role than before. Its been mostly stuff happening and Ginko being there to explain to the audience what is going on. 
>> ARTICLE
When Kanta's legs started flowering, I was concerned he was depressed with his fate and becoming suicidal. Happy that it ended differently. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the best part of the episode was when she decided not to touch the life sparks at the end - knowing how much pain her family went through prior.

I wish we had more Ginko in these episodes though - it seems this season is really sparse.
>> ARTICLE
Why was she even tempted to go there *again*? I'm not sure, if I understood that part correctly
>> ARTICLE
I don't think she was tempted per say, I think the beautiful light just captivated her like it had prior. Only this time she had gone through the ordeal and knew the pain it had caused so instead she just enjoyed the moment.
>> ARTICLE
I always try to find links between mushishi and possible situations they could be applicable to in real life. This episode makes me think of being captivated in your own interest to a point of addiction. She loves the lights so much she forgets her family and herself while still being supported by her family through food and the doll. Also she is the only ones that can see the lights causing disconnect between her and her family.Parallels could be drawn between a drug addict still living at home causing problems for immediate family while ignorant of the fact because they to focused on themselves
It ends with the girl still drawn to the light but having set personal boundries so she can enjoy her interest while not losing herself.

This conclusion is a recurring theme in mushishi. In "Raindrops and Rainbows" parallels can be made with the father chasing the rainbow being a victim of addiction and the effect it has on his family and how addiction can be transferred to your children. The ending is also about appreciation of beauty but not letting it take hold of you.

In "Floral Delusion" the family that takes care of the blind deaf woman think she is so beautiful that they are addicted to her. Doing everything  they can to keep her alive at the cost of innocent people. Again the ending is 2 men standing and appreciating the beauty of the sakura tree(The girl is a symbol for the tree) and then moving on.

I think mushishi is trying to tell me that even though you enjoy your own interests please don't forget about the rest of live
>> ARTICLE
So Mushishi is the antithesis of otaku-ism?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i think so. Thats a great title for my post actually.
>> ARTICLE
I really like how the girl never really felt alone despite being visually presented that way. Would've been easy to portray her as isolated and lonely but instead the episode focused on how the love of her mother and sister kept her from feeling that way.
>> ARTICLE
This episode seemed to wrap up pretty quickly, also the mushi world just get more and more bizare. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode really felt like it went by so fast. It was another wonderful episode though. When in the well world how all the sounds were dull and echoed a bit was a nice touch, and watching Ginko fade away back to the other side was really well done animation. A lot of the transitions between scenes were wonderfully done as well.
>> ARTICLE
Feeling like you're alone even though you know you're not. Not being able to see or hear the people right in front of you. Being blinded by something unimportant while the people who care about you worry. I think a lot of people can relate to that.

Mushishi always makes me reflect on something about myself that I wouldn't have otherwise. As long as it keeps you thinking, it's accomplished its goal. A great series. I don't think I can ever dislike an episode of this show.

In a time where almost every other anime is about cramming as many events into one episode as possible, Mushishi takes one small event and lets you reflect on it. No world-saving or world-changing hero, just one man travelling around and helping people see what's important to them. It's so soothing.
>> ARTICLE
This story was great, and very surreal. Funny enough however it brings to   mind some of the things scientists are learning more about recently. Not   going to explain it, but maybe this episode was made more subconsciously   knowing of these things.

Yup, I watch it every week, but I have nothing to say. The show also doesn't have that man watchers in the first place. The MAL stat has  8,128 watching. I imagine many people might wait until the season is over to watch as well.

I watched the first episode and it just didn't grab me in any way.

It honestly didn't make sense to me. Maybe it gets better, but the emotionless characters made it hard to pay attention.
>> ARTICLE
It's pretentious as shit. The first half is the at least half-decent half. Later everything reasonable goes out of the window. 
>> ARTICLE
Hooray glad I skipped it. Dumbest thing is I even like stupid pretentious shit from time to time. Just seemed like they were mixing word salad with actual plot points though.
>> ARTICLE
A more nuanced description:

> Overall, I really enjoyed the show, but it definitely had its problems. Pacing was pretty bad, with some episodes feeling like filler, while others felt like they were trying to tie up every loose plot point as quickly as possible. The plot pushes the symbolism to the point where it may be intellectually deep, but on the surface it's incomprehensible. It's one of those shows that you have to put effort into watching; it's not necessarily enjoyable to watch casually. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is up for debate...
>> ARTICLE
Most people I know think of it as a masterpiece, so I really wouldn't believe the first person who says it's pretentious... It would be a really bad idea to judge Ergo Proxy from its first episode, the actual series changes quite a lot after the first few. 

If you only like action anime and fighting shounen, then I can guarantee you that you won't like it. If not, you most likely will like or love it.
>> ARTICLE
You guys are the first people I've ever heard that said they flat out hate this anime
>> ARTICLE
Well, because giving a pass for mediocre anime only happens, when it doesn't try to be 2deep4me while being nowhere near close to actually being deep.

Mushishi is well known to have these long over-arching themes or life lessons in their episodes, I always come out of each episode with something new to keep in mind

haven't seen it but heard of it quite a bit on Podtaku, izzit worth checking out?

Definitely worth it.   It's a short anime.

I tried to go back to it recently, just to watch a couple episodes.

It is slow.  It is thoughtful.  If you have the patience, though, I highly doubt you'll regret watching it.  Honestly, the order of episodes probably isn't even ideal, but I couldn't suggest any alternates.

The end of episode 3 , Tender Horns... marks the only time in my adult life where any form of media has brought me to full on tears. Still one of my favorite shows. 
>> ARTICLE
That Pillow Pathway episode still haunts me sometimes. That poor bastard just couldn't win  :<
>> ARTICLE
I had just started watching Mushishi and decided to show it to my sister, damn she thought I was a sadistic bastard because of the Pillow Dude. Still feel sorry for that guy, he made nice swords and shit I hear he became a blacksmith fucking hell man what the hell. Guy didn't even see the fucking hummingbird coming. Can't blame him though live some lose some. I'm gonna go sleep some more that's all I really get to do anymore. Goods show though I'll miss it. S2 yeah fun.
>> ARTICLE
To contrast with that I always found the rainbow episode to be incredibly touching and relatable while being simultaneously hilarious and unique. The way it ends in particular, with the man having obtained personal understanding that carried over into his profession, exemplifies the best qualities of the show.
>> ARTICLE
I think its about time to watch this again.

I was just thinking the same thing!  Definitely worth it to those who haven't seen it.

I didn't get a chance to finish the first season because it was taken off Netflix :(

For those who saw it, how was the second season? Better than the first? I'm just curious so I know if there's something to look forward to.

First season happens to be on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/mushi-shi), so you can finish watching it!
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, how are the Hulu subs? I was thinking about just using fansubs
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think they were bad. They also have the dub up, which I've heard are fairly decent. And, while fansubs are going to be better, I figured watching it through a legal, free means will help the show out better. But that's just me. And not using hulu means no ads, so I can't really argue against it...
>> ARTICLE
The first season was better. It concentrated more on the people and their problems and less about Ginko. In second season it's mostly about Ginko and his journey.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose it would get boring to have the same focus for two seasons. Sometimes, getting to know the main character can be nice and provide more depth to the show.

It just wasn't what I was hoping it would. That's why I thing firs was better. It's the same Ginko but maybe it the would focus on Tanyuu Karibusa storyline. I hoped they would :(

There is a word to help describe this, it's called sonder, when you realized that every human being is living a life just as complicated and amazing as your own...

It's stuff like this that's in almost every anime is what makes this genre so stunning! I'm still a newbie, but I have fallen in love with anime so much so fast!

It can leave other words behind.

Who cares, it's still deep!

In Afrikaans (one of the languages in South Africa), 'sonder' means 'without'

It comes from the identical Dutch word, I assume. German has basically the same word.

It is in Swedish ;P  
In Swedish sonder means probes.  
Close 'nuff I say.

Alternatively sner means sons.

Well... It isn't an English word. It cannot be claimed to have a meaning in English.

I think it's less realizing how everyone has a life of their own, but rather just how alone we are in our minds. You can never actually convey a sensory feeling through speech, the only way for a blind person to understand colour is for them to see it themselves.

The amount of information one can convey to another is limited, and the only one who truly understands an experience you had is you.
>> ARTICLE
Guys, it's just about mushi. It's about how you can't see mushi and they're weird. Ginko's a straight shooter, he tells it like it is. 
>> ARTICLE
I do think Ginko is as much of a psychological/spiritual healer as he is a mushishi. He's as devoted to protecting people as he is to protecting mushi.
>> ARTICLE
In philosophy that's called a *qualia*, i.e. something that cannot be conveyed from one person to another but must rather be experienced first hand.  You could try to explain what the color "red" is to someone, but you can't do better than use metaphors and examples--for the other person to know what "red" is, they have to see it for themselves.

I never really "got" Mushishi.  I tried.  I played through half of the series, but it never really got anywhere.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is episodic and simply about the life of a travelling doctor in a world where pseudo-spirits are a somewhat common ailment. There's not much else to "get".
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi doesnt have much of plot line rather its just situation to situation. Theres very few recurring characters but the focus is more on the smaller stories and the humanity of them
>> ARTICLE
That's the point. It's not really a plot going anywhere. Just a slice of life. Dude finds people blaming spirits for their problems and shows them a way out.
>> ARTICLE
That might be the most shocked I've ever seen Ginko. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt like that would have been a good opportunity for him to have been smoking and just let his cigarette fall out of his mouth in shock.
>> ARTICLE
Today's episode really hit the spot. The story did a really good job of building up the recovery of Yuuta to make the final disappearance hit that much harder. The series itself has set up such a good rhythm of Ginko successfully helping those who follow his instructions that seeing his oversight lead to a complete failure came out of nowhere. Of course, he returns to his typical self after the fact, but the shock, confusion and fear that overcome him when Yuuta evaporated was such an unexpected and atypical expression that it's effect was almost harrowing. 

EDIT: Thinking over it, did Ginko Really fail? I wonder if knowing the full story in the beginning would have allowed him to approach the situation differently. 

As a side note I think that this particular case had Ginko Returning much more often than other long term cases than he has had before. 

>> ARTICLE
I think the point was that it was inevitable that this would happen to her son. The loss was inevitable, and it was only then about how you react to it. Even if Ginko knew the full story from the start, there was probably nothing he could have done. As he said, her child and the mushi fused at birth. They were basically one and the same.

I think the most difficult thing to accept when something terrible like this happens is that there really was nothing you could have done. That makes people feel very empty for a long time afterwards. Losing a loved one in tragic circumstances. "I couldn't save him" or "In his last moments I couldn't do anything for him" or "I wasn't there". That's what I think most of the regret, when it comes to loss, comes from.

Sometimes bad things happen that are inevitable, and it's just about how you deal with that fate, accept it and move on. There's no shounen plot armour in real life.
>> ARTICLE
I was kinda surprised the mom didn't blame Ginko at first, she just lost her son and I'm pretty sure she wasn't thinking rationally in that moment. That probably would have unsettled him even more.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was interesting. This episode offered an interesting contrast from when Ginko usually fails. Normally his treatments don't work because there is someone who is all "I don't need this damn mushi crap!" or "Ehh, that creepy white haired dude told me not to do the thing, but he hasn't been around for a while now, I guess I can do the thing." But this one was almost entirely on Ginko. 

As for the mother, I think the reason she wasn't mad either had to have been her acknowledgment that Ginko was honestly doing his best to help them, or that she knew secretly all along that Yuuta was living on borrowed time. She had already experienced his death twice (once when she drowned, once when he was born and they thought he was dad) so she could have just been prepared for it. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the biggest thing is that there is absolutely nothing he couldve done apparently.


>> ARTICLE
It was very refreshing to see an episode go in that direction. I never realized that I actually really wanted to see Ginko fail for once. He always appears to know everything that he needs to know in order to handle a situation. Especially last week when he managed to pull a girl out of *another dimension,* and it was even implied that other mushishi had failed before him. I did love that episode of course, but no one is that great. 

I really like the message in this episode though. The mother was given a few years with her son that she would otherwise have been without. It is sad to loose a loved one, but she should be grateful for the time that she had with him. He was given to her, and then he was returned. This applies to any death, but this narrative made it easy to make that rationalization. 
>> ARTICLE
Only let down that I had in this episode is that I expected a stronger emotional reaction from the mother when her son vanished. 
>> ARTICLE
Well. That's biggest downer Mushishi's ever ended on.
>> ARTICLE
I had a feeling thing wrapped up too neatly, and then the kid evaporates. 
>> ARTICLE
When the kid evaporates at 17:00, I was like, "Shit, the kid is dead unless if Ginko pulls a really fast move to save him." The kid didn't survive :( 

Still, the episode showed the power of the love that a mother/father (mother in this case) has over their children even if there is something wrong with the child. For example, there parents with children who had autism, but for many parents, autism or any other diagnosis only strengthens the bond between the parent and child.

This episode did not play fair.

What a great episode.

Damn Ginko, you killed a kid. I guess that's how surgeons must feel when they wrongly diagnose someone, operate, and then that person dies. In both cases they leave the broken shell of a family afterwards. 
>> ARTICLE
That kid merged with the mushi before he was even born. He was eventually going to be part of that mushi's life cycle whether Ginko did anything or not. There's nothing Ginko could've done even if he knew this before hand. What he did is give the mother and son a normal life even just for a short while.
>> ARTICLE
> There's nothing Ginko could've done even if he knew this before hand.

We don't know that. Ginko has proven to be pretty resourceful given that he knows exactly which mushi is affecting someone, and to what extent.  
If the kid managed to live through several years of rains and floods, he'd live through more.

> What he did is give the mother and son a normal life even just for a short while.

They weren't unhappy before he had given them the brew. Sure, kid was a little cold and a hair's breadth from being a windowlicker intellectually, but they loved each other as parent and child. I'm sure she'd be happier with his kid still around, even if warped.
>> ARTICLE
The mushi gave the kid couple of more years to live, episodes like this shows the harmony of the mushi and humans and how mushi can help humans (I'm saying this now as I also just finished watching the Light Thread episode). 
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap. This season's been especially dark. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that was a very dark episode as opposed to the other episodes which were more sad. I think it was the fact that the dude was willing to kill his nephew, even after his nephew said that he didn't hate him, that I found most disturbing. 
>> ARTICLE
In for a penny, in for a pound. :\
>> ARTICLE
There was a lot going on in this episode, from the powerful visual metaphor of carrying vestiges of the deceased to Ginko letting Sousuke talk through his lingering hang-ups on the callous custom of abandoning the dead on the mountain and losing his father. Mushishi places its exploration of human drama above all else, and this is reflected in the manner in which Ginko conducts his investigations and the degree of his success in applying some form of remedy. When questioning Shigeru, Ginko abruptly stops before any inferences or accusations can be made on his behalf. Shigeru was seeking forgiveness not unlike what he denied his brother Shinobu. But Ginko is not here to deliver that, and Shigeru meets his demise when Sousuke denies him that release as well in their final confrontation.

Mud Grass bears the signature mark of beauty in aesthetic that we've come to expect in the show, but this story is relentlessly brutal. Not an offering I've come to expect of the show, but one that I'll certainly accept.

Three weeks until the final chapter. There is much to do to prepare myself for it.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is great that way in that some of the human drama might even be mundane if it isn't enhanced by the supernatural and given a twist to look at the drama from another angle. Mushishi reminds me of some of the better X-Files episodes in that regard, where the human drama is filtered through the mysterious and the supernatural. So even when the themes may not exactly be the most innovative, the way they're approached is unique thanks to the mushi interaction.
>> ARTICLE
Wow a fantastic - yet dark- episode. I was trying to play detective on how the weed was growing on the uncle towards the start; but once we got to the reveal of him murdering his brother out of rage I couldn't look away. It was an engrossing episode to watch, even if it was really dark as others have said.
>> ARTICLE
The question is was that grass silhouette the nephew's or the Uncle's? I am guessing the uncle's as his body probably washed up further up stream and the silhouette looked too big to be the nephew's.
>> ARTICLE
It's the uncle's. Ginko even mentioned at the end how he didn't even get to return to the mountains. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode gave me the heebie jeebies. Having uncontrollable warts/plants/parasites growing on me is one of my biggest fears tbh
>> ARTICLE
I was squirming the entire time. This episode was really uncomfortable for me as well.
>> ARTICLE
I love Ginko's thought process. He's very different from "shamans" portrayed in anime - he thinks like a doctor, a *scientist*, which is rather unusual in an universe where exist god-like creatures like mushi (everything from causing wind, through summoning rain, time manipulation, and ending in alternate fucking dimensions).

Oh, and *fuck me* that scene where murderer thinks he sees his brother's corpse apologizing to him... "Nii-san... So sorry...". Bloody hell, I haven't been so scared since Ghost Hunt episode with Urado.
>> ARTICLE
Argh, this episode made me so uncomfortable all over while I was watching it since I kept on getting goosebumps every few minutes (because they continue to show the seeds/warts on people).

Just when I thought I was sort of getting used to that they show us the uncle with the actual weed/dead grass growing on him. 

I watched every episode of Mushishi and had only been slightly discomforted by that one episode where there were mushi in the girl's eyes. But this one is on another level, more akin to nightmare fuel but it's still such a beautifully woven story.

Pretty sure this is the episode I'll skip if I re-watch Mushishi again though. orz I'm still getting goosebumps even after the show is over. I think the idea of growing those seeds/weeds on your body is just a really disturbing thought. LOL I think I'd rank this as the most disturbing episode of mushishi I've watched yet.
>> ARTICLE
The other one like this I remember was that one where the lady mushishi had the plant growing in her lungs or something, or the one where the couple gives birth to multiple spore kids. *shivers* Needless to say, I'm generally not in a hurry to rewatch those.

But yeah, combine the seeds and weeds with the dark subject matter, and it goes up there with the tree episode from earlier this year in creepiness (that tree one was practically Criminal Minds level but without the squick factor today's had).
>> ARTICLE
Oh god that spore one. I've still had nightmares about that one.
>> ARTICLE
The spore one wasn't too bad tbh, I didn't feel any discomfort for those since it's not really something akin to body horror in a way? (I actually don't remember the plant growing in the lady mushishi's lungs.. was it the same mushishi that acted as Ginko's mentor?)

But yeah oh man, I like how Ginko's basically pointing out the truth without saying it directly and not judge the uncle for it? He sort of leaves it out there that he knows what the uncle did, but he'll still try to help as a mushishi. 

Even now I'm still having goosebumps here and there, argh this is going to take a while to get rid of. I regret watching this last after all my usual Saturday animes haha.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, she might not have been a mushishi, been a while since I watched that one. And yeah, different people get squicked by different things, since the spore one got to me more than today's.

And yes, I loved how Ginko handled it. He knows and is willing to help, but at the end of the day it was up to the uncle to do what needed to be done and I think they both knew that. I was sad but not entirely surprised at how the uncle decided to handle it. :(

I loved them all, but I guess if I had to pick a favorite... maybe Pretense of Spring (ep. 15). Also, I recommend watching it subbed... the English dub is rather bad.

This is the best series I have seen so far... in fact I have spent the time since, looking for anime nearly this good and been left disappointed.

I'm in the same boat. this was the first full anime i ever watched and i have yet to find anything so masterfully done. Haibane Renmei came close though.

It is pretty much one of the last series' I've watched since like 2008?  I mean, I don't actively search for new anime that might interest me either...  If this ends up being one of the last handful I see, then I am okay with that.  
>> ARTICLE
You guys should check out Kino's Journey.
>> ARTICLE
it's definitely the anime i've come across that been the most similar in structure and feel, but i don't know...it lack's the heart and depth that makes mushishi so lasting. Most of the stories in Kino play out like jokes, where characters and plot are just vehicles for some eventual punch-line (or moral). Am i the only one who thought so? i know it's on a lot of people's top lists.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that each story is like a fable that is supposed to teach a moral or lesson, but I think that is what's great about it.  

I didn't find too many jokes though, other than the Kino/Hermes conversations.  

Natsume Yuujinchou is another great one that has the same feel about it, and has a lot of that "heart" you speak of.  Granted it has plenty of comedy as well.
>> ARTICLE
i meant "joke" more as an example of the show's structure, but fable works too. You're right that there wasn't too much comedy. But I'm really intrigued by Natsume Yuujinchou though, thanks for the rec!

Saw the first four episodes of MuShiShi at my University's anime club back when it first came out.  Loved what I saw, and tracked down the rest of the series.  I then found the manga and read that. I love both the anime and the manga.

May I ask what numbers 2 and 1 are? ^^

Tis.
>> ARTICLE
Sooo many great moments from the series. But, I always like mentioning the funny random things I see in anime.

If you watch the dub, the VA of Ginko is the same VA as Roy Mustang in FMA ep. 14 (Inside the Cage), the two guest VAs are also the VAs of Edward Elric (Kisuke) and Riza Hawkeye (Setsu). You don't hear much of Riza, but if you were only listening, the Kisuke/Ginko conversations sound like an out-of-place FMA conversation, almost creepily so.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for reminding me, it's been a few years since I've seen this series and been meaning to give it a second watch.
>> ARTICLE
I urge you to check out the manga too. Only about half the series made it to the anime, and the manga gets far darker imo. The mushi in the first half seem to me far more benign in their impact on the human world as compared to the latter half.

Mushishi is definitely my favorite anime of all time.

The manga has more stories though, and is just as good.

I've been watching it on Netflix stream... watched about a dozen episodes so far. At first I was like AMBORED. Then I was like CANTSTOPWATCHING. O_o; 

I'm hoping for an all out Mushi Mecha battle where whats-his-name becomes a devil. Or Sailor Venus. Or something @_@;
>> ARTICLE
Mushi-shi fans should definitely check out Natsume Yuujinchou. Definitely had the same feeling while watching it.
>> ARTICLE
can anyone help me this streaming online please?
>> ARTICLE
I should really watch the 1st season now.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished it yesterday, weird coincidence
>> ARTICLE
First season is coming up on CR I think...
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
This is what nice about Mushishi, you'll be able to watch the second season without having seen the first one! But of course, do watch the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is for TV series what Princess Mononoke is for movies.
>> ARTICLE
You should, I gasped in surprise when I saw the new season announcement just because I remembered how good season one was.
>> ARTICLE
Don't watch it while drunk or high. It's not needed, the show will trip you out enough as-is.
>> ARTICLE
Haha! But in all seriousness, it's so relaxing that I would highly recommend pairing it with some indica.
>> ARTICLE
I'm gearing up to get started. Gotta start soon, as there's only three months or so.

What an awesome reward, am jelly

I watched it over the summer and it's amazing. It's not in my personal Top 5, but if someone asked me for the 5 best anime's ever I'd say it's one of them.
>> ARTICLE
I think what I liked most is that it didn't fit in as something normal. It feels more like a documentary but it does it in a way that is very entertaining.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously respect you for that. They're are so many amazing things that I've watched that don't go in my top 5, but I understand that they're incredible pieces of art that deserve all the recognition they get. 
>> ARTICLE
Someone please hack my PC to take me back to reality. I must be dreaming. 
>> ARTICLE
Aye, I'm incredibly surprised and delighted...its the little things!
>> ARTICLE
Hold on while I remove the little Mushi from your PC.
>> ARTICLE
today is a good day!!!
>> ARTICLE
Now for a Kino no Tabi sequel and I'll have the travelingest year in anime.
>> ARTICLE
You misspelled Hitsugi Katsugi no Kuro. 
>> ARTICLE
The source material for Kino no Tabi is available and translated on Baka-Tsuki and is just as good if not better than the anime. If you have not already, I would check it out.
>> ARTICLE
The director for Kino no Tabi is unfortunately passed away. without Ryuutarou Nakamura, I doubt they'd be able to capture the same feeling. Mushishi S2 is (presumably) using the same director and team though. No worries there.

Did I just read a thank you based god response in a reddit anime submission about mushishi? times are truly changing.
>> ARTICLE
thou shalt always praise based god
>> ARTICLE
Looks like Mushishi just jumped up on my plan to watch list! 
>> ARTICLE
It's a super chill show. I watch it and rewatch it any time I'm looking to unwind.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is now on my re-watch list.
>> ARTICLE
Late reply but what can you tell me about it that won't spoil anything?
>> ARTICLE
you can't really "spoil" mushishi in the sense you would most other shows because it's entirely episodic. think of it as a giant short story compilation. most of it is just ginko (main character) helping various people with mushi (strange supernatural creatures) related problems. it's really chill, atmospheric, and interesting, and doesn't feel like a typical anime. it's almost like watching a documentary in some ways, but a very entertaining one.
>> ARTICLE
Mushi-shi is always on my re-watch list. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like people are underestimating how popular this series is with people. By all means, it's fantastic and deserves to be popular but I think most people see it in their mind as a cult classic.
>> ARTICLE
I got shivers going down my spine reading this. So awesome.

Thanks for making my day :)

Mushishi was the biggest reason I fell in love with anime. The otherworldly atmosphere and the soundtrack and the music was just magical.

Mmmm and now a sequel you say? It's good to be alive.

Try Cencoroll ;)

Aaaand, we already know AOTY 2014.

You'll eat those words when season 3 of Yuru Yuri is announced.

Late Christmas present, eh?
>> ARTICLE
...I'm trying to think of something witty to say. But I can't, because I'm sitting here in slackjawed amazement. It's been over 7 years since the show ended. How did...? Why...? 

I just...I don't know. All I know is, Spring 2014 is now officially on my radar (SAO can go fuck itself because it ain't worth the lint on my scrotum.) The other seasons are going to have to work ridiculously hard to beat a *Mushishi* sequel. My plans to read the manga are now shot to pieces as I'll now wait for the next part to be animated. Aniplex too stronk.

Here's to Japan, guys. Sometimes, they're pretty alright.
>> ARTICLE
> SAO can go fuck itself because it ain't worth the lint on my scrotum.

That show is WAY better than you think it is. Maybe if you knew how to deal with the small flaws the show has, maybe you can quit being so butthurt and enjoy the show.
>> ARTICLE
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

>> ARTICLE
Fucking pumped for spring now cause honestly it looked pretty shit before this.
>> ARTICLE
Kampai!
>> ARTICLE
The other seasons aren't going to top Spring this year. You'd need something gigantic to beat out a second season of Mushishi and the first true anime adaptation of Stardust Crusaders, given how wildly popular both are. Combined? Yeah, no doubt. 
>> ARTICLE
This was actually not all *that* surprising.

There were strong rumors that this was the case, in 2012. The director, scriptwriter, and character designer were reported to be working on a new work. A producer hinted that "hey, maybe it's Mushishi", and people went a bit crazy thinking "oh boy oh boy Mushishi season two", although there was the possibility it was something new, or maybe a sequel to Detroit Metal City (which is by the same people).

And there was a long time elapse with no news. People thought maybe Aku no Hana was what the director was working on (same guy), but that wasn't involving Artland or the other two guys, so it didn't fit. People forgot about the speculation in 2012.

Then they announced the OVA for January 2014 (the one that just released and provided this announcement), and people rejoiced, but they assumed that that was what the rumor was about...just the OVA. It turns out that the OVA was just gearing up for the TV sequel.
>> ARTICLE
See, I'd been one of those people whose attention perked up when the OVA got announced, but I hadn't dared hope there'd be a new season. Why would there be? The manga's been over for over 5 years, and I didn't hear anything about it doing crazy well. Quite frankly, I don't see a financial reason for this to happen, which would make this more of a passion project, and passion projects aren't really expected. I mean, I predicted *Unbreakable Machine Doll* and *Mahouka* just because of their nature, but more *Mushishi*? Damn.

Also, shit, the OVA is today? Eagerly awaiting subs, discussion post submission typed up and ready to go...
>> ARTICLE
You commented four hours ago...umm have you found it with subs yet? I can even do Spanish subs.
>> ARTICLE
[Made the discussion right here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1uedi8/spoilers_mushishi_tokubetsuhen_special_hihamukage/) I included a link in there to the Crunchyroll stream, and obviously you can find *other* subs at the usual places. I actually have it paused at the moment 31 minutes in.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the reply! I'm gonna order pizza get booze and watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, I've been sitting here trying to figure out what to do for a while and I just blurted the perfect plan.
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't ask for more. Best news of the year. And I really don't care it's just the start of January. This IS the best news of the year. Thank you Japan.
>> ARTICLE
STRAIGHT INTO MY VEINS
>> ARTICLE
I don't think anybody expected this to come after the special. This is great news.
>> ARTICLE
Was expecting S2 the second they announced the OVAs and reissue of the manga tanks but I was thinking it would be on a manga obi somewhere along the road. 
>> ARTICLE
Guys... GUYSSS!!!!  I'm legit crying right now.  This and Stardust Crusaders in the ~~Fall~~ Spring!  My hype levels are pretty much reaching terminal levels.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I think stardust crusaders is spring it's coming in April I believe 
>> ARTICLE
Typo, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who have not watched the series would you guys recommend it and if yes why?
>> ARTICLE
Its a different type of story than most anime and its put together really well; I would suggest it just for the way the story is told and the interesting concepts.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed the philosophical undertones to it and the fact it was non-episodic each story presented it's own parable. Every episode is like it's own little Ghibli movie but I find Mushishi a lot deeper.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, there are so many interesting philosophical undertones weaved seamlessly into each story that I feel Mushishi is one of those rare shows that really transcends mere entertainment and actually makes you think and challenges how you view the world.

Or at least, I've never been able to watch more than like 2 or 3 episodes at a time before I have to go lie down in the dark and ponder the meaning of life for a while...
>> ARTICLE
It's great, I'd definitely recommend it if you like mystery. I think of it as being like House MD except instead of dealing with traditional diseases it's got a bunch of weird quantum-like magical organisms that cause trouble.
>> ARTICLE
Think of it as a feudal japan x-files where every episode is the "creature of the day" episode ad none of the lousy overarching "ufo conspiracy" main plot episodes.  Pair that with some of the most amazing art and music.

Edit:  posted before, House is a better metaphor
>> ARTICLE
i like yours better
>> ARTICLE
I'm so happy right now. Maybe Spring will be great after all.
>> ARTICLE
Wow... and I just finished rewatching the first season yesterday night! Definitely one of the greatest anime to come out in the past 10 years so I'm very excited!

It is just fantasy~
>> ARTICLE
[Fuck yeah!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBBFDb0hC4Y) Mushishi is amazing, I can't wait... I just hope the second season lives up to its name.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic! Most relaxing anime I have seen (and also very good) :)
>> ARTICLE
Shit. Well, now I have a reason to finally finish Mushishi. I HATE how long I've been putting it off, since I *know* I'd love it. 
>> ARTICLE
never watched Mushishi. Is it as good as Monster or berserk? I've seen Mushishi as a recommended manga for those 2.
>> ARTICLE
> berserk?

The story, pacing, and atmosphere are just so different it's hard to really compare them. They're nothing alike at all except I suppose they're both fantasy genre. I mean I liked both Mushishi and Berserk, but for very different reasons.

Mushishi is a relaxing show about a man who travels the country side solving people's problems with these fantastical creatures called Mushi. It's a bit of a feel-good show.

Berserk is a hell-on-wheels action packed show with pure unadulterated violence.
>> ARTICLE
It's just on the recommended list if you search for berserk or monster in a couple of anime websites. I will def give it a  try. Would you recommend reading the manga  first or go straight for the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Overjoyed. This is my favourite anime series. When I am trying to introduce anime to someone I will always recommend Mushishi as it's so unique and is such a change from everything else. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow spring is going to be amazing with this in the lineup. I can only hope Crunchyroll picks it up so I can watch it in glorious 1080p.
>> ARTICLE
Judging from all these comments I'm going to assume the first season of this show is really good? 
>> ARTICLE
Beyond good. Amazing and inspiring.
>> ARTICLE
Extremely. Can't recommend it enough. Instant favorite.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like the Watch Club is going to do a rewatch in honor of this announcement. I'll have to join in on that. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope you enjoy it. I've never heard of anyone who didn't.
>> ARTICLE
I have a friend who didn't. But then he only likes action and isn't really open to things that are different from what he tends to normally watch/listen/etc.

Still no spice and wolf season 3

Better.

Bones didn't do Mushishi, it was by Artland, and the new site says that Artland is doing this as well.

OH yeaaah

Well looks like I have a series to re-watch as its been a good 5 or 6 years.

My favorite anime gets a second season! Thank you based anime gods!

Oh this made my day!

Mushishi is my favorite anime!
>> ARTICLE
Cannot wait for this.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, I JUST started the first season today. This is freaking nuts. 

But seriously, as far as I am into it, I can't explain enough how awesome Spring is going to be in terms of anime. Stardust Crusaders and a sequel to a highly acclaimed anime? Awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the world just paused for a moment at this.

I know some friends who love the show to death, and are probably beyond ecststic at the news.

Perhaps I should watch the original as soon as possible.
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty awesome Mushishi is easily one of my favorites, it's completely captivating in the most unique way. Now I'm glad I didn't read the manga. Can't wait!

OOOOOOH HYPE

Even the announcement page is beautiful.

this is awesome, I CAN'T WAIT

Not many years where you already know AOTY 4 days into the new year

Wonderful news. I hope they will be able to recapture the mood of the first season. It was amazing.

i started smoking because of this show

YES!

can't wait! just had SAO2 announced I'm so excited!

All I need is an Index III announcement sometime soon and I'll be incredibly happy.

Imagine a world where there's TAMNI with World War arc, Akagi 2, Kino no Tabi 2, Mushishi 2 and Ou Dorobou Jing 2 in one season.

God. I can only dream.

I would think that *you*, of *all* people, would want to forget WWIII.

You got me here :3

Guess I'll watch season 1 soon
>> ARTICLE
Looks like I'm going to be buying the first season and re-watching it in preparation if I can. 

Does anyone have any info on whether or not funimation's SAVE re-release of the show would be worth buying since I live in the UK? I've heard it's region free/hybrid but I'd like to confirm whether it is a safe purchase or not by getting a second opinion, since I like to play it safe.

EDIT: If I'm going to buy it from anywhere, Amazon will be one of the places I look. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mushishi-Save-DVD-US-NTSC/dp/B005HVWWB2/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1388873222&sr=1-1&keywords=mushishi

>> ARTICLE
Is there any word if it is going to have some plot progression this time? I loved the art and simpleness of it but i couldn't sit through more then maybe two episodes without falling asleep and giving up on the show because none of it had a point to the overall story. I understand some people like this but its just not my cup of tea. I'd really like something this time around that i can really sink my teeth into.
>> ARTICLE
It will be like the first season, unless they invent a bunch of new stuff themself. The first season only covered the first half of the manga and it continues in the same fashion to the end.
If you find it hard to focus on it might I recommend that you read it instead? The story and the artstyle and the same, in fact I think the manga looks better and a chapter/episode goes much faster to read than to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Okay thanks I think ill give it a shot at the manga then. I just watched the OVA after my first comment and I really enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
<3 I literally cannot even right now. 
>> ARTICLE
First time I am excited for anything in the spring season. 
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait the hallmark of this show to me was its surrealist quality to its visuals and story telling. It had me captivated from its first episode. For those wondering I believe CrunchyRoll is airing an ova some time in the future.
>> ARTICLE
FUCK YES FUCK YES FUCK YES FUCK YES FUCK YES FUCK YES. ALL MY HOPES, ALL MY DREAMS HAVE COME TRUE ON THIS DAY.
>> ARTICLE
Finally 
>> ARTICLE
Never watched the first season, but after seeing all the excitement in these comments, I definitely plan on checking it out.
>> ARTICLE
the Manga is just amazing as well the live action movie was pretty good too. This is most definitely one of my favorite animes in a long time. I was so excited to watch This OVA and THRILLED to find out they're making more eps! 
>> ARTICLE
I'm so excited right now, Ttis can't even be called a hype train.

hype rocket?

Lets go with hype rocket.
>> ARTICLE
Now if only they would add it back on netflix. Also did anyone here see the movie if so was it good ,bad or something else.
>> ARTICLE
Picked a good time to rewatching Mushishi. Hopefully Funimation will get Travis Willingham I play Ginko again. 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished the first season not so long ago... must be so lucky to have a second season coming soon!

That reminds me... I should go see the special now :o
>> ARTICLE
Ohh, now all that is missing is Gantz!
>> ARTICLE
Prepare to be really fucking depressed, again.

I dont think there was a single character in the first season that you don't feel soul crushingly bad for by the end of each episode.
>> ARTICLE
Mushi-shi weirded me the fuck out.

But I kept going back for more, because it was a good type of weird...

OP..... You just made my day! :D

Love the show, but I'm already wincing thinking about the psuedointellectual philosophy debates that will inevitably ruin the discussion threads.

No undo is cool and all I guess, but can't you simply paint over the thing to cover up mistakes and pretty much have the same result? Not entirely sure of the significance of that mention.

Otherwise, pretty cool
>> ARTICLE
Believe me, as a guy that's constantly making stuff with lineart, its no surprise you dont need an undo for this. If this was a line art, then i'd be impressed. It's a good pitcure, though
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful work! You have real talent. The way you captured the atmosphere in the show is perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Not hard to not undo. Just paint over mistakes. 
>> ARTICLE
I think you forgot that when dealing with reddit you have to explain it like they're 5.  He's not criticizing the art people, just pointing out a technicality in the title.

EDIT: Nevermind I spoke to soon, you're back in the positives now.

Even if he called the art shit he is still entitled to his opinion as much as those who praise it and should not get any more downvotes than anyone else

this is my new background, very nice. simple, unmistakable.

i liked it until i read the title
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like he's bragging but he's really just stating fact. If I could draw that well with one brush and an undo I would do the same damn thing.
>> ARTICLE
it's annoying because it's not impressive or worth mentioning. that and the painting itself is mediocre
>> ARTICLE
0 undos is really impressive for a piece of this quality IMO.

you know you can just paint over mistakes an infinite amount of times in digital, right?

It's BEAUTIFUL O.O

I'm mad at you because you are better at art than me, but I respect you because you are awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Very nice, deserves more upvotes!
>> ARTICLE
How is Mushishi?
>> ARTICLE
The first season so far is still better (though that might be partly nostalgia) but it's easily one of my favorites of all time. Its beautiful and thought provoking. Good story telling, likable characters, consistent atmosphere. It's prefect.
>> ARTICLE
First one? Sorry I never heard of this anime until this season on CR.
>> ARTICLE
Mhm. What's going up now is the second season. First used to be up on Netflix but i have no clue if it still is now. The season one dub is also well done I might add. 
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful is the best word to describe it.  Its very chill and all the artwork is amazing...just don't watch it late at night if you're easily freaked out; it scares some people.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus Harold Christ, this is beautiful! 
>> ARTICLE
I LOVEEEEEE THIS ANIME. Contemplating watching that or natsumi book of friends again haha. Amazing talent, keep it up!!

You should repost this to /r/animesketch
>> ARTICLE
Wow, no undo. 
>> ARTICLE
I didnt realize anyone could actually use paint well. Damn, good piece.
>> ARTICLE
this wasn't made in ms paint
>> ARTICLE
Oh. Well regardless it is a pretty amazing piece. I cant even draw a proper stick figure let alone something this beautiful. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm interested, been planning to watch this for a long time.

The format of 3 episodes per 3 days sounds good, however honestly I am fine with either method, but the one episode per day format might be a little inflexible for some.
>> ARTICLE
3 episodes per 3 days sounds like a much better system.  Easier to find the posts, less spamming of them, lets us all discuss episodes together easier.
>> ARTICLE
Considering Mushishi's episodic nature, I suggest one episode a day. It actually loses part of its charm marathoned, which people often resort to when it's 3 episodes per 3 days.

I watched it during lunch breaks at work, 1 episode a day, 5 days a week, last year, myself.
>> ARTICLE
The reason that I'm inclined towards 3-per-3 is that the difference is that the latter can accomodate people's schedules better, since not everyone can make time to watch anime every day of the week. People who want to actually do it one-episode a day will still find they're able to participate in discussion, since it's the same number of episodes on average.
>> ARTICLE
True enough.

Also, not really a much to talk about with this show, it truly is an episodic "Feel" show. But on the other hand, there's an endless amount of stuff to discuss in this show, heh.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who hasn't seen Mushishi either but wants to as well, I'd be very interested. I don't usually take part in Anime Club discussions, but now I might give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
Interested for sure!
>> ARTICLE
Yep me too, though are there any official places to stream it?
>> ARTICLE
It was on Netflix (USA)for as long as a I can remember.  I'm hoping it'll still be there come this watch.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly, in Netflix's quest to remove all good anime from its archives, Mushishi has been removed.
>> ARTICLE
One of the main reasons I canceled my netflix membership and got a CR one :)
>> ARTICLE
It's on [Funimation](http://www.funimation.com/shows/mushi-shi) and [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/grid/mushi-shi?categories=dubbed), dubbed and subbed, free. The latter is what I watched it on, as I personally prefer Hulu's video player to Funi's. I watched the dub, and although both are quite good, I will always prefer Travis Willingham's Ginko over Yuto Nakano's, however; his voice doesn't seem as deep and mysterious in the Japanese. 
>> ARTICLE
I've only watched fun myself and loved it but I'll prolly rewatch with the sub so the S2 isn't so jarring with the different voices but hopefully it'll get dubbed too 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Thanks a lot for the youtube link, becuase unlike hulu, funimation etc, it's not better with a subscription, but mainly for the fact that it's not *Region exclusive* so I can watch it even in the UK without a proxy.
>> ARTICLE
Interested!

If it turns out as good as people say, then next to JoJo I will have one more amazing anime to watch this spring.

Watch structure is fine either way.
>> ARTICLE
Interested. I watched about half of it once upon a time, when it was still on Netflix. It's currently on Hulu, both subbed and dubbed.
>> ARTICLE
It's all available on funimation's youtube channel currently as well
>> ARTICLE
I'm certainly interested. 3 episodes/3 days sounds good to me; I remember falling behind this year's ToraDora christmas rewatch threads a few times.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely interested in this
>> ARTICLE
Interested. I started watching it and I stopped because of finals/nobody to discuss it with. I'm excited. Either watching format works for me. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been meaning to watch it, will participate.
>> ARTICLE
The announcement of the second season is the first I've ever heard of the show. If it's as good as people are saying it is I'd love to watch it. Watching it with r/anime discussion? Even better. 

Also, I think 3 episodes every 3 days would be better. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd watch, never seen it but I've read a few chapters of the manga, and I've been planning to watch it for a while.

3 episodes per 3 days is definitely the way to go for me.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen it yet, I'm definitely down!

3 episodes per 3 days would be preferable for me.
>> ARTICLE
Ive re-wated this show about 3 times, but ill happily watch it again 
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen it yet, so I will join in.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good. Really liked the Toradora discussion threads, and I haven't seen Mushishi yet.
>> ARTICLE
Interested, Always have wanted to see it
>> ARTICLE
Id love to do this. I watched half of it during study hall about 2 years ago from a recommendation from a friend on my baseball team and when I transferred to a 4 year I stopped watching it and I only got to about episode 16 so I'd love to start fresh. It's been sitting on my plan to finish list for ages now.
>> ARTICLE
I actually wanted to nominate it for the current club watch in anticipation of the special that came out yesterday, but it's too popular on MAL and we wouldn't be able to watch all of it in time anyway. All's well that ends well, though, because the second season coming is an even better opportunity and Planetes, which I nominated instead, is also great to watch. I actually started rewatching Mushishi myself, but I guess I'll just watch the special and wait for the second season with the full rewatch too!
>> ARTICLE
I definitely want to watch this series, I've been interested in it for a while, I just got busy with my life and shelved Anime for a while. Now I'm back with a Vengence! I don't mind either format for watching either.

Because of the episodic nature of the show, I think it'd be easier to do it every three days. Its difficult to write a bunch about a single episode, even if they are all their own contained story, just because of how simple the stories themselves are (and gushing over how masterful the directing and atmosphere is gets old, fast.)

I want to contribute here a bit. In Russia we have a very popular (probably the most popular) source/database of anime [world-art.ru](http://www.world-art.ru/animation/) which also has its top. And it looks like this: 

1. Great Teacher Onizuka
2. Steins;Gate
3. Clannad: After Story
4. Code Geass R2
5. FMA: B
6. Usagi Drop
7. One Piece
8. Beck
9. Gintama
10. Nodame Cantabile
11. The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya
12. Spirited Away
13. Hikaru no Go
14. Mushishi
15. Hajime no Ippo
16. Bakuman.
17. Monogatari SS
18. Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuiokuhen
19. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
20. Death Note
21. Cowboy Bebop
22. Cross Game
23. Nana
24. Skip Beat!
25. Code Geass R1

Beck is a wonderful show. Glad the Russians like it as much as I do. GTO, as well.

Russian anime fans confirmed to be only anime fans without shit taste.

For some reason, I really like the idea of Russians liking GTO. Onizuka kind of has that "Fuck it, were Russian" sort of vibe. Never thought about it before, but yeah, it works.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting enough. Also this list has considerable amount of shoujo/josei anime (Usagi Drop, Nodame Cantabile, Nana, Skip Beat!) that you don't see in other lists.
>> ARTICLE
It makes me happy to know that Russians apparently really like shoujo/josei. I'm not sure why, probably just the disconnect between how the internet commonly depicts Russia and something like Usagi Drop.
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, mandatory 'people /= government' comment. By the way, Usagi Drop is my favorite slice of life anime.

I didn't mean that in a bad way. I meant it in the silly "Look at this truck in Russia driving down a highway at 90 MPH / 144 KM/H on three wheels" kind of way.

>> ARTICLE
That's...that's a lot of R2 love.
>> ARTICLE
HummingBird is the only website where the original series has a higher rating than R2.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually a really weird statistic. Normally, the second season is higher rated simply because the people who dislike the series never get to it. They drop it in the first season and then never touch the second season, resulting in slight inflation. On Hummingbird, the general userbase agrees that R2 was a large enough drop in quality from R1 that they even get past this inflation. My own opinion on R2 vs R1 aside, this is a pretty interesting statistic.
>> ARTICLE
I always thought of it as R2 having such a beloved ending, that it left a strong, good taste in everyone's mouth after the loveable trainwreck the actual season was. 
>> ARTICLE
The only part I didn't get was why he kept sneaking back into the school once he was long gone... It would have been easier with an entire freaking army to capture the people he wanted to protect from the school and keep them in the military base, but being smarter than everyone else and overcomplicating things is what leluch (sp) did best.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think R1 is much better than R2 simply because R2 is such an insane trainwreck. The ending saved it from having a lower rating than what I currently think of it.
>> ARTICLE
I actually felt completely different. I felt R1 was the trainwreck and R1's ending/R2 saved the series for me.  I even rewatched the series and came to the same conclusion. Of course, R2 (and R1) had lots of flaws themselves, but I just cant imagine Code Geass as a whole being better without R2. Maybe a better way of putting is I think R2 had higher highs and lower lows than R1. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel as if R1 was better because it was more strategic. R2 basically devolved into whoever had the best mech would naturally win. Oh shit that mech is so powerful, oh man now my mech has new stuff on it so I'm better, OH SHIT I HAVE A MECH THAT CAN DESTROY EVERYTHING WHILE STANDING STILL AND SHOOTING LASERS. Though the ending was very very good for R2 which is why people rate it highly imo. 
>> ARTICLE
I get that, but I dont see why people treat them almost as two different shows because of it.

R1 still had lots of strong mechs that single handedly turned around the battlefield and made strategy redundant. Examples include the the always incredible Lancerlot, Gurren and Lelouch's fucking Gawain)

R2 still had a lots of strategy and wit underneath the fights, including the escape from the chinese, the destruction of the tower, strategic positioning of the armies in the huge final battle. All of this that people *seemingly* forget just because there is a Lancelot and Gurren flying around.

You see. People act as if there are two extremes, R1 was prefect strategy and R2 was a stupid mecha-power circlejerk. But if you look closely, you can see each season actually has a lot of both. This is why I think the distinction between R1 being 'so much better' than R2 is just foolish. Strong Mechs and Strategy *is* Code Geass. If you just want strong mechs, go watch Gundam, if you just want strategy, go watch Legend of the Galactic Heros. But you cant just like Code Geass and then ignore half of what it is. Accept all of it or none of it.
>> ARTICLE
I just wish someone could explain to me why R2 was a trainwreck. What am I missing?
>> ARTICLE
I think it mostly boils down to the fact that the plot goes a bit haywire and introduces a ton of meaningless characters. I personally consider Code Geass one of my favorite animes but I honestly can't recall anything that happens between s2e1 - s2e22. It's very unmemorable save for the ending.
>> ARTICLE
[CG R2](/s "Sure you can! For example, one of the best scenes in the entire show is when Rolo kills Shirley. The bunney suit Kallen is all over the place too. What about how freaking cool Suzaku as a knight is!?")

MAL should seriously combine all the Gintama series except for the movies .

By the time the new Gintama comes this year  im 100% sure half of the list of the top 10 would be Gintama for a long long time  and I love gintama but still !
>> ARTICLE
I agree that MAL should reconsider when they combine entries. However doing so presents some clear challenges.

Firstly there's the question of what you do on the database side when combining series. Delete everyone's old ratings or try to average them out? At some level you'll lose data because inactive users won't come back and change their ratings, and inevitably you lose the information of which half is higher rated (even though selection bias arguably makes that question meaningless).

Secondly you open the more difficult can of worms of what criteria should be used to determine when series should be combined? When the second season follows directly from the first in style? When they air within enough time of each-other? When the MAL user base votes that they should be combined? What about splitting up Death Note into two halves on the same basis or going all the way and rating individual episodes?

I think it's clear that MAL will need a better system for dealing with the fact that most anime now take up several MAL entries, in this age where increasingly a show will get an 11 episode first season, 9 or so 2 minute specials, an OVA episode, a split cour second season, recap movies and finally a sequel movie.

The solution that I do think will eventually be implemented will actually be some sort of franchise system, but even that presents the problem of how do you divide up something like all the Ghost in the Shell anime.
>> ARTICLE
Easy

Allow a rating for the entire franchise but also allow people to rate individual seasons/segments/episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Consider the following example with made up ratings that do not reflect my actual opinion:

GITS SAC 2 episode 11 is rated 8.48

GITS SAC 2 is rated 8.55

GITS SAC (S1 + S2 + Solid State Society + Solid State Society 3D + Laughing Man +  Individual Eleven + ...) is rated 8.62

GITS ( GITS + Innocence + 2.0 + ARISE + SAC + GITS 2015 + ...) is rated 8.34.

Personally I think that's a lot of data to process at once. Furthermore it would put a strain on the servers to store that much more data as well as all the calculations needed to pool all those numbers together. I don't think it's impossible or even a bad idea per se, but I do think it would be difficult to implement in such a way that it's nice to use (both in terms of performance and UI).

I always find it endearingly peculiar that the ANN top 25 has three Maria-sama ga Miteru seasons. By the way, it's a very pleasant series.

[All the seasons are on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4U0FQ15BX8D1-lCVHli3WNK7KhVOuBtH)
>> ARTICLE
Now that you've pointed that out I've been consumed by curiosity? Was it a belligerent effort by /u/ or some such organization in a bygone era? Do ANN's users happen to be similar to the other sites for the most part, but have an unusually high ratio of Class S fans? Is this an oddity of the algorithm ANN uses to get their averages?
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop and Baccano! both in the top 25 on hummingbird, with Bebop nearly in the top 5. Sounds like my kind of site 
>> ARTICLE
It's fairly out of date at this point, but if we're looking at lists, [there's also this AniMetaCritic List](http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/) from The Cart Driver, which compiled the MAL ratings of a bunch of anime critics/bloggers. It's unsurprisingly slanted towards the kinds of shows beloved by people who like to write a lot of words about their media, but with a number of surprising picks as well.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow nothing in the top 11 surprises me, except maybe Aria. Didn't know it was that well acclaimed critically.
>> ARTICLE
It's likely just reflective of the general self-selection that goes into sequel ratings - if you're watching the third Aria series, you're probably a person who's inclined to like Aria.

Cross Game and Nodame in the top 25, could AniDB actually have good taste?!

Summer Wars should be bolded, looks like.

I enjoyed Cross Game, would you recommend the other 2? 
>> ARTICLE
If you have any classical training or just enjoy classical music, you will love Nodame. If you liked anything like Honey & Clover, you'll still like it even without that.

Summer Wars is basically my favorite movie ever.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. Think I'll also check out Summer Wars because I looked it up a while back and the bunny looks pretty cool from what I can tell. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved Nodame. It's a music slice of life, so if you're not into that, don't watch it, but the characters were nice, the music was fantastic, and I enjoyed it thoroughly to watch all 3 seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. I'm meh with slice of life. Last one I saw was Nichijou which was hilarious but I'll give it a shot if I'm in a slice of life mood!
>> ARTICLE
The AniDB results look majorly affected by the fact so many of their entries have so few ratings. Nodame has 6490 AniDB ratings compared to MAL 51210 ratings and Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd Season has 437 AniDB ratings compared to 8695 MAL ratings. Furthermore they seem to inconsistently amalgamate anime with all 3 Madoka Movies occupying a single entry and Mushishi Zoku Shou having 2 entries.

That's not to say that it's not possible that AniDB has good taste per se, but rather that their top rated anime list is messed up.
>> ARTICLE
Ima get rekt by downvotes for this, but **seriously,** why is FMA: B so universally loved? I watched the whole series 3 times just trying to understand what I was evidentially missing; as far as I could see it was just averagely good?
>> ARTICLE
One of the few shows that goes on for that long and actually has a cohesive, structured beginning, middle and end. Just a well told story is all.
>> ARTICLE
It's the anime equivalent of a western fantasy novel. Great world building, unique story, diverse cast, great character development, some twists and turns, satisfying ending, mix of action, drama, and humour, etc.
>> ARTICLE
I think to get at the top of lists like this, it's less important for it to be loved, than for no one to hate it. It also benefits from fame and popularity - it gets voted 10/10 by a lot of a newcomer anime watchers who have nothing else to compare it to.

It also exemplifies really well its genre. People who won't like FMA:B don't watch it in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Because its a perfect 10. The way they blend the dramatic moments with the soundtracks (and sometimes ED), the action is top notch, the VA's are *phenomenal* and its funny. 

Whats not to like? 
>> ARTICLE
different people like different things
>> ARTICLE
Can different people think different things?
>> ARTICLE
you don't say
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't mean that those different people liking different things don't have their own personal reasons for liking those different things.  lilelf29 probably was asking for examples of those personal reasons specifically referring to why people like FMA:B.

Basically, why do different people like different things?
>> ARTICLE
A big reason is because it's an easy to reccomend show, free of some of the dumb tropes that plague anime like random upskirts, MC's falling on vags, etc. I did like it a lot, but I definitely find some big problems with it, my main one being the ending. The main villain was probably one of the most boring villains in anime, and that ending was so shonen it was unreal. I actually thought that the original FMA was better, the villain was more interesting, and the beginning was much better (they skipped a lot in brotherhood)
>> ARTICLE
The biggest thing is that it's just a very solid show across almost all aspects. It is a great first anime and can appeal to everyone with a story that can be embraced by all, yet still holds quirks that make it uniquely it's own and uniquely an anime. It doesn't seem to excel at one particular thing, be it animation or sound or drama or comedy, but it still does all of those elements very well, and the combined overall goodness is it's biggest appeal. It's a jack of all trades in a way, and it just an overall balanced show. It also helps that the plot is one of the most well wrapped up storylines I can recall, and that "OHMYFUCKINGGOD" moment when everything comes together is really memorable.
>> ARTICLE
It has the largest draw and I think is consistently good in all aspects and all around very enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's universal. Anybody of about 12 or older could watch it and enjoy it. It's got good animation, well fleshed out characters, a great and original story, and plenty of philosophy. It's got funny, happy, sad, exciting, tense, scary, and thought provoking moments all wrapped up in one 60 episode series. It can be shown to anybody as a sort of "entrance to anime," yet a veteran watcher can enjoy it just as much. It has very few flaws (nearly none, actually) and does everything it tries to do extremely well. It covers all of it's bases; It ends the story in a satisfying way, it fleshes out it's characters thoughts, feelings, and actions and the reasons for each, it doesn't use bad CG and has an appealing art style, the pacing is good and doesn't leave much to be desired, it has a good english dub, and a million other things.

The show is just perfection incarnate. It's good because it doesn't fuck up. Steins;gate fans will admit that the show up until the latter half was slow and uninteresting. Gurren Lagann fans will say that Yoko was a bit overly sexualized, and that some bits at the end could have been omitted for sake of time. Cowboy Bebop fans (like me) will admit that the episodic nature bores some people, and the show is really only a 7 or 8 out of 10 until you've seen [spoilers](/s "the last episode"). But FMA:B is just ***good***. It's not that something about it is so keenly sharpened that it stands out. It's like a clean, sharp kitchen knife. It's not your sharpest, but it's flawless. It shines, no scratches, cuts everything equally without fail.

Maybe I'm exaggerating when I say it's perfect, but it's damn near it. I would go as far as to say it has no glaring flaws at all. But yeah. That is, at least, my take on why it's considered the best. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your detailed reply, you have convinced me to give FMA:B another try.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but as an FMA:B fan, I can easily admit the show leans too heavily on the action shonen tropes (The whole last few episodes in particular) and Ed and Al are very sidelined down the line. The first 13 episodes are also rushed through pretty hard, which makes some scenes lack a lot of emotional power. Not only that, the humour can easily come off as obnoxious due to its placement (IMO its better in the manga). FMA:B absolutely is great, and it does have a universal popularity factor that pushes it forward for the younger audience of anime, but to say it has no points of contempt is absolutely ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly your point about the rushed early story is why I recommend starting with FMA if you're at all interested in the fullest experience. I'd say as a whole the original FMA is much weaker, but after watching it first FMA:B's beginning was VERY short indeed. I didn't care too much because I wasn't really looking to re-watch all of that again, and I think that might have been something the creators considered.
>> ARTICLE
As I always say,  FMA: B assumes you've watched FMA, so it skims over the beginning
>> ARTICLE
> I watched the whole series 3 times to understand what I was evidentially missing...

There are shows that I adore that I haven't watched that many times.  Maybe you like FMA:B more than you think?


>> ARTICLE
I think Brotherhood is so widely enjoyed because it's the most western. Other factors help, of course. The source material was incredibly well-written, and the adaptation was extremely faithful. Few anime tell a single overarching story so well, connecting every dot and and plot point. I could talk about why I like Brotherhood for hours.

But if you ask why it's so universally loved, I think the lack of Japanese influence is a big factor. No difficult to pronounce names with difficult-to-translate symbolism, no unfamiliar references or settings, and very little reliance on puns or wordplay for humor. I struggle to think of anime with as little to do with Japan as FMA: Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
You could actually be on to something there as I would say AoT is similar in terms of being western and it didn't enjoy it.

The animation quality was flawelss in AoT, but just about everything else was pretty poor imo.
>> ARTICLE
How did it in Japan?
>> ARTICLE
Really average actually. I don't remember exact numbers but the Blurays sold under 10k, maybe closer to 5~7k, despite the manga's immense popularity. To put it into perspective FMA:B sold as well as Guilty Crown, slightly better than Dog Days S1 and less than Hyouka. 

FMA:B was quite a long series though so that may attribute to its low sales. 
>> ARTICLE
I've got another one:  Attack on Titan is also a strictly western setting.  Based on its popularity I'd say your diagnosis is correct.
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B is just the anime that appeals to the most people. There's lots of action which appeals to a younger audience, yet there's also science, strategy, and questions about humanity and religion which appeals to an older audience. There's some very sad moments and a lot of comedy. There's some romance but it doesn't spend too much time on it. While FMA:B is outclassed by other anime in pretty much every area, FMA:B is at worst considered averagely good and many people consider it the best anime because it has so many different aspects going for it.

I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time, as bold of a claim as that may sound. It's what happens when you mix in a perfect adaptation of the source material from an anime studio with absolutely phenomenal writing. And to have that consistency in both writing and animation for a full 150 episodes is what solidifies it as one of the best.

> I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time

And not everyone shares that opinion as evident by a couple of top 25's. I think that's fine, it would be rather boring if everyone likes the same things. As they say, variety is the spice of life.
>> ARTICLE
That's true, and I'm not necessarily saying that these rankings are literally wrong just because HxH is not on it, because there are a lot of anime deserving of a top 25 spot. Simply explaining to /u/Heizenberg what /u/bloodgods was trying to say.

Don't worry I got it, it is pretty amazing for a production studio to achieve such a consistency, in 150 episodes! Can't think of any other mediums that have that, in any kind of media.

Yeah for me personally, i probably agree most with ANN(with animeplanet close behind) top 25 than the others, but my personal top 25 anime still doesnt match up with it.

Anime isn't 'dying' but I don't know why these charts would make for a convincing argument that it isn't. Most anime fans are only into anime for a few years and, particularly nowadays with the greater access afforded by widespread streaming, they tend to watch current material. What the airing year table tells us is that anime fans have only a very limited sense of the anime past.

>> ARTICLE
Might get some hate for this, but since it's in 4 of the 5 lists now's as good a place as any to say it: 

Wolf Children isn't as good as everyone says it is, and I don't really think it deserves a spot so high on so many lists. 

Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with plenty of touching scenes and is, without a doubt, visually beautiful. But I don't think it's the masterpiece so many people seem to say it is. I'd hardly call ti equal to most Ghibli movies and, other than having a slightly unusual premise, wasn't anything too special. Since I should probably back up these opinions, I'm going to get into spoilers. So If you haven't seen it: turn back now.

My biggest problem with this movie is the ending(s). I feel almost totally robbed of an emotional climax. Ame becomes the real focus of the story for the last quarter and he's honestly kind of unlikable. For his big emotional scene all we get is a

"No, don't leave" 

"I have to leave" 

"Okay" 

kind of interaction. Which I suppose could be impactfull if they did a little more with it, but as is it feels very anti-climactic. Yuki doesn't even get that. All she gets is one confession of her identity (in an admittedly cool 'shot' where the curtains blow in front of her as she transforms and whatnot) to one kid. I found myself asking what this reveal is supposed to mean for Yuki. Does it mean she's accepted her wolf side even though she wants to be human? If so why does she continue into a life where her wolf side is so hidden? Again, it felt like some big realization or emotional peak was closely missed almost altogether. 

I'm also not a fan of the length/pacing. This movie is just under two hours, but not a whole lot really happens in that time. Some segments feel like they get a huge space of time to be developed even after we already get what's happening (I'm looking at you extended "it's hard to have young kids" montage) and others feel pretty rushed. (particularly the ending) 

It's a good movie, with an excellent premise that looks very nice and has a few interesting time lapse, POV, and other scenes. But beyond that Wolf Children really didn't blow me away like it did so many other people.
>> ARTICLE
All I did after Wolf Children was to go hug my mother, she's raised my brother and I by herself almost single-handedly right after migrating to Australia. The film resonates a lot with me personally so it's one of my top films.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's a good film but I can't see any way that it's one of the best 25 anime titles. 

But then again if I wanted a really solid stab at that kind of list I'd assemble a committee of people I trusted and have them fight it out and then write up an opinion with collective responsibility, rather than aggregating the ratings of thousands of randoms.

It's interesting in a kind of anthropological way that thousands of randoms loved Wolf Children to bits.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I accept your opinion, but I disagree.

Let me start by saying that I think that Ghibli is generally overrated. It's sort of funny, because endings are generally where Ghibli falls apart. Miyazaki wants to tie things up too neatly, so the climaxes of his films tends to come out of nowhere, and break the themes and characters of the films just to wrap things up happily. Spirited Away is most egregious for this - no, the film is *not* about the main character's ability to supernaturally sense whether the pigs are her parents what are you even doing Miyazaki!!!

In contrast, I think Hosoda's films have endings that flow naturally out of the themes and characters. Even if this means that they are open ended, or often very unhappy.

The main character of Wolf Children is the mother, Hana. The theme of the story is this core question - can she hold to her resolution that she would allow the wolf children to make their own choices in life, and love them unconditionally for that? Even when the choice is one that she does not want them to make, that takes them away from her? The tension in the story is between that resolution and her desire as a mother to do all that she could possibly can for the children. The story ends when she finalizes this resolution, when the children develop their own choices, when the story moves on from her story to the untold story of these children and how they live the rest of their lives.

The point of the ending is that the viewer occupies the same mental space as Hana. Adulthood comes all too suddenly and against your will. An emotional catharsis is denied. There is no one big realization, only the culmination of small choices that take place without you knowing it. You become only a small part of someone else's story, a story that is denied to you. This is an incredibly brave and personal choice on Hosoda's part, and one big reason I find the film really special. I can understand it not working for everyone though.

(As an aside: Yuki revealing her identity is about the changing of a secret. Her wolf side was previously a secret shared by the three members of the family. Now it's a secret shared with one she loves. Thus, the secret of her wolf side is recontextualised, it's not something that holds her back any more from the human interactions she desires, and so something she resents and fears. But instead it's a moment shared, that binds her *to* those she loves.)
>> ARTICLE
Also something interesting to note is that Hosoda has been clear in interviews that the film is a tribute to his own mother. Yuki and Ame represents himself - the path he felt his mother wanted him to take, and the path that he did take.

I thought the Gintama manga was fairly amusing, but I'm surprised that it rates so high on so many of these lists.
>> ARTICLE
While you don't hear masses of people talking about all the time it's a constant undercurrent. I can't speak about the other sites but on MAL, along with other long shows, it also benefits from the requirement that you need to have seen a fifth of a completed title for your rating to be valid, which means a lot of the people who try and drop it don't register.

I suppose I shall have to try it myself one day.
>> ARTICLE
Where's IMDB? :P.

TIL: Animeplanet has terrible ratings.

All of the website in the list are dedicated to anime while IMDB is just any form of television or movie so it wouldn't have really been a good comparison.

>> ARTICLE
Ok, lets do this... Clannad explain it to me. White album 2 is one of my favorite shows, the relationships portrayed in that show feel very genuine and the struggles the characters have make for a incredible show. I know almost nothing about Clannad other than the character designs put me (way) off and from the few screen grabs I have seen it looks like the literal poster child for generic moe blob harem show.

Are the characters well written? Is the setting actually interesting? Is it more than just a love dodecahedron? I think I just need a push to get over my gripes with how the characters look, but as a outsider it seriously just looks like the most generic 90's Harem anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Its not for everyone, but there is a reason why it is considered a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is rather generic yeah, but its still pretty well writen and the chars are likeable.

Now thw senbd season, Clannad:Afterstory(the one that appears on the tops), it's a whole different beast, while the first 8 ep are rather crappy, when the afterstory kicks in, it just leaves anyone speechless.

It's a family tale, a tale of reconciliation, and the feel trip is otherwordly.

PS: sorry for typos
>> ARTICLE
I literally stopped like 7 or 8 episodes in and haven't touched it yet. It just bored me to death, so I moved on to something else. Maybe I'll give it another try.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't give it another try, I watched the entire two series because people kept saying it got better. 

*It gets better after the Fuko Arc*

*It gets better at AS*

*It gets better in the second half of AS*

*The last few episodes make the series*

Complete waste of time.
>> ARTICLE
I came into afterstory expecting too much (reading all the hype for it) after watching clannad. I was always waiting for that special moment to happen and i was waiting to be impressed for the entire series yet nothing spectacular or minblowing ever happened. Sure there were sad moments but didn't make up for the boring first 15 episodes. So clannad and AS as a whole was a huge disappointment for me.

Do you think it is worth a rewatch in some time to maybe get a different opinion of it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i have to agree with you, and i didnt even get that much hype, only from my one friend(who got me into seasonal anime) and he loves literally everything japanese. He would basically be a weaboo, except he actually has japanese blood. So obviously i didnt buy into that hype and my reaction was nowhere near as positive as his. I really dont feel like the good emotional shit of the last 2/3rds of AS can justify watching through the mediocrity(imo) of most of the first season and the first 8 episodes of the second. Im only like halfway done making my MAL, and i really have no idea how the fuck im going to score the series.
>> ARTICLE
well overhype can ruin a lot of stuff, so is normal.
It really depends, for me i know it's worth a rewatch since i liked AS a lot, but you need to be conected to the characters, or the feels wont hit home run xD.

I would recommend you to start a rewatch, and if you see yourself in some of the characters, continue watching, if you don't feel any special interaction, it's probably better to just jump to another anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you know little about Clannad, by all means go in and watch it. Hype can a real destroyer for some people, and I'm grateful I watched both seasons of Clannad with an open mind. The character designs did throw me off a bit, but it only took minutes to get over it. I'm by no means well-versed when it comes to these types of shows, but it really packed an emotional wallop with an intelligent story supported by a super strong cast of characters. Honestly, I can only think of a handful of shows that measure up in quality with Clannad. 

Speaking of White Album 2, I'm planning on watching that after I finish K-on! It's been hyped so much to me, but hopefully I can approach it without any major expectations. 
>> ARTICLE
The second half of the second season made people cry so the entire show is amazing, that's what Clannad is.
>> ARTICLE
Did someone say [90's Harlem animation?](http://reenied.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Super-Globetrotters.jpg)

I'm guessing you meant Harem? Clannad is a slice of life comedy, the MC's ok, the girls are ok. The *feels* are forever. It is no where near WA2 in character depth or scope, but if you liked any KyoAni's stuff (K-On, Air, Canaan, Haruhi) then it falls in a similar category.
>> ARTICLE
> Did someone say 90's Harlem animation?

Lol fixed
> The feels are forever

This is the part I have heard about, and the reason I want to watch the show, but can you really feel a emotional kick when all the characters are just "ok." Oh and if the characters in Clannad have half the amount of awesome interactions Kyon and haruhi do then I think Ill enjoy the show quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Kyon x Haruhi is much better imo. But you get a solid first season of interaction followed by a story going legit sad. It puts more effort than most shows. If you've seen AnoHana or Steins;Gate then you'll understand what I mean. 

KyoAni series: Haruhi > Hyouka > Clannad > K-On > the rest. To give you a rough idea of expectations.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is indeed kind of harem-y, with one male raking in chicks by helping them with their problems. It's enjoyable, pretty moe, and gives you intermediate feels. 

However, the second season is much more mature, and deals with the life of the male protagonist beyond high school, and focuses on his relationship with one girl for the most part. The second half of After Story is known as monstrous rollercoaster of emotions, and the feels level is through the roof, which is why it is considered so highly . I without a doubt recommend that you watch the series if you can put aside the art style and generic plot at first. 
>> ARTICLE
Wolf Children and Spirit Away? I feel like anime movies should be in it's own list like most lists when they say the best shows and best movies.

You can think Parasyte is a good anime and still undeserving of Top 25 status.
>> ARTICLE
True enough. Judging by the tone of his message, though, he's obviously not a fan.
>> ARTICLE
The ratings of anime that are still airing are infamously inaccurate. Raters haven't seen the whole show especially the ending (which invariably changes opinions), those people who don't rate shows they haven't completed haven't contributed their opinions and often the sites use different algorithms for determining average ratings while the show is still airing (in particular MAL only counts your rating if you have seen one fifth of the episodes that have been released). Even after long after an anime has finished airing their scores tend to gradually change over time for innumerable reasons.

I would offer the hypothesis that AnimePlanet's Crunchyroll integration is partially to blame for whey the score of Parasyte in particular is so inflated compared to other sites.

Of course that's not to say I think that it should be in a top 25 anime list (at least not so far). But what are you expecting an anime community not to have shit taste?

Hummingbird masterrace!
>> ARTICLE
Hummingbird lost any respect I might of had for it when it listed Avatar as an anime unironically 
>> ARTICLE
Depends on how you define Anime.
>> ARTICLE
Anime is animation made in Japan

That's the definition- even this subreddit agrees on that as it's right in the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules#wiki_everything_posted_here_must_be_anime_related)
>> ARTICLE
I think it is up to someone's interpretation. But to call one side wrong is well, wrong.
>> ARTICLE
That is *a* definition. Not *the* definition. It may be this sub's chosen definition, but it is not the only (nor widely - meaning outside the anime community) accepted one.

Merriam-Webster (somewhat of an authority on language, at least English) states this as it's definition: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime). You will notice that the emphasis is on style - one that originated in Japan - but makes no statement that it cannot be produced outside Japan.

Again, regardless of either of our opinions on the definition of anime, it's silly to say that that is the only definition.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't hear any of that, but even if they did at this point, I wouldn't mind it too much. I don't see that as an anime either, but I judge the website for it's overlays, accessibility, ease of access, w/e.

That's an arbitrary reason for losing respect. It's not anime but it's close enough, who cares? 
>> ARTICLE
If I had never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime I would not believe that for a second

They are pretty far from being anime, mind I still like some of those cartoons very much on their own merits.

And there are many other reasons I dislike Hummingbird, the fact that they include non-anime is just one of them.
>> ARTICLE
Ah the old anime argument again. I take it you are in the camp that says anime = cartoons from Japan? If so, I present yet again: Le Maison Petit Cubes... (aka Tsumiki no Ie, aka Pieces of Love) an anime which you would probably say was not anime had you "never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime"...

This whole argument is ridiculous tbh, but please do go on and tell me why you think Avatar is not anime while Tsukimi no Ie is.

Would you suggest this series? Why? I'm interested but not sure if I'll like it. 
>> ARTICLE
If for no other reason, watch it for the art. Its breathtakingly beautiful in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
It's an anecdotal series that doesn't have very much of a central plot line. Each episode is a beautiful story that depicts a different slice of life and the problems that can come with it. What ties all the episodes together is the little revealed during episodes about how the main character, Ginko, became the way he is.

I loved it
>> ARTICLE
awesome sounds cool. I'll look into it. 
>> ARTICLE
This was such a great series!

Just to critique the poster your shading and use of colors is great though the actual drawing needs a bit of work, the hand and arm is kind of small and off, but I think you captured Ginko's likeness very well. Did I mention your shading is pretty great?

I'm curious what program you used for this and if you also used a graphics tablet of some sort?

Awesome. Any recommendations on the sub vs the dub? I recognize several of the dub VA's, and I very much like Travis Willingham, so I'll probably go with the dub, but if you have anything to convince me decisively either way, I'm all ears.

Edit: Too late.
>> ARTICLE
If you watch the dub, you might experience some whiplash when watching season 2 since you'll have no choice but to watch it subbed.
>> ARTICLE
No problemo. Did the same thing with xxxHolic, and ended up appreciating both for what they were.
>> ARTICLE
I staunchly defend the dub as one of the best dub performances I've ever heard. Travis Willingham as Ginko works really well, primarily because his voice performance seems to carry a certain airy yet intellectual air to it; it suits Ginko's "informed quiet observer" persona, and he can take it up a notch in the very rare moments when he shows greater emotion or needs to lighten things up. 

I mean, Yuto Nakano isn't bad, but this is one of the performances where I think the dub isn't just a suitable replacement as with most dubs, but actually beats out the sub for me. There are also very few awkward sentences that I noticed when I watched it (probably a product of the unusually low amount of face-to-face dialogue, meaning the adaptive scriptwriter has more flexibility w.r.t. matching lip flaps.) 
>> ARTICLE
I agree wholeheartedly. I really missed Travis Willingham's voice while watching the OVA.
>> ARTICLE
Aye aye Cptn! You have convinced me, that's for sure! Dub it is!
>> ARTICLE
Most of Funimations stuff has really good dubs, especially when it comes to scripts.

I loved Ginkos dub voice. I mean it's Roy mustang FFS

Question Mr. Garlock,

How would you recommend watching this show? I've heard around here the past few days that the show is pretty episodic, and doesn't stand up well to marathoning. Would you recommend watching maybe 1 episode per-day or something to avoid that problem? Or do you think it's ok to marathon. I'm just trying to get the full experience here.
>> ARTICLE
It's true that the show is episodic - each episode is a single story contained in itself, with no threads being tied between besides the presence of Ginko, sometimes Adashino and the setting. I began watching it at a pace of 2-3 a day, but after seeing how much I didn't want it to end, I slowed down to 1 a day. Now, I've saved the last 9 episodes of the show for special occasions (yes, I haven't finished the show, but 17 episodes is enough to know how good it is.) Personally, I think marathoning it is an injustice to the show, and it's not really needed; there's nothing you need to keep track of between episodes, so you can drop it for a few months, pick it back up and you're none the worse for it. 
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good then. I think I'll just start watching a few episodes at a time. I have till spring to get through them all so I think I'll be ok. 
>> ARTICLE
This channel is not available in your country.

So I guess Funimation doesn't care if I pirate their shows then? Seriously region locking is just one of those ways to get rid of customers.
>> ARTICLE
You will end up with a higher quality product anyways... Most likely hilariously enough... 
>> ARTICLE
It's not Funimations fault, they only have the rights to North America.

If you really want to point fingers you should be pointing them at your regional distributor. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for all the links! I've been meaning to watch it for a while. I'll probably watch season 1 and the OVA as season 2 is starting...
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone who has read the manga for Mushishi let me know whether it is likely that the second season will cover the rest of the source material? Did the first season cover approximately half? It looks like it's only 10 volumes so between the two seasons and the OVA that should be doable, but it really depends on how many chapters are covered per episode.
>> ARTICLE
Funimation is possible the worst company when it comes to region restrictions.
>> ARTICLE
Cool. Will watch tomorrow. 
>> ARTICLE
This is one of my favorite animes. Just watched it on CrunchyRoll. That was nice, I want to re-watch the originals now

And added it to my queue so it will show up as soon as it starts in April.

Announcer: After a series of staggering flops, Rule#34 animators assembled in the anime studio in late 2016 for a session with famed producer willsolvit. And, luckily for us, the cameras were rolling

[ dissolve to anime studio ] 

Willsolvit : Alright, guys, I think we're ready to lay this first animated scene. By the way, my name is Willsolvit . Yes, the Willsovit. And I gotta tell you: fellas.. you have got what appears to be a dynamite perversion in hentai

Sauske:Coming from you, Will, that means a lot.

Toro : Yeah. I mean, you're Willasolvit!

Niko : This is incredible!

Bubba: I can't believe willsolvit  digs our hentai!

Willsolvit: Easy, guys.. I put my pants on just like the rest of you -- one leg at a time. Except, once my pants are on, I make money. [ the animators laughs ] Alright, here we go. "Kurayani; hentai special" -- take one. Animate it [ he exits into the office ]

Sauske: Alright! One, two, three, four... 

[ The group starts animating: "Bubba starts with the background, Sauske with the hentai girl , and Takamura animates in tentacles... ]

Sauske: [ distracted by takamura's immense tentacles] Okay! Wait! Wait! Stop! [ the group stops animating ] Um, Willsolvit, could you come in here for a minute, please?

Willsolvit: [ stepping out of the office ] That... that was gonna be a great scene. Guys, what's the deal?

Sauske: Uh, are you sure that was looking okay?

Willsolvit: I'll be honest.. fellas, it was looking great. But.. I could've used a little more tentacles. So.. let's take it again.. and, Takamura?

Takamura: Yeah?

Willsolvit: Really explore the the tentacles in the girl this time. 

Takamura: You got it, Willsolvit. 

Willsolvit: I mean, really.. explore the holes.I like what I'm looking. Animate it 

[ the group starts animating again, as Takamura animates tentacles more obscene than the last, gyrating this tentacle on the exposed belly of the hentai girl. In the office. Willsolvit is smiling to keep from laughing. Before the session is interrupted, Takamura  puts a tentacle in one of her ears and out her nose]

Sauske: Okay, wait! Stop! Stop! Will, I'm sorry, could you come back in here, please?

Willsolvit: [ stepping out of The office ] Fellas.. now, we just wasted two good scenes! This last one was even better than the first!

Sauske:Well, it's just that I find Takamura's tentacle playing distracting! I don't know, if I'm the only one, I'll shut up.

Toro: Nah, it was pretty rough.

Takamura: You know, I could pull it back a little, if you'd like.

Willsolvit : Not too much, though! I'm telling you, fellas -- you're gonna want that tentacle in the ear!

Takamura : You know what? It's fine. Let's just do the thing. 

Willsolvit : Okay, Roll it.

Sauske : One, two, three, four... 

[ the animators starts the anime once more, with Takamura animating tentacles right next to Sauske's hentai girls ear until Deletes it and throws the mouse]

Sauske: [ stopping the anime again, fighting Takamura ] COME ON, Takamura!! 

Takamura: NO, YOU COME ON!! 

Willsolvit : [ running out of the office again ] Guys, y knowthatthatit doesn't work for me. I gotta have more tentacles!

Niko: [ grabs Takamura's shirt ] Don't blow this for us, Takamura!

Bubba: [ cracks up ] Quit... quit being so selfish, Takamura!

Takamura: Can I just say one thing?

Willsolvit : Sure, baby! Just say it!

Takamura : I'm standing here, staring at hentai producing legend Willsolvit !

Willsolvit : The tentacle of the walk, baby!

Takamura  And if Willsolvit wants more tentacles, we should probably give him more tentacles!

Willsolvit : Say it, baby!

Takamura : And, bubba, you are right - I am being selfish. But the last time I checked, we don't have a whole lot of anime with tentacles through the ear and out the nose.

Willsolvit : I gotta have more tentacles, baby!

Takamura : And I'd be doing myself and every member of this anime group, if I didnt animate the HELL out of tentacles

Willsolvit : Guess what? I got a fever! And the only prescription.. is more tentacles!

Takamura : Thank you, Will. But I think if... I think if I just leave... and maybe I'll come back later, and we can lay down the tentacles. [ starts to leave the studio ]

Willsolvit : Aw, come on, baby..

Sauske : Takamura, wait! Why don't you lay down that tentacle right now. With us. Together.

[ long pause while Takamura looks around at the group ]

Takamura : Do you mean that, Sauske?

Sauske : Oh, yeah. 

Toro: He speaks for all of us.

Takamura : Thank you.

Willsolvit : Babies.. before we're done here.. y'all be wearing gold-plated tentacle chains.

Niko : [ confused ] What does that mean?

Willsolvit : Never question Willsolvit ! Animate it! [ exits back to office ] 

[ Takamura picks up the fallen mouse and high-fives the animator before getting into position ] 

Sauske : One, two, three, four... 

[ the animators starts up again, this time Takamura  animating in tune with the group . Close-up on Takamura as he makes the most detailed tentacle ever seen in hentai to freeze-frame with graphic: "In Memoriam: Takamura: 1980-2020" ]

Invest in a Slam Dunk remake.

And adaptations of Vagabond, 20th century boys, berserk (without cg), more Hajime no Ippo

And remakes of anime that didn't do justice to their source material
>> ARTICLE
I would literally sell my soul to you to turn the rest of the Spice and Wolf novels into anime
>> ARTICLE
Yes can't wait for the Berserk anime (although it has cg).
>> ARTICLE
100 million would be nowhere near enough for all those remakes.
>> ARTICLE
What about the money generated from successful titles, we can keep the cycle going
>> ARTICLE
Im drooling at the thought of a Vagabond anime adaptation, why is this not a real thing yet?
>> ARTICLE
How come 20th Century Boys hasn't gotten an adaptation? Was it not popular in Japan because it's high rated on MAL
>> ARTICLE
It was very popular in Japan. It's just not an easy show to make into a successful anime in this day and age. There's not much fanservice or action (even the action scenes are more about drama than cool fighting), a lot of the focus is on mystery and suspense, the individual characters don't sell much merch, etc. The live-action movies were decent, but they didn't have enough time to do justice to the manga. An anime adaptation would have to be at the very least 48 episodes without a pause, and the industry currently prefers to do single-cour seasons so that would be a very hard project to sell.

Also it's complete. Very few completed series get anime adaptations because the majority of anime is made to promote the more profitable manga/LNs and merchandise. Completed series really only get attention if they're enduring classics like Tezuka's work or if there's a live-action movie coming out to promote like Parasyte.
>> ARTICLE
I love you. Add Pluto in there and you're my favorite person ever.
>> ARTICLE
I'd help the animators unionize.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely this. 
You can produce few titles with a million, but the real issue lies in the industrial structure.
For example, (broadcast station) take a large portion of fundings from , and this is one of the most unfair thing- can you imagine Walmart eat 1/3 of your product's total budget? That's absurd. 

Also the HR training could also be greatly improved simply by increased cash flow for anime studios.

Start a union is only OK in westerners perspective - oh hell the collective consciousness of Japanese would impress you a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
Why not just use the $100mil to start an animation studio, a broadcast station, and a publisher. From there, you basically control the whole chain of production. Instead of unionization, just such the industry dry of talent by paying the best. As studios go broke, just buy them out and make them exclusive to your stations. 
>> ARTICLE
Make a thread on Reddit and make the top idea. I'm onto you op.

>> ARTICLE
After converting USD to JPN I'd get around 11 billion yen. Assuming each anime would cost 1 billion yen for 26 episodes I would get to do 11 series/seasons..


1. Spice and Wolf season 3 just to make this subreddit super happy (Keep the same studio)

2. Masamune-kun's Revenge adaptation (PA Works)

3. Abnormal-kei Joshi adaptation (Just because it's a major "what the fuck." I'd choose SHAFT for animation.)

4. Oukoku Game/Kingdom Game adaptation (Cause I really love this anime. I would throw in extra money to make sure it gets an anime original plot after volume 2 or 3 since it doesn't seem to have any more volumes... I'd choose Brain's Base for the animation.)

5. Rosario+Vampire reboot from the beginning following the manga more closely (like no fucking deviations or cutting out a lot of the plot/dark stuff. I want it to follow the manga as closely as possible, even if I gotta pay extra. I suppose keep the same studio.)

6. Fate Strange Fake anime adaptation (Ufotable obvs)

7. Girls in the Wild's anime adaptation (JC Staff?)

8. Puella Magi Suzune Magica adaptation (would probably take 12 eps or less so I get an extra adaptation to make. I'd choose SHAFT.)

9. Sekirei season 3 or a reboot, depending on how far it deviated from the manga. I haven't read the manga, nor have I finished season 2. Cause of that I don't know what to do here. (I guess keep the same studio.)

10/11. Gakkou Gurashi reboot with seasons 1 and 2 OR season 2 and 3  (Keep the same studio.)


12. Not sure. Would do Chaos;Head reboot, but at the same time I want it to have a lot of episodes so that it's not rushed. I guess first part could be 13 episodes since I have that many left over and then if I profit enough from that and or everything else I could make more seasons. Maybe White Fox since they did Steins;Gate?)


>> ARTICLE
Now, you say Spice and Wolf Season 3 would make us happy, but that'd be a temporary fix. I wouldn't be satisfied until all the LNs were adapted properly.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, all the people just saying season 3 probably don't realize that it would just end on a worse point than season 2 did. Seasons 3-7? That would be sufficient.
>> ARTICLE
Give sequels or reboots to anime that deserve them.

Pay the animators well, and invest heavily into creating programs that recognize talent and work above and beyond the ordinary.

Hire more animators so as to relieve those that are already overworked.

Create a review board for the creation of new shows that encourages risk-taking, and provides funding packages for those more promising in terms of creativity (shallow harem LN adaptations get fuck all)
>> ARTICLE
I would probably also encourage globalization of the anime industry. Selling more copies in more languages across the globe could reduce the per unit cost and still end up making animation studios more money, and in turn, make the lives of animators easier.

[Three Kingdoms?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms_(TV_series\)) I am watching this right now and it's fucking epic. It blows every anime I saw out of the water in terms of depth, strategy, compassion, politics and characters.

I would 100% recommend it.

Everyone who likes LotGH should give it a try, 3 Kingdoms is truly an epic tale of political intrigues, ambition, deception and the rise and fall of heroes affecting the realm of ancient China. Shows like LotGH and Game of Thrones took clearly inspiration of it but they don't come close to it's complexity and depth.

Especially Cao Cao's character blows my mind.

100m would be enough to fund...around 600 anime episodes.

* The episodes would be properly paced, reaching a total of 80-90 episodes.

[Toaru Series](https://redd.it/1kuqwe) overhaul!!!!:

1. Reboot of Index: Better pacing and would run to completion, rather than being broken down into seasons. It would incorporate Road to Endymion, The Miracle of Endymion (minus the non-canon retcon), and Index SP. Would collaborate with Kamachi to iron out inconsistencies and such.

2. Reboot of Railgun: Completely faithful and would incorporate the side stories A Certain Vending Machine's Proof of Existence, Liberal Arts City, and Shopping Mall Demonstration. Would cover the Level Upper arc through the Daihaseisai arc (assuming it would be made right now). Would collaborate with Kamachi to iron out inconsistencies and such.

3. Index SS: Side story anime which would cover Kanzaki SS and Necessarius SS.

3. New Testament anime: Would cover the GREMLIN saga.

If there's still money left over, then:

1. The Voynich Hotel by Shaft

2. Full and faithful adaptation of Negima!.

3. Medaka Box Minus and Not Equals arcs

5 season run of a certain raunchy manga that caters to a niche audience.

Pokemon Anime that follows the Manga.

I'd use it to create a studio dedicated to only producing original content. No adaptations, remakes, etc. Set everything up under an audition/prize system where creators are given the chance to pitch and possibly create the series/film/one-shot that they want with no concern made for the commercial viability of it (e.g. no need to fit into a given episode count or length, no content restrictions, etc.) with an intent to distribute it along an OVA model. Sale will be simultaneous worldwide with subtitles and no intent to dub it into any language other than the native language of the creator.

I want fresh ideas aimed at an adult audience, not a proliferation of what can be cross-promoted or will sell Blu-Rays to the entrenched fanboys.
>> ARTICLE
I would

- Remake the Fate route of Fate Stay Night in the style of UBW and Zero

- Give The Devil Is A Part Timer! a few more seasons

- Remake Angel Beats! into the 25 episode show it deserved to be.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely remaking the Fate route for me. Would make it a lot easier for me to just recommend people to just watch the Fate route then go on from there rather then them having to decide between watching the DEEN 2006 adaptation, Ufotable UBW, F/Z.

The Devil is a Part Timer! is such a nice sitcom-esque  type of anime that I'd definitely watch that.
>> ARTICLE
Full adaptation of index, and spice & wolf
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
I'd probably spend it on Sailor Moon.
>> ARTICLE
Get Tokyo Ghoul a proper adaptation. It's my favorite manga so I'd probably try to get madhouse to do it, as they tend to make their work really faithful to the manga they adapt. 
>> ARTICLE
The money will mainly go into improving the labor conditions of animators, lower-end studio interns/production crew, and lesser-known seiyuu. These are the people who keep the industry alive, and they deserve to be treated with the respect worthy of all the hard work and passion they put into creating what we love. 

A follow-up part of this injection of money will be efforts to improve official access to anime and manga for the ignored parts of the global fandom. Increased streaming rights and merch sales in Europe, Latin America, [mainland Asia](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3mhrun/when_japanese_anime_inspired_a_subculture_in_india/?) and [Africa](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3by6m3/this_is_what_its_like_to_live_in_zambia_and_love/) will inject even more money into the industry, easing concerns about the possibly declining numbers of fans within Japan. 

As for a personal project I'd fund? Probably a WWII anime about the Asia-Pacific theater, which portrays the crimes of Imperial Japan in mainland China and Korea. The more it pisses off Japan's modern-day historical revisionists and neo-militarists, the better. 

And another personal goal of mine with such money would be to improve the livelihoods of hose involved in localizing anime for my part of the world. It'd be great if voice acting in anime dubs had higher pay, with more unionized actors involved.

Nichijou season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Remember Kantai Collection and how shit it was? I give it one last stand before it fades from popularity. A new adaptation that accurately follows the pacific theatre, warfare and casualties true to history.

Hibiki loses all her sisters then becomes a war spoil. Yukikaze is chastised by fairies(sailors) because ships who sortie with her dies. Poi dies in a suicide charge. Akagi and Kaga endures being on fire for an entire night then gets scuttled.

Then a set of OVAs that details the war aftermath and surviving ships. Operation Crossroad, ships coping with civilian life, Yukikaze becomes Tang Yang etc.

The point is I really wanted Kantai Collection to go full Saving Private Ryan.

I hope that they will turn into the "retro studio" taking old and maybe forgotten Manga/Anime and giving them a proper remake
>> ARTICLE
They're going to be doing Jojo until it's done, or they shut down, man. Hopefully the former, since I can't imagine part 4 coming up here bombing too hard, and if they make it to part 5, they've got the money from that to push to the end.

Japan loves part 5, an adaptation could be steaming garbage and it'd still sell hotcakes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Araki loves Part 4 and Part 5 is beloved both in Japan and Italy (which is a good market for anime, the new Lupin had some Italy-exclusive episodes). I think the biggest hurdle will be Part 6 (since it's good, but female-focused and unpopular in Japan). Steel Ball Run will print money once they get through Part 6.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they need tbh. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure looks pretty superb if you ask me.

Or did you just mean give it to them for their hard work/dedication? If so, I agree.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, the things I could do. 

First I'd fund the development of catgirls. 

Then I'd bribe Anno to return to the industry to create the crossover movie we've all been waiting for- 

> Eva 1.23: One of these Things is (Not) Like the Others

And finally I'd use the change to lure Miyazaki out of retirement to create the Ghibli-sponsored masterpiece *Valkyrie Mermaid 2: Totoro Boogaloo*.

Oh, the things I could do.
>> ARTICLE
I'd force Miyazaki to fully adapt Nausica.
>> ARTICLE
You overestimate the power of $100m. 
>> ARTICLE
> First I'd fund the development of catgirls

Just brilliant, i haven't thought of that 
>> ARTICLE
Man, I'd probably come off 20m to get the rights to Macross from Harmony Gold. Fuck Robotech.

With the 80m left...I'd probably waste it on foolishness lol.   Get some remakes of anime I thought didn't get proper adaptations. Air Gear. Flame of Recca.  Someone earlier said 100m could fund 600 eps.   I'm too lazy to check but we'll make that as a base.   I blew 20m on that Macross thing so I've got 80m which would only make 480 eps.

A proper adaptation of a finished Manga should be 4-5 chapters an ep. We'll say 4 so it can't be rushed. 

- Air Gear's 90 eps.
- Flame of Recca's 80 more.
- Mahou Sensei Negima(!)'s another 90.
- Legend of the Legendary Heroes deserves at least an 70 ep remake.

That's...330 eps? OK, I'd probably burn another 70 on making an anime version of Green Lantern since clearly DC's not interested in my favorite character anymore. :(

As for the remaining money? Probably toss it towards creating merch for everything I just made, and hopefully get enough to turn a profit.   If not, I'd adapt the rest of Medaka Box 'cause that deserves an ending.   Would probably take 30 eps to finish it off.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with Harmony Gold. It needs to be freed. But their owners are holding onto it just to be spiteful so it will be difficult. It's  crazy that it's owners might have to die of old age in order for its successors to lose that personal vendetta in order for negotiations to even happen.
>> ARTICLE
Reinject those 100 million in that company that made those pencils of whatever color they needed to be so animators never ever run out of them. 

Alternatively, distribute it equally between the studios so they can have it easy for a little while at least... Hopefully they'd learn a thing or two about not overworking their employees and give them a fixed salary instead of a per-drawing thing salary while they're in an OK-ish situation...
>> ARTICLE
I'd give it to the studio's who I think would best be able to make an original work or to not be bound to "what sells". I'd want them to have the freedom to make something they love as the creators rather than something we love as mindless consumers. I'm so fucking tired of every season being one shitty LN adaptation after the other.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, that decision happens because they need to. Not because they want to keep making low budget LN adaptations.
>> ARTICLE
use all that money to give togashi all the fucking money he needs for treatment so there'll never be any more hiatuses. 

and give the leftovers to madhouse to animate the damn manga

Soul Eater remake that's all I want. Please!
>> ARTICLE
I might make an anime studio that is directly linked to world wide stream and merchandise distribution channels and help the animators have the budget, time and wages to be able to make great work. So even after my money dries out, there is a fighting chance for them to be self sustaining.

Anime contentwise, there are a lot of terrific classics that never got a chance, some anime original stories there could be made. Even for some more schlocky shows, they can have a lot of budget to make them pop like Kill la Kill or Needless. 
>> ARTICLE
Pay the Hyouka author to actually finish more volumes and then have them animated.
>> ARTICLE
god of highschool adaptation and tower of god
>> ARTICLE
According to /u/UnavailableUsername_, 100 million is enough for 600 anime episodes. And according to Digibro, even things like Ufotable's UBW anime actually didn't have a budget that was way bigger than normal, just a talented, well-treated staff and a good production schedule. So I'd definitely fund a new season of *A Certain Magical Index* just because I need to see the [Index LN](/n "World War III") arc animated. 

Beyond that, I'd fund a lot of experimental shows, works by up-and-and coming creators who need to make a name for themselves, and definitely the works of creators who don't want to bend over backwards to force things like fanservice and creepy pandering and the like in order to increase the marketability of their work. I'm not in it for the cash, I'm in it as a patron of the arts! 

My conditions for funding would include that the animators are not to be given crazy work schedules. I would also arrange for a good portion of the money that would go back to me as an investor to go to the animators at the bottom of the pecking order as a thank you.

is it bad? 

just curious, cause im pretty close to timeskip
>> ARTICLE
The anime catches up to the manga around that point and starts spreading the content thin. Instead of covering 3 or 4 chapters per episode, they do one chapter per episode. 

The first 5-7 minutes are usually recap scenes from the previous episode. There's a lot of stills of character's reactions (looks like a slideshow). 

If you can marathon through a bunch of episodes, you might not notice it as badly. But if you are watching week to week, episodes feel very slow, like not much is happening.

Do it incredibly well, while reinforcing the fact that it's a second season, just to drive people crazy. Maybe have the last episode delayed in the same way for no reason just to make people think something bad is going to happen but nothing does.

I would create a new studio that has ways to recognize the talent of the animators and pay them stable money for how much they work. On this line I would try to keep most of the staff in the studio by giving them benefits. Also have the option for the staff to live in a boarding house so they could spend less money in transit, housing fees, etc. Also try to change the way to make money is needed in the anime industry. Currently merchandise is the main income source but they do not make enough money from it. Some ideas for raising income of the profit from making the anime would include sharing rights with a online streaming website and try to go global for sales in blue rays, figures, etc. I would try to partner with crunchyroll or any other good streaming website with a good player, putting content onto youtube like op's first scenes from the anime we make and instead of sharing rights per show attempt to make a deal for a certain price a year with someone like cr allowing them to get 100% of the anime we make. Also trying to make the sale of merchandise a global selling point would be my main priority for making profit. Anime is spreading and with the right staff we could make more profit with lowering the price of bluerays, waifu pillows, figures, etc. in a global market. Lastly with the youtube content we could have ads on the channel to increase profits. This would take a lot of time to build up money but funimation's top video has 4 million views. This is not much money but it is free advertisement for people to watch the ops, see funny scenes and enjoy the anime without actually watching it. I feel like currently it is hard for studios to do much of this because of how much money they have, but with 100 million you would be easily able to take this risk.

What the anime industry needs is more stability. The biggest issue with anime in the next few years I see is stability. If the staff is not being paid properly how many great animators, writers, etc are going to go into the industry.

tldr: Pay the workers proper wages, increase ways to make money.

Sidenote: I know nothing about business so some of my ideas may be really stupid.

100 million can go a long way.  I could make 3-4 shows for that amount.

I would get the best artists and producers from Production IG and Xebec together to make an original 26 episode fantasy series (based on a script I already have).  With the story being open for sequels.

Then I would try to get the original team (BONES and the writers) together to make a second season of Angelic Layer.  Though it has been about 15 years since the show aired, I would pay to get the first season repeated on TVTokyo before the second season aired.

Then I'd help pay for new seasons of Kimi Ni Todoke and Hajime no Ippo.

If all of these investments worked out, I would continue to work with Production IG/Xebec to make unique series.  As well as try to get the original team from JCStaff together to remake Lost Universe.  Leading into a new Slayers series.

From then on, it would jusy snowball into tons of unique projects.  I'd probably help fund any future Junichi Sato or Mamoru Oshii projects.

Reminds me of [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3r85y0/if_you_had_1_billion_dollars_for_anime/) I posted an answer to it [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3r85y0/if_you_had_1_billion_dollars_for_anime/cwmgsy7) if you're interested.

$100 million is more limiting, though. I think I'd invest most of it into developing more advanced animation algorithms (to be released open-source), in order to reduce production costs for the industry and lower the barrier to entry. Hopefully that would result in more anime being made and with better animation quality. However, I might also set aside some for 'X-prizes', rewards offered to anime producers who make the kind of shows I want to see. In particular I'd like to reward strong endings (none of this lame unfinished adaptation shit) and art styles that I like (nice angular late 2000s stuff). Maybe I'd set up a permanent fund that pays out prizes every year, like the Nobels. Hopefully that could influence the industry to make better stuff.

Honest answer:

Pushing a law for imposing KyoAni real salary to animators style to all anime studios.

Alternative is founding a new Anime studio focused on yuri and moe, and using the KyoAni system, for pushing the industry in that direction.

The horrors of the real life of an animator in the anime industry is really a dark spot on the anime industry and needs to go away.
>> ARTICLE
i agree with you, animators need to be paid a more reasonable amount. A lot of people here said producing more moe, it seems like i'm missing the appeal or something. I dont hate slice of life moe shows but if anything i think the industry needs to go in the other direction and produce more interesting non "Cute Girls" shows. 
Some Yuri is fine though.

I like moe yuri, for that part.

And if moe/cgdct shows are growing, is because they are watched and popular, nothing wrong in it.

I just finished that a few days ago after much pressure from a friend.  I'm so glad I did.  I'm also really proud of myself for figuring out that [Steins;Gate Ep. 16](/s "Suzuha was Daru's daughter") an episode before that was shown. 

I've since started watching Fullmetal Alchemist after much pressure from this same friend.  I've made it to the end of episode 16 just now.  I'm so glad to actually have free time now that exams are over and it's the holidays.
>> ARTICLE
About your episode 16 spoiler, I did the same thing. It's probably one of my favorite aspects of Steins;Gate  it's an anime that just makes you think while you're watching it. It's just so immersive.

One of the greatest things about Steins; Gate is that you will probably miss some things when you're watching it for the first time, but when re-watching it you catch these little things that foreshadow later events.

**Shinsekai yori** - 25/25

Dropped after one of the first few episodes back when it aired since it didn't seem all that interesting. Finally decided to finish it since everyone was giving it rave reviews (subreddit logo was also made me curious) and it was absolutely fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
I stumbled across it back around February. It's a total gem, thrilled that it's getting more exposure. Reminds me of slow-paced western science fiction(ish) in the vein of The Giver. 
>> ARTICLE
Finished [Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) this week! Wow, what a series.

I really liked it up until End Of Evangelion. The old art style didn't bother me at all, I think the show still looks great and it doesn't seem to have aged to bad. I really liked the fight scenes, especially the one with Eva-02 in EoE. The characters were great too, as was the OST.

I was so confused after End of Evangelion that I didn't know what to think about the series. I didn't know if it deserved a 10/10 or a 1/10. After reading up on some stuff and after watching some videos explaining things, I can say I understand most of it now and I think the series is really clever.

Overall, I'd give it a 10/10, it was a great action series that evolved into something really fantastic near the end. Only complaint I have is that it should have asked me out to dinner before it mindfucked me.
>> ARTICLE
Are you planning to watch the Rebuild movies also? They're essentially all the cool action without most of the substance and with a higher budget; good for cleaning your palette.
>> ARTICLE
I do plan on doing so, yes. I'm just iffy about the CGI on the Evangelions... Do they use it for every action scene or only some? I've only seen three clips, every one was CGI.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I also finished NGE recently, and the ending really bothered me because I did not know what the fuck was happening. People told me that the movie wrapped everything up, but the only that the movie did was leave me even more questions.

**Puella Magi Madoka Magica Episodes 2-4**

I picked it back up after /u/Novasylum I should probably get it over with. [Here's a link to my writeup on these first episodes](http://i.imgur.com/5cgvDi7.png)

Here's hoping I have fun with every episode after (finally)!

**Psycho-Pass Episode 7**

Still confused about how I feel about the utopia/dystopia that the world of PP presents. On the one hand, the figurative (and in today's episode, literal) death of creativity and the removal of natural suffering has led to a degradation of the human condition; the focus on punishment over therapy for those who Sybil system deems to be a threat to social order. On the other hand, I can't say that the purposeful spread of death and suffering that I think Makishima is implied to advocate is right, either. It's complicated...

...I guess it's not supposed to have an easy answer, huh?

**Tegami Bachi (Letter Bee) Episodes 1 - 10**

I sort of got tired of cycling between two Urobuchi shows, so I went to a random number generator, and picked the first show from my PTW list that matched a number.

It's a nice shounen, I guess? A Studio Pierrot production, the show is about a child and his desire to become a 'Letter Bee' - a member of the national postal service - after being saved by one in his youth. 

It's pretty by the books. It follows many of the same, fairly typical shonen tropes - protag doesn't want to hurt people, is a bright-eyed, naive youth, makes friends everywhere, has a secret ability that makes him special, etc. - and in that sense it's really nothing special. The art is also...well, low budget. Let's just leave it at that. It's not ugly, but it's clear Pierrot was working on a small budget with this show. It also doesn't have great writing, although it does take cares to not get too melodramatic or too preachy. 

But there is one thing that the show has a lot of: [heart.](http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s106/DaHaloChick/Blog%20Photos/Bleach%20Troll%20Blog/theheart.jpg) 

"Heart, you say, Garlock? I never learned about heart in my seminars on literary criticism!" And you're right, heart is an undefinable thing and is as far from an objective criticism of any show as you could possibly get. But still, that's all I can really describe it as. Thematically, the show is about connecting people; the letters are always described as feelings of the heart, and the Letter Bees themselves use magic guns powered by their heart to fight the beasts they encounter on their courier routes. Perhaps that's what lends it's strength? That it's so focused on thoughts, wants and desires of the heart that it resonates with the viewer (or at least me.)

The show is very innocent and heart-felt. Though the writing isn't particularly clever, it is rather charming and earnest. There isn't a drop of cynicism, but at the same time, it's not saccharine. It's just very...genuine. 

I think I needed this show. It's not cerebral or dense enough to make me want to take notes, but at the same time, it doesn't feel like empty calories. I probably won't rate this show higher than a 6 or 7, but I can't say I'm disliking what I'm watching.

Are you going to read the Berserk manga now that you finished the anime series?

I'm not sure. I'm not that big a fan of reading manga, but I also want to see more of the story. 


I probably will, just not yet
>> ARTICLE
I personally haven't seen of read it yet, but heard extremely good things about it, so I think I will watch and read it during downtime (watching 6+ shows atm).
>> ARTICLE
If you choose to read the manga, you probably won't regret it especially if you liked the movies/anime. It's my personal favorite, the only downside is that the author is taking forever to write the next chapter.
>> ARTICLE
I had the opposite experience. A friend introduced me to the films, which I thought were fantastic. I've been reading the manga because I liked them so much and it's just... incredibly dissapointing. It turns into directionless shonen drivel after a while. There are still "shit that's cool" moments, but not much compelling happens after the golden age arc. It reminds me of every other serialized 900 issue manga. I was quite let down.
>> ARTICLE
I like it more after the Golden Age, personally. Became a true seinen manga in my mind.
>> ARTICLE
I'll have to agree that yes, after the Golden Age Arc the quality dropped, but I still found it good.
>> ARTICLE
Given the Anime's cliffhangy ending, I'm surprised you haven't already rushed to read the manga! It's absolutely worth reading the manga, make sure to start from the beginning instead of where the anime leaves off, there's some things left out of the anime that are important to building character.

 Also be warned, it might be a bit jarring to go from the anime to the manga, after the Golden Age arc, a comic relief character is introduced, and this can be a little jarring given the show's dark nature.
>> ARTICLE
I started and finished Berserk this past week as well, and wanted closure so I tried the manga however I found that I really didn't care for [how the focused is towards supernatural/horror/demon compared to how the anime was 23/25 medieval fantasy](/spoiler)

I still have the the 3 movies to watch, but I have a feeling that I won't really care for more than the Golden Age Arc and the manga might not be for me. 
>> ARTICLE
It really does become more of a horror manga than medieval fantasy. I actually really liked that, but I can see why it might feel like a bit of a bait and switch to someone who started with the anime. In the Manga, there is an arc at the beginning that sets up the demon shit right away, but in the anime it starts from the Golden Age arc.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren 12/12**

I had high hopes going in after the first season, and I have to say that this was a huge let down. After I finished watching, I started reading the discussion threads here on /r/anime to see what other people have said, and it was cathartic to realize that I wasn't the only one that was disappointed. 

[Chuunibyou S2 spoilers](/s "After establishing in S1 that Rikka and Yuuta's relationship has progressed past friends, it remained stagnant for 12 whole episodes. It's like any form of character development was thrown out of the window. After 12 episodes, we finally get the big buildup to the kiss only to get blue-balled by the cliche phone interruption. But hey, at least Chimera had kittens.")

[Shichimiya Satone spoilers](/s "It's also usually not a good sign when your favorite character for a season is considered a side character.  I just felt so bad for her after episodes 9 and 10.  I'm usually a proponent for the canon couple, and even though I think Rikka and Yuuta are right for each other, I still think that Satone is more compatible. She has much more emotional growth than Rikka and even pushes Rikka towards Yuuta despite her own feelings. She's just a tragic character, and her arc was my favorite for the season.")

**Nanana's Buried Treasure (11/11)** (Watched 6-11 this week) 

This show was fun, but I think the lack of a proper ending ruined the whole enchilada for me. 6/10. Felt like a waste of time. If it gets a second season, I'll probably watch it but this ending just left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Meh.

**Monster (51/74)** (Watched 49-51 this week)

I don't know why but this show bores me for some reason. I love the story, but I seem to only be watched 3 or 4 episodes a week. Oh well. I'm almost done.... kinda. I hope to finish by the thread for the 27th. Mainly because I'll be watching season 2 of.....

**Fate/Zero (13/13)** (Watched 1-13 this week)

My co-worker/friend suggested this to me, saying it was 'the only anime he ever enjoyed.' Well, with him putting in his two weeks notice the other day, I realized I should watch it. This was great. That being said, I would have been so mad if I was watching this when it was airing. Total cliffhanger at the end of "Season 1." The whole idea of the show is awesome. I was genuinely surprised when [Season 1 spoilers](#s "Caster showed up and started acting so nice towards that kid, letting him go out of Ryuunsuke's house, and then BAM, Caster kills the kid. I was flipping out. So well executed."). Rider best girl. Can't wait to watch the rest!

**My Neighbor Totoro (Movie)** 

Only my second Ghibli movie since starting anime.  I'm starting to get the hype around these guys, they make fun movies. I really enjoyed watching it, but it seems like every Ghibli movie starts way too slow. That being said, it was fun! I'll give it a 8.75/10.

**Toradora!**: 9/10. Almost perfect, and easily my favourite Romance anime. Quite a feat since I don't usually like Romance anime.

Currently watching **Gunbuster**, but that 80's animation and sound is making it very tough going.

Not exactly \*this past week* but what I finished this morning at 5:39 AM was **Cowboy Bebop**.   

Man, was it a blast. To be honest, when I first watched the first few episodes, I was sure the series could only be 12 or 13 episodes, since the visuals were so stunning there was *no way* they could keep it up without a massive budget. Except they did. Also, I loved [Spoilers]( /s "how very very subtle the romance was, if it was there at all. So much of the ending was left to the viewer's imagination, such as Faye and Jet's reaction so Spike's death.")    

I gladly give this a **10/10**. The episodic nature of the series didn't hold it back in any respect. If you haven't seen it, do. Its Sci-Fi is actually fairly plausible, and sticks to its rules. Guns don't have infinite ammo, and it's one of the very very few things I've seen that actually have RCS on spaceships.

**Maoyu** (12/12) It's only 12 episodes long, and it feels a little rushed.  It has a few interesting concepts, but the execution is off.

**Love Live** (marathoned both seasons + ova)

First of all, *I don't really dig idol anime* and hell I even dropped Idolmaster, AKB48 and Wake Up Girls. But this one, well I'll be damned goddammit. After finishing first season, I definitely felt the labor of love Sunrise put into this. Season 2 toned down the drama but blasted away with tons of music which is damn enjoyable. You want to see anime characters dancing to pop songs and *having fun* while doing it (not to mention many of the songs in the anime is almost full length)? Look no further and watch this. Also, prepare some tissues when bracing S2.
>> ARTICLE
>Also, prepare some tissues when bracing S2.

Cannot overstate enough. It may not be the same for everyone, of course, but the show really did suck me in in that way. 
>> ARTICLE
Honoka's father scene at the end of both season accurately depicts what I felt during those episodes. I wasn't prepared for that and it instantly broke me right at that moment.

Going to shamelessly cross post my /r/TrueAnime response

Didn't watch much this week because of the Dota 2 International, so all the time I had was sucked up by it or watching airing shows.

What I got around to

**Free! (12/12)**

It was...surprisingly good? I mean the fanservice was just as obnoxious as I thought it would be (seriously where are their nipples?), but the show still had that beautiful KyotoAni art going for it. The story wasn't anything too new, just the typical sports anime story of overcoming personal conflict with sports, this time the fear of falling off into obscurity and whatever the fuck is wrong with Haru. Not too much there but what is there sparkles.

**Nismemonogatari (3/11)**

Bakemonogatari seemed to be about 60% Arararararagi shooting shit with people, 30% helping the girls with their problems, and 10% creepy fanservice and weird stuff. Nisemonogatari so far has been like 50% shooting shit and 50% creepy fanservice and weird shit. I haven't gotten to the tooth brush scene yet! I'll keep trucking along through this, if only to see Monogatari Second Season considering how highly rated it is.

**Shinsekai Yori (1/25)**

Reminds me of that book by Lois Lowry, The Giver. Probably the whole simplistic village with very controlled method of how people advance in life thing. Gotta say, so far I'm feeling the hype. I love the art-style and the direction it seems to be taking, can't wait to see where it goes.
>> ARTICLE
The Giver is a great comparison for Shinsekai Yori; peeking into the darker side of a utopia. 
>> ARTICLE
**Monogatari SS**&mdash;In the middle of the Shinobu arc. "Are you Italian?" made me crack up and is probably my favorite line. I've greatly enjoyed all the stories so far. [Spoilergatari](/s "Really liked seeing Hanekawa and Senjougahara together. Hachikuji legal version. Sengoku losing her shit.") When I got into anime, I never thought I would enjoy watching people converse so much.

**D-Frag**&mdash;About halfway through this. I really like things with oddball, out of left field humor, and this show has it in spades. Every episode is full of laughs. Roka? Takao? I can't pick...

**Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko**&mdash;Only through the first arc. More Shaft goodness. [Spoilers -5](/s "I hope we haven't seen the last of Futon Erio.")

Thats a nice summary of Monogatari

**[Oreshura](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=14749)**

I seem to be going through a period of watching harem shows, and Oreshura is one of the better typical harem shows. The show is nice enough with some mild drama, but I really was able to get behind the romance within it. The fact that it ends fairly conclusively helps, but overall the themes of self identity and being able to be oneself were very nice. It was a decent watch.

**8/10**

**[Futakoi](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=125)**

You ever watch a harem show and just think, I wish there were more girls, but the artists were feeling lazy? That's Futakoi for you. Basically, Harem 101 but each girl has a twin. Nothing out of the ordinary at all, but it was nice enough. Aged pretty well, considering it's from like 11 years ago. 

**7/10**

**[Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=4744)**

Basically, I watched this because I heard Rie Kugimiya was good in it. Pity the show around it was pretty pants. Stopped after 5 episodes.

**[Henneko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15225/Hentai_Ouji_to_Warawanai_Neko.) (rewatch)**

Henneko is one of my favourite harem type shows, mainly because it really isn't your typical harem. Yes, all the girls are after Yokodera, but we get a focus on one relationship pretty much from the outset. From then on in, Yokodera helping the other girls is always affected by Tsukiko. 

On a second watch through, the bread crumb trail of the over arching plot is much more noticable, and I appreciated how the show used that to really bring in the weight of said issue. I really got behind the central relationship, and I found it rather lovely how the series wrapped up. 

**8/10 added to pile of fluffy jumper shows**
>> ARTICLE
Watching [**HeartCatch Precure**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7645/Heartcatch_Precure!) (finished ep 25). Decided to give this show because of the manga, [Shinozakisan Ki Wo Ota Shika Ni!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinozakisanKiWoOtaShikaNi), which they kept referencing it as PrePure. 

Surprisingly enough... I love it! It's essentially a kid's magical girl show, but with DBZ-like battles. That and I love the art style and transformations, despite the obvious merchandise advertisement lol. Cure Sunshine is ~~badass~~ cute too. *Real magical girls duke it out with fists!* 
>> ARTICLE
I've been really meaning to check that series out. I hear it's one of the better PreCures.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Nisekoi and was really disappointed by it. I have to finish stuff from the spring since I wasn't home for two weeks but Nisekoi was the one I watched sort of out of nowhere.
>> ARTICLE
Nisekoi is just tease.
Decided I wanted to get some closure and so I read the Manga.

It just gets worse...

At least the art-style is pretty and the characters aren't bad.

I finished Kokoro connect. Loved it. 10/10

I watched Eden of the East, it was good =)

Finished:

Kokoro Connect- I really liked it, I don't know why I waited so long.

K-on movie- I waited so long to watch this to because I didn't want the ride to end. It was worth it
>> ARTICLE
Finished Ga-Rei: Zero last night. Loved it.

And suddenly, rewatching the first episode of Tokyo ESP becomes a lot more depressing. I had only seen the first episode of Ga-Rei when I first watched it, so now when I realize that [Ga-Rei: Zero](/s "the two girls are the beginning were Kagura and Yomi... ;_;")
>> ARTICLE
I was watching [Kanon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/144/Kanon), [Air](http://myanimelist.net/anime/101/Air), and [Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka). 

Kanon and Air were rather confusing and disappointing, not nearly as enjoyable for me as Clannad and they followed the basic ideas behind them. Plus they were just...confusing at times.

Hyouka is hilarious and good fun. I like the lack of dramatic drama in place for real fun and a bit of regular intrigue that you could honestly believe a bunch of highschoolers could have. If you aren't particularly interesting in over the top romance, drama, adventure, or the supernatural, give it a try. I'm not nearly done yet, but I'm really enjoying this change of pace. 

I'm also rewatching [Clannad](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2167/Clannad) and hope it lives up to my initial impressions.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Haruhi (Melancholy and Disappearance), and now I'm feeling empty inside, such a great show. 

So now I'm torn between GitS:SAC, Spice and Wolf, Nisemonogatari, Kuroko no Basket and Tatami Galaxy (the ones I can watch but have not begun) to fill that void, but I don't know which one to watch, so in the meantime I'm rewatching Madoka.
>> ARTICLE
Watch Tatami Galaxy. It's a masterpiece, and almost none of /r/anime has seen it. It's a shame. 
>> ARTICLE
**Joshiraku** 2/13 - I'm certain about 90% of the jokes in this went completely over my head. But that's okay, because I still enjoyed it.  
Decided to watch this one cause of some picture someone put up somewhere on reddit(I think), and then someone recommended it to me when I wanted to watch something wordy.

**Shinryaku! Ika Musume** 1/12 - It took one gif to make me watch this. Just the one. I'd heard it before, but hadn't really a clue what it was about other than a girl who is a squid.  
I'll probably be slowly getting through this one, as there is a fair amount of stuff out there, OVAs, S2 and whatnot. It's about what I hoped it'd be though, so that's nice.

**Yama no Susume S1** All of it! - Prior to this season starting, I looked through the shows that were coming up, and saw S2 listed. I wasn't aware at the time that it was a short series, and I burnt through it all in one sitting. This was a really easy watch, and if you want something just to relax and watch, this certainly suits that bill nicely.

**Ai Mai Mi** All of it! - Same deal as Yama no Susume, at least in the reasoning for watching department. This was rather silly, and didn't make a single bit of sense. Pretty funny at times, definitely would suggest people give a look at these shorter series. I've so far found them more entertaining than full length ones, simply as I tend to get burnt out on 30-minute shows, and with about half of them they never get finished simply due to the commitment.

And not sure if this counts here, but I'm currently rewatching **Monogatari Series - Second Season**, and when I first watched it, I didn't find myself enjoying it as much as I had earlier seasons(particularly Bakemonogatari). With this rewatch, that most definitely isn't the case. Just a couple of hours ago finished the [Arc name spoilers, nothing more](/s "Shinobu Time arc"), and I only started this rewatch about 4 days ago, intending to go through maybe an episode each other day, to try and line it all up with Hanamonogatari starting up. That isn't quite working out.

Finished Clannad & Clannad After-story, which was an epic emotional journey :)

>> ARTICLE
I finished watching [Jormungand](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12413/Jormungand) and am half way (7/12) through season 2 now. It's very good all things considered.
>> ARTICLE
I watched [NANA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/877/Nana). It was suprisingly interesting considering I usually don't like slice of life animes. The characters really pulled me into the show and made the anime a lot more interesting. It's a lot more realistic than other romance animes.
>> ARTICLE
I finally got around to finish fucking **[Binbougami ga!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13535/Binbougami_ga!)**  and it was actually pretty funny. HanaKana in a not shy role is always good, the little parts of drama were acceptable and the references were Seitokai no Ichizon level.

Casshern Sins, FLCL, and currently in the middle of Black Lagoon.

Deadman Wonderland and now Durarara!!! :P
>> ARTICLE
**Ore no Imouto ga konna ni kawaii wake ga nai**  S1 + S2 + Specials (32 episodes)

I finally said 'fuck it' and dove into this series.  The premise was great and the Kyousuke / Kirino dynamic in season 1 reminds me so much of the Kyon / Haruhi relationship.  Haruhi is one of my top series so that was a great plus.  All the scenes of Kirino entering otaku mode were pretty adorable too.   

Season 2 though changed the dynamic entirely.  All of a sudden every single one of the female characters was inexplicably attracted to the MC even though they are all rich / super models.  What was a slice of life tsundere otaku comedy turned into a generic harem which pissed me off.  The ending was a total clusterfuck of wrong I should have seen coming.  Manami is the only girl in the cast with any sort of sense.  Overall though I liked it but the ending totally ruined it for me.

8/10

**Beyond the Boundary**  Last 6 episodes

This was a series Ive had on hold for the past few months but finally finished.  The last episodes had really great action but there was a bit too much hand-waving done about critical plot points for me to care about the actual story.  Still this series has great characters and fantastic animation (KyoAni) and I'm glad I finished it.  

8/10

**Log Horizon** 2/26

I've heard this series was really good but the first couple of eps seemed really generic.  Am I missing something?  Does it get good later?  I'm putting this one back on ice.

6/10

**Sengoku Otome: Momoiro Paradox** Last 4 eps

What's with all the rule 63 Nobunaga these days?  This is a light comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously.  I've always liked seeing how well normal people can fare in fantasy worlds and this one does it pretty well.  The ending was particularly satisfying.

7/10
>> ARTICLE
Man... Another manami bro. Hold the line. 
>> ARTICLE
Manami and Kuroneko are the only ships I see with any legitimacy.  The other 4 characters I just don't buy their motivation.  I heard Manami got a lot of hate for that confrontation at the end but she was 100% justified in trying to shine a light through that cloud of bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
Manami also gets a lot of hate for shit that was revealed in the LNs, which imo is entirely irrelevant to show watchers. 
>> ARTICLE
Log Horizon gets much better later on. At least it doesn't go SAO style. You do have to enjoy stuff like tactics and politics to truly enjoy the show.
>> ARTICLE
Really I haven't seen an MMO based anime since .hack but the genre seems pretty popular now with SAO, NGNL, and Accel World.  It made me want to try one of them but I might have chosen poorly.
>> ARTICLE
NGNL is not an MMO based game, that I can tell. It is really good anyway.

I found Log Horizon to be the best of the 3 you mentioned. In terms of story and characters, it is far superior than AW or SAO. It is has a very different tone from either of those since it is much more based on strategy and human interaction. It feels more "real".

If you prefer more action, AW is the next best choice, though many people don't like it. Finally, SAO, since it completely goes downhill after episode 3. This is personal opinion though. A lot of people can enjoy SAO even if it's story and characters are mostly not the best.
>> ARTICLE
>I've heard this series was really good but the first couple of eps seemed really generic. Am I missing something? Does it get good later?

Yeah, the first episodes are a bit generic with the pervy knight and the tsundere ninja and their quest of trying to save the loli, but it gets much better later on, and luckily those "hilarious" antics between those two stop soon.
>> ARTICLE
How much farther is the "later on" part?  This is a pretty common problem with series that are known to get good later on.  It's hard to tell when you should give up.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 5-6 I'd say. In episode 5 you begin to learn more about the world and the mechanics of the game, and episode 6 is when the big mindgames by the main character start happening.
>> ARTICLE
OK,  that's same as what another poster said.

I would estimate...Episode 5-6?

Alright sounds good.

Yeah, I looked over the episodes and that's when it gets pretty interesting.

**Tari Tari**

When Tari Tari started airing I had lost my mother 4 months ago, which made me drop the anime. This week I decided to try it again. No regrets. **Tari tari is a fantastic slice of life** which I recommend to everybody who likes the genre. It has fun moments, sad moments, happy moments, ood music, good animation, nice characters.
>> ARTICLE
**Colorful**- Kind of surprised I've never heard of this until this week. Gets a bit slow in the middle, but it's worth it in the end. Not sure what else to add other than it got me, and I really enjoyed it. If you got a few hours to kill definitely check it out. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched the entirety of **Kill la Kill** in 2 days. I always ignored it, casting it aside as a "Gurren Lagann with more tits", but it was an interesting ride. Not really incredibly awesome like the hype made it out to be, the main character had a lot of random power-ups that came out of nowhere and made it feel like a battle shonen which I didn't really like.

7/10
>> ARTICLE
I had lots of free time this week, which directly translates to 'I had lots of time for anime this week'.

1. **Hataraku Maou-sama [13/13]** -- Man I loved this show. It was perfect for me. The comedy and the characters were right up my alley; I liked how the jokes and gags were more inherently and genuinely funny instead of just goofy, slapstick, "everyone turns into a chibi to react" typical anime humor. If anything, I'd had wished that we would have gotten some more romantic development with either of the two female leads, but, I mean, it's not like I was expecting that to actually happen. **9/10**

2. **Working!!** and **Working'!! [13/13]** **[13/13]** **[REWATCH]**-- This little rewatch here got me to remember why I loved this show so much. It just has a certain lovability and relatability to its characters that no other anime does. On this second run-through, if anything, I noticed that it's much more tropey than I remember, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, even if the humor sometimes stumbled a bit. I found myself uttering "I fucking hate this show" one second and "I fucking love this show" the next, and that's pretty funny. Also both OPs were love. **8.5/10**

3. **Binbougami ga! [7/13]** -- Absolutely adoring this series so far. Love the comedy, love the abundance references, love the art style and character design. I really appreciate how the humor actually gets adult or contemporary, how it's actually funny and not just more slapstick anime humor (although there is certainly a very, very huge amount of slapstick humor in the show; it's just actually funny). Also loving the OP and ED, might be some of my favorites. Will be finishing this as soon as I can.

3. **Ga-Rei: Zero [2/12]** Oh God damn it [you guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ag28k/spoilers_tokyo_esp_episode_1_discussion/civ2ud8?context=3). And my week was so filled with comedy and happiness, too. Er, well, it's pretty good so far. Appreciate the well-animated action, like the character design. Also really enjoying the sound design, most notably how the sound of the fire was left audible as the credits rolled at the end of the first episode. That really made the impact of that first episode pack even more of a punch. If nothing else, I also have to give it props on how it's giving us action and blood and dark themes without falling into the whole angsty-teenaged-bullshit grimdark "I'm cool because gore" kind of category of shows. I'll be finishing this one in a bit.

I finished watching the Kara no Kyoukai movies, ufotable's animation blew me away and the characters and suspense was nothing short of thrilling, I'm giving this series an **8/10**.

Stein's Gate absolutely blew me away, the synergy between Okabe and Kurisu is one of the best I've ever seen in anime, the movie added another layer of complexity to Kurisu and showed us how far she and Okabe have come since the start of the series, overall I give both the show and the movie a **9/10**.

I'm up to episode 10 of HxH and I'm hooked, it was cool to find out that Sawashiro is voicing Kurapika, I plan to watch the 3rd Madoka movie because I've been putting it off for a while.
>> ARTICLE
Finished Gurren Lagann, then thought to myself-

*Man, Kill la Kill, Sword Art Online, and now Gurren Lagann? God I need something more emotional*

**Golden Time**

I enjoyed it a lot. It was a little unorthadox in terms of how I usually see romances work out, but I enjoyed it. Banri was a good character on his own, his *other* friend that tagged along with him was a pain in the ass and I absolutely hated him.

Koko was a bitch for the first 15 episodes, just saying that whatever character development they gave her they immediately ruined it by making her act like a bitch.

Side characters are side characters *except 2D-kun, who is best kun*. Some get annoying and the rest get little involvement in the story.

Plot is fine, will get annoying when you first hear about it, but it grows on you when you realize they do it realistically.

Story ends blissfully.

Kaiba 12/12

Amazing experimental anime that is ultimately about love and memories. Great themes explored. The only real problem I had was I was a little confused with a few things in the series but that might not be a problem with the series maybe its a problem with me being too stupid or not paying enough attention. I look forward to re-watching it in the future to maybe get even more out of the themes and hopefully understand it better.

8.5-9/10 Masaaki Yuasa is a god.
>> ARTICLE
Trying to blast through **Gintama**. I have episode 103 on pause right now as I write this. So far, it's goddamn amazing. Everything that comes out of this show is somehow original, and it usually ends up being hilarious, and the parts that are supposed to be serious are also executed perfectly. It's just really great, there's nothing more to say. I can't wait to get to some of the episodes that people are always talking about.

Watching Yahari Ore no Seishun Love wa Machigatteiru, have to say I expected a bit more but it isn't that bad.

**Kuroko no Basket** S1 and S2 and all the specials. Ended up marathoning whole thing, never thought that watching basketball anime gets you hooked that hard. 9/10, cant wait for season 3.
>> ARTICLE
Finished my re-watch of Oreshura, Masuzu's antics are helped by context from Jojo. The series is still both very pretty, using (it's pastel tones and thin lines to good effect) and uses it's characters well(using cliches in a fun, playful way), still have a strange love for that opening... 

Watched the first episode of Another, struggling to get a feel for it and haven't got attached because it feels far too forced.

Got to SAO and watched the first episode, nothing much to say except it's a start.
>> ARTICLE
**Blue Exorcist (10/I'm on mobile and I forget how many episodes there were)** - watching this one because a friend wants to do a cosplay with me of the MC and his brother. It's kinda generic shounen stuff so far - kid finds out about secret powers, tries to figure them out while fighting monsters and going to school. There's nothing I particularly dislike about it, I'm still laughing every so often and I don't hate any character, but its not really jumping out to me.

**Katanagatari (4-6/12)** - I'm taking this one slowly and trying to soak it in as much as possible. I'm enjoying this one immensely. Every character is fantastic, the humor is great, and it just looks good. I was a little put off by the style of the characters at first, but its really grown on me. I love how Shichika is growing as a person, from killing the owner of the third sword just because she was the swords owner and didn't want to give it up, to recognizing the value of people's lives and sparing them. I look forward to see where it's going.

The only thing I'm a little disappointed in so far is the Maniwa corps. Each one could be a great character in there own, but almost none of them make it past one episode. A lot of the time, they just show up, get built up as a cool and intimidating enemy, and then immediately get killed and then the real fight starts. Right now, they seem pretty much useless beyond another force hunting for the swords, but I really hope that changes.

Also, what the HELL was episode 4?? They built up Shichika's huge fight and even animated it for the preview, then never showed it. But then they describe it in detail after its done pretty much just saying, "Man, wasn't that fight totally badass? It was so cool and you both had so many amazing abilities! I'm really glad you won." I had to laugh because it was just so absurd, I couldn't even be mad about it. I hear the ending of the series is truly a masterpiece, so I'm excited to finish this one next week.
>> ARTICLE
Although I agree that the Maniwa corps could have used more screentime, I will say one of my favorite parts about the show is how they managed to build very clear and ranged personalities for each member. There are many who only have a total of around 20 minutes screen time, yet they feel very fleshed out. A great example of this is the Insect squad, [Katanagatari Episode 4](/s "who feel incredibly fleshed out in the few minutes they are given before being murdered by Yasuri. I actually felt really bad for them and that scene had much more impact with those few minutes they used to establish character.") It really shows Nisio Isin's skills at characterization.
>> ARTICLE
Rewatching Evangelion and EoE. As always, spectacular, still catching things i didn't notice the first time through. On a lighter note, I also started Yuyushiki after finishing YuruYuri a little bit ago, and gosh this show is so adorable I love it, really hoping for a second season at some point. 

Also I haven't actually started it, but I plan to watch Humanity has Declined and FINALLY picking up Mushishi again, I could save those for next week's discussion, but i tend to blow through shows, so I may have finished them by then since it looks like I have all this week to myself!

Watched Nisekoi, Black Bullet and No Game No Life these past few days.

No Game No Life was pretty fun to watch, bit too much on the ecchi sometimes but overall it was a pretty fun watch, sort of Deathnote meets games and magic in a happy setting.

Nisekoi, still dont really know what the fuck was going on in the show pretty much everyone was like i want to ask him out but im too scared to do anything fun for a few episodes but damn it gets annoying.

Black Bullet, fun to watch, plot was okay nothing really new though

  
>> ARTICLE
I agree, Black Bullet was completely mediocre.
>> ARTICLE
**Psycho-Pass** (ep13-end)  
Pretty good anime overall. I like this dystopian settings. I got quite the Death Note feel from this. Hoping season 2 can keep up with this! (Rating: around 8.5 rated as 9 on MAL)

**Ghost in the Shell** (movie 1)  
Liked this, but it was a bit too much things dragged into one film. I think I could have enjoyed it more if things were more talked about. A normal 12-24 episode show would be much better. (I don't know if the animes touch the same story or not). (Rating: 7.5, rated as 8 on MAL)

**Baccano!** (ep 1+2)  
This is... different. I didn't most of what happened in the first episode but I assume things will clear up. Nothing really much more to talk about right now.
>> ARTICLE
The first episode of Baccano is a recollection of the events that chronologically happens at the end of the series, with a kind of meta touch. It will all clear up soon.

Currently about halfway through Psycho-Pass.

Finished **Nagi no Asukara**. I can easily say it is one of the best drama series I've watched. 16/20.

Finally watched **Black Lagoon**. It is not my cup of tea, but it is a nice show nevertheless. 15/20.

Watched **Seikoku no Dragonar**. It actually isn't that bad^except for the tentacles . It had a relatively decent story and characters, and I liked the general concept. 13/20.

I'm now watching **BTOOOM!**, probably going to finish it today, because I like to suffer and wait for a second season that's never going to happen. So far a 16/20 but I have to finish it first.

Went through and watched Neon Genesis Evangelion again.  I still have mixed feelings about it
>> ARTICLE
Finally watched kaichou wa maid sama and it was amazing! Pretty sad that there isn't going to be a season 2 though :(
>> ARTICLE
**Higashi no Eden (Eden of the East) (1/11)** Having seen only one episode, I can't comment on much, but I will say that I like it already. The visuals are pretty great, the character designs remind me of Honey & Clover(which is a good thing) and the premise is interesting. I also appreciate the effort put into the voice work, in that the English-speaking people are actually voiced by native speakers(though the writing quality of their lines varies quite a bit). I have high hopes for this.

**Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (The Tatami Galaxy) (1/11)** I've only seen one episode of this show as well, so once again I don't have much to say, but man this show is different. Looking at the premise and story alone, without regarding the characters or the crazy visuals, makes it look like the start of a very safe and generic romantic comedy, but I have a feeling that is really not the point of the show. The fact that the main character speaks at a headache-inducingly high speed is in itself a tell, as are the aforementioned crazy visuals, but even more than that, the show *feels* like it's about something entirely different. I actually don't know where exactly this show is going, and that's interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Episode one of Tatami Galaxy is insane. They throw you into an insane scenario at breakneck speed with absolutely no explanation for what's going on. It's an amazing show, but I didn't really love it like I do now until the final episode.

Also, you're spot on with the point of it not really being a generic romcom. The MC adresses it in the last episode, and it's one of my favorite lines in anime. 
>> ARTICLE
What do you think of the opening for Eden of the East? It's one of my favorite openings of all time!
>> ARTICLE
It is pretty great. The song is the best part, obviously, but the visuals are pretty interesting as well.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the middle of watching Shuffle. I like it so far.
>> ARTICLE
Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (6/12) - This has been sitting on my list for an absolute age, mostly because the premise sounded really cool. So far I'm not that impressed, there are a couple of scenes that are quite beautiful but the plot seems to be progressing so fast that I'm finding it hard to keep up with. It's just pretty meh to be honest...
>> ARTICLE
**Higurashi no nai Koro** 20/26 I picked this up on a whim after hearing about it as one of the best horror anime and the VN is getting an updated release on steam so it seemed a good time to pick it up.

So far the show has been excellent ignoring any DEEN quality I've enjoyed all the characters and story lines though I have a lot of questions in relation to it and what's going on. I hear the next season has the answers so that should hopefully help. 

As for the scariness it actually rather is with it giving me quite a few jumps and being generally creepy and off putting especially [spoiler](/s " when Rena goes all dead eyes and talks about being stalked by oyashiro-sama or in the first arc where her and mion keep getting possessed and getting cat eyes before confronting keiichi")

Legend of the Galactic Heroes

its quite fucking good but after having people praise it like the second coming of jesus every time its talked about I still kinda expected more
>> ARTICLE
Durarara! (currently at episode 22/25)-

This anime is gripping from the first episode, and ALL of the characters are really likeable and kind of scary at the same time. The storytelling is very well done too. I'm approaching the end, and the show still hasn't slowed down or dragged out anywhere. I wish I had tried this one earlier. 
>> ARTICLE
Mirai Nikki.
>> ARTICLE
Sword Art Online:  Damn this show started off strong and slowed down hard.  I don't think i'm gonna stick with it, to be honest it seems like a show i'd like, but i'm just not digging it. 

Currently watching Knights of Sidonia.  I'm enjoying this show quite a bit, seems pretty cool.  Animation framerate is kinda disappointing, and i can't seem to differentiate the girls at all, but otherwise its pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
Someone on  r/mecha posted Knights of Sidonia at 60FPS. 
>> ARTICLE
Im watching the netflix version.  The framerate isn't bad enough that i'd really try finding another version.

I finally startet watching K-ON!, 5 episodes in and I love it so far! Feels good to know there is a second season with double the episodes and a movie and I'm just at the beginning.  
In addition I finished Hitsugi no Chaika which I first dropped after three episodes when it aired but now I'm glad i catched up because it was awesome and I'm looking forward for season two in fall.
>> ARTICLE
I finished full metal panic (fumoffu is just awesome). And I got 9 episodes into high school of the dead.
>> ARTICLE
Finally finished Asu no Yoichi Samurai Harem. 

Watched a bit of the great Boys Over Flowers.

I'm slowly working my was through the classic rom com Maison Ikkoku, I'm now in the 50s.

I'm rewarching the orig sailor moon to prepare to binge watch the reboot once it's all released. Just started the R season.

No Game No Life is the most recently released show I've watched this week.

**Monogatari Series Second Season (10/26)**

So far I've been extremely impressed with this show, the characters have much more depth and there are quite a few really touching moments in the show so far.  Araragi has become my favorite MC, he has all of the traits of the stereotypical hero but he's also a very flawed person, which makes him feel much more human despite the fact that he is a semi-immortal ex-vampire.  The last arc I completed has definitely confirmed my feelings that Shinobu is best girl, her relationship Araragi is really cute.  Overall I think this season might be the best I've seen yet, I'm really excited for more.

**Selected Infector WIXOSS (12/12)**

I saw some people recommend this show saying it was underrated and noticed the second cour will be airing in the fall so I thought I'd give it a shot and I was reasonably impressed.  Sure its probably a bit over the top melodramatic at times but I thought it was quite an interesting character drama.  The ending of the the first cour was really good and definitely has left me wanting more so I'm excited for the conclusion in the fall.  I should probably go watch Madoka Magic now because it seems like you can't bring up this show without making the obvious Madoka comparison.
>> ARTICLE
With as full as this new season is it's been difficult for me to watch much else. I was able to get to a few things, however. 

**Kaze Tachinu (The Wind Rises)**  
Great story, well paced and full of emotion. Loved it.  

**Isshuukan Friends 6-9**  
I fully intend to finish this tonight or tomorrow, it's a shame I fell so far behind last season.  

**Origin: Spirits of the Past**  
I'd already seen this one before, but had completely forgotten about it. So when I saw some mention of it online it caught my interest again (I'm a huge fan of post-apocalyptic stuff with forgotten technology). It was as mediocre as I remember it having been though. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched the entire series of C Money of the Soul and Possibility of Control in one day(favorite anime btw) and then the next day watched the entire series of The Devil is a Part-Timer. I have no life 9.9
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Bakemonogatari**. I had started it, but then put it on hold for quite a while. But then I discovered a Soundcloud [playlist](https://soundcloud.com/dakroz/platinum-disco-nisemonogatari) that had a ton of the popular full song versions of the OP's. After a few weeks of listening to it non-stop, I gave in and finished. I enjoyed it a ton more going back into the story than when I started out. I think I appreciated the dialogue driven aspect of it far more this time around. I'm excited to start Nisemonogatari.

I also watched **Hajime no Ippo**, and dear lord is that an awesome anime. I didn't particularly care for boxing, but my friend was always raving about the manga, so I gave it a shot. I've only seen the first 75 episodes and the movie, but it's just so good. 
>> ARTICLE
Got up to episode 8 of Ping Pong the animation as I didn't watch it last season. Pretty impressive so far.
>> ARTICLE
Akagi, it's Death Note with more table games and less death gods and blondes.
>> ARTICLE
**Ie Naki Ko 32-51 (END):** The tone in the second half of the show is very different; rather than a tragedy every other episde, it's more upbeat. Although I found that the tragic moments had more of an impact on me than all the happy ones, I think I preferred the second half. My main gripe with it would be the "plot by coincidence" that goes on, if that makes sense. So many characters just happen to meet other characters by chance, which shouldn't really happen since France is fairly large and most people are on foot. And all the instances of people just missing each other when trying to meet was frustrating to see.

Other minor niggles include the fact that Remi and Mattia can apparently speak English (or everybody in England can speak French), and that all strangers are just too nice. Sara had this issue too, so I suppose it's just a symptom of it being a children's novel.

**Jewelpet Happiness 30-36:** The plot that was hiding in the background has crept in quite quickly. The amount of humour in each episode has gone down as a result, but there are still a few perfect scenes each week. And finally, the cause of those pitfalls has been revealed.

**Isshukan Friends 9-10:** I'm trying to finish this before this season gets properly started. I can't say I like the drama that this new guy has brought with him at all, and it is probably less effective than it should be because I only care about Kiryuu and Saki. Why are the supporting characters usually more interesting in this kind of show?
>> ARTICLE
K On!/K-ON!!- Was halfway through S2 but the site I stream from had a massive issue that caused nearly all of the old videos to break. This means they have an ETA of a few months, and I've not found any other site with nearly as good mobile support so I put that K-ON!! on hold for now. I've been really enjoying it though- its got that perfect balance between comedy and SoL and when they actually play music its great music. The only fault I can think of is that some of the animation is pretty janky, especially when they are moving at anything faster than a walk. Looking forward to continuing when it comes back up.[](/sp)

In the meantime I've picked up Watamote. I find it hilarious so far, although at the same time it has some things that really annoy me. The biggest being that certain parts feel really "2edgy4me", and strike me as fan service designed for people who would insert as Tomoko. That being said, I'm enjoying it so far and I'm pretty sad it has so few episodes.[](/sp)

Not entirely relevant, but I'm planning on watching either Another, Kin-iro Mosaic or Infinite Stratos next. Any suggestions on which I should see first?

Non Non Biyori 4/12

Heard about it from a friend, decided to pick it up. Very nostalgia-inducing, great anime so far. Highly recommend to anyone that's looking for a fun, lighthearted series to cool off.
>> ARTICLE
Finally got around to finish Slayers. I absolutely loved this show, it was a blast from start to finish. I really enjoy the anime from the 90s, stuff like dragon ball, fushigi yuugi etc. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good adventure/fantasy anime.

Currently crawling to finish Mikakunin. Just checked out 1st episode of Golden time. :D

I'm fairly new, I just finished Steins;Gate... It was one of the best shows I have ever seen. I haven't found anything that even remotely compares to it.
>> ARTICLE
I have been watching Code Geass, I just finished the 20th episode of season 2. As it is getting late, i will finish it tomorrow.

I realy like it so far, but I was rather disappointed with how they ended the first season, building up lots of tension and questions, and then just start one year later like nothing happened. They did explain what happened and it all makes sense, but i wish they had continued the story and not just done a huge time skip in the middle of the action.

**Ano Hana (11/11)**
Surprisingly, I didn't cry, though I did get pretty damn close at times. I felt like the whole love dodecahedron was a little contrived at times, but the whole concept of getting one last impossible chance with the girl you loved so much is heartbreaking. I did laugh at Yukiatsu at times, though. Not sure that was supposed to happen. 
Also, Menma is *adorable*.

The OP and the ED were great. I don't think I skipped the OP even once.
>> ARTICLE
* **Redline**: If you liked any part of TTGL, you'll love Redline. Why? They're the exact same principle, just in different settings. 8/10  
* **Hanasaku Iroha: Home Sweet Home**: It fills out the stories between the characters, and does it in a really sweet way. 7/10  
* **Parasite Dolls**: It felt like a few episodes of the Law & Order... And I fucking love Law & Order! 9/10  
* **Toaru Hikuushi e no Tsuioku**: Much more interesting than A Certain Pilot's Love Song. 8/10  
* **Cat Shit One**: WTB CoD mod with bunnies. 9/10  
* **Eiken**: I've made some bad decisions in my life. Eiken is one of them. 3/10   
* **Eikyuu Kazoku**: It might make more sense if you're on some really good drugs. Just alcohol didn't cut it. 4/10  
* **Aki-Sora**: Ummm... Yeah. 4/10

Shin Sekai Yori, Nagi no Asukara, and AnoHana

Shinsekai yori was brilliant, one of the best sci-fi/fantasy anime Ive seen. NoA had an awesome setting, loved the way the world was drawn and the romance was decent. AnoHana I marathoned in one night and had to hold back the tears.

**Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo 10/10** 

I do have a soft spot for this kind of show (reminded me a tad of kokoro connect), well executed, had some minor flaws but it was very enjoyable. Really looking for some suggestions of similar shows.

**Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R1/2 10/10**

VIVA LELOUCH VI BRITANNIA, 10/10. why did I wait so long to watch this? probably because of the mechs, I normally hate mechs, but it didn't bother me in code geass, classic imo.

Gankutsuou

Finished Chaika. Watching now Hataraku Maou-sama (8/13).

I'm enjoying Hataraku Maou-sama quite a bit. I was expecting it to be something on the lines of Keroro, but oh boy was I wrong. I hope it does not flop on the ending like most series tend to do.

And about Chaika, it was a fun series to watch. I hope the story really picks up in the next season, since it barely got going.

Chaika.

finished dragon crisis. got really cute at the end. started k-on last night and got to ep 4. need some moe cuteness to balance out the intensity of tokyo ghoul, akame ga kill, and zankyou no terror lol
>> ARTICLE
**Wolf Children (2012 movie)**  
I had a few free hours at AX, so I decided to go see this film that I'd heard a few people gushing over in the past and boy, what a stroke of luck I did. It's a slow, plodding story, but that's what makes it so sentimental, for lack of a better term - it's a *good* story, and it's one that you don't mind rewatching just for the warm fuzzy of the brief moments of comedy and the interesting characters that it spins. Hana for Mom of the Year.

10/10, would rewatch

**Summer Wars (2009 Movie)**  
Y'know, I should really watch more of Studio Madhouse's work, because after Wolf Children and now Summer Wars their animation style is really growing on me. That said, masterpiece of a film - "family entertainment" isn't normally a label you'd apply to anime, movie or no, but this is definitely a film you can sit down and watch with anyone.

What I think I enjoyed most was the escalation of plot while maintaining the same core themes - the strength of family, in particular, but also the side symbolism provided by the Jinnouchi's history of standing up against overwhelming odds. Add in some sprinkles of very well-handled romcom and thriller elements and you've got a very well rounded and thoroughly enjoyable final product.

10/10, planning to rewatch (my brother'll enjoy this).

**Little Busters (1/26)**  
I was a fan of the VN, which I was unable to complete due to issues with typsetting in the English translation, so rather than digging through a million old torrents I decided to skip straight to the anime. So far, I'm liking it - a lot of the same fun quirks and characterization elements seemed to be preserved, even an episode in. Also, I adore the soundtrack (*everything* Key Visual does gets good music), so there's that.

?/10 (too early to call)
>> ARTICLE
I've been finishing up Log Horizon.  Also, playing Transistor.  It's an awesome game.  Y'all should check it out.

I finished **Noein** last night. I tried looking up interpretations/explanations of symbolism in the entire series, kinda disappointed I didn't.

I started and finished Anohana, I liked it alot, going to watch kanon 2006 next
>> ARTICLE
Finished One Week Friends; didn't like the ending. Was hoping that at the end of a 1 cour show they'd be able to wrap it up with her not forgetting her memories, but nothing was really resolved. That's just how I feel. Art was still amazing and Fujimiya was still adorable.

Started Kyousougiga. What the FUCK was that episode 0. Then episode 1 kinda helped. Will most likely watch Episode 2 tonight.
>> ARTICLE
Currently watching a few animes. As of the last week, I'm watching:

Log Horizon - Was pretty interesting to begin with, but now I'm losing interest. The story definitely intrigues me, but it's a bit slow on execution and progress development.

Nourin - Started out well, but there hasn't been as much development as I would have liked so far. Albeit, I'm only at episode 4.

Outbreak Company - This one is pretty funny.
>> ARTICLE
With you on Nourin, finished that yesterday.
>> ARTICLE
Cutting down since I picked up a lot of series this season.

**Gintama** (30/201) - An entire episode fighting over sukiyaki? This is the first episode Ive found to be really amusing. The Death Note parody went over my head though since I haven't seen it.

The episode with the underground fighting ring and the orphans was touching. Revealed a good side to Sogo that I hadnt seen before. Glad to see the fallout from that with the rest of the cast in the next episode too. Oh, Sachan.

And then ew, cockroaches. The ogre hunting for the sword and running into Kagura was fun though, as was the crime mystery story with Otsu. No idea how many references I ended up missing there.

Also a new opening and ending. I already miss Mr. Raindrop. Overall it's still hit and miss, but I'm enjoying it more as I go along.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (8/64) - Barry the Chopper and the Slicer Brothers! I dont recall the former being so humorous.

**Beck - Mongolian Chop Squad** (1/26) - Okay start. Not overly fond of the animation or the individual voices so far but the dub does a decent job with the setting. Not sure how this one will go.

I'm also steadily advancing through the **Fate/Stay Night** visual novel, but I won't talk about that here since it's not an anime series. About 20 hours in and I'm really enjoying Saber's story; the VA for her also voiced one of my favorite characters so I'm enjoying that (Lafiel in Banner of the Stars, who even has a similar personality).

I just finished Death Note for the first time. Wow, thats about all I can say about it. The ending just killed me. Even if the second part wasn't good in my opinion, just the entire series as a whole was full ingenious plots, even if they were a bit far fetched. Still a great anime, 10/10

I just finished Mirai Nikki, that was pretty good, aside from a few nitpicks I had with the show. I really did not expect a lot of those twists! (also such a good first op, the others fell short)

I also rewatched Neon Genesis Evangelion, because I love the crap out of that shit, and finally got around to watching those Rebuilding Evangelion films, which were pretty sweet. I felt the third one was lacking compared to the previous two, but it was good enough for me to enjoy it and I cant wait for 4.44!
>> ARTICLE
About halfway through both Nagi no Asukara and Shinsekai Yori. Both VERY awesome and intriguing so far. The art style is also fantastic! Would definitely recommend based on what I've seen, both 2 cour, so it's a bit longer.

Finished: [Hataraku Maou-sama!](http://hummingbird.me/anime/the-devil-is-a-part-timer)

Went in with close to no expectations since I just wanted to see why it was mentioned on Hummingbird's [2013 - The Year in Anime Slideshow](http://hummingbird.me/2013/) so often. Easy to watch with standard but likeable characters. Actually hoping for a second season now

Started: [Suisei no Gargantia](http://hummingbird.me/anime/gargantia-on-the-verdurous-planet)

Started out of the exact same reason as for Hataraku Maou-sama! Only watched the first episode so far but I really like where this is going so far.

Also, I just found out that there's a [sequel](http://hummingbird.me/anime/jormungand-perfect-order) to [Jormungand](http://hummingbird.me/anime/jormungand). Holy crap. So I'll definitely start watching that, too.

Fate/Zero. I can't believe I had not gotten around to watch this earlier. It was absolutely amazing! I watched Fate/Stay Night quite a while back, and I know it's not a popular opinion, but I enjoyed it.

Been watching **Gankutsuou** over the past week. I'm upto episode 18. It's a wonderful story and I love the way they've done the art style.

I'm fairly new to anime as a medium really. I started watching some stuff a couple months ago and have quickly fallen in love. Recently I was working my way through Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and I am loving it so fucking much.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** Ep. 38-64 [3rd Rewatch]
I normally like to rewatch shows 5 or 6 months after (re)watching them. This rewatch is pretty fun for myself mainly because the long wait had me forget about most parts of the show

**OniAi** Ep. 2-12
After looking around the subreddit /r/imouto and seeing a post of it, I really wanted to watch it because the very interesting plot. (story plot that is *cough* *cough*) But I am actually really enjoying this anime

**Mayo Chiki!** Ep. 13-13

I seen this one a recommended post here, wanting to check it out I actually quite enjoyed the show. I can easily say the characters are pretty damn likeable.

Dog Days 13/13 and Dog Days' 6/13.

Was a bit reluctant going in, but it really caught my attention after 3 episodes. Very nice anime to watch inbetween more "serious" series.

**Kyousougiga** - Man, I was really surprised by this one. Wasn't aware of it when it aired, and in fact had only just recently heard anyone talk about it. Heard good things from people I trust and decided to give it a go. 

First episode had me confused but *extremely* intrigued and by the time I got through episode two I thought to myself, "I think I've found something amazing".

Honestly thought I might end up finally giving a fourth 10/10 rating and breaking something into my top 5 after it's been left unchallenged for so long. In the end, I was *incredibly* happy with it, but it wasn't quite a show that I would call a masterpiece. **9/10**

- Bleach-(30/344) Watched 21-30 this week: Yay! Soul Society arc has started. Looking forward to seeing Ichigo kick some ass. I really love the new opening song, and I am looking forward to seeing how Ichigo will rescue Rukia. 

- Fate/Zero-(13/13) Watched 1-13 this week: Wow. Major cliffhanger at the end of Season 1. I can't wait to start Season 2! Animation was extremely well done, and even though the plot was pretty slow at the beginning, things have definitely picked up! 

- Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam-(22/50) Watched 21-22 this week: This one is a pretty good entry into the Gundam franchise. At times, the plot can be somewhat confusing, but I am looking forward to finishing it. 

- Black Lagoon-(12/12) Watched 1-12 this week: Revy is such a freaking bad ass! I liked this one, and I am looking forward to started The Second Barrage as well as the OVA.

**Danganronpa** 13/13

I got told about this shows a while back and it ended up on my watch list until finally this week I watched it and I am rather mixed on it. At first it was somewhat interesting and weird and then it's ending felt so sterotypical shounen that I dropped it's rating to a 5/10 .

**Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou** 12/12

I liked the sorta slice-o-life no school drama BS upbeat comedy and I loved Senpai's voice. leave it to Kana to be everywhere and all the while I still love her voice.

7/10


**Sword Art Online** 25/25

This is a show I actively avoided for so long but at least I also avoided any spoilers. The show started sooo strong and was really interesting up until the whole log cabin bit. After that was rather so so. I definitely understand why the reception is so mixed.

7/10

**Escha & Logy no Atelier:** 4/12

I just started this one so I have not gotten far but fantasy and its weird charm work for me.

**Date A Live II** 4/10

I almost dropped the show after ep 1 but at least it has gotten better. I liked the first seasons stupidness and s2 definitely feels right at home.

At first I was disheartened when I saw that the episode count for the second season of Zoku Shou was set at 10 rather than 12 as that left out the final 2 chapters from its broadcast, but this more than makes up for it. Hihamukage showed that the show could work well in a lengthened format and I have little doubt that the final offering will do more than impress.

Im on the 22nd episode of Mushishi, still hoping i will enjoy at least more than 3 episodes. Should i hope for something good at the end or?

It was probably wrong to watch Paranoia Agent in between, because it made Mushishi look bland and unappealing.
>> ARTICLE
If you're not liking the first 22 episodes, you're probably not going to enjoy more than like 1 or 2 of the rest - the style of the show is fairly consistent. *Mushishi* may just not be your thing.
>> ARTICLE
It has no soundtrack, apart from the opening song, the characters look exactly the same through out the whole show, and all the situations are solved by the knowledge he has that we know nothing about. The only thing interesting is the eerie aura animation type, that i really enjoy. But thats pretty much it.

I have to try and read the manga, if there is any, to see if its better.

When i saw the type of animation, i was really hopeful it would be a great show. The dialogues arent interesting and the main characters doesnt change in any way along the show.

Sorry man, im ranting a lot and talking crap about a show you enjoy, and a show i wanted to enjoy. At least the animation style is beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for the late reply, Reddit only just notified me (bizarre, I know!)

The thing is, your complaints aren't going to be addressed by either the manga or the later anime - I can say with confidence that *Mushishi* will not change as it goes on. The character designs will continue to look the same. Ginko will always have the knowledge needed to solve the problem. The animation will continue to be eerie, and the dialogue will *always* be sparse (actually, possibly even sparser in the second season.) 

Personally, I think it *is* a great show, but it's for exactly the reasons you dislike it. I enjoy how minimalistic it's dialog and how slow it's visuals are, since it forces me to pay attention and allows the director to say very significant things in a very simple manner. I agree that the lack of differing character designs is annoying, but frankly I consider that ancillary to the other gorgeous animation and touches it has. Like I said, *Mushishi* really may not be your thing, and that's okay - it's a testament to the subjectivity of quality, and our differing reactions to the same "text" re-inforces how much bullshit it is when people say "quality is measure on an objective standard."

Can you read? Where did i say the show is terrible? I stated what i disliked and what i liked about the show. Of course ill watch it until the end because they might explain some else interesting about the main character , like they did middle season.

There are a lot of shows that have 26 episodes and the manga continues after. They might explain more stuff.

I guess the closest Sakura had to fanservice was the somewhat lewd costumes she sometimes gets in. It's pretty standard fare for 90s-early 2000s anime though.

That and all the shipbait, which newer fans might consider fanservice since it would have been played up like crazy in a modern show. It really isn't treated that way in the show though, and even the most needless Nadeshiko/Sonomi and Li/Yukito scenes are treated as cute instead of lewd.

Seed has fanservice? Does a story-relevant sex scene count as fanservice? I always thought fanservice was unnecessary sexual content, not sexual content that was part of the story.
>> ARTICLE
That's what fanservice is (doesn't have to be sexual content only however). And I wasn't referring to that scene.

[But...](http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g298/strike_zero/1373002087269_zps1299b842.png)

And whenever a missile hit the ArcAngel, you can see where all the budget went instead of actual fight scenes that don't reuse stock footage. Also the [OPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6PzlnjAPqQ) are chock full of really unnecessary stuff (lots and lots of boob bouncing) and Lacus' bust size is made inexplicably larger in the OP and mid episode transitions. Just some of the stuff I could think of off the top of my head. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess I had tuned out the Arcangel missile scenes (my god that was obnoxious). I also forgot that the remaster dialed up the fanservice (especially in the OPs). And Destiny did have quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Seed's OP nudity stuff felt like a throwback to oldschool shows though. Including the nude scenes in openings, which was fairly common in 80s and 90s anime, even for many non sexual shows.

Yeah, there's some shots that are fanservicey. But there's like 5 or 6 shots the entire series and that was about it. I kind of went in with the expectation that it was going to have fanservice but was kind of disappointed it had very little. I think some oldschool Gundams had a bit more on average. A lot of unexpected fanservice too, with the wacky scenes like in ZZ.
>> ARTICLE
Cagalli meets Athrun.  Some of Flay's stuff.  Every time a missile hit the Archangel.

Gundam SEED is still Gundam, so much less fanservicey than most anime.  Among the Gundam franchise, SEED / Destiny is perhaps the most fanservicey.  It's all a matter of degree, so.
>> ARTICLE
There's a difference between being a throwback and having constant tits bouncing on your screen in every OP. Besides, you can have nudity in your OP, but to throw it into every OP is simply unnecessary pandering. For example, see [00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH3m3c8SZCg) as an example of doing it right. 

>  I think some oldschool Gundams had a bit more on average. A lot of unexpected fanservice too, with the wacky scenes like in ZZ.

Zeta had like 1 Fa scene. ZZ has Chara, but that was limited to mostly near the end of the show.

Seed has a good amount with the repeated stock footage usage of missle arcangel bouncing action. Destiny ramped that up way, way more. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know. The Seed animations are kind of dramatic but not that bad. Flay's bounce was actually kind of realistic even, considering the zero gravity depictions. Some of the cheeky shots in the show itself is more fanservicey than the stuff in OP as I see it. I never really looked at that scene like it was especially pandering. Just felt like they were animating the classical silhouette nude scene a bit more. I was told the series was fanservicey but got very little out of it. Destiny actually seems to have had less overall than Seed.
>> ARTICLE
>Flay's bounce was actually kind of realistic even, considering the zero gravity depictions. 

That's not the point. The point is that it is pointless and adds *absolutely* nothing. Further perpetuated by the fact that it is *resused* in pretty much OP. It's fine if you use it once if your intention was a throwback but it comes to a point where it is just there for cheap sexual pandering. 



> Destiny actually seems to have had less overall than Seed.

[Can you really say that?](https://i.imgur.com/mSM5SPW.jpg) 
>> ARTICLE
 To me, OP flair is OP flair. It just is something that is a separate entity from the actual show itself. Again, I felt Seed was referencing the silhouette/nudity effect of oldschool shows. Many oldschool shows had wild OP/ED imagery that never really makes it to the actual show, especially with nudes. Flay may be fairly bouncy but I just thought it was realistic to a space imagery.  Just felt like an eyecatch for an opening and not much else. We both know she is not a trifling character in the show itself.

And just having sexual appeal in itself doesn't automatically mean it's 'cheap' in my book. I felt Seed series just was more graphic in both the sexual and violence aspects overall. It didn't really feel out of place to me, Definitely not that much more or less than what we usually get out of a Gundam show. I can kind of see your point with boob bounce when ship gets attacked, but I thought it worked well visually and didn't stand out especially or anything.

And yes, Destiny definitely had less sexual appeal scenes than Seed overall, even with those remaster changes. Just from the actual number of scenes.
>> ARTICLE
> Flay may be fairly bouncy but I just thought it was realistic to a space imagery.

Could you really say this is [space imagery (nsfw)](https://youtu.be/jKU1VU2YTZk?t=23s)?

> didn't stand out especially or anything.

[We seriously get a angle camera shot of right in front of Murrue nearly everytime it happened.](http://i1222.photobucket.com/albums/dd496/ShawnMerrow/anime/1076329281762.gif). It had so often to the point that even B[uild Fighters](https://youtu.be/vaRynhjiIsM?t=12m57s) makes a goddamn mention of it.

While yes, Seed many not have as much fanservice as say, Cross Ange or something. The fanservice is still a lot more than what we get in comparison to other Gundam shows. It's about the *way* the scene is done and where the camera focuses itself on in Seed that makes it incredibly intrusive and comes off as nothing but a cheap way to entice the viewers.

"fanservice" implies pointless panty shots or "Baka! Hentai!" moments where the entire story stops dead in its tracks so that the audience can ogle at animated tits for a moment.

That's not fanservice. Fanservice is (often, but not limited to) lewd depictions for the sole purpose of appealing to fans.  
Your scene is of importance to the story, as stated before the scene happens, and the effects of which we can see after the scene.

I'm not sure, Hyouka's first ED is somewhat suggestive fanservice. Not apparent but I don't want to watch that with my parent.

To each his own i guess. I honestly didn't see anything in Hyouka that i wouldn't mind watching with my family. But obviously each family is different so what might cross the line on one end might not be the case for the other. But even if you consider the ED to be slightly suggestive fanservice I hold a similar stance as I do with the OVA which is its optional and can easily be skipped without missing anything important so if it is undesired you can avoid it without missing the core content. Also there is going to be suggestive content in pretty much everything so its hard to find something with no suggestive content whatsoever (not saying it doesn't exist, it is just the minority).

I'm not so sure about Durarara!, there is what I would classify as fanservice with two twins, but after thinking about it I guess it is pretty much only they who have anything fanservicey. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, title does say zero OR minimal fanservice. You might also consider it fanservice in very few scenes with Celty here and there, but it's no annoying "in your face" stuff, mostly fitting the situation and definitely not taking anything from the atmosphere or story. Don't know about the twins though, if I recall correctly, they only first appear in the second season. Haven't fully kept track with that one yet, to my regret.

i mean i guess at its core its a funny story of a girl in love trying to win her crushs heart, so i guess it could be considered one. but its just so goddamn funny you kinda forget that even though a lot of jokes are based on her trying to win his heart. its easily in my top 5 anime ive seen so far. its the only anime where ive actually spent money on by buying the first manga volume. i never thought id actually spend money on anime when i started watching, but im planning on buying all the volumes as they come out now as well as the box set once it comes out lol.

i could go on about this show for days i love it so much. it was one of the first comedy anime i watched. i could kinda tell when and what jokes were coming, but for some reason the anticipation made it even funnier. since watching that i still havent found an anime that made me laugh as hard and often as this one. season 2 plsjpn

[You're telling me](http://imgur.com/1NBUyWH) [this isn't fan service?](http://imgur.com/NpA9HgX) 
>> ARTICLE
Well, that would really stretch my idea of "fanservice". But maybe I'm reducing it too much to almost-sex scenes and nude skin...  Again though, the title says "zero OR minimal". If you want to call it that, I think we can agree on "minimal" (so still legit) in this case. My view on that though: That first pic is mostly just using her stance as a device to show her outgoing character and in that case intention of attention. The second one is an illustration of their subtle but not very established friendship and Hikki's impression, so he gets to question his view of them. 
>> ARTICLE
But [Yui](http://animediet.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tayuntayun.gif)?  (Not to mention all her 'accidental boob-press scenes' with Hachiman.)
>> ARTICLE
Is that from the second season? I really don't recall that scene. Boob-pressing-scenes and stuff, I would hardly call that fanservice either and I doubt it's really dominant in the story. It probably serves the fans less than it serves to show that Hachiman is not as unfazed as he might come off. But seriously, I'd say there's more fanservice going on with Saika than with any of the girls... and I've seen that anime here in another person's post somewhere, so I can't be that far off...  
More importantly, I was simply trying to add something for people who aren't looking for animes along the lines of FMA or Attack on Titans. I personally enjoy romance, if it's taking a little seriously and not just about annoying scenes of people falling on each other while accidentially dropping some clothing in the act. So when I saw this thread I was like: Cool, maybe some nice recommendations, then was disappointed when there were almost exclusively Anime that rather obviously wouldn't feature fanservice, because they're not even brushing the matter. Anyway, even if you do take romance seriously, there will be some display of attractive features or physical contact and the according reactions. It kinda comes with the genre. There's nothing out of place there. For me fanservice includes display of these things outside of plot/characterization necessities.

I mean, you can justify it all as 'in character' for Hachiman, but does it really extend the plot, drama, and relationship of the characters, or is it all just a thinly veiled excuse to put close-ups of character [T&A](https://ironkleid.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/74aad-ohys-raws_yahari_ore_no_seishun_lovecome_wa_machigatte_iru-_zoku_-_03_tbs_1282b32.jpg?w=640&h=358) on the screen for the viewer?  Granted, it's not as over-the-top as Rail Wars to completely distract and interrupt the plot, but as much as I love the series, Oregairu's still full of fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
You can call it 'justifying' all you want, but I'm just stating my true feeling about the show. That picture of Yui you posted, I can't recall seeing that, but, if it's from the anime, I'll give you that - it's fanservice. Still not a common sight on the show, if not the only happening to that extend. And man, Hikki is a teenage boy. Why shouldn't he be thinking about this kind of stuff? It's called realism, it makes the anime charming. He's not a complete robot, despite his image. That IS characterization. The show doesn't ignore the fact that he's attracted to certain physical aspects, that IS realistic. If you cut scenes like that completely, that's when it seems staged. Let's just agree to disagree. Unless the creator removes my post I don't believe I maltreated the spirit of the thread.  
*edit* : I marked it in my list, I hope that shows my consideration. I'm not brushing you off, I'm just not convinced it doesn't belong here.

>> ARTICLE
Hmm in one of the early episodes Shinichi grabs Murano's breast and there is some nudity in it later on.
>> ARTICLE
Grabbing of Murano's breast is because of Migi, not really fanservice. As for the nudity later on [Parasyte](/s "In Kana's dream, her and Shinichi were naked, but you could argue they were because of her infatuation with him. Then Murano and Shinichi having sex isn't really fanservice and develops their realtionship.") I consider fanservice as pointless nudity, upskirts, doesn't contribute to the story etc. But in both examples, it's not really pointless and either makes sense in context of the narrative or develops something.
>> ARTICLE
This is a bit off-tangent, but I've been wanting to ask, at what point does something gets considered as fanservice? Because something like Love Live! for example, had a beach episode and they all had their 2-piece bathing suits, yet in that episode and throughout the whole series there has never been a single moment/shot/angle dedicated to emphasizing sexuality. (not counting the pre-anime PVs, Mogyutto had a bunch of those.) Not to mention that a number of their costumes are fairly revealing.
>> ARTICLE
Fanservice just means "giving the fans what they want."

Some entire series are an act of fanservice. Fate/Kaleid Liner and Carnival Phantasm are both examples of this. For a western example, see the movie Predators.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more like gratuitous fan pleasing that's not necessary to the plot.
>> ARTICLE
Fanservice is just unnecessary stuff that does not add to the plot or characters in any meaningful way. It does not have to be sexual (for example, UBW's Sunny days ending or GBFs and Shingeki highschool parody is fanservice for Gundam/SnK Fans) but that's what most people refer fanservice to be.

If they're at a beach then it's expected to have swim wear so it's fine and not really fanservice so long as the idea of going to the beach is in some way part of the plot or characterization. 
>> ARTICLE
If the scenes don't have to include the content or frame it in a sexual way to get the plot points across, but they *choose to*, it's fanservice. A beach episode can have the characters be there for a serious reason that is vital to the storyline, but if the show takes a moment to show off their new designs, that specific scene is fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the definition nowadays is just for unnecessary sexual shots. I guess it all boils down to how shows handle the show actually portrays stuff like beach scenes, as pretty much 2/3 of anime has some sort of swimming episode, but not all of them use them to sexualize the characters.

You're Under Arrest - none that i can think of, though it has been a while.

Hyper Police - I'm going to say minimal if there is any.

Please Teacher - Minimal, i don't remember there being too much fanservice. Mostly cleavage i think.

Otome Yokai Zakuro - None

Rurouni Kenshin - I dont think there really is any, nothing really stands out to me from memory.

Haibane Renmei - none

eX-Driver - Minimal at the very most.

Utawarerumono - Minimal, i don't think there is anything really too objectional

Galaxy Angel series - None

R.O.D. OVA and TV. - Minimal to none. There is one ep in the TV series which has topless nudity for a minute or two but nothing else aside from that.

Comic Party - Minimal, i think its pretty safe series in that respect.

El Hazard: The Magnificent World - Minimal, there is a bathing/hot spring scene which has a few of the female characters naked and showing breasts on screen.

Okay: here's my anime recommendation list for ages 12 and up:


Absolutely NO fanservice, and Pat Robertson or Rick Santorum would be proud to watch it.


1) [Barakamon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon) - rural countryside setting


2) [Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/Gekkan_Shoujo_Nozaki-kun) - runs your typical slice-of-life and high school tropes straight, but your sides are likely to be gone after each episode.


3) [Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou) - if "moe" does not equate to fan service, you are pretty safe. Over-the-top humor (which may be an acquired taste).


For films, anything by [Makoto Shinkai](http://myanimelist.net/people/1117/Makoto_Shinkai) would qualify, but the storyl tends to be too realistic for those who delve into anime.


Other (slightly older) classics include Madoka Magica, Rurouni Kenshin and Haibane Renmei. Minimal fanservice, if any.
>> ARTICLE
> anything by Makoto Shinkai

I don't know man, The Garden of Words had a lot of feet. (   )

Garden of Words: Foot-fetish fanservice

Psycho Pass (badass female detective unravels titanic conspiracy in an Orwellian Cyberpunk future city)

Eureka Seven (a boy mechanic falls in love with a young ace pilot from a group of freedom fighters, and as he grows up their love plays an integral role in solving the mystery of this futuristic setting and reuniting humanity and nature.)

Eureka Seven: AO (Sequel to E7, follows the child of the two main characters. The "inconsistencies" between the two shows' settings hides an enormous plot twist and amazing story. gets a weird amount of hate, despite being a 9/10 amazing show. )

Last Exile (two childhood friends/steampunk airship couriers become embroiled in a war against a guild of hyper-advanced humans intent on guarding the Ark ship which will unite humanity and return it to Earth.)

Ergo Proxy (dystopian future-noire existential thriller. Oozes with symbolism. Trying to understand and dissect the meaning of each part of the show is even more fun than watching it.)

Cowboy Bebop (One of the defining works in the space-western genre. Lack of fanservice is debatable, but the good far and away outshines the bad)

Arslan Senki (Fire Emblem: the Anime. A Persian prince seeks to reclaim his rightful throne and rescue his people from barbaric totally-not-the-Jews invaders. There's one scantly-dressed main character who never does anything remotely sexual.)

Knights of Sidonia (a stowaway boy becomes a soldier in a giant Arc flying through alien-controlled space. Beautiful art with weird/interesting animation. Netflix.)

Steins;Gate (I'm amazed no one has mentioned this yet. Delusional "mad scientist" invents a way to send information through time. As events spiral out of control, he realizes that what he's lost is worth fighting an unwinnable battle to recover.)

BONUS OBSCURE ANIME: Xam'd Lost Memories (A young man leaves his island home after it is attacked by the supernatural forces of an enemy nation. Having become a strange, supernatural creature himself in the process, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery and seeks the guidance of spiritualists, old friends, and new companions. Feels like a cross between Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and Eureka Seven.

In all cases, the anime above are beautiful, high quality productions with no space wasted on stupid, pointless ecchi scenes which fail to advance the plot. When nudity does occur, it is incidental, artistic, or quickly brushed over in a tasteful way.

Can't believe noboy mentioned Berserk yet. You can spot some butt or breast ocasionally, but it's not fanservice, it's necessary for the plot.  
Also, I think there is a rewatch going on, so if you haven't watched it yet, go do it.
>> ARTICLE
Berserk certainly does have fanservice. Fanservice can move the plot forward/be integrated seamlessly into the plot. If the scenes don't *have* to include the content or frame it in a sexual way to get the plot points across, but they choose to, it's fanservice. Berserk is a great example, because there are also quite a few scenes with totally nonsexual nudity and sex acts that clearly aren't fanservice (the rape scenes are good about being horrific and uncomfortable.) 

A ton of Golden Age Casca/Elaine Casca scenes all count, along with a few of Griffith's and Guts' topless scenes. There are multiple ritual orgies too where the characters are meant to be attractive.
>> ARTICLE
I'm talking about anime here, manga has way more nudity and fanservice, [example being](/s "Farnese masturbating with a sword,")but that's manga only anyways.
Lemme bring up a few scenes from the anime.  


[Spoilers](/s "Naked Casca warming up Guts") - It gives Casca a real and tangible reason to hate Guts, without this she would be just a random tsundere bitch.

[Spoilers](/s "Scene where Griffith and Guts are splashing water at each other") - Griffith's butt naked, but the whole scene is portraying Griffith's childlike nature. I can see the scene working without Griffith being naked, but it would be illogical, he's washing himself, so why would be he clothed?

[Spoilers](/s "Casca naked after Guts drags her out of the river") - It helps advance the sub-plot of her being insecure about being a woman-warrior. I have to admit though, we do get to see a glorious sideboob later on, and that's pure fanservice.

And that's kinda it. Nobody would ever classify[](/s "tortured Griffith's bare torso"), or[](/s "Casca's Eclipse rape")as being fanservice.

I might have forgotten something, but even if so, the Berserk anime has extremely low erotic fanservice, and it qualifies as an anwser to this thread.

I wouldn't say that's necessarily true. Kyoto Animation had its fling with fanservice in early 2000s and some of their recent shows had more displays of sexual imagery. Sometimes full on butt-shots and in the case of Euphonium, a lot of imagery was bordering on sexual tease (even though no actual upskirts or anything). Stuff like teasing the legs, thighs, nose, mouth happened in Euphonium.

Added at the mod's discretion

> Mononoke is a spin-off of the Bakeneko story arc of Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror. It follows the Medicine Seller as he deals with various spirits or "Mononoke" in feudal Japan. Just like in the Bakeneko story, he combats with a series of tools and his vast knowledge of the supernatural on his side, but can only slay the Mononoke when he uncovers its form (Katachi), the truth behind its appearance (Makoto) and the reason for its unusual behavior (Kotowari).

It's only the second season, new passage, though. You can watch the first season on YouTube from funimations channel I think
>> ARTICLE
Did Netflix have a revolution or something?
>> ARTICLE
We had a great selection when it first launched, then nothing but Robotech movies for about 2 years. Glad to see more stuff added.
>> ARTICLE
Is Robotech any good? I've actively avoided them...no idea why. But then again I did that to quite a few shows in US Netflix, then I eventually watched them and ended up amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't really know myself. I bought the complete collection a few months back but have only gotten through disc one. What I have seen is enjoyable but a bit slow. If you can get over it's age and stick with it I'd imagine it gets better.
>> ARTICLE
I should start with the 2005 season and not this one, right?
>> ARTICLE
It's all episodic. I think there only a couple episodes where there is continuity. Apart from the main character there is only like 2 other recurring characters as well so you could start with this season. But the first season is just as good as are all the special episodes 
>> ARTICLE
Season 1 has backstory for the main character in the later episodes so you can understand more about who he is and why he's a mushi-shi. I recommend watching Season 1 first cause it's really good in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I've personally not seen any of Mushishi, but by the looks of it, you are correct.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. You'll get a lot more out of the episodes in the second season if you watch the first season. It's hard to say more without spoilers but there's a few specific episodes where this applies, even if the overall series seems episodic.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped:

World Trigger because I got bored of watching it and the face the "alien"(or however he is called) constantly does is just really annoying

Terra Formars because I enjoy seeing colours, not a black screen.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah pretty much same list except i stopped watching sora no method since... Hmm i should give it another shot, i don't know why i stopped watching 
>> ARTICLE
Pick up Terraformars again. It's uncensored now.
>> ARTICLE
Correction: no people have died recently. The roaches don't get censored ever. I don't think the series in uncensored still. 
>> ARTICLE
Heads have rolled. It's uncensored.
>> ARTICLE
They realeased the first few episodes uncensored a while ago.
>> ARTICLE
I was under the the impression that was just a teaser. 
>> ARTICLE
Crunchy Roll has actually stopped using the black censor bars.
>> ARTICLE
Are all the episodes on crunchyroll uncensored now or just certain ones?
>> ARTICLE
All I think. The last hand full of episodes that I've watched have been uncen. I'm not sure if the early censored episodes are now uncen.
>> ARTICLE
At what episode did you notice they had stopped censoring? Cause I stopped watching after episode 2
>> ARTICLE
It was a little after that. Probably episode 3 or 4.
>> ARTICLE
dropped "world trigger" because toei can't do animation right.

 "Grisaia" because of the rushing of the last 2 episodes and picked up the VN instead.

 "Terraformers" because the first 4 episodes was just bodies dying which wan't enough to entertain me.

Lastly "Trinity seven" because i just wasn't that interested but i'm looking to pick it back up because the discussion threads look fun
>> ARTICLE
Trin 7 isnt all too amazing, but it is still interesting.  I nust hate the mcs eyes.  They piss me off
>> ARTICLE
The Trinity Seven OST is freaking AMAZING!
>> ARTICLE
I want to drop Trinity Seven because I really can't get into the characters or story, but the animation style is exactly what I enjoy and the humor makes me actually chuckle out loud. I end up catching up on it when I'm out of my other anime's to watch. I'm not that interested in what's happening, but the outright fan service makes me laugh. 
>> ARTICLE
I have been contemplating whether or not to continue watching the Grisaia anime. I haven't read the VN, but people have been saying that it is really much better. I really enjoy shows with interesting characters and great development; also enjoyed this anime. However, idk if I have 50+ hours to do so. Is it worth it? I've never read a VN before and held off the anime since ep 4
>> ARTICLE
I'll always recommend people read visual novels, it's my current favorite medium. In my opinion, grisaia is an above average VN in its genre and worth reading, if you like the genre. 

Vndb and fuwanovel are the two sites to go to for info, as well as our own /r/visualnovels
>> ARTICLE
VNs are just like regular novels in that it's easy enough to put down and pick up later. It took me weeks to find the time to read the entire thing, and it was amazing all the way through. 
>> ARTICLE
as an anime only watcher, i'd say go read the VN.
The last few episodes have felt so rushed you don't get time to get attached to the character and sympathize with their backstory before everything is suddenly over and the show moves on to the next
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. It's particularly bad in this case, since one of the strengths of the VN is how much time it spends introducing and developing the characters before even hinting at their pasts. Not having that attachment really kills the "Holy shit" factor that *should* come when you understand why they behave the way they do. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't dropped any as of yet, however I'm thinking about putting UBW on hold. Just so I can binge watch it later on.
>> ARTICLE
You guys are really gonna have to try hard to avoid spoilers. There will be a massive explosion both at the end of this cour and partway through the next cour.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it will be a problem. However I'm currently playing through the Fate route in the VN. So most likely I'll continue with the UBW route after that so spoilers might not be an issue :p
>> ARTICLE
Oh god yes. And it's not like the internet isn't already a minefield of spoilers for fsn
>> ARTICLE
Similar for me. I'm putting it off until I have a chance to do the VN.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't dropped anything but then again I hardly picked up anything either, the only ones I'm watching right now are FSN, Parasyte, Log Horizon 2 and 2nd season of Chaika.

Nothing else looked interesting to be honest, and next season isn't looking better.
>> ARTICLE
you should add bahamut
>> ARTICLE
Does this show get better after episode 2 because the first two were a huge let down to me.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly it gets better, but not much better.
>> ARTICLE
I recommend you catch up on Psycho Pass so you can watch the currently airing second season. 
>> ARTICLE
I've dropped:

* **Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai** - watched two eps and it seemed pretty ...bland.

* **Denki-Gai no Honya-san** - the comedy was hit and miss, for me. I like the characters so I might pick this back up later.

* **Sanzoku no Musume Ronja** - dat CG. Too childish, as well.

* **Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete** - The first (or second?) episode was pretty interesting but when I dropped it, it just seemed like a generic harem with a bit of a twist. Not enough of a twist to keep watching, tbh.

* **World Trigger** - Dropped at first episode

* **Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji** - the dude in it is a fucking asshole

* **Gugure! Kokkuri-san** - meh. 

* **Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Crystal** - For whatever reason it's just not as interesting to me as the original. I've watched about 20 episodes of the original and I only managed 7 eps of this.

* **Girlfriend (Kari)** - Not what I expected, but I'll watch it at some point if it ends up being a *good* CGDCT series.

* **Orenchi no Furo Jijou** - uneventful

edit:

>***On hold***:

* **Shingeki no Bahamut Genesis** - Don't hate me! I want to marathon this when it's done.

...I dropped a *lot*, but I'm still watching 15 shows. c:
>> ARTICLE
The latest episode aside (because it was terrible), SMC is something I think mostly would only appeal to those who have that childhood nostalgia associated with the series. I'm really excited about it... most of the time... but the crappy CG doesn't endear it to anyone.
>> ARTICLE
If you fully intend to watch something after its airing, then you didn't really drop it. If anything, you put it on hold. Dropping an anime, at least the way its been defined in this community, means that you don't intend to watch it anymore, at least any time soon. 
>> ARTICLE
Aww, Kokkuri-san is pretty funny, though.
>> ARTICLE
If you plan to binge watch Shingeki no Bahamut, then you haven't dropped it. You've only put it on hold :p
>> ARTICLE
Does this show get better the first 2 episodes were meh at best for me

>> ARTICLE
IMO the plot gets better, but I'm no fan of the characters so, watch those that are out atm, and decide after that :p
>> ARTICLE
Its probably just not the type of show for you then. It's quality has been fairly consistent across the board, but you may be more drawn in as plot/character's develop. 
>> ARTICLE
True, although I hate using my on-hold list ~~because it's so full already~~ ; u ;
>> ARTICLE
I've only dropped Selector Spread WIXOSS. I think I just lost interest in the story, the characters annoyed me more than usual and I don't like Yuri.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the exact same thing until I saw episode 7. Things are getting serious, you should pick it up again.
>> ARTICLE
I *might* pick it up after it finishes airing but I doubt it. Tell me this, is there still Yuri in the show?
>> ARTICLE
Kinda, yeah. But it's a very relevant plot element.
>> ARTICLE
Selector Spread was at the point where I was ready to drop it, and then the latest episode happened. Guess I won't be dropping this show, shit got very real
>> ARTICLE
I usually drop series when i find myself literally falling asleep when watching them.

-Trinity Seven (i dislike generic harems so there's that too)

-Girlfriend (Zzzzzz)

-Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai (Zzzz)

-Donten ni Warau (Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz)

-HisCoool! SeHa Girls (never owned a console so..)

-Sanzoku no Musume Ronja (being cg helped too, and a little too childish)

-Orenchi no Furo Jijou (I did watch Love Stage and want none of that ever again thx)

On the edge: 

-World Trigger ([ayy lmao](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2lq1q8/toeiplsstop/))

-Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (wating for that sweet plot twist that will probably never come)
>> ARTICLE
Depending on what EP you dropped Donten ni Warau I'd recommend picking it back up, but that's just me, I enjoy historical fiction. Also i'm 3 episodes behind on Yuuki Yuuna, should i catch up?
>> ARTICLE
Last episode was quite interesting, i'm curious to know where they will take it from there.

And i dropped Donten ni Warau on the second episode, disliked the main characters.
>> ARTICLE
> Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (wating for that sweet plot twist that will probably never come)

Same director as *Angel Beats!*, *Humanity Has Declined*, and *Arpeggio of Blue Steel*, so shit'll probably get real in the last 3 episodes or so.

To be honest I could see how you think that. I think of the shows i'm watching right now it's probably one of the weakest. 

Still enjoy some moments out of each episode to keep watching though.

I think episode 3 was the weakest episode, at that point i was like "hey, maybe this isnt so brilliant after all", but i kept watching and i loved the latest few episodes. But i could still see how it wouldnt appeal to everybody, so its up to what you think
>> ARTICLE
I beg to differ. Episode 6 was by far the most cliche and uninspired out of the bunch so far. I'm just sticking to it because it's KyoAni and I'm over halfway done anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Episode six had a pretty cliche plot point, but the humor was great that episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you have very good taste in cartoons.

SO THERE SUCK ON THAT!!!
>> ARTICLE
Not really dropped, more like put on hold but:

-**Nanatsu no Taizai**: Already read the manga and don't have much time to watch it

-**Sanzoku no Musume Ronja**: Haven't even finished the first episode, but wanted to give it a try since the plot sounded aight


-**Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso**: Read the manga as well, but don't know if I'm going to pick it up from the looks of the manga. Takes too long for MC to realize/admit his feels for the girl. And half of the time I feel like to him Piano>Girl


-**Yowamushi Pedal**: Read the manga heh


-**Kiseijuu**: Overall it's hard to watch anime where I already know what happens because of the manga. Unless the manga is like a 12/10

-**World Trigger**: First episode I dropped. Tried to read the manga and dropped that after 10 or so chapters.

Everything else is still a go!
>> ARTICLE
I say pick up kiseijuu again. The right now is very good.
>> ARTICLE
The last 3 minutes of the last episode was so good, that hype with the soundtrack was perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Say what you want about the pacing but the hype skills of the show blow me away
>> ARTICLE
I only legitimately dropped **Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji**. Not because I necessarily think it's bad, but the way Kyoya treats Erika, it makes me cringe and I can't get past the cringe.
>> ARTICLE
I have dropped:

* **Girlfriend (kari)**: I just can't do it. SoL with zero plot. Basically cute girls doing cute things. Not my thing. Dropped after Ep1.

* **Gundam: G no Reconguista**: The art style didn't go well with me. Even though I'm a big mecha fan, the characters just annoyed me way too much and it seems to be too kiddy for my liking. Dropped after halfway through episode 1.

* **Shingeki no Bahamaut**: This one is probably the most controversial. I've watched the first episode like 2 times trying to get into it, but for me I just can't. I don't like the characters at all. I'm not saying its bad, but I guess there are just some animes that won't click for everyone. Dropped after Ep 1.

* **Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete**: The animation for the series is just awful. The characters look so out of place that I just couldn't take it anymore and dropped it halfway through episode 2. The plot also seemed pretty boring to me and there was absolutely nothing interesting that stood out to make me look past the animation.   

* **World Trigger**: This one was one of the few shows that piqued my interest back when the fall 2014 season show list was announced. Definitely the biggest disappoint of the season for me. Everything just screamed boring to me and the monsters themselves are just laughable. Dropped after episode 2.  
>> ARTICLE
Funny, I accidentally watched the 4th episode of Bahamut first, had no idea what was going on, and loved it.
>> ARTICLE
I didnt really get hooked on the first episode of Bahamut either, you should consider watching at least episode 2. If you dont like it by then it just doesnt click for you
>> ARTICLE
Bahamaut I don't know if it is because of how stupid the MC looks or what but I could not get past episode 2 
>> ARTICLE
I totally understand! I didn't get into Shingeki until seriously an episode or two ago. Till then, I was just watching because I felt like I should like it, even though I didn't. I'm really on the edge with ushinawareta too - I keep thinking it might get better and have something interesting happen, but it keeps not happening... and I hate looking at the main girl and guy. I didn't even attempt on World Trigger after episode one. 

I am still watching Girlfriend though. I'll watch anything if it's cute enough, so cute girls doing cute things is perfect for me XD
>> ARTICLE
Shingeki didn't click with me until episode 3 or 4 when I realized how freaking smart and subtle the writing is (for an anime). It doesn't hold your hand and walk you through the show, characters develop quietly and their motivations, while obvious aren't explained to you the viewer but to the characters in the show. And everything the characters do make sense, Basically it's really well directed.
>> ARTICLE
Heh, yeah, and that's why I kept watching it. I'm still having trouble getting over Kaisar's pants though o__o
>> ARTICLE
Only thing I specifically remember dropping was World Trigger.

Checked out the first episode and it seemed really terrible.

Avoided Terra Formars since I heard about the censorship, but from the discussions it doesn't look like it'd be my cup of tea anyway.

Still watching 27 shows from the season. 80% of which are thoroughly amazing.
>> ARTICLE
>Still watching 27 shows from the season. 80% of which are thoroughly amazing  

22 shows this season make the cut as "amazing"? I can't fathom how one can be that easily amused.
>> ARTICLE
While 80% may have been a little bit of hyperbole (or might not have been since I'm excluding the 5 or so shows I fell behind on during the exam period)

* Akatsuki no Yona

* Amagi Brilliant Park

* Cross Ange

* Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken

* FS/N UBW

* Hitsugi no Chaika 2 

* Gugure! Kokkuri-san

* Parasyte

* Log Horizon 2

* Madan no Ou to Vanadis

* Nanatsu no Taizai

* Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji

* Ore Twintails ni Narimasu

* WIXOSS

* Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso

* Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis

* Shirobako

* Sword Art Online II

are all exceptional examples of their relevant genres and the shows that I haven't included because I fell behind on them were looking to be quite exceptional as well.
>> ARTICLE
There were a few shows I dropped for the reason of that I was watching a few more shows than I usually do this season, but I decided to pick most of them back up. Stuff like Okami Shoujo and Shingeki no Bahamut I stopped after the first episode, but came back to them around when the 3rd episodes came out. I also stopped watching Cross Ange at the first episode just cause I didn't think to much would happen that I would like, but people are saying it's cool so I'll probably catch up with it in a few days. Daitoshokan I have on hold cause I wanna read the VN first, which will take quite a while since I'll actually have to get somewhere in my Japanese studies.

Edit: Oh yeah, I forgot about Grisaia no Kajitsu. Although that's less so because it's kind of a rushed adaptation, but mostly because I finally finished the VN after a year so I kind of want to distance myself from it until the sequels get translated.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually really surprised with Ange. With the SEED guy involved and those ridiculous pilot suits, I was expecting a complete trainwreck. However, they manage to fit a ton into the 24 minutes they have per episode, the theme/concept is interesting, and the mecha are really cool with the motorcycle-style controls. 
>> ARTICLE
Drops: Inou-Battle, Madan no Ou to Vanadis, Garo, World Trigger  

* **Inou-Battle**: 3 episodes. Not my style of anime, I was hoping it'd be more than a school/slice of life since it had the seemly interesting powers, but it wasn't.
* **Madan no Ou to Vanadis**: 3 episodes. Too much random harem and ecchi, several questionable character decisions (like archer goes in the middle of the road to shoot enemy, prisioner with lots of freedon gets an army, general raids house alone with no protection and so on).
* **Garo the Animation**: 5 episodes. I liked the show, but it is so forgetable that I forget watching it, I don't know why. I may continue watching someday.
* **World Trigger**: 3 episodes. Kuga was too annoying with that =3= face, show didn't manage to pick my interest. 
>> ARTICLE
dropped grisaia no kajitsu because i had no clue what was happening
>> ARTICLE
The visual novel is better in the sense that it actually explains things in detail and it develops the character's backgrounds. The anime adaption cuts out 90% of all content in the VN, and that is the reason why for anime-only viewers, some things seem rushed and make no sense whatsoever.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped:
**World Trigger** : Completely unlikeable characters and just really genuinely stupid dialogue. I'm pretty new to anime but this is probably the worst show I've seen yet.

I haven't watched:
**Psycho Pass 2** : I'm just planning on marathoning it once the season is over because I'm lazy and can't watch it on Crunchyroll. Enjoyed the first season a lot though.

I'm thinking of dropping Grisia or whatever it's called because it honestly seems pretty lame and I've never played a VN before so I don't really understand the appeal. I just don't get it.

I'm tempted to drop Log Horizon 2 because it's been 1.5 seasons and literally nothing has happened. They have an interesting premise and good characters so I'll stick with it in the hopes that it lives up to the hype but right now it just seems so slow and flat. For as much as people rag on SAO at least the characters do things and give a shit about what's going on around them. Log Horizon 2 characters get stuck in a game and just sit around in a city. They don't try to get out or get stronger, they spend an entire season learning how to cook.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the need to point this out whenever people compare SAO/LH2. You may or may not be aware of it already. 

Log Horizon character's are **not** stuck in a game. They woke up in an alternate reality that mirrored the game. The game wasn't a VR like SAO, it was a keyboard and mouse game like we have today. 

Imagine going to bed and waking up in WoW/Everquest/insert fantasy MMO. It has no end to beat, and there is no obvious goal/way to go back to their reality. Its just an alternate world/reality that has some game like mechanics, but **not** an actual game (at least no more so than real life is). Personally I think stabilizing a society and proceeding to use your collective resources for the task is the best route which is exactly what they're doing.

That said this season (Log Horizon 2) has pacing and animation issues up the wazzu.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I don't think it's necessarily an important distinction, but thanks for the clarification. I don't think that the way they act given the circumstances is very reasonable (stuck in a game or in an alternate reality), particularly if they are supposed to be the "heroes" of a story and that's my biggest complaint. As a result I feel like the characters (after the set up) feel very flat. They feel (and act) a lot like NPCs would in a video game. Very static. They just don't act like human beings would given the situation. There is just no urgency.

That being said I've never seen/read the source material and maybe it's all a pacing issue with the anime. I'll stick with it and hope it becomes good. Honestly the main reason I would compare it to SAO is because everyone who talks about them compares them. SAO has it's own problems, but I've always liked that it takes a pretty real approach to human nature. People in stressful situations panic and make poor decisions. People who are trapped try to escape. People in a game act like they would in a game.
>> ARTICLE
Well its a major distinction because if they were trapped in a game there would be a way out and/or a chance of rescue. As it stands "a way out" of their reality is about as realistic a goal as flying to Alpha Centari is to us. Something that is theoretically possible, but we have neither the knowledge or resources to do it. It isn't like SAO where they have the clear goal "beat the game and be free". 
>> ARTICLE
**Denk gai no honya san**, comedy is hit or miss, bland overall. I was hoping for a character driven comedy, I got a comedy with caricatures. Dropped at episode 3

**Gogure kokkiri San** felt very sparse to me, it's pretty funny but doesn't have enough substance to hold me. Dropped at episode 3

**Ookami  shoujo** I hate every character they all are unnecessarily awful people. Plus every episode feels the exact same. Dropped at episode 4

**chaika** maybe it's because I I'm not marathoning this season but it doesn't have enough to hold my attention. Plus I never found chaika cute or endearing. It feels like I'm being retold things I already know every single episode.


Shows on the edge of being dropped:

**Inou Battle** needs to either get to the battle section of the show or add a heaping dose of Mirei.
>> ARTICLE
I just decided to drop UBW. Because Emiya is too generic of a MC.
>> ARTICLE
**Denki-gai no Honya-san** - bored  
**Grisaia no Kajitsu** - Not interested in the premise  
**Gugure! Kokkuri-san** - moe by itself isn't enough to interest me  
**HisCoool! SeHa Girls** - Seriously?  
**Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de** - Interesting premise, but it's a comedy/harem, it's not taking its own premise seriously at all so dropped.  
**Magic Kaito 1412** - Just boring.  
**Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji** - So this being what it is, I expect the girl to fall for the jerk guy. Except he's not just "a jerk", he's a blackmailing douchebag. Unless I get spoilered that she *doesn't* fall in love with him, this is staying dropped.  
**Sanzoku no Musume Ronja** - Just boring. I guess I had higher expectations from Studio Ghibli.   
**Terra Formars** - Ridiculous censorship ruins any little enjoyment that could be found from such a premise. The dumb decisions characters make didn't help either.  
**Trinity Seven** - Not interested in the premise.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped all of those shows except for Trinity Seven. Given the amount of other great shows we have this season, I can't justify spending time watching something I don't particularly like unless the season happens to be slow. 
>> ARTICLE
Grisaia no Kajitsu: The fan service is kind of dumb, to be honest (every girl getting a panty shot in the first episode kind of sets a tone), and I find none of the characters interesting. And it honestly made me kind of angry that they tried to argue that the girl who *pulled a knife on someone they just met* had traits that *totally* make up for it. Trying to cut strangers is kind of a dealbreaker in my opinion. Maybe there's something in her backstory that justifies it, but that doesn't change the fact that the way the characters reacted given the information they had at the time was just nuts.

Inou Battle: The promotional blurb made it sound interesting, but then the actual show came out...I guess I was expecting more from Trigger. The art style is kind of generic and the moments of beautiful Trigger animation are very sparse, and the otaku pandering is a bit much for me. Not that I mind a bit of otaku pandering, but it feels like the show doesn't offer anything else.

Dropped
Sora no Method - Bored me to death after episode 3
Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso - The story and characters bore me
>> ARTICLE
Yes! Sora no Method = Boring
>> ARTICLE
* Gugure! Kokkuri-san - I don't know. Nichijou is one of my favorite shows but I guess this show's humor just didn't click with me.
* Akame ga Kill! - It would not do this show Justice to keep watching.
* Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete - With a start like that I was hoping this would turn out to be the next Steins;Gate. But I couldn't find anything particularly likable about the characters and the CGI bothers me.
* Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai - Did this show get anywhere yet? The humor is great at times but the original premise kinda got lost by the wayside and I'm behind by two episodes with little motivation to continue.
* Sora no Method - It's pretty, but also not much happening for the first 5 episodes.

Honorable mention:

* Karen Senki - My golly this show is terrible but I'm doggedly keeping up every week to see if it can get any worse.

^^Still ^^Watching: ^^UBW, ^^Amagi ^^Brilliant ^^Park, ^^Chaika, ^^Twintails, ^^Bahamut
>> ARTICLE
On the topic of Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai, it's a bit boring and really shouldn't have taken half the series to get into the plot and explain the whole "Shepard" thing. I'd only recommend picking it back up if you liked the MC as it completely revolves around him deciding if he wants to help people or just be a selfish dick at this point.

Ok thanks! I'll wait until it finishes airing then before deciding if its worth picking back up.
>> ARTICLE
Your Lie in April. This is a show I wanna watch in one sitting when I'm in the mood for that type of anime. It's really really good IMO, sucks that I have to wait but whatever.
>> ARTICLE
Not called dropping m8, it's called putting a show on hold! 
>> ARTICLE
Never said I dropped it?
>> ARTICLE
I don't drop series but put them on-hold instead and here they're:

* Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai - Didn't seem to get any better and I fell behind on the episodes.
* Donten ni Warau - I don't like Historical settings.
* Girlfriend (Kari) - Looks terrible and I don't like CGDCT series.
* Gundam: G no Reconguista - I don't even know why I started this, it looks a bit old and I didn't understand anything at all.
* Ore, Twintails no Narimasu. - Boring as fuck.
* Sora no Method - CGDCT.
* Terra Formars - Horrible censoring, I'll pick up the manga instead.
* World Trigger - Toei butchering the series, the white haired guy was annoying.

EDIT: I'm gonna assume that most downvotes comes from saying that Twintails was boring as fuck. If you disagree with me then tell me what makes it enjoyable and I would be glad to discuss it.
>> ARTICLE
If you don't really like mecha shows and generally don't know about Tomino's shows, I say wait until a few more weeks to see if you the show got better for you. It started to pick up in this week's episode and it will probably get better as it goes on.
>> ARTICLE
> Ore, Twintails no Narimasu. - Boring as fuck

Kruzy! What are you *saying*?! >:|

Mind letting us know your reasons why? Just curious. :3
>> ARTICLE
The animation is whacky. The story is stupid. The characters are annoying. 

You have a guy with a twintail fetish fighting a bunch of perverted monsters over and over. It felt like it's trying too hard to be funny and the whole subreddit treating it as the second coming of Jesus doesn't make it any better. Half-way through episode 4 I just said Fuck it, there is better shit to watch than this.
>> ARTICLE
im glad there are still sane people left without a twintailfetish
>> ARTICLE
We are a very quiet minority around here.
>> ARTICLE
There are dozens of us!
>> ARTICLE
I hate how people have the need to insult those that have different tastes than them.

Oh, you like Twintails? Clearly you have a FETISH for them. Because we live in a black and white world right?
>> ARTICLE
lol calm down and fap on some twintails
>> ARTICLE
    >doesn't have a logical retort
    >resorts to childish comeback of telling me to fap to something I like

You're right about one thing

>no point to argue with a salty hater

;)

>> ARTICLE
no point to argue with a guy who likes the shittiest anime of the year + stalks my comment history hahahhaha
>> ARTICLE
so saalllllllllltyyyyy ;)
>> ARTICLE
whatever helps you sleep at night, twintail weeb
>> ARTICLE
In it's defense, I watch it with friends while drunk and it's amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Im starting to regret watchn these LH2 episodes, and ive jus accepted to watch Trinity seven with 0 fucks given xD
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Denki Gai,Trinity Seven, Yuki Yuna is a Hero, mainly because I didn't start them and I've been busy as hell this semester so episodes have been piling up. I might pick them back up to binge them at the end of the season. Other shows I may be dropping might be Celestial Method, Girlfriend Beta, Grisaia, and Gugure! Kokkuri-san. I think I might power through those though. The first episodes had me a little hooked.
 
>> ARTICLE
Gugure! Kokkuri-san: Loved the first episode, but with the introduction of Inugami the show just stopped being funny.
>> ARTICLE
I'm waiting on a lot of episodes for shows like in search of the lost future, lord marksman, and many more 
>> ARTICLE
World Trigger: I really wanted to like it but the animation and awkward spaces drove me away. (episode 2)

Ookami Shoujo: Characters are unbearable and the girl is so stupid. (episode 3)

Akame ga Kill: I really wanted to like this one too but I hate [](/s "when they keep introducing characters only to kill them off. 3 of my favourites are dead and I just don't want to keep watching people die. Plus I really don't like Mine.") (episode 6)
>> ARTICLE
Having dropped any because I didn't pick up much to begin with. Picked up whatever was on CR minus whatever seemed to be getting bad reviews + Shingeki no Bahamut(Funi) and Fate/Stay(Hulu).

If I absolutely had to choose one to drop, it would either be Gugure (because it can be slow at times) or Sora no Method (because middle school drama).
>> ARTICLE
* Grisaia no Kajitsu - I'm reading the VN instead, it's a lot better
* Ookami Shoujo - The characters were either boring or unlikable
* Sora no Method - I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and all I got was little kids fighting about things that I didn't have enough knowledge about to care (i.e the saucer) 

>> ARTICLE
**World Trigger** Couldn't get into it because of the animation, dropped halfway through the first episode.

**Terra formars** Unappealing premise

**Girlfriend(Kari)**I want the 20min of my life i spend watching this back T-T
>> ARTICLE
Fate. Looks amazing, but I feel like watching it would spoil me or something.
>> ARTICLE
That's kind of a stupid reason to drop a show :D
Just watch it as the last show of the week or something, otherwise put it on hold and marathon it when it finished airing next summer.
>> ARTICLE
I'm waiting for A week I have off, and gonna marathon everything from the universe.
>> ARTICLE
dropped world trigger. uninteresting mc's.
>> ARTICLE
Terra Formars. I imagine the manga is decent, but everything is just so poorly executed; the pacing is incredibly slow, and I have no reason to care about any of these characters. There's just no exposition.
>> ARTICLE
* **Cross Ange**: Got bored of it after 4 episodes.

* **Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai**: After 5 episodes didn't really care about this show anymore.

* **Donten ni Warau**: Couldn't even finish the 3rd episode before dropping it.

* **Garo: Honoo no Kokuin**: Dropped after 3 episodes. Wanted to know more about the prince than the main.

* **Girlfriend (Kari)**: Grew tired of it after 2 episodes.

* **Grisaia no Kajitsu**: Everything just felt too rushed so decided to just finish VN and maybe giving this another try.

* **Madan no Ou to Vanadis**: For me pacing for this show felt awful. In 6 episodes it felt like the show just went everywhere.

* **Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji**: Not my cup of tea.

* **Sora no Method**: Wasn't enjoying this show.

* **Terra Formars**: Not the best story and censored episodes.

* **Trinity Seven**: OK for a harem anime but nothing else was good about it.

* **Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete**: Was interesting at first but then just fell off from there.

* **World Trigger**: =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3= =3=

* **Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru**: OST was nice but it didn't interest me after 4 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
World trigger. Seemed poop

Sora no method.  Got a few episodes saved, just never watched.

Akatsuki - idk.  I just havent gone back.


>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who likes World Trigger? Lmao.
>> ARTICLE
animes 
>> ARTICLE
Dropped:

* Grisaia no Kajitsu, because I'm going to read the VN.

* Sora no Method, because I'm going to wait for it to end.

* Karen Senki, because it's shit.

* Cross Ange, because it's shit.
>> ARTICLE
I think saying "because it's shit" is kind of a cop-out. It'd be more informative to explain what made you decide it's shit. 
>> ARTICLE
Cross ange is pretty cringy but it gets better after 3-4 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
My group of friends that never watch currently airing shows are meeting up with me to watch Cross Ange every week, solely because it's just a train wreck. 

We enjoy watching it so much that i don't know if we're still making fun of it or if we actually like it now.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat...
>> ARTICLE
I'm prepared to be downvoted but I dropped fate stay night have no idea what's going on for real but I do intend too come back to it later after I finish some other shows 
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched Fate Zero? It will make more sense if you watch it before FSN :)
>> ARTICLE
Is Fate Zero the original ?
>> ARTICLE
No, but it was created as a prequel to FSN. It explains everything about the Holy Grail War and the motivations of some of the characters in FSN :)
>> ARTICLE
If you're interested in the world, I recommend picking up the visual novel. Unlimited Blade Works is the second route, so you're kind of supposed to know what's going on, and it's basically just eye-candy for us VN readers. The first route of the visual novel will explain the relevant mechanics of the Type-Moon universe, although there's plenty that it doesn't go over since they're more relevant in Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai, and others.
>> ARTICLE
**Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso-** Disliked the female lead and how aggressive/pushy she was. Also found it somewhat boring even though I enjoyed the music. 

**World Trigger-** hated the =3 face and the animation didn't leave much to be desired.

**Denki-Gai no Honya-san-** The comedy fell flat for me. Felt like the characters were trying too hard to be crude and it didn't seem fitting at all. 

**Girlfriend (Kari)-**  Cute girls doing cute things is simply not enough.

**Ore, Twintails no Narimasu-** Didn't find it funny which takes away its biggest strength. 

**Sora no method-** Not a fan of little kid drama. The start was also quite boring and uneventful. 


 
>> ARTICLE
> CGDCT 

Thank you ! Finally found someone who dropped Sora no Method. That show was literally a sleeping pill
>> ARTICLE
I'm putting Log Horizon on hold for the moment - I'm not a huge fan of the art and the story seems a bit jumbled and rushed (after 5 episodes)


>> ARTICLE
I'm also on the same boat as you. Fit me it just seems soooo boring. I find Akatsuki's not even an interesting character and the dialogue is so bland, repetitive and cliche. There's very little I find impressive about this series.
>> ARTICLE
The only show I've dropped with no intention of picking it up again later is **Karen Senki**. Unless you count **Akame ga Kill** since it's still airing from last season.

I'm waiting on more episodes to binge through for **Terra Formars**, **Selector Infected WIXOSS** and **Ronja the Robber's Daughter**.
>> ARTICLE
I feel pretty good, of 15 shows I only dropped 3. 

* Girlfriend: I was never that much into it, and dropped it in the first episode when that German/French girl started talking in that horrible horrible excuse for language. It's probably the shallowest reason I've ever had to drop an anime, but like I said, I was never that much into it so I would've probably dropped it for whatever other reason later on. 

* Inou Battle Wa Nichijou: Another one I was never that much into. Three episode rule, felt pretty generic and genuinely uninteresting. Dropped. 

*  Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai: This one was pretty much the same. Watched the first two episodes. Way too generic and uninteresting. Dropped. 

I also have Shirobako and Log Horizon 2 kinda sorta on hold (nothing especially wrong with them, I just don't feel like watching them right now).  

Other than that I'm really up to date with the rest of my list, so I'm happy. 
>> ARTICLE
Well at first I would have agreed with you about Inou Battle but what really sets it apart from the other generic harems is the MC.  Andou is a harem MC that is actually intelligent and knows what to say at the right times. 
>> ARTICLE
His only personality is that he is nice to the girls and helps them out when they are going through some hard times. Just like every harem MC.  Ohh and he's chuuni.   
>> ARTICLE
Can't say I really noticed it, man... To me he was pretty average. 
>> ARTICLE
It started of quite generic, but because I know that Trigger studios produced some great stuff before (Kill la Kill), I gave it a chance, and I feel like it's picking up pace. It's still not amazing, but I do enjoy watching it every week.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus Fuck, how many of these threads do we need?

Well, notable drops people hate me for:
Shirobako
Twintails
Inou Battle
Trinity Seven
>> ARTICLE
I also dropped Shiroback, but also tune in from time to time to check the episodes.

It's realistic in a sense where people fuck up and drop their issues on one another, but again it keeps the light tone and resolving them with an optimistic outlook.
>> ARTICLE
Grisaia no Kajitsu - I hated all of the characters except Michiru. i get the feeling i wouldn't like the VN either. 

Akame ga Kill -read the manga and it was a pretty meh shonen. The main characters die before I even get a chance to like them.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso - Kaori's eyes really bother me. But no, I'm gonna watch it later by marathoning it.

Terraformars - gonna marathon it later. 

Twintails - I only have so much time in the day and that's not enough time for twintails
>> ARTICLE
> Twintails - I only have so much time in the day and that's not enough time for twintails

I find your lack of attribute disturbing, give up sleep:)
>> ARTICLE
D: Not enough time for twintails? There should always be enough time for twintails! XD 
>> ARTICLE
* Garo: Honoo no Kokuin: Just not interesting enough.
* Gugure! Kokkuri-san: Got bored the first 9 min cause I didn't like the girl and the "humor".
* Magic Kaito 1412: I thought the heists would be more interesting, also the characters are meh.
* Sora no Method: Nothing really happend the first episodes.
* Terra Formers: Characters were boring and nothing interesting was happening.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped Denki-Gai because the comedy just did not work for me. 
>> ARTICLE
**Dropped**
- World Trigger: I like it but there are better shows out

- Orenchi Furo: Ok comedy but I don't have time for it

- Trinity Seven: Boring

- Ai Tenchi Muyo: Idk what this is about

- Karen Senki: wtf is this garbage

- Tribe Cool Crew: idk what this is

- Dengki gai Honya: boring

- Terraformars: censorship

**On Hold** 

- Magic Kaito 1412: I'm pretty behind but I like it so far. Might restart once I get more time

- Gundam G Reco: I have no idea what is going on in this show
>> ARTICLE
I have not dropped anything but I do plan to watch Fate/stay night and Mushishi when the dubs come out hopefully.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Read the thread title again.
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda freaking out right now.

We're back, it's as if those 7 years never happened and the show just continued.  If it keeps going strong I think this will easily be AoTS for me, hell it'll probably be AotY as well.  Its contemplative beauty is just so stunning.  

And boy do I love that new op.
>> ARTICLE
Having finished the first series, I find it wonderful that they began this season with a depiction of mushi as a benign (perhaps neutral) preternatural force - the first season didn't paint as kind a picture of them in the beginning. 
>> ARTICLE
I could be wrong but doesn't Ginko mention that most of the mushi are rather harmless.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Tundranocaps gave a good example above. They are not malicious. They're like bacteria, neutral and simply living like anything else. They can just cause bad stuff to happen.
>> ARTICLE
Well, he's a Mushishi, he's a doctor. He usually comes around when things go wrong, so it makes sense most of the episodes he's in are with "harmful" Mushishi.

Even if they're harmful, they're still "neutral" in the same way a wave can lap at your feet or be a tsunami.
>> ARTICLE
I LOVE the new opening! I was expecting Ally Kerr again. What a pleasant surprise! (Shiver by Lucy Rose if anybody was wondering.)

I totally didn't tear up or anything. That would never happen. No sir.

It's back, and I couldn't be any more pleased.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who can easily change their mind about an anime by music alone, I feel like I have to watch s1 now because that song is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
S1 op was amazing as well. It's called (I believe) "The Sore Feet Song."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBBFDb0hC4Y&feature=kp
>> ARTICLE
The song at the beginning was Shiver by Lucy Rose. It says it in the opening near the end.
>> ARTICLE
Lol, I was looking in the end credits! Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
[Link for the lazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0DegEdeCLs)

Also here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o84y-5-cO0) to the full song. 
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't tell if the visuals in the OP were real or fake, that shit was Makoto Shinkai level
>> ARTICLE
Right? I was staring so hard to try and figure it out. I'm still not sure. If it was fake, it was the realest fake scene ever.
>> ARTICLE
That music video is stunning.  Fits the song so well.
>> ARTICLE
I just realized the music video tells the story of a guy that lost his girl.

That's like one-third of the outcomes in this show.
>> ARTICLE
I went coma after the Opening. The music was so beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Seven years later, and we are back in business, baby. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow. I was hyped for Jojo and it really got my blood boiling because of the sheer awesome. Decided I'd watch Mushishi as a way to calm myself down and holy shit did it work.

Everything from the opening onward was just designed to put me at complete ease. The most intense scene was when the kid tripped and caught himself or when they chased him for a few seconds. 

I used to watch the first season on Funimation channel at like 8:00 in the morning before school started because it was an amazing way to wake up. I welcome these new episodes with open arms.
>> ARTICLE
Same. I'll eventually rewatch the first season with subs, but I watched the dub on TV back in high school, so it's weird hearing the original voice for Ginko.
>> ARTICLE
Ya, that's the boat I'm on, though I only watched Mushishi about six months ago. Ginko's voice just sounds *wrong* to me. I...I might actually have to wait until this season gets dubbed before I finish it.
>> ARTICLE
You had a funimation channel?  Jealous.
>> ARTICLE
[I love my life so much right now.](http://i.imgur.com/R604gyN.gif) It really doesn't get any better than this. All aboard the *Mushishi* hype-train! Choo choo motherfucker!

Also, for those of you who're trying to add Zoku Shou to your watching list on MAL but it won't let you, hopefully the mods at MAL will push the update I made to the airing date - right now, it says the air date is April 5th, even though it already aired.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call it a hype-train, more like a nice relaxing hype sail boat.
>> ARTICLE
It let me add it, so I'm not sure why it wont let you.
>> ARTICLE
It won't let you move it to "Watching" from your anime list page if it's in "Planned". You can get around it if you go to the series page and change it manually to watching. However, it'll randomly change it back to your planned list sometime later - that's what I did last night, and this morning it got moved back to my "Planned" list. I just moved it back to watching; hopefully, it'll stick this time.
>> ARTICLE
I had it in my "Planned" list and still let me move it even though it says "not yet aired"
>> ARTICLE
Ah. I didn't have it in my plan to watch so that's probably why.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I binged the last 10 episodes + OVA yesterday.  I'm running on three hours' sleep but I feel great!  Guess I got some Kouki flowin' through me ;)
>> ARTICLE
Who would of thought mushi like to drink? I'm heavily considering going to grab so sake and re-watch this episode in the right state of mind and hope to god I see something cool, fingers crossed, lol.
>> ARTICLE
Mushi are always a bit Shinto, and all gods partake of Sake.  Monogatari references this idea as well, both back in bake with Senjou drinking a bit of sake to commune with her crab god, and in the most reason season with Nadeko getting offered sake by Kaiki.  There was also the sake cup back in Mushishi season 1 ep 1
>> ARTICLE
Remember it needs a golden glow ;)
>> ARTICLE
Your so right....anyone know how to get in contact with Rokusuke? lol
>> ARTICLE
That was everything I hoped it would be. Same as always, magical.
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful OP :3 Yes, sometimes it pays to take an already existing song, where you know what you're going to get, and can fit it to the show.

This was a little piece of real magic, wasn't it? I like how in some episodes, and this is hardly the first, Ginko is just some wanderer wandering through someone else's narrative. The place where the real and the fantastical intersect.

Also, copy of a copy, and yet striving to be real on its own merits, is what the son's sake is.

>> ARTICLE
We're in for some loooong weeks boys.
>> ARTICLE
>:[ 
Damn time
>> ARTICLE
We must fill the void with a dozen other shows, stay strong!
>> ARTICLE
Man, I missed this show. That new OP was heaven. It looks like this could be just as good as last season if this episode's any indicator.
>> ARTICLE
SO LONG HAVE I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS, AND DAMN IT WAS WORTH IT

Definitely loved this episode. The music and storytelling - mmmmmmmm. Waiting a week for the next episode will be terrible...
>> ARTICLE
Definitely got shivers this episode. Very comfy.
>> ARTICLE
That was a great first episode. The ost and OP were great as always , I missed this show so much.
>> ARTICLE
i have so many shows to catch up on, i have to catch up on some of last seasons shows and i have to catch up on jojo's prequel and mushishi prequel im in for a week of marathoning
>> ARTICLE
I'm just going to hold off on Jojo for now, maybe over summer.
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend you put space in between Mushishi because it is a bad show to marathon. Watch 2-3 per sitting tops or at least an episode of something else in between every couple
>> ARTICLE
It's the perfect one-before-bedtime anime.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, it calms you while lots of anime will either get you pumped up or emotional
>> ARTICLE
probably the AOTS just by the first episode, head and shoulders above any other anime released so far
>> ARTICLE
and torso, basin, legs... the rest are at his feet, as literally as possible.

>> ARTICLE
Finally out!
>> ARTICLE
Hooray, finally got to finish the episode!  Great as expected, beautiful art, music, and story as always.  Great start to my first season, and I loved that Isaza cameo!
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know how much of the manga the first season covered?
>> ARTICLE
They covered about 5, and a little bit of 6, of the 10 volumes. The OVA was separate from the manga, so we're more or less looking at the same pacing as the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, it's still Mushishi. Artsy, chill, and still beautiful. One thing that I noticed that felt strange is that certain movements felt like they were really dragged out. Like a guy turning over his shoulder would take a full 2 seconds. But hey, I'm happy to see this airing again.
>> ARTICLE
damn, we get this AND stardust crusaders at the same time, this is gonna be a good season
>> ARTICLE
I've waited way too long for this. Just as perfect as I remember it.
>> ARTICLE
The first episode was pleasant as always, can't wait for more.  

Mushishi is the best kind of show. Beautiful, thought provoking, incredibly relaxing yet never boring and always keeping me deeply interested and attentive of what is happening. Such an absolute joy to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I love the art style, the way the world is put together and how people act.  I was so sad when Mushi ended the first time, now it is back!!!
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if they will continue where the OVA left off, with Ginko bringing Tanyu the shard. I hope so, can't get enough of that ship.
>> ARTICLE
My ears are so hard for the narrations.   
>> ARTICLE
A relaxing episode about sake. A nice way to reintroduce the show before delving into the bitter-sweet stories.

I also liked how this episode adds to the mushi mythos.
>> ARTICLE
Very great episode imo.

I didn't watch the OVA, is that a problem or not?
>> ARTICLE
Well since the show is episodic and none of the episodes tell the same story, the OVA is just like a regular episode that's twice as long. No reason not to watch it!
>> ARTICLE
You can watch this first, but I suggest watching the OVA soon.  It's really good IMO.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I watched the OVA to get re-acquainted with the series, it's been a while since I've watched the first season.
>> ARTICLE
I am so glad I held off watching the first season of Mushishi until a couple months ago. Even then the wait was unbearable. Its so good to be back! I can't wait for a certain ship to set sail....get it Gin!!
>> ARTICLE
It's been awhile, but it's finally back! And it started just as good as the original! I love the intro song, was pleasantly surprised by it. The art is fantastic as usual. This is already looking to be AoTS for me! 
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people are saying that in this thread which I think is hilarious because most of this season's shows haven't aired yet!  But I understand the excitement, I'm excited too!
>> ARTICLE
Haha, very true. I guess I should at least give other shows a chance first!  This one just seems really promising! 
>> ARTICLE
Such a relaxing show. A great way to end the work week.
>> ARTICLE
I love that this show is back, I watched the first season last year so I'm not dealing with that 7 year wait but it's still awesome having more episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Should i watch the prequel before i start this? is that important?
>> ARTICLE
Not really, the episodes are pretty much all one offs. That being said, I highly recommend you do watch it since it is such a great show. Also there are a few recurring characters who you won't recognize unless you watched the first season.
>> ARTICLE
So it's like Space Dandy then?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
also mushishi is actually a good show 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
True. I would have said while Space Dandy is good. Mushishi is objectively amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily. There are some episodes in this series that will relate, but everything you'd need to know would be in the preface to each episode, or in the OVA if you watch that.
>> ARTICLE
I see, thank you.
>> ARTICLE
You should always watch shows in release order.

In my experience it's very rare to have a previous season that's skippable and not really worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but release order doesn't necessarily mean chronological.
>> ARTICLE
chronological is not necessarily the order you should watch it.
>> ARTICLE
True, but it is often the way it will make sense.
>> ARTICLE
if it didn't make sense in release order than there would never be prequels made

something has to stand on its own enough for people to like it before you start trying to fit more non-chronological stories in
>> ARTICLE
A lot of shows that mess with chronological ordering of events end up being better for it. Suzumiya TV airing is much better then the Bluray, or Bacanno is all over the place and is better for it.

So, stick with the release order, it can have nice surprises and doesn't spoil things.
>> ARTICLE
The only exceptions I can think of are remakes that fix the problems of the older series, like the new JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders and the Hunter x Hunter reboot.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking of White Album 2 and the Fate/Stay Night anime.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Mushishi is known for being an extremely episodic series. You should probably watch the [original series](http://myanimelist.net/anime/457/Mushishi) to get a better appreciation for the Mushishi universe, but there isn't a whole lot you need to know. From what I recall, some important things include Ginko's backstory and what the "Kouki" is.
>> ARTICLE
OK. I'll watch the prequel and return next week then.
>> ARTICLE
Try not to marathon it, put some space between the episodes otherwise you won't be able to fully appreciate it. I would recommend 2-3 per sitting tops or at least watching something in between
>> ARTICLE
don't marathon this show... you are going to enjoy it better if you take your time to watch it, try watching 1 episode per day, this is one of the most relaxing shows ever and you will get a feeling of comfiness every time you watch an episode. If you marathon this you will probably no appreciate it that much as if you'd take your time to watch it 
>> ARTICLE
>Should i watch the prequel before i start this?

Yes

>is that important?

No
>> ARTICLE
Then I will start the prequel.
>> ARTICLE
MFW http://i.imgur.com/V4TwWJM.gif
20/10 AOTS. Pretty sure this new OP actually managed to top the original. If not a really close tie.
>> ARTICLE
A great opening episode for the new series! Glad they didn't start on one of their more depressing episodes. They're easing us in to it.

By the way, does anyone know what "zoku shou" means?
>> ARTICLE
Do I need to watch S1 to watch S2? I have the first season DL'd but it's taking me forever to watch. Mushishi doesn't really lend itself to marathoning.
>> ARTICLE
Finally...Everything I hoped it to be.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god so I totally on a whim marathoned the first season of Mushishi yesterday because a friend recommended it to me a couple weeks ago. I looked up stuff on MAL and found out about the new season today and saw when it was airing... april... fifth? holy shit that was yesterday! I was so sad when it was over, but now I can just happily continue the amazing journey! This is seriously one of the best shows and I'm so excited for whats to come. And it looks like this season is gonna hold up to the last very well.

I really want to watch this right now, but I don't like Crunchyroll's subtitles. Does anyone know where I can see which groups are planning to subtitle this? Hopefully niizk will be doing it again.

Almost the entire series is the same. If I remember right, there is one part that spans two episodes, or maybe it's just that one thing comes up again in a second episode. But yeah, if you didn't like the first few episodes, you wouldn't like any of them, damn near nothing changes.

I can't fathom /r/anime's obsession with it, truly. I get that it's well animated, and well arranged, and I enjoyed watching it, but it just seems uninspired, and the overall setting seems poorly thought out (Mushi seem to have no consistent rules to them, like magic in the worst way). It's ***just*** a series of simple stories with mushi made up to create conflict.

>Mushi seem to have no consistent rules to them, like magic in the worst way

I think it's magic in the best way. When magic has strict rules, it doesn't feel like magic to me. I like how the mushi are this drifting force that subtly influence life in various ways. I think it strikes a good balance between something recognizable and something humans can never truly grasp.
>> ARTICLE
>I can't fathom /r/anime[1] 's obsession with it, truly.

Is it so hard to realize that /r/anime has 150k subs and different people like different things? 

For example I can never in my life figure out how seasonal shounens are getting such a huge following even though most of them are seeping shitty writing and have glaring problems. I don't really like that kind of entertainment. However, Mushishi is objectively a great show. Doesn't mean everyone has to like it or even tolerate it though. I say objectively, because I haven't seen anyone saying that the show is bad and backing up their statement with some analysis of why it is like that. Some people find it boring, some people hate episodic nature, but that's just a personal preference. The show explores interesting themes, the characters are quite well written and the stories are well built. Also, if I wanted to clear your confusion about Mushi being uninspired, I'd have to write way more than I am willing to do at this time, but keep in mind that it's not a show about mushi, it's a show about humans and mushi are just a tool. Btw, I find Mushi to be really awesome and the things they do are quite original, don't you agree? They are way more interesting than another alien creature trying to conquer the world or another bad guy who is bad because some arbitrary reasons. 

But that's what I enjoy. I enjoy the lack of moral extremes, I love the exploration of human nature, I revel in adventures and fancy different characters. Mushishi is a selection of simple stories telling way more than most shows. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. Again, I enjoyed it, but I don't understand why anyone thinks it's *literally* the best anime ever made, which an opinion many people here express fervently.
>> ARTICLE
Well, probably because it's the best for them. And I don't blame them. Mushishi is in my top 10 too. And it's far from the worst show to admire. I've seen around 200 different shows and Mushishi is something that stands out to me. Very few shows do things as well as this. Maybe it's not on the same level as good literature, but in anime world it's one of the highlights. Everyone has personal criteria on which they rate their consumed media. 

EDIT: Also last season was really crappy(I don't think any of the shows passed 7/10 for me). I am genuinely excited for some good shows. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a personal favorite. I can easily imagine myself watching the whole series every few years, verry little shows get two or more watches from me.

As for why, it has a great universe to explore, very calm tone (not a lot of shows can do this), is not in your face but you pick up stuff as you go. A really well done slice of life in an alternate universe.

It's the closest I've seen to a really good book in anime media. Now, I'm not trying to be a troll here, but just like a book you need to not have ADD for this series, which is a problem in today world since we are all sensitized to everything being NOW (I notice ADD in myself from time to time, hard to get rid of...)
>> ARTICLE
It stays episodic, I heard someone once say it was "bedtime stories." That's a good description, they're just interesting stories.  You do learn a bit about Ginko and there are a few recurring characters.
>> ARTICLE
Since Im posting the thread this week, I suppose I should kick things off.

Man, its been a LONG time since I watched any anime. 3 weeks, in fact, according to my MAL when I updated it today with all that Ive watched in the past week, and even then I only watched episode 1 of Brynhildr in the Darkness. Dunno what caused this, considering its the middle of summer before my Freshman year of college and I have nothing better to do, but whatever. At least this week was better.

**Persona 4: The Animation (6-16):**

As Im replaying the game currently, I decided I should continue watching the anime, which I had started several months back on a whim and then randomly stopped watching (just like almost every other show I pick up). I have to say, I did not quite expect the anime to somehow be so goddamn hilarious. It honestly made some of the funny moments in the game from chuckle-level to oh god, my sides hurt so much. Much of this is probably due to the personality they gave Yu, which is to say make him a complete and utter goddamn troll, who I am pretty sure knows hes a complete troll in at least some capacity. 

**Usagi Drop (1-2):**

Ive only watched 2 episodes of this, and I am already developing diabetes. By the end of this show, itll probably be the most severe case the world has ever seen.

**Sakura Trick (1-7):**

[I think this video just about sums up what I feel about the series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtW_SXe8Cv0&feature=youtu.be&t=3m44s)

No, but seriously, I like what I see. There is a lot of very obvious fanservice, which is what I expected going in, but theres also a lot of daww moments without an overwhelming amount of fanservice, which is really nice to see. The show could still be better, obviously, as some of the fanservice just goes a little too over-the-top and Yuus sister is causing unnecessary drama imo, but hey, Ill take what I can get.

**Devil Survivor 2: The Animation (1-3):**

Never played the game, so this will be my first introduction to it. Seems at least decent so far, but nothing truly special. Hoping it gets better now that things are starting to pick up more and more.

**WataMote (3):**

Like the first two episodes, I liked this one as well. However, also like the first two episodes, I felt horribly uncomfortable while watching it, which I suppose is just a part of the show. It does make it kind of hard to marathon it in any manner, though, which is a problem for my growing unfinished anime list <_<

**Durarara! (3-8):**

The background information on all the characters is really, really nice to see, but I gotta admit: this pacing is slow as hell so far due to it. Ive been told by a friend that it starts to pick up later, kind of like Steins;Gate I guess, so Im going to stick it out, but I just hope that speed up comes soon.

**Samurai Flamenco (1):**

Havent had much time to watch this yet, but Im at least somewhat interested to see where it goes. If nothing else, the concept seems mildly interesting.

**One Piece (1-6):**

And so begins the journey of a thousand miles, the end of which I fear I may never seen. I just hope the openings get better, or I get used to the first one at least, because Im not feeling so hot on it currently.

**Chaika (1):**

I...have mixed feelings on Chaika so far. I know its got a huge hype train going for it, but I just dont know. Something just isnt resonating right with it for me. Maybe it has something to do with watching the show with a friend and him having a negative opinion on it, and Im just conforming because of peer pressure or something? Who knows. Ill probably rewatch the first episode by myself before continuing on with the series, just to be sure.

**Mayouu Maou Yuusha (1-9):**

I literally found out about this anime at like 1am today, and decided to watch it a little bit. Ill admit, the first episode nearly made me not watch the rest for at least a while, as it just didnt really give me a good impression. However, I decided to 3-episode-rule it, and pressed on to the next few.

Holy shit, I am so glad I did that. It got MUCH better starting with episode 2, giving me a fairly good Spice and Wolf vibe that I see others are getting as well based on the old discussion threads. Most of the characters are at least somewhat interesting, it (usually) has a decent balance of light-hearted and serious, the animation looks nice, and the soundtrack is just lovely.

However, what really and truly blew me away was episode 9. I mean, wow. Just wow. Despite all of the anime I have seen before, all of the cool/awesome/tearjerky/good things that I have seen in those anime, never before had I seen something that made me pause the show and then just stand up and freaking clap. The speech given in that episode, however, made me do just that. Despite the fact that it was like 5:30 in the morning, I just stood up and clapped. Even if I look back on the rest of the series and decide it is, at best, decidedly average (especially considering it is an adaptation of an apparently currently-ongoing series), this scene will probably always stand out to me as one that just completely and utterly made the series.


**White Album 2 (1-13):**

I

I made a mistake. I shouldnt have marathoned this series. I sure as hell shouldnt have marathoned it after having not slept for a stupidly long time (damn random insomnia), causing me to be even more emotionally vulnerable. I know Im a sucker for catharsis. I know I feel terrible afterwards, and I sure as hell knew EXACTLY where this was going. I knew from probably a little bit after the midway point near-clearly where it was headed, and yet despite that I pressed on, naively believing that things would get better. That they wouldnt end on the note that it did. But I was wrong, and now I got burned. I got burned harder than I thought I would. I got burned hard enough that Im currently searching for a patch to translate the second half of the visual novel, which takes place 3 years later, in the hopes that I wont get burned again.

But I know I will. After all, happy endings are for suckers, right?

Now, if youll excuse me, I need to go be alone for a little bit, and contemplate on some things. The least of which being the realization that I still have 5-6 more episodes of H20 to watch this next week.


>> ARTICLE
One Piece openings get WORSE IMO. We Are is like....one of the quintessential feel good OPs.

Having the will to go through the lengthy beast that is One Piece is all you need. Keep at it, it will pay off, you're in for an incredible journey (and yes, the openings do become much better). 
>> ARTICLE
> I think this video just about sums up what I feel about the series.

Yup. That pretty much summed it all up there. If I wanted a love story, I'd dive into some recommendations off of Aoi Hana. But I really wanted happy bouncing girls kissing happy bouncing girls, so it all worked out well.

> White Album 2

Now you know why  we've been praising this show from top to bottom on this sub. 

> I still have 5-6 more episodes of H20 to watch this next week.

Woah. Dude. WA2 *and* H2O on back-to-back weeks?!? 

You going to be okay, dude? Just checking.

I literally just started watching Usagi Drop and just finished the second episode ten minutes ago. I'm on this Type 2 Diabetes boat with you.

I read this comment and then I marathoned the whole thing.  It was amazing and then I googled if there was going to be a season 2 and the links about the manga ending ruined it for me :[

Strange that you can't get into the first opening for One Piece; a lot of people consider it one of the best (including myself). It's just so damn catchy.

Eternal Log is my personal favorite. Or Fight Together albeit somewhat cheesy. I might have to pick the one from Marineford as well. Quite a few I enjoyed.

There is an English review and/or summary of the remainder of the WA2 VN on a blog somewhere. It is very thorough and explains each possible ending as well. If you really want to know the ending, I'm sure a quick google search would find it...(I don't want to link it. Some people don't have enough willpower to resist. If you go looking for it, well that's on you not me.)


>> ARTICLE
You're in for ride with WA2. The VN is supposed to be one of the best out there.
>> ARTICLE
fffff

you watched a lot of old shit this week
>> ARTICLE
I watched what my PS3 Crunchyroll app let me watch. For some reason this past week, it would only let me watch some series, but not others. For the most part this was limited to newer series, like Brynhildr in the Darkness and Nisekoi, but it also randomly affected some older shows, like Nichijou. It would also occasionally change what shows it was and was not affecting, hence why I jumped around even more than usual this week. It seems to have cleared up in the past couple days, though, so hopefully I can stick to one show more consistently now.
>> ARTICLE
60 episodes, to be exact.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus, really? It was actually that much?

*Goes back to count*

...It really was something like that much. God damn, I didn't even necessarily mean to watch that much. It just sort of happened.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I wanted to say it's a lot of shows, but not a lot of episodes, so I counted, and 60 episodes *are* quite a lot. These days I rarely pass 25-30 episodes a week myself. Though a couple of months back I've watched all of Chihayafuru (51 episodes) in 3-4 days, and back around 2011, or 2007, I'd sometimes watch 100-200 episodes in a week (Eureka Seven in 2 days, catching up to Bleach by watching 7 hours a day, etc). But that's not really a good example of stuff, and perhaps not that healthy itself.

:)

So long you're having fun, it's all good.
>> ARTICLE
Usagi Drop is probably my favorite SoL, like ever. It's a fantastic show. 

As for Sakura Trick, you're entering the phase in which I started to abhor that show. Show, Yuri, whatever, I like it, but it starts to push in some really obnoxious drama that kind of goes against everything the show was prior. It tries to make nonsense yuri fanservice serious, and I really, really hate it. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm with ya on Usagi Drop. It was absolutely fantastic on every level.

White Album 2 is amazing isn't it?  Have you read ahead in the VN? (just read you did, oops)  It only gets...better.
>> ARTICLE
...What do you mean by "better?"
>> ARTICLE
I don't wanna spoil it for you because it seemed you enjoyed it, but WA2 is notorious for being a very depressing series so keep that in mind...

But when you read the VN summary, read the Touma End.  I consider that canon.
>> ARTICLE
Still loved it. 
>> ARTICLE
Like I have said if they do the Touma ending I will cry like a fucking bitch so hard at the end scene.  
>> ARTICLE
I hope we are talking about the "true touma ending" and not the "normal" one.

Ugh. I watched all of WA2 about 2-3 months ago. I still feel physically ill when I think about the ending for too long. Even so, it's still one of my all-time favorites.

Its exactly the same for me. I just had to read the summary of the VN afterwards , because i couldnt accept this ending!

**Serial Experiments Lain** [(MAL)] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain) ****Completed**** In my attempt to watch some older shows and after seeing this one mentioned a lot I thought I would check it out. It was pretty amazing. It's sort of hard to wrap your head around if you aren't watching actively because some things aren't very explicit at times. It's a great watch through that has a lot to offer and if you haven't had a chance to watch it, I'd highly recommend it.

**Mawaru Penguindrum** [(MAL)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum) ****Completed**** Another one I'd seen mention around that I never had a chance to watch. The first thing you notice is how the vibrant show is. It's a fun ride that kept having twist and story you'd never expect to happen. It's rich in symbolism and focuses on themes of fate all centered around an endearing family. Also highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't watched it.


>> ARTICLE
If you haven't already, you should watch Revolutionary Girl Utena. It's an older show with the same director/scriptwriter as penguindrum. Definitely something you'd enjoy if you liked Lain and Penguindrum. 
>> ARTICLE
First I want to explain how I decided to have my ratings work.

A show gets a 10/10 if it's in my personal top 5 anime.  And a show gets a 9/10 if it's in my top 10.  So a show like Code Geass is in my personal top 5 now so it gets a 10/10.

So on to what I watched the past two weeks (for I missed last week):

1. **Code Geass R1/R2 (50/50):** I regret not watching this sooner.  After I got over the weird character models I throughly enjoyed this show.  The badass MC has always been my weak spot and Lelouch might be the baddest of MC's.  Suzaku is was also a very interesting Antagonist type character, and the pay off at the end with [](/s "him and Lelouch working on Zero Requiem was amazing.  Like Lelouch said "Together, we could do anything".  I also am of the belief Lelouch lived and is traveling with CC as a peddler, both immortal.  But I could live with him being dead as well")  Code Geass gets a **10/10**.

2. **Golden Time (24/24):**  I enjoyed it mostly until the end.  Too much shit and non closure.  If [](/s "they were going to milk the Banri loses his memories of everyone since you have been watching, then don't do the cop out thing and have him remember Koko from just the mirror.  Irritating.  I am waiting for a show where the female lead and the male lead do break up but both are better for it because they grew as people so much.  Much like Kokoro Connect did with Inori and Tachi.  Also the fact that Linda, my favorite character, got that weak ass ending was disappointing, along with the fact Misuo and Chinami's thing never got resolved.  Stop trying to make MitsuoxLinda happen.")  Golden Time gets a **6/10**

3. **Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (24/24):** Same as Golden Time though I enjoyed it more.  Enjoyed the humor and most of the characters, especially Nanami.  Loved Nanami to death.  Sad she got kind of a bad ending and never truely told [](/s "Sorata how she felt")  The main romance was honestly not very good, though it wasn't horrible.  Misaki and Jin's romance was amazing.  Characters grew as the show went, so I enjoyed it.  I gave Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo a **7/10**

4. **Clannad/Clannad:AS (47/47):** You know, I thought Clannad was overhyped.  I thought I wouldn't enjoy it, or be moved by it as much as people were saying I would.  Good god I was wrong.  I have seen a few complaints about the characters not being deep enough for people and I can see that, but I enjoyed it and especially thought Tomoya's character was very good in Clannad and became downright amazing in Clannad:AS.  Nagisa was honestly very bland in Clannad but I feel as though her character was amazing in Clannad:AS.  When Clannad:AS hit it's main arc in episode 16 when [](/s "Nagisa dies in Childbirth...I think my eyes were watering for 6 episodes straight.  Ushio's scene in the field was a downpour.  I cannot put into words how tragically beautiful the ending episodes of Clannad:AS are.  After reading up on the ending and understanding it I believe it is a beautiful ending as well for the fact they have had magic in the series the whole time it makes it feel like it isn't a cop out.  I want to point out I would've been equally moved if Tomoya got his life back together with Ushio and moved on from Nagisa with Kyou instead, but the ending it has is more than fine.")  Clannad got a **8/10**.  Clannad:AS got a **10/10**.
 
5. **White Album 2 (12/12):** Beautiful.  Straight up [](/s "tragically") beautiful.  All the characters were wonderfully deep, wonderfully flawed, and wonderfully real.  I actually liked all the characters and the [](/s "airport scene at the end basically crushed me emotionally.")  The music was also amazing.  I also read ahead in the VN and [VN spoilers](/s "if they go with the Touma route with a continuation of the anime adaption, I will automatically bump it up to my #1 anime of all time.  Because good god I would cry like a fucking bitch at that ending.") White Album 2 gets a **10/10**.

6. **Nisemonogatari (3/11):** It is nice, I like it so far a little bit more than Monogatari, and I am eagerly awaiting the tooth brush scene.  I am going to keep going for I have heard Monogatari:S2 is good, though I am enjoying Nise.

7. **The World God Only Knows S1 (8/12):** Really enjoying it.  The MC was honestly annoying in the beginning parts but he is getting better since the Kanon arc and it seems it finally is affecting him emotionally that these girls don't remember him.  The filler episodes are kind of annoying though.  Also, what is the order of this show?  It seems like it's a wonky order you are supposed to watch it in.

Damn that took a while.  Hope you enjoyed my thoughts.
>> ARTICLE
So... in a week you watched 3 shows that went straight to your top 5. That's very... good, or bad, depending on the perspective. What are the other 2, just out of curiosity?

Of the shows I watched, I kind of agree with everything you said, though I actually think Sakurasou is better than Clannad season 1. It touches some really deep subjects that Clannad just doesn't do.
>> ARTICLE
Well I have just started watching anike in the past month.  And this was also the last three weeks of watching shows for I missed last weeks thread.

The other two are TTGL and Angel Beats.

Hm. Point of parliamentary inquiry: When you fill out your List to the 100+ range, will you keep scoring in such a restrictive fashion or will you allow more scores of 9s and 10s to exist? 

I'm not complaining. Gods know I've got my own hard-and-fast rules for a perfect 10/10 score, and it is still well under 5% of my 326 completed shows... Yet there are still eleven of them, and I think I would have been driving myself absolutely crazy if I absolutely had to pick six titles to demote.

Man after [That,](/s "Nagisa's death, it truly felt like someone important was missing from the show;") it was just so hard to continue with the series.

I'm watching Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo as well. I just finished 16 episode. I just love it. My best character is Nanami too. I like relationship Sorata x Nanami. Relationship Jin x Misaki is very sad for me. I'm looking for anime like this.

for TWGOK, IIRC it goes S1, S2, 4-Nin to idol OVA, Tenri arc OVA, S3


>> ARTICLE
The 4-Nin to Idol OVA doesn't need to be watched, but the Tenri Arc HAS to be watched before you start watching season 3. It sets up the whole plot of season 3.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, but if you wait until youre done with the 3rd season to watch it it sucks because youre going back to how the relations between the characters where before, which are much worse imo
>> ARTICLE
That's true, but some people don't like watching OVA's. I was only saying it because it is essential to the plot, so you would be confused if you didn't watch either of them.
>> ARTICLE
**Gurren Lagann (1-12)** I finally got around to watching it. I'm loving the mecha and the fight scenes, but a lot of the characters really get on my nerves. 

**Mushishi (10-13)** I have been slowly watching this show for a little while now. It's good, but it's not a show I feel like I should be rushing through. 

**Shinsekai Yori (1-9)** Really enjoying this show so far. If things keep on track, it should have good character development and an interesting plot all the way through. 


>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann will hit insane hype soon, go for it!

Shin Sekai Yori: A lot of people felt a bit put-off by it, but I think its a fantastic science-fiction story. Its focus is on world-building and asking questions, a little less on the characters (although that is there). Keep in mind that its based off of a novel, and so it has the pacing of one, and like many novels its about the build-up to the finale. The questions that the children ask at all stages of their development, remember them and keep questioning.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate, and by god do I regret not watching it sooner. It is the best series I've watched so far, and I'll probably end up rewatching it at some stage in the future. I do agree that it starts off slow, but I believe the series ended off better as a result. The characters were perfect, the story was fantastic and the ending was really satisfying. I couldn't have asked for anything more, and I'm glad I watched it.

**[Sukitte Ii na yo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14289/Sukitte_Ii_na_yo.) (Say "I love you") episodes 1-13+OVA (Complete):**

First, I'll talk a wee bit of production. I liked the voice actors, that Kurosawa Yamato played the main role (he's Suzaku from Code Geass, Makishima from Psyco-Pass, and most importantly) which stands clear in my memory lately for this exact voice as Fakir in Princess Tutu, combined with [how much the OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHR24MZUGy0) reminded me [of Princess Tutu's OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH0ULZZScJQ) as well, and the piano music playing everywhere, I was predisposed to liking it.

Character designs are nice, if simple. Backgrounds are lovely. Animation? The whole series probably has less animation than a single episode of Free! or something. Almost everything is a still shot, or a single limb moving. Scenes where we see characters' full bodies as they walk are often awkward as hell.

Well, with that out of the way, let's get to the good stuff, the story.

This is a shoujo manga adaptation, and reads as one. If you like shoujo romances, I think you'll like this one. If you don't, or wish for harems, then you won't. It's pretty darn standard, guys.

The heroine is a close cousin to Hachiman from OreGairu - got harmed in the past, and now decides she doesn't need people. But damn, the first episode covered so much ground. Compared to all the premiers that take 2-3 episodes to get *anywhere*? This show more or less starts with the two main characters becoming a couple, and then slowly growing closer, and then running into the issues that a real couple might run into. Yes, [spoilers](/s "saying "I love you" out loud is somewhat "The payoff" at the end"), but it's not a "Will they, won't they?" but "*How* will they deal with this? How will they deal with themselves?"

I really liked a couple of bits that felt super-real, such as sending an SMS, and the other side replying too late. And then people slow-cook in their own thoughts, dwelling, and things escalate. If anything, the main thing I've found unrealistic about the show was how when both sides got hurt, and in turn hurt the other,[spoilers](/s  "everything was resolved by both sides just coming clean and trying to resolve things"). This sort of thing *does* happen, and is indeed the best way to solve things. But it takes time to get there. All too often, especially early on, the urge to hunker down and only hurt the other side more kicks in. That bit of shounen RomComs is frustrating to watch, but it's realistic.

The plot-points are often pretty standard, "Get boy and girl together, boy is popular so deal with disapproval from others, make friends, deal with boy potentially dating other girls, then girl gets advancements made on her," but honestly, if you're looking for something "different", than most romance stories are the *last* place you should look. Yes, it's "comfort-food", and I'm fine being comforted by it.

The one thing that *did* stand out to me? The male MC. If you break it down, his "noble and will sacrifice himself for others" is actually something that appears in a lot of shoujo mangas, due to, well, how *idealized* they are. He's something of a "bad boy", and it's interesting how shoujo fit the two together. So what stood out to me? How much they took it to its logical conclusion. [Spoilers] (/s "This dude slept with a girl who felt down in order to make her feel better.") He truly did *everything* to make others happy. If anything, he reminds me of Araragi from _monogatari. Minus the lewdness, but with the "I will sacrifice myself to help others!" and how that actually makes everyone around him sad, especially those he helped.

And of course, if he helps everyone, it made the romantic interest less sure of herself and how "special" she is to him and so, which is natural.

I also liked the OVA. The final episode of the series was the funniest one, to me. The OVA just had side-characters gain more time, but still as a drama.

This show is probably a 6/10 in terms of quality - it's a perfect boilerplate example of a well-executed shoujo. I will give it **7/10** because I've enjoyed it quite a bit. Was fun to marathon in the middle of the week.

What was your opinion on the female main character? I really didn't like her. All she could do is blush, I think we'd gotten literally nowhere if it weren't for the male MC. If you compare her to other shoujo MC's, she's by far the most annoying in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
A passive MC who does nothing is not annoying, because there are no acts to be annoying, but you're annoyed by them.

Hmmm. What do I think of her?

As a character, or as a person? I think in both cases, I liked her fine. As a person, she let things bottle inside, she avoided confrontations, as most of us would, and then things would burst out once people prodded her to share. That's actually... *realistic*. No, not everyone's like that, but many people have an *aspect* like that, and I've known a fair number of shy/hurt people who were even more recalcitrant with sharing their feelings than her.

Moreover, we did know what she's thinking and feeling. This is a shoujo romance, not a shounen action show. "I think" or "I feel" in such shows are just as important as people actually taking out actions in the outside world. We see things from her perspective, so while others act, she's allowed to tell us via thinking, and reflecting, and questioning herself. That's part of the genre.

Now, as a character. As a character, if the above isn't sufficient, she's both "main character" and "Supporting character" at the same time - others' actions reflect on her, via her thoughts and in the end pushing her to act. Also, when she decides to *not* act - it's an action. Each time she said nothing but felt sadness inside? It's an act. Not saying anything when you have nothing to say isn't an action. When you have something to say and stop it, it *is* a worthwhile act, that ups the stakes.

Yes, in my old relationships, such behaviour often led to trouble, but that both made it more realistic, and in the narrative, it moved things along even as "nothing changed", because *tension* rose.

Finally, as a "supporting character", she got others to act, via her silences, via her feelings, and her outbursts.

I might have not liked being in a relationship with her, but as a character in a narrative, and a person we can empathize with? I liked her fine.
>> ARTICLE
Looking at it that way, I can't say I disagree. To be honest I hadn't thought about doing something by *not* doing anything, to put it simply. Thank you for the trouble of typing all that, it's nice seeing a character who left a negative impression the first time in a somewhat more positive light.
>> ARTICLE
Just keep that in mind, when in politics someone speaks of "restraint", or when you're in a relationship and the other side tells you "Nothing" when you ask them what they want to do/what the problem is ;-)

More seriously, glad I was able to provide an alternate take on things.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly, many people don't share the same ability to be introspective and open like you. I wholeheartedly agree with tundranocaps about Mei and her characterization, but I've seen many people who simply don't understand the story being told. My only working theory is that the average anime fan simply doesn't have the breadth of social experience necessary to "get" the characters/plot of Sukitte Ii na yo. It's definitely the type of show that if you've experienced something similar in real life (or even know someone who has) you will relate to it much better.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion (26/26, End of Evangelion)**

Dafuq man. I love it.

Such a good series.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion (5/26)**

First of all, yes...I haven't seen NGE yet and no, I have an actual home, not just a rock.

This week I was finally able to overcome my reluctance to all things Mecha in order to watch NGE. And boy, I'm glad I did. After pretty much marathoning the original Sailor Moon, I've been seriously itching to sink my teeth into something complex once again.

I came in expecting it to be maybe 70% mecha fights/technobabble with the other 30% for the much lauded psychological drama. So far, the ratio seems to be more like 10:90 which makes me a very happy panda.

Each episode is so packed with things relevant to the psychology of the characters that I find myself pausing every 2 minutes or so just to let them sink in and find a place for those individual jigsaw pieces in the grand scheme of things. I absolutely love what I'm getting so far. 

Perhaps my only criticism is that some of the psychology (particularly with Shinji) feels almost Freudian, which is personally something I'm not a huge fan of. 
>> ARTICLE
You gon' like iiiiit.

I only watched it this past year and it instantly shot to among my favourite series ever. 

Watch the TV episodes, and then the ending movie End of Evangelion.

The Rebuild of Evangelion movies are for after all that.
>> ARTICLE
Wait till episode 25/26. Bam!
>> ARTICLE
The psychology is very much Freudian, and it only gets more-so as you keep going, and then look back on the series. Sure, there could be a dose of Jung in the end. But it's got Freud writ large all over it.
>> ARTICLE
Make sure to watch The End of Evangelion once you finish episodes 25 & 26.  Then if you want you could watch the 3 rebuild movies (you could probably skip the first since it's basically a recap of the first few EVA fights but much MUCH prettier).
>> ARTICLE
Rebuild 1.0 is still one of my favorite just for all that sweet mecha battles. Just don't get me started on 3.0.. =_=
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I know a lot of people don't really like 3.33 but I guess I'm in the minority.  I really liked all 3 movies with 2 probably being my favorite.  Three was really good because of how the trailer threw everyone off and made them forget that they were still watching EVA and EVA doesn't do typical mech things haha.
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching **Psycho-Pass (9/24)** and **Knights of Sidonia (7/12)**.



Psycho-Pass has been really great. The setting is really creative for cyberpunk (although most cyberpunk settings have pretty interesting concepts), and all of the characters are really interesting. I think what I like most about it are the various villains. 




Knights of Sidonia is basically Attack on Titan in space in a lot of ways, but I'm finding it surprisingly enjoyable. I think the animation during some battles could use some work, but otherwise the different animation style isn't bad. What I like most about it is the setting, and I think that Izana is best bigender right now. [Knights of Sidonia](/s "Also, when that chick peed in the guys mouth, I couldn't help but laugh. I know it was filtered and necessary to live, but I just couldn't help it.")

[Here's a link to the Psycho Pass book club/recommended reading list](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/07/10/join-the-psycho-pass-book-club), if you're interested! I'm aiming to finish all of the books on the list before season 2 airs.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. Funnily enough, I am reading 1984 right now.
>> ARTICLE
I really wanted to enjoy Knights of Sidona but something about the animation style is really off putting to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I understand. Personally I don't really like the gauna design, but I got used to the animation outside of the fight scenes pretty quickly.
>> ARTICLE
I'll give it another try I think. Is this something I could watch at a workplace without much problem? I accidentally started Tokyo Ghoul at work without reading up so I'm a little gun shy.

There are a few fanservicey scenes with Barbie Doll nudity and a bunch of girls in their underwear. 
>> ARTICLE
**Aku no Hana**

it is... strange. It really is extremely odd, though that's not bad, im liking it
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the Aku no Hana anime itself is vastly overshadowed by it's art style. The manga is seriously amazing, but a lot of people can't say much about the anime besides "huh, this is weird", usually only talking about the visuals. Granted, it is a weird story, but I feel like the oddness, massage, and tone of the story are sidelined due to the visuals of the show. 

>> ARTICLE
yeah, that might happen a lot, although after 11 episodes it isn't actually noticable anymore for me.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the middle of **Stein's Gate** right now and loving it. All of the characters are awesome and work very well together. They are a major highlight of the series for me. Halfway through shit starts to hit the fan and it is done pretty well. I can't believe I haven't watched it before.
>> ARTICLE
Currently watching Fate Zero.

I went through all available Fate Kaleid before that. It is what got me interested.

LOVED Fate Kaleid and I'm really like Zero so far.
>> ARTICLE
Kaleid is just a comedy spinoff of a couple of characters of the Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night series, other than that there is no relation. Like, it's just so different, but still Fate/Zero is incredible. 
>> ARTICLE
As a Fate/Stay Night fanboy, the order you're experiencing the series in physically wounds me. I guess it's okay if you enjoy it though.

**Hunter x Hunter (2011) (1-58)** 
Tried to decide between HxH and Fairy Tail as my shounen of choice. Ended up picking HxH and lets just say that I'm enjoying it a lot. Watched all of the Phantom Troupe arc in one sitting. Paused a bit at 58 which was the end of the arc but going to be going back on track today. 


**Kiss x Sis TV (1-10)**
I don't know why. Maybe it was because HxH just didn't have many females. It's... pretty boring. I planned to drop it but I keep coming back for "one more episode".


EDIT: **The Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi (1/1)**
Totally forgot that I watched this! For a franchise that I didn't particularly love, this movie was amazing. I'm actually planning to watch a lot of anime movies in the next week so I can participate properly in the movie ranking game. I've got a lot of catching up to do right now since I've hardly seen any (I haven't even seen Princess Mononoke) but I have planned to watch Summer Wars tonight. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't really want to diss Fairy Tail and I wouldn't call it bad, but you can't compare it to the masterpiece that is HxH. You made the right choice. Watch Fairy Tail only after you exhausted your other top shounen options. 
>> ARTICLE
I second this, Fairy Tail is a fun watch but nothing like HxH in terms or plot or fight quality.
>> ARTICLE
**Legend of the Galactic Heroes**
I'm on episode 11 so far. I like the premise and the characters already have a lot depth to them. I just find it hard to watch a lot of episodes at once because it is a thoughtful anime that if I were to watch more than like three episodes at a time, it would overwhelm me. That sucks because I really want to finish it before school starts except I don't know if I will
>> ARTICLE
I have been meaning to ask. Where can someone watch, stream, or rent "LoGH?"  I have been an anime collector since 93 and have never encountered a legit translation (or even a fansub) though I haven't looked years. 

(No "Google Torrents" recommendations please)

I'm pretty sure the only way to watch it is 'illegally' because its not licensed

There is no legit translation, the best one I've found is the version on uploaded to Youtube actually(if that is still there.)

**[Acchi Kocchi](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=8890) 6/13**

Moe/comedy/4-koma, with a little romance and surprise catgirls.  Simple and relaxing.

**[Urusei Yatsura](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=377)  195/195, 1/1 (tv specials) 1/6 (movies) 0/12 OVAs**

This has been my "watch it on my phone / tablet when I some free time" series for over 2 years, and I've finally finished the main series.  Now, going for the rest of it.  Classic screwball comedy.  And don't forget the [best girl](http://imgur.com/4sAQN97).

>> ARTICLE
**Blue Exorcist (25/25 + Movie)** - Again, watched this on a friend's recommendation, and honestly, and while I didn't hate it, it was just really generic shonen. Kid gets special powers that are different than everyone else's special powers, dead parent, goes to school while trying to hide the fact that he has special powers and fails, fight fight monologue friendship fight, not really too much to say about. The ending wasn't great, and it really didn't even accomplish anything in the long run of the series, but eh... I'd rate it a little above average for at least an interesting concept and not completely falling on it's face.

Oh, and the movie was okay, I suppose, but again, it really didn't leave any kind of impression on me at all.

**Katanagatari (12/12)** - That was an amazing show. The characterisation of every single person was possibly the best I've ever seen. Even the characters that only had maybe 5 minutes of screen time had a well defined and interesting personality. My only complaint about the series is exactly this, though. Because all the characters are set up to be incredibly fleshed out and interesting, I got really mad when so many of them just ended up being killed almost immediately. I'd love to see more of *any* character in this show, and that's saying a lot.

The final episode was fantastic, just like I've been told it was. [Katanagatari finale](/s "Seeing Sichika just destroy every sword effortlessly was so intense to watch. Seeing his true power, not bounded by his promises to Togame in the first episode, was astounding, and his final fight with Emonzaemon was my favorite part of the whole series."). 

Beyond those, I've watched the first episodes of **Baccano**, **Spice And Wolf**, and **Nagi no Asukara**, and the first two of **Hitsugi no Chaika**. None of them in particular really stood out to me, so I'm not sure which ones I'll start first, probably S&W or Chaika.

Lots of ridiculous antics and great jokes. One of the best mini-segments ever in the form of **High School Girls Are Funky**.

Looking forward to a very unlikely S2.

Solid **8/10**.
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching the second season of **Chihayafuru**, and it continues to astonish me how compelling this show is given its subject matter. There  are never long stretches between major tournaments, characters show clear growth in their gameplay and character arcs, and the show is doing an excellent job of introducing new characters. I love the continued emphasis on realism now extending to which players should play in team matches, and these matches are always exciting and novel.

Speaking of realism, I've also been watching **Knights of Sidonia** on Netflix. Its main problem - the CG character models - continues to be annoying, but less so now (5 episodes in) than it was at first, and the flipside is that space battles look great. [](/s "Sidonia accelerating") was brutal as hell, and seeing how scary a single Gauna is makes me excited to see more of them at once.
>> ARTICLE
**No Game No Life (12/12)**

I didn't watch this when it was airing, just because of a lack of time back then. I also didn't bother to pick it up until now, and I have to say I'm glad I did. Although it might not entirely deserve the ridiculously high rating it got on MAL (8.82, ranked #23 of all time) I get why people liked it. 

I liked it. It has fun characters and a really interesting world and story. The fanservice was a bit too excessive at times but I couldn't say it didn't match the show's atmosphere. It was well animated and the music was great, all in all a really fun show to watch. I as many others can't wait to see a second season and with the positive response it got it wouldn't surprise me if one would be announced.

**Bokura ga Ita (5/26)**

This is just my 'watch when I'm bored' shoujo anime. It's from 2006 and the art and all is a bit outdated and looks simple, but it works fine in the show as it's just a slow-paced shoujo romance. It has a great main character and even though some side-characters seem a bit plain, it works fine for this kind of show.  

The only problem is: Where are they going with this? In 5 episodes I must admit a lot has happened and I can't really see how they would fill another 21(!) episodes. If we'd compare it to something such as Kimi ni Todoke we'd be around the 20th episode already. I hope it won't get stretched out with a ton of fillers and nothing interesting happening. But, we'll see I guess.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the entirety of Golden Time.  I swear to god if I got a dollar every time someone said 'Tada' or 'Banri' id be a goddamn millionaire.  Overall I give the show an 8/10.  2-D kun will live on forever in the bro hall of fame.  I give the writers mad props on tearing me between the SS Linda and SS Koko.  Honestly couldn't decide which ship I liked more.  Ending was really mediocre though.
>> ARTICLE
**Chihayafuru** up to episode 9. I read the manga before and never started the anime, but I'm so glad. Perfect adaptation and the music/animation is amazing

Didn't watch much this week. 

**Spice and Wolf** [13/13]

I remember watching this way back and then forgetting about it after episode 2. After watching the whole thing, I have to say that I loved it all the way through. This show makes bartering just as intense as balls to the wall action. 9/10
>> ARTICLE
Finished Steins;Gate, holy crap was that incredible.

**Gintama** (31-36/201) - Amnesia plot was okay, didn't expect Kagura to be the most loyal of the lot but I think I'm underestimating her character overall. Shinpachi going on a date was my second favorite episode so far, but I didn't like the resolution of [Gintama Episode 35](/s "the woman being a thief.") I wanted them to play it straight for once and have things turn out well for a time. This batch of episodes made me like Otae more too.

More in the [Gintama discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2b5r0a/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_3136/cj22bdk) thread.

**Beck - Mongolian Chop Squad** (2-3/26) - The third episode finally got my attention, though its still pretty slow. 

Still less overall this week due to the **Fate/Stay Night** visual novel. But a question since it's relevant: after I complete that, is the original F/SN anime series or Unlimited Blade Works movie worth watching, or should I just go straight to Fate/Zero?
>> ARTICLE
I'm so fucking happy someone went with Fate in the correct order!!! You can watch UBW if you want to see the badass UBW fights animated (in fact, you could just watch from the Archer fight onwards). Fate/Zero is pretty good, hope you like it. Adds a lot of flavor to the original.
>> ARTICLE
If you're already reading the visual novel, there's not any point watching the original 2006 Fate/Stay Night anime as it doesn't do it justice really. The pacing and animation quality is not too bad, but it ends up trying to mix together bits of other routes (despite being predominantly the Fate route) in a manner that leaves much to be desired. I watched it before reading the VN and at the time it seemed decent, but I couldn't imagine enjoying it after having read the VN. 

The Unlimited Blade Works movie doesn't make much sense as a stand alone story, but it was basically made as a treat to VN readers by giving them a condensed version of that route (including the most important fights) in an animated form. Watching it is purely optional.

Fate/Zero is based on the prequel light novel(s?) written not by Nasu of Type Moon but by Gen Urobuchi and is one of his most famous works. If you're familiar with other works by "Urobutcher" then you know you can expect great things but it won't be all roses and cut and dried morals. You should watch this as soon as you finish the visual novel, Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night's VN both seem to spoil each other in certain plot elements but overall you could do it in either order.

Fate/Stay Night is getting an all new adaption this fall by the same studio that did Fate/Zero, so it promises to be very good and a huge improvement over the previous adaption unless they monumentally screw up. Rumor has it that it's going to be an original route that stands alone yet borrows from the 3 routes in the VN, others suggest that it might be the Heavens Feel route since it's the only one to not be adapted so far.
>> ARTICLE
Just go straight to Fate/Zero. Unlimited Blade Works might be worth watching, but general consensus is that the original F/SN anime isn't really worth the time.

Chuunibyo - (3\12)

I feel embarrassed watching it because it reminds me of when I thought I was totally cool and unique, and at the same time, I laugh at it because it nails it. I was pleasantly surprised at how funny it was. Also, Rikka is best girl

Himegoto - (2\12)

Half the reason I'm even watching this is because the troll subs had me dying from laughter (first two episodes, anyways), but I actually found the normal subs pretty cool. ^^^^^IswearI'mnotwatchingitjustfortraps:<

No Game No Life - (1\12)

Being honest, I can't get into it. Should I give the show another shot, does it pick up from the first episode, or does it just stay the same?
>> ARTICLE
Kimi Ni Todoke.  It was mentioned in another thread so I checked it out.  I ended up marathoning it this week.  I'm exhausted :)

It's a really sweet story about a girl who because of her resemblance to the ghost girl from "The Ring," is feared and shunned by her classmates.  She is noticed by a popular guy and a romance develops. 


I liked it  a lot, but all of the obstacles to them getting together started feeling pretty forced by the second season.

**2199 Yamato (20/26)**

I'm watching the remake and it's got a lot of things that I love from the sci-fi genre.  Feels like a great blend of Battlestar: Galactica, Stargate, and Star Trek.  I'm enjoying the plot a lot even though best girl is not winning.  I also really like how instead of the normal spaceship they're basically naval warships in space.  It made it unique and memorable especially the part with the [](/s "submarine").

Have you seen the Universal Century (original) Gundam series? Please do.

The newly finished Gundam Unicorn & the soon to come Gundam The Origin take place in the same timeline as the original series (original, Zeta, Char's Counterattack etc). Unicorn was fantastic!!

I haven't watched UC yet, but I'll try to (it's hard finding a site that'll stream it)

I have seen Unicorn Gundam Ep. 1 & 2. I'll have to catch up on that.

**Death Note (All 37 episodes)** 

Decided on a whim to rewatch death note, since I hadn't seen it in years. I'm surprised that I forgot so many plot points. Was just as enjoyable as the first time. L is seriously the coolest.

**Mirai Nikki (1-2)**

Really enjoying this. For some reason, this anime was recommended in some context related to Mafia (party/forum game) years ago, but I never got around to watching it. I really like it and can see some sort of comparison there. Reminds me a bit of Liar Game and Death Note, which are some of my favorite story types. I'm a sucker for psychological battles (esp. 1 on 1, which is why I loved Liar Game and Death Note so much...if you have any recommendations based on this, please tell me!). Yuno sort of weirds me out..I don't know why she is so obsessed with Yukki but I love how she says the name Yukki. I sort of just love her voice actor. Eventually one of them is going to have to betray the other, and I suspect with Yuno having the Yukki diary, she will have a major advantage later on in the story. Will probably have made significant progress on this by next week, if not outright finished it.

**Puella Magi Madoka Magica (All 12 episodes)**

I'll be honest, I'm not completely sure how I felt about it. It was incredibly interesting. I'm not sure what I was expecting from the show, but it definitely wasn't that. It was very enjoyable however and the plot never left me bored. A problem I may have with it is if [](/s "Kyubey's race only intervened on earth in the first place for to counteract entropy, why did they come to earth in "Madoka's universe" because magical girls didn't turn into witches so the entropy wasn't counteracted...? unless I'm missing something.") Overall I'd give it an 8/10

**LuckyStar (1-1)**

Not much to say about this, I thought it was fairly enjoyable though, and I've heard the first episode is a weak spot so I guess I'll probably enjoy the show

**Gintama (1-2)**

Hilarious, so many episodes though. I think it'll be a show I'll just watch  every once in a while when I need a good laugh. It's too intimidating to marathon

**Nichijou (1-1)**

I remember watching a couple episodes of this a while back, so I started it back up. Again, not much to say but it's very funny.

**Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni (1-3)**

I watched this years and years ago and I remember liking it so I'm starting it back up again. I've forgotten pretty much everything but every so often I have a bit of memory come back and I can predict what's happening next because of that. Still, very enjoyable IMO.

**Baka to test (1-1)**

Hilarious.

[Madoka Magica TV series](/s "In response to what's in your spoiler tag, Homura explains at the end of the series that just because Madoka prevented the formation of witches doesn't mean that human grief doesn't manifest. Instead, those wraiths form and personify despair, and the magical girls fight them. When destroyed, they drop those little stones that Homura "feeds" to Kyuubey, and it's implied that this gives them energy, though nowhere near as much as the witches used to").

**Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (26/26)** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex)


A few weeks back, I watched the 1995 Ghost in the Shell movie and loved it. After I got through a couple series that I wanted to watch first (Log Horizon, Chaika, etc.), I decided to watch GitS:SAC and loved it as well. It seemed like 2 or 3 episodes were filler, but were pretty good to watch because of the action (except for one where they literally sitting around a table and talking for 22 minutes). I gave it an 8/10 on MAL, but if I could do 0.5's, then I'd give it an 8.5/10.


**Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - The Laughing Man (1/1)** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2449/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex_-_The_Laughing_Man)


If you're strapped for time and don't want to watch 26 episodes, then this movie made a good summary of GitS:SAC. It's somewhat lengthy at 2 hours and 40 minutes. 8/10

I've mostly been watching movies this week. I've also put in the english names just in case it's easier to search up.

**Sakasama no Patema:** or **Patema inverted:**

Boy this movie was a bunch of fun; it's a fun romance with a really *really* interesting world. It'll make your head spin with constant camera switches which always feel appropriate. I kind of want to watch it with my monitor upside down. [ ] (/s "lol")

**Byousoku 5 centimetre** or **5 centimetres per second**

I can not believe I've never watched this staple. It's so bittersweet it's ridiculous. [ending] (/s "this whole movie makes me so depressed seeing him being pushed away from a perfect romance but I can't help but feel happy seeing his smile at the very end knowing he's moved on.")

**Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei** or **The Garden of Sinners Movie 1**

This sound track is so based and the animation is godly. I'm really excited to see the rest of this story but I can't really say much considering I've only watched one of 7 movies and movie one starts about halfway into the full story.

**Shinsekai Yori 1-25:** or **From the New World 1-25**

This was the show that I devoted the most amount of time to this week. Although people say that the start is slow I've found that it kept a strong pace throughout although I seem to be alone on this. The job they did at world building was simply spectacular and I get chills watching it. Apparently it gets good after episode 11ish but I "loved" it throughout. Love in the way that it's a fantastic story and world but man it creeps me out.

**Yama no Susume 1-12** or **Encouragement of The Climb** AKA **Mountain Climbing Lolis (thanks commie!)**

Hooray, slice of life! I watched this not knowing that season 2 was coming around this season and I'm super excited that it is.(too bad subs are never coming out). I love slice of life shorts like aiura and this brought joy to my soul. 

>> ARTICLE
The CR subs are actually fairly decent for Yama no Susume Season 2. Then again, I never saw the Commie's subs. The ones I found for the first season were by a small group called Lazy Lily, but they're doing Hanayamata this season instead of YnS.
>> ARTICLE
The CR subs are taking forever; episode 2 aired last Wednesday and there's still no subs! The commie subs were pretty good although they called the show mountain climbing lolis for some reason.

Shinsekai yori. Definitely a lot of intense vibes from this one. Not exceptionally dark but deeply unsettling in an Orwellian fashion. I also loved the fact that there was no OP. It felt tone appropriate and I'm glad that they didn't include one merely for the sake of having one. Overall, a fairly solid top 15 pick and I would be interested in seeing more of these kinds of stories. Incidentally: [Any recommendations?](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Bernmann&status=7&show=0&order=4)

**Turn A Gundam (completed)**

Well this was certainly different than any Gundam show I've seen before. For some background info, they say that when this series came out, Yoshiyuki Tomino was recovering from depression and wanted to do something that wasn't as dark as his previous installments in the franchise. Story wise it was there for being the most unique Gundam series to date but that doesn't do enough to hide its flaws. The series itself was a colony drop in failure. Pacing, acting, characters, animation, the script, ect ect ect. It felt like they never bothered to revise anything and just winged it the entire way through production. Would not recommend unless you're looking for a series that's trying to parody Gundam. The only highlight was seeing the character growth of both Kihel Heim and Dianna Soreil and their struggles to bring peace to both the Earth and Moon race.  

**Initial D Fourth Stage** (18-24)**

Aww yiss, more of Akina's best downhiller racer taking others to school. I know next to shit about cars but this series just keeps making street racing and cars in general so interesting. Would definitely recommend as alternate to the regular shounen sports that involve some kind of ball sport. 
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari:** A couple of my friends have been telling me to watch this for a few weeks. I couldn't see how it could be as good as they made it out to be but damn... What a good series. The quality of everything in it is incredible. I would recommend it, for sure.

**Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica: Rebellion (movie 3):** "What the fuck" was pretty much my reaction (although that's not surprising). It was closer to the style of the TV series than I thought it would be. The synopsis I read made it sound quite different. I didn't enjoy it as much as the show and I don't think it was as solid in some parts (although it's been a while since I've seen the series) but it was definitely good. [](/s "That ending though...")

**Toradora! (7/25):** Very enjoyable so far. I like the characters and am interested to hear the background stories for some of them.

I've decided that unless something is worth noting, I will leave unfinished shows blank, just showing the episodes I watched from the week. Example: Psycho-Pass this week.

**Psycho-Pass (5/22)** (Watched 3-5 this week)

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (17/27)** (Watched 14-17 this week)

**Ping-Ping The Animation (11/11)** (Watched 1-11 this week)

Really enjoyed this more than I thought I would. *'Blood tastes like iron'* was a fun phrase making references to Tsukimoto being 'robot-like' and boring. With Tsukimoto being the MC for the most part, I was [Spoilers](/s "a little disappointed with the ending since Tsukimoto becomes a teacher and Hoshino being on the Ping Pong team instead"). But overall, very fun and amazing for marathoning. Watched it in two days. 9.25/10.

**Gyo: Tokyo Fish Attack OVA**

What the fuck? If you haven't seen this... Don't. I mean, it wasn't that bad, but... there's so much better stuff to watch out there. As for the content on this, I'm usually desensitized to gore, but this made me sick to my stomach... from laughing at it so hard. It really does better as a comedy rather than a horror. Bland characters, meh storyline, don't bother unless you're a huge fan of gore.
	
**Fate/Zero S2 (1-7)** (Watched 1-7)

>> ARTICLE
I was satisfied with the ending, because the original goals shown of each of the characters made sense with the outcome. Smile was using Ping Pong as an enjoyable hobby and never wanted to see it as a competition. While Peco always wanted to be the #1 best Ping Pong player.

That's true, but it always seemed to be like Smile was the main character. Maybe I'm just thinking about it wrong. I guess Peco really did want it more.

**Katnagatari (12-12):**

This series was simply amazing, I loved how they pulled a bebob every episode where they introduced a colorful set of characters who feel fully fleshed out only to then replace them and move on to the next set. The episodic nature of the series was a little annoying at times because it made the series fairly predictable, that said we did get trolled and spoiled by the narrator a few times so that kindd of made up for it. Overall this series got a 10/10 from me but coming from someone who loved the monogatari series that's probably a little biased! My only complaint with the series was that haircut. GOD WHY NISIO ISIN!

**[Tokyo Magnitude 8.0](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6211/Tokyo_Magnitude_8.0)** Episodes 1-End(11):

This is the first anime to make me cry since Clannad. I picked it up after finding the dub on Youtube. The[] (/s "'big twist'") was pretty obvious, but figuring it out early didn't lessen the effect. It's worth watching if you haven't seen it yet. And the ED's really catchy.

Non Non Biyori (12/12)

The cutest shit I've ever seen. I vomited rainbows the entire time. Also very funny. Renge is the best thing of all time. I need more.

Btooom! (12/12)

This show was like Death Note, Battle Royale and something else put into one. Great stuff. Also got caught up with the manga and sadly found out it isn't being translated past chapter 69 right now and the raws for 70+ have been out for months soooo that kind of sucks...a lot.

/r/Gundam would like to have a word with you ;)

I would recommend Gundam 00 (pronounced "double-oh"). Its the first Gundam series made in HD and it. looks. amazing.

Great fight choreography, great action. I think you'll love it. 

Hit me up for more Gundam suggestions if you'd like.

Also, the current hype mecha show is Aldnoah.Zero (3 episodes in). It's by the same guy who wrote PsychoPass, Madoka Magica, and Gargantia (another mecha show).

**Shiki (22/22)**

Just straight up blazed through this one. I got really hooked on this one and I think when it comes to Mystery/Thrillers then this one is definitely one of the best. It is a show about vampires and human morals and the story is basically [small spoiler](/s "that the MC's are slowly trying to find out why people just keep dying all the time"). The OST fits perfectly with the creepy and mysterious tone of the show and the artstyle is... [well certainly unique](http://i.imgur.com/WricH.jpg).

Another thing that stood out to me was how misleading the first episode was because [Shiki ep.1 and ep.2 spoilers](/s "just the way this episode is presented is very different from the rest of the episodes. They introduce you a MC that just complaines about everything and pretty much hates everything except the guy that she has a crush on. She even stalks him and spies on him at night. My thoughts on the first half where basically "wow do I really have to deal with this bitch as a MC -_-" however she dies because of a sudden disease and that's basically what changes the way the story in this show is told. Instead of a single MC the story is now told from the perspective of a lot of different characters at once. Of course later on the focus shifts more on the actually MC's because of reasons but I still found it very interesting.")

I would say if you liked Higurashi or Monster then you should definitely check this one out.

**Kareshi Kanojo no Jijo/His and Her Circumstances:** Picture a highschool romance anime, directed by Hideaki Anno. I'm 18 episodes in right now, and this has to be one of the best romances I've ever seen. Every character feels fully fleshed out, without resorting to tired character archetypes. The character's decisions are realistic, and there's a great deal of psychological analysis into their motives. There's so much more I can say about this, but I'll cut it short and say that it's one of those shows that makes you wonder, why aren't there more anime like this?

**Serial Experiments Lain:** 7 episodes in, and I'm ... not really sure what's happening. So Lain's classmate dies, she gets interested in computers, and then ... things happen. I like the tone of the show so far, but I feel I'd enjoy it a lot more if I understood the significance of every scene.

Did I finish Trigun this week? Can't remember. Anway, **Trigun:** This show was brilliant. It started off slow, just looking like goofy fun, but by the time the Gung-Ho guns started showing up, it got really good. You could really feel for Vash, when he desperatly wanted to save as many lives as possible. My biggest problem is that I don't feel that the back story was sufficiently explained. What is the deal with the plants? And [Vash] (/s "obviously isn't human, but what is he?") Overall, this series easily fits into my top 10.

**Revolutionary Girl Utena (29/39):**

Been working my way through this series for the past week or so. It's kind of slow-moving at times, but I'm really digging the visual and narrative style. 

This is a show that treats itself more like a stage than a camera lens. The chorus of shadow puppets interjecting [oblique commentary](http://imgur.com/a/4MK37) into every episode; the parallel or straight-up repeated scenes from one episode to the next; the surreal imagery that pops up all over the place, but [especially where the student council hangs out](http://imgur.com/a/NMaKk) -- Utena is very self-consciously telling a story, as opposed to showing events that are ostensibly "real".

Although, all the artsy thematic development and subtext notwithstanding, my favorite episode so far has got to be [spoiler](/s "Nanami trying to come to terms with the fact that she's apparently laid an egg.") Good times.
>> ARTICLE
**Psycho Pass (22/22)**

Started watching the re-release that's airing currently, but found out that the promised "extra content" might not really be worth waiting weeks on end for. So, that being said I started watching the original series and after a bit of a slow start ended up marathonning the whole thing this weekend. A real piece of work, this series. Equal parts amazing and disturbing, the whole fascination with utilitarianism and its ruthless cruelties as well as sick twisted tragedy in general is classic Urobutcher at his best.

**Shuffle!** It's my brother's favorite anime and has pressured me for years to watch this show since he loves it so much. I have a general disdain for Harems because not everyone can win, not to mention I'm a sucker for a straight up OTP Romance. 

I'm on ep 3/24 and so far it's "eh" I'm hoping it improves. 
>> ARTICLE
**Hyouka - Completed** To be perfectly honest i'm not a fan of the mystery genre in any form, and Hyouka hasn't changed that, but it is now my favourite slice of life anime i've seen. Great writing, realistic characters, fantastic animation and by far the best school festival arc in any anime. Why is there no festival arcs like this! We get to see most of whats going on in the school through multiple perspectives, the clubs, the competitions, running booths, i want more of this!

**Baka to test - Completed (both seasons + ova)** - So a couple of weeks ago i decided to go back and watch some of my favourite comedies to see if they held up (so far yes, they have). While i didn't burst into laughter at every other joke i found it overall enjoyable, though some of the characters did annoy me immensely (Himeji and Shimuzu) their jokes fell flat and they felt more in the way of best girl. I found scenes far less enjoyable when Himeji played a part, her character was shallow (not to see other characters are exactly deep) and pretty much bog standard Mary Sue.

**Horizon In the middle of Nowhere - 9/13 (1st season)** So i have been looking for something a bit more fun and adventurous lately, while the adventure aspect hasn't really begun, it has been building to it and has been an incredibly enjoyable ride so far. Aside from an almost annoying amount of exposition and tits the size of continents, the world and characters are interesting and likable. I love the fact that they've not just adapted our world into a fantasy/sci-fi setting but made it in a way that feels unique, they have their own quirks and lingo that is easy to understand, and i like that they are just letting things like the dolls or the interpretation of student councils exist without deep explanation of why. More shows should let the viewer discover the world, i like being confused for the first few episodes while i try to figure out how shit works in this world.

Anyway a side note, last season i decided to drop everything at episode 2 after i figured out i didn't like watching things week to week. I couldn't feel a connection to the characters that way, i finished most of last season not too long ago and enjoyed some of the shows (NGNL, Bokura Minna, Nanana's treasures) more than i thought i would. But there were shows that i don't think worked as well in a marathon. This season i've been watching Space Dandy and Sword Art Online weekly and i'd like suggestion for other shows that won't hold up in marathon form, it'd be a great help!

Oregairu (1-13): Definitely one of my top 10 series. Characters are very well fleshed out and likable, the humor is superb, and the drama didn't feel forced at all (unlike certain other series [](/s "kokoro connect")). Season 2 can't come soon enough

Nisekoi (1-11): Solidly entertaining, it's not some ground breaking masterpiece, but it's perfect just the way it is

I watched **Another** and i've just started watching **The World God Only Knows**. **Another** gave me the creeps and **The World God Only Knows** seems pretty generic as a comedy haremish sort of anime.

>> ARTICLE
**Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 (11/11)** Well, if nothing else, this was far and away the most *realistic* anime I completed this week. I found myself a bit irritated at the extras in the first few episodes being all-around rude to everyone, but after the intial two (three?) episodes we got to see more of the better sides of people. And then the depressing happens.

**Hamatora The Animation (12/12)** Basically, I saw the second season coming was airing in Summer and thought to myself "I wonder if this is worth watching?". I ended up with a definitive "eh, sure. Why not?" Its one of those shows that I'm continuing to watch not because of its plotline (which took a few episodes to really get into) but because its fun to watch. 

**Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku (13/13)** I just finished this within the past hour. This will likely be random ramblings. This will problably have more **spoilers** than the other two. 

Overall, I felt this was a fine show. We get to see Shu discover the working of a barren world dominated by war, where the soldiers operate on fear and what slim hopes of a good future they have left (its never really explained how Lala-Ru managed to get to Shu's world in the first place, although we do get to see how she was followed).

Speaking of Shu, I feel like he didn't change much throughout the course of the show. I somewhat feel like he should have changed given what happened, but at the same time, given his personality, it makes sense that he didn't. However, while Shu doesn't really seem to change his ways, the characters around him sure do, as Nabuca slowly begins to realize the things about the world he's fighting in. Also, Lala-Ru has no emotion and Hamdo is absolutely high on the crazysauce. 

I feel like I was going to write more than that, but its 1am and I did not get enough sleep last night. So to conclude, it wasn't a masterpiece, but it was good. I can see myself coming back to re-watch it sometime, eventually.

>> ARTICLE
**Gintama: 1-6**

Seems like an enjoyable show so far with some good laughs. I hope the laughs pick up though like I've heard. I've heard that after the first twenty or so episodes the show really picks up so I'm gonna keep going. Wish me luck.

**Zatch Bell: 1-14**

Don't ask me why. It's a show I used to watch as a kid and now I'm just rewatching for the hell of it. Except the sad part is that it had such a good concept but was executed so poorly. The voice acting (dubbed) is so bad I cringe sometimes. The plot is only ok and the animation would have been better with some of today's animation style. If Zatch Bell was made in this year I feel like it would have been 10X better. Anyone else watch it?

**Steamboy** - Majestic visuals, breathtaking animation, interesting alternate history take. It was trying very hard to be a whimsical fantastical action adventure, but it lacked a certain *je ne sais quoi*. The most impressive theme that ran throughout the movie was the question "what is science for?". For profit, for the pure discovery of laws of the natural world, to make people happy, or to strengthen your nation? But the exploration of the theme takes a backseat to wildly ridiculous but exhaustively entertaining action. 7/10

**Golgo 13 - The Professional** - The plot itself is straightforward tale of a stoic seemingly emotionless hitman and a father out for revenge. But it was told with a psychedelic, almost crazy and schizophrenic sort of artistic style that was interesting to watch. The director or the editor really had fun with this post-production, and it shows. Weird cinematic angles, strange cut-ins, action scenes only shown in silhouette, bizarre choices like having character portraits multiply, expand and dance around the screen as they talk on the phone. A competently made and well directed OVA that could have been easily mediocre, considering its straightforward story. 8/10

**Hurricane Polymar - Holy Blood** - Polymar OVA based off the original series. Character design by the guy who also did Kite and Mezzo Forte... his art style is very distinct. It's directed by Shinbo, but the only other thing of his I've seen is Madoka and this is nothing like that. It's a rather flaccid action show with annoying comic relief side characters who adds nothing to the "story". The "story" is 100% turn-your-brain-off material, with unnecessary sexual fanservice. The tone deviates wildly from the dumb slapstick humor with the comic relief characters to the grim and gritty, dark action scenes where people get their heads ripped off and blood and gore flies everywhere. Tonal whiplash like crazy. The fight scenes aren't even that particularly well animated, considering its just a 2 episode OVA. I did enjoy it overall, for visceral and not intellectual reasons, and its not really recommended unless you just want a dumb action show. 6/10

**Katanagatari**

I just finished this one, and it is instantly one of my all time favorites. The originality and art-style, the characters and the world they were written in, the light-heartedness that times its dramatic moments with such expertise. Everything about this show just screamed masterpiece to me. The final episode may also be one of the greatest closing episodes I have EVER seen in any anime. Well done.

**Uchouten Kazoku**

I'm around halfway for this anime. So far, I am loving every second. The character writing is always colorful and interesting, and the aesthetic quality of the show is off the charts and never ceases to give us some of the most beautiful shots we can find in all of anime. I have always kind of been a sucker for shows that feature interesting people to follow in their daily lives and this one definitely fits the bill while still adding more and more at every turn. However, I can understand how this may not be for everyone due to it's heavy lack of engaging linear plot lines.

**Hunter x Hunter 2011 (100ish-138)** 

This show surprised me like I never thought it could. It's up there with my favorite anime. Give it a watch if you haven't. Killua is a beast. Honestly, my only problem was the [Arc name spoiler](/s "Chimera Ant") Arc having a slow start, but it was totally worth it and it became my favorite arc of the show thus far. 9.5/10, wish I could go into hibernation until Tuesday.

**One Piece (1-9)**

In wake of my depression after getting caught up to HxH, I started this. It's pretty cool so far. Luffy isn't just a dumbass like he came off, and I like the art style of the show, dunno why people actively dislike it. I understand vast shonen like this have slow starts but it's not pulling me in very much. Usopp is kind of annoying, but I'll get used to him. 7/10, but will probably get better.

**Trigun (5-7)**

I started this anime a few months ago and while it was good, I was busy with school. I ended up putting it on hiatus. I was pleasantly surprised how it was very approachable still. So far, Vash is a rad character, who's turning out to be more complex than face value. 8/10, will most likely finish this up this week.

As I haven't been home during Sundays for quite a while I've missed a lot of these threads so too make up for it I'll post for the last three weeks here.

#30th of June - 6th of July

I finished a lot of the spring seasons series as they were on their last run this week but I also started and finished some other series.

**Ookiku Furikabutte** 25/25 - Man baseball series never disappoint, I think the reason baseball always comes out so interesting is because it's easy to be creative with while the sport is simple enough to quickly understand yet complex enough to keep interesting. Ookiku Furikabutte did a good job with the baseball scenes overall and I liked Abe's character a lot but Mihashi was extremely off putting.

**Hataraku Maou-sama** 13/13 - Finally got around too finishing this, a good watch well worth the time invested in it.

**Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya** 6/10 - The show is decent..... I guess. Nothing outstanding but not bad either.

**Chihayafuru** 3/25 - I felt like starting this up as it's supposedly very good, hasn't quite gotten into it yet but who knows about the future.

#**Hyouka** 3/22 - I got this feeling during an evening that I had to watch Hyouka and the time to do that was now and as such I began.

#7th of July - 13th of July

This week wasn't a very active one for me aside for one day in specific where we had an anime evening.

**Hyouka** 22/22 - While I did enjoy Hyouka quite a lot (especially the culture festival arc) I do feel like it's slightly overhyped around here but it was a good show nonetheless and the characters were all great.

**Tonari no Totoro/My Neighbour Totoro** 1/1 - Was a neat watch and definitely a feel good movie until I read the dark version of it which was quite intriguing all be it a very far fetched fan theory.

**Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi/Spirited Away** 1/1 - So as you might've guessed by now I wasn't very much of an expert on Miyazaki so I hadn't seen a lot of the things he'd done. Spirited Away was one of them but damn am I glad I watched it. Such a great movie!

**Mononoke Hime/Princess Mononoke** 1/1 - I was expecting this to be Miyazaki's best for some reason, slightly disappointed but still pretty decent.

**Kaze Tachinu/The Wind Rises** 1/1 - Not one of the Ghibli masterpieces exactly but it was really beautiful, a bit slow in my opinion though.

#**N.H.K ni Youkoso** 14/24 - I'll eventually get to finishing this I guess, quite a good comedy with an interesting set of characters.

#14th of July - 20th of July

**Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya** 10/10 - I think the series was decent, I'll probably get to watching 2wei eventually but I'm not expecting any wonders exactly.

**Cowboy Bebop** 26/26 - Never got around to finishing Bebop before but finally did, overall a nice watch but not as good as people make it out to be.

**Trigun** 26/26 - A bit too repetetive for my taste but I managed too finish it atleast even if just to say that I did.

**Sankarea** 12/12 - I started this a while ago and then put it on ice but finally finished it, a bit of a shame because I loved the introduction to the series and thought it was gonna be really good but ended up being so-so at best.

**Fate/Stay Night** 17/24 - Really enjoying this thus far, I figured I'd watch F/SN and then rewatch F/Z too see if it raises my opinion of F/Z, Saber is a really nice character now that she's getting some development. I did read on MAL someone saying F/SN was like "A 24 episode series with the animation budget of a 12 episode series and the storyline of a 36 episode series". And I'm starting too see what they meant.

**One Piece (1-40):**

I decided that if I was ever gonna catch up to this anime it would be now. So far I have loved it. I have watched at least 3 episodes of it every day so I'll be fully caught up sometime in February 2015.

**Selector Infected WIXOSS(7-12):**

Finished up the anime. It was okay. It started to become interesting after like episode 9 or something ([Spoiler ep.9](/s "the one where Yuzuki becomes a LIRIG")).
>> ARTICLE
Completed **BTOOOM!**, because I like to suffer and wait for a season 2 that will never come. It is a really good show actually. 7.5/10

Completed **Natsume Yuujinchou**. It isn't my cup of tea, definitely, but I actually kind of enjoyed it. Mainly Nyanko-sensei, because he is easily the best character in the show and turned boring situations into comedy moments. Natsume is very, very bland which is a shame. The rest of the cast manages to be good, and the stories are kind of nice and everything. If I ever feel like watching something relaxing, this will be the series to go to. 7/10

Then, my computer died and could only watch old stuff. So I ended up rewatching **Accel World**, but no one cares about this show so I'll move on.

Yesterday I, finally, started **Cowboy Bebop**, but I still don't have an opinion about it.

Total amount of episodes, although no one cares: 55, including the seasonal ones. I was busy with other stuff so I didn't watch a lot of anime.
>> ARTICLE
**Higashi no Eden (Eden of the East) (11/11 finished)** - Wait, was this really an anime? It sure didn't feel like one. The premise(which was not revealed right at the start) did remind me of Mirai Nikki, but in terms of storytelling, this was vastly different. In that sense, this was more like 24. Characters mean nothing(except during the short intermissions), next objective means everything. 

And that was my favourite thing about the show. There were no cutoff points, no reasons to quit. I could easily just keep watching episode after episode without getting bored. Hell, this is one of a very small number of shows that I think could be extended quite far in terms of additional episodes(and they already kind of did, with the 2 movies that I have yet to watch). I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone.

**Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (The Tatami Galaxy) (11/11 finished)** - Well... What is there to say about this almost infamous show? 

Interesting visual style(s) with sometimes-smooth-sometimes-not transitions that ultimately serve their purpose perfectly, storytelling that goes from episodic to thematic to self-referential to paradoxically simultaneous to somehow sensibly conclusive, characters who at first glance are naive, narcissistic, kind, eccentric and outright evil but who are actually evil, eccentric, kind, narcissistic and naive at first glance in that exact order but actually in no particular order. Soundtrack was ok but forgettable, I guess everything can't be perfect.

Still 10/10, though.

**Kuragehime (Princess Jellyfish) (6/11)** - This show is more standard than the aforementioned shows. It's fairly trashy in its comedy, not unlike most harem and non-harem romcoms you see every season. In terms of plot, it's kinda like Watamote, except the main character doesn't actually want to be popular. What sets this show apart, however, is the fact that it's based on a josei manga. This means that the character interactions are fairly different. The humour is much more self-deprecating on all fronts and it passes the [Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) on several occasions(almost all of the time, in fact).

All in all, this show is worth checking out, if only for a few episodes.

**Kill La Kill (1-9)**

Started out pretty shitty and was rather reluctant to keep watching after the first couple of episodes, but it is getting better even though a good part of episode 9 seemed like a waste of time.

Yikes, where did my weekend go...

**Usagi Drop (11/11):** This is probably now in my 10 top all time favorites. What a wonderful story about something so selfless. While the art wasn't revolutionary, it was skillfully done and the voice overs and music were very tasteful too (even the child voice actors were quite good). A non-stop train to feels town. Now to forget the manga ever existed. D:

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! (12/12):** Ohhhh boy. So many things I could write about this show. I could go on and on about symbols and social commentary, but the reality is you just need to go watch this. It is outstanding.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren (12/12):** If you just couldn't help yourself, you'll be like me and watch "Ren" as well. Unfortunately, you'll find a lot of filler and a very frustrating series. Hopefully KyoAni won't let it end here and will make another season or movie or something. Whatever you scored season 1, expect about 2 points lower for Ren.

**Tonari no Seki-kun (21/21):** To quote DemolitionD, "this show *gets* me." I haven't watched any anime with the ability to make me legitimately burst out laughing in a long time. Sure I chuckle or smile at some of the antics, but nothing was as genuinely funny as this show. As guy, I can absolutely relate to Seki-kun at every turn. What a wonderful way to way to *kill time.* ;)

**Lucky Star (1/24):** I don't think this is for me. I might watch another episode or two just to make sure, but I don't find it funny. I know I'm supposed to find it funny. I understand the jokes, the punchlines, and the general type of humor, but the timing (or perhaps the subject matter?) doesn't work for me. I can see where others would like it though.

**Blue Spring Ride (1/12):** Yeah, this is going to be right up my alley. Unfortunately, I waiting a week between episodes and CR only has two episodes out. I'll probably stop for now and wait till they are all released and then mainline the whole thing like a champ.

**[Ga-Rei: Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4725/Ga-Rei:_Zero)**

Mostly because of a [certain gif](http://i.imgur.com/gjNMBrX.gif) that's been going around lately, or rather the reactions to it (looking at you /u/NoviceElectromancer). In a word, holyshit.

[1st ep spoilers](/s "First off, the first two episodes. Attack On Titan got nothing on this in terms of killing off potential main characters. The ending of the first episode alone had me addicted.")

[Later spoilers](/s "The next few episodes were a complete change of pace, which I was initially hesitant about, but definitely found myself enjoying. And then the expected feels trip kicked off with the gutpunch to the emotions that was episode 9 (Yomi in the hospital). Despite knowing it was coming literally from the first episode, I was still totally unprepared.")

[Last ep spoilers](/s "And as much as I wanted there to be an 'everyone wins' ending (well, everyone other than the people who were already dead I guess), I'm kind of glad that they made Kagura kill Yomi.")

Good stuff. Fantastic soundtrack too.

[spoiler] So this week I watched "Chibi Vampire/Karin" episodes 1-4 with my boyfriend. What started this was discussing Anime and I ask him if he's watched before, he tells me no but he's read the mangas and enjoyed those. So I'm excited because he may like the anime series. There's so much i enjoy about this series. I've watched it completely before but i'll explain what I like from what I saw so far this time. My favorite part so far is when Karin finds out she's attracted to unhappiness. She thinks that her blood taste is embarrassing, and Kenta has a strong dose of unhappiness, so she's trying to get him to be happy. Karin's friend Maki Tokitou (I may have the name wrong) noticed that Kenta was very hungry so she gave him Karin's spare lunch. Kenta gave Karin the bento at the end of the episode and was thankful. Karin says at the end that "happiness is a boxed lunch!" which is my all time favorite quote from that show.

**Texhnolyze (13/22)** (pronounced: Tek-no-lies)

I don't know what to make of this

...

...

[](/s "Holy fuck")

First off, check out [that OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3SzOzm8lmo) with a song by Juno Reactor. This might knock *Key the Metal Idol* off as the weirdest show I've ever seen. And the darkest, like this might be one of the darkest shows out there (Shin Sekai Yori's got nothing on this). There is such a heavy and bleak atmosphere pervasive throughout the whole thing, combined with washed out backgrounds and Yoshitoshi ABe's designs give this thing an incredibly unique and dark presentation. The cinematography is almost western-like, the dialog is very minimalist, lots of symbolism, and the storyline is quite cryptic. The characters don't say much at all, and we don't hear their thoughts. We learn about the characters by their actions, which is actually kind of refreshing instead of having it spelled out for you like usual.

It's a draining show to watch, since you really have to use your head to piece together who the characters are and what is happening. So, to my surprise, I ended up marathoning quite of a bit of it! It's just so enthralling and interesting to watch. Though the ED might have helped out a bit, [this ED is fantastic!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh1hoNwFfg8) and such a contrast to the rest of the show. While everything usually sounds so muffled and disturbing and electric, the ED is a wonderful change of pace with it's acoustic guitar and bright colors. Like this may end up being one of my all-time favorite EDs.

Anyways, I think I like this show. It's *so interesting*.

> Sometime in future Japan, androids have been involved in every aspect of peoples lives. One day, upon checking his android's behavioral log, Rikuo, a student, noticed his android's returning times have been odd recently. With his friend Masaki, they found out the place where his android, Sammy, have been visiting: a small cafe called Eve no Jikan where androids and human are not seen as different. Upon talking with the "people" in the cafe and discovering more of Sammy's behavior, Rikuo changed his view about androids and treat them as friends rather than tools.

I've watched it several times, including when it was released months apart, so I won't be voting for it, but Time of Eve is something I've really enjoyed. Heartily recommended.

Honestly, this line-up is full of good stuff. I liked Wolf Children, and absolutely love Voices of a Distant Star, but being 30 minutes, I'm also not sure just how much there is to say of the latter (said he who sometimes writes 1.6-2k words about single anime episodes).

**Gintama** (24/201) - Watched 11 episodes this week to keep up with the [group discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/29wdoq/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_1924/). It's still hit or miss a lot of the time but I'm enjoying it more overall. Whether that's because I've gotten used to it or because it's gotten better I'm not sure. Some individual points:

* Captain Katsura was fun. Not sure how I feel about Zura getting crazier though.
* Elizabeth is... eh. New ending is great though.
* Much like Shinpachi, I didn't want to spend an episode looking at/hearing about his sister's panties. Seems like most other people really liked it, but again it's not my preferred style. All of the landmine triggers were fun if predictable.
* The stories with the kappa Amanto and Gintoki hunting down a fan were both good.
* In general, I like any episode dealing with the dynamic between humans and Amanto. Terrorists and resistance plots are good.
* Sa-chan is my new favorite character in the show, but I hope she gets some character development beyond the pilot and her introduction. It's partially the glasses.

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (6/64) - I dont remember specifics of the original FMA but I feel like Scar didnt become a major threat this early on. I like this pacing though, and Armstrong gets more time to sparkle on screen which I always love.

---

**Baccano!** (16/16) - I eventually came to the realization that this is basically what Quentin Tarantino would do for an anime series, plus [](/s "immortality, alchemy, and the Mafia.") Blew through the last half of the show in one day and I have to say it works much better that way than with one episode a week. Isaac and Miria are the best crazy couple, followed by Nice and Jacuzzi. Overall: a great dub and one of the best [opening themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOZ1hsb8smQ). Ill have to give it a second viewing at some point and see what I missed given the out-of-order style, but its already in my top 5 favorite series.

**Score: 9/10**

Edit: after watching the OP again for the first time since wrapping up a few days ago I realized I'm really going to miss these characters. I might have to bump up that rewatch sooner than expected.

---

**ef: A Tale of Memories** (12/12) - (I started writing this at 5/12 and kept adding as I went along so it will likely end up very disjointed.)

I love the shifts in art style they have at times. [ef](/s "Kei blames herself for Chihiros accident because she stole Hiro from her sister for one day? Thats rough.") Unfortunately, the music that starts playing after [ef](/s "Chihiro says Renji should kiss her then") reminded me so much of the [Exorcist theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1PH_Y8Xn4g) that I started laughing and it completely ruined the moment for me. [ef](/s "And then Miyako has a breakdown and its legitimately uncomfortable to listen to her leaving all those messages. After a back-and-forth with Hiro being a complete idiot for not deciding, nearly everything goes to pieces but he miraculously manages to salvage both relationships after talking to an angel or something. By the end I was more in favor of Kei than Miyako though.")

At least Renji and Chihiros side of things went decently. [ef](/s "And then they banged on the roof of the school and she decides to throw out her diary entries. He goes though a collect-the-pages quest but turns out he didnt need to because she cant stop thinking about him. Daww.") Overall, the much slower pacing was quite welcome compared to the other series Ive been watching, and while the Kei-Hiro-Miyako side ended up being fairly clich, Renji and Chihiros story was uniquely endearing.

**Score: 8/10**
>> ARTICLE
> Not sure how I feel about Zura getting crazier though

He is only going to get crazier, but he's going to be one the funniest guys in the show IMO.

I watched the earlier episodes of Gintama again and it was really weird seeing how Zura was more serious and well...a little bit boring. I think they took awhile to just really find his character and I personally like him much better as he is now than before.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion 2/26**

Yes, this is my first time watching Evangelion. I've known about Eva from before I was ever into anime, yet for some reason I just held off on watching it. I finally decided that it was time to watch the anime that so many people love.

**Mobile Fighter G Gundam 2/49**

I'm a big fan of the Gundam franchise, but I really haven't watched any non-UC Gundam series. I decided to pick up G Gundam after seeing pictures of the various crazy mobile suits that are present in the series. I mean come one, [one of them is a windmill.](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120818152956/gundam/images/c/c3/GF13-066NO_Nether_Gundam_Front.png) *That's brilliant.*

**Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic 11/25**

I'm normally not one for adventure shounen type shows, but the setting of this one looked intriguing. It's definitely a day-time shounen series, but I'm enjoying it so far.

**Cardcaptor Sakura 10/70**

The buzz around Sailor Moon Crystal got me excited for magical girl shows again, and this is one of the classic magical girl anime that I had never watched. I'm really liking it so far, perhaps more so than Sailor Moon.

**Seto no Hanayome 2/26**

Apparently I downloaded this months ago and forgot about it? I don't know, I just found it on my hard drive. I don't quite remember why I even downloaded it. But hey, it actually seems better than the premise suggests. It's very funny, and a bit of a break from more serious anime.

**Fate/kaleid liner PrismaIllya 7/10**

Gotta finish season one of Prisma Illya before season two starts. If you like the Fate/Stay universe, this series is absolutely hilarious. Plus, the battle scenes are really well done.

**Majokko Tsukune-chan 1/6**

[This show.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnctZvlyc2g) I don't even.

**Lucky Star 1/24**

Another one of those "I've known about this show for ages but haven't watched it until now" entries. The first episode was pretty mediocre, but that is what everyone who has watched the series has told me so I expected that.

**Little Witch Academia 1/1**

Rewatched this one. Still fantastic.

> The buzz around Sailor Moon Crystal got me excited for magical girl shows again, and this is one of the classic magical girl anime that I had never watched. I'm really liking it so far, perhaps more so than Sailor Moon.

I watched this because I remember it being the comical counterpart to Madoka. Suffice to say, that was pretty much on the money. BTW: [ending spoilers:](/s "Clow's a dick.")

Yes

I'm not the person you are asking, but yeah, I'm pretty sure that they are talking about Lucky Star, because they did switch the directors for Lucky Star after a few episodes.

G Gundam is a fantastic blend of various ridiculous ideas. The director is apparently a big film and TV buff, and he cheerfully borrowed images and elements from various international films and from old martial-arts TV serials.

I'm told the reception of the show among Gundam fans initially wasn't particularly positiveand I can imagine why!but personally I think, with a longer-term perspective, it actually manages to be a more coherent and successful piece of entertainment than some of the AU Gundam titles which cleave more closely to the UC formula.

#[Ripped from the /r/TrueAnime thread...](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/29uh51/your_week_in_anime_week_90/ciolvt2)

Finished up the last 6 episodes of ***Wandering Son*** (6-12/12). Note, by the way, that MAL will say it's an eleven episode series. During the block it aired, it was only allowed 11 episodes, so they spliced episodes 10 and 11 into one, and aired that. The BD/DVD came out with the complete versions of the show, and [*Wandering Son Specials*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10935/Hourou_Musuko_Specials) are those two episodes. 

[So I spent all my time gushing last time,](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/299lup/your_week_in_anime_week_89/ciirj8q) but you've probably heard enough of that (as did pretty much everyone on my Twitter; I apologize guys, I just couldn't help myself.) Very minimalistic dialogue and sound, still allowed the viewer to use their brain to infer motivations, etc. Still kind of bothered by how mature and "restrained" the cast is.

It's this last point that I want to address, because I think it's the primary point of contention I have with the show. On the one hand, being too muted and restrained means that suspension of disbelief is easily broken when you remember how young these kids are. On the other hand, though, the few times that Nitori gets something resembling emotional and [](/s "tells off Doi for being the little shithead he's always been (intentionally or not), the viewer feels that same heady rush of emotion that Nitori has when he realizes that he just stood up to someone.") By being so muted so often, the moments of real emotional catharsis or drama are amplified in power because they're so *rare*.

Speaking of catharsis, I'm happy about the climax, even if I secretly wish we got...more. It's fitting, for sure, and it's the capstone to a great amount of character development, especially on Nitori's part. Given that there were many more volumes of manga ahead of the finale, this was honestly the best way they could've ended it given the circumstances - [](/s "Nitori realizing that despite his best efforts, he's still growing into a boy, but then accepting it and showing his determination to change") was inevitable. I think my slightly tepid reaction to the ending is because I wanted something more...sweeping? Grand? It doesn't really fit the kind of show that *Wandering Son* is, but there was a distinct lack of finality to it. It felt like the ending to a first season, and given that there's a 0.001% chance we'll ever get a sequel, this should effectively be "it". It's just not enough.

I also wished we'd got more time to explore the side-characters. In particular, I'm interested in finding out more about Chi-chan. But I guess I always have the manga for that. 

At the moment, my provisional score is a 9, as I debate whether or not I found it memorable enough to be a 10. Either way, though, I *highly* encourage everyone to watch this if they like character focused shows and are tired of overly-emotional shows weighed down by an obsession with ***FEELINGS*** (you know what I'm talking about.)

Not sure where I'm going from here. I'm holding off on *Psycho-Pass* until I get confirmation of anyone subbing/streaming the re-air, and I dunno what else to tackle. Anyone want to give me an idea from my watch-list?

Dude.

> Still kind of bothered by how mature and "restrained" the cast is.

For me, a trans* person that knows several trans* people, that was quite believable. Most of the trans people I know were like that when they were young and the drama was mostly in their head which is understandable if one remembers that "the wrong body" tends to not be the place to show "the correct" emotions. Sure, the rest of the cast is quite "restrained", but it fits the boy.

Imo one of the most important aspects of the anime, and in this case the anime is very true, is that a girl acting as male is regarded as good and a male acting female is recarded as dysfunctional.
>> ARTICLE
I see, I didn't really consider that. I think my primary basis for that was that...well, honestly, all the middle schoolers I knew were insufferable and melodramatic little shits. I don't know any trans* people in real life, either, so I couldn't even rely on their first-hand knowledge to inform my statements. 

You're right, though, that being restrained fits Nitori greatly, regardless of his identity, so he's kind of the one exception to my "complaint." 

>a girl acting as male is regarded as good and a male acting female is recarded as dysfunctional.

Yeah, the anime did discuss that at length. What was kind of heartbreaking is that there was no "solution" that would've changed people's perceptions, other than time and persistence at making people not judge you like that.

Kokoro Connect. I did not think it would be this good. Some parts seemed "meh" but most of the time it was one hell of a ride.

Yup! Made me like Iyori even more

[Kyoukai no Kanata](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18153/Kyoukai_no_Kanata) I really enjoyed it, I thought it was an anime all about dance because of an AMV i watched, until my friend told me to watch it lol.
>> ARTICLE
I personally couldn't really get into it.

It was just excruciatingly boring to me. I didn't find it particularly funny, I didn't find the characters too compelling (especially MC) and the attempts at being a dark series fell flat due to the jarring contrast with the moe factor of the shows (dance scene for example).

It however *looks* really nice, but I can't find anything that is particularly enjoyable outside of that.

It's one of those shows I might pick back up when I am in a mood to watch cute girls doing cute things.

I havnt watched it since it first aired and have completely forgotten about it. What happened in the last half minute?

[](/s "Akihito randomly gasps and starts running up to the roof of the school without any reason. He opens the door and Mirai is just there, smiling, and they greet each other. Credits roll.

[](/s "oh yeah, because she shatters into glass and dies, then they go on with there lives and stuff and its a pretty decent ending. Then suddely out of no where he just decides to go to the roof and shes suddenly aliive again")

Precisely.
>> ARTICLE
 I'm not op, but personally, ruined it for me. I actually didn't mind the series up to that point. It was visually stunning and I enjoyed Akkey and Hiromi's dynamic. The plot was nothing special but I thought it wrapped up okay as far as LN adaptations go.

And then the ending.

**Steins;Gate [24/24 + extra + movie]** - Finally got around to watching it, and what a ride it was. I loved how planned out it was compared to a lot of other anime, in that almost everything that happens is connected to something that happens later. The only gripe I had was it didnt show as much of Suzuha's mother as I would have liked (though at least they didn't leave it completely hanging and actually showed who it was).

**Score: 10/10** - Definitely in my top 5 now.

I'm only just getting back into anime after a long hiatus so I've been watching a lot of short animes from the last few years. 

So far I've gone through in the last week:

 - **NGNL**: This was a lot of fun. I loved how the siblings were so confident indoors and not so much outdoors.

 - **Hataraku Maou-sama**: Mad giggles. Really liked the sheer ridiculousness of the situation. 

 - **Nisekoi**: Only a few eps in, but I read the manga so I know what I'm in for.

 - **Golden Time**: Watching an ep right now. Couldn't get into the manga but was quite interested in it so here we go.

 - **Sakurasou No Pet No Kanojo**: I've had the opening and ending songs on repeat.

 - **Yu-Shibu**: Almost forgot this one. I like Airi so I wasn't having the most fun times.

If there are any good anime from the last few years that I haven't named that you reckon I'd enjoy, let me know. On holidays now and I am in full swing.

Typed on mobile, sorry for any misspellings

**OreImo (31/31)** - Decent series, ending was absolute shit, Kuroneko best girl.

**Sakura Trick (12/12)** - Went into this expecting moe yuri cuteness and that's exactly what I got

**Katanagatari (3/12)** - Really liking this one so far. All the characters are enjoyable and funny. I loved the catchphrase bit and how its continuing. I've only heard amazing things about this series, so I'm excited to continue it.

**Knights of Sidonia (6/12)** - This was sold to me as Attack on Titan in space with mechs (Yes I know this series came first) and it really fits. The similarities are huge really - Humanity living in a small isolated place, attacked by monsters of unknown origin. Its been one hundred years since the last major incident,  [both series spoilers](/s "the 'elite' team gets wiped out so the rookies can take center stage, and both government have an interest in the main character because he has something special about his skills"). Not saying its a bad thing, I enjoyed AoT for what it was, and I'm enjoying this as well. Also, from following the discussion threads along with watching introduced me to the program SVP (can't link, on mobile =\ ), which has pretty much changed how I watch everything, so that's fantastic

I just stopped OreImo after [he](/s "confessed to his sister"). I know that's kind of being a bad sport, but I just couldn't deal [with](/s "best girl losing so badly"). But from what people have told me, I'm not missing out on much.
>> ARTICLE
Right?  I kind of wish I didn't watch the online episodes.

I had to finish the series just because it was so close to the end, but you're not wrong for stopping. It just kept getting more and more difficult to watch until the very end [Spoiler](/s "when they reveal they were only pretending to date each other, but that just pissed me off more because he then dumped Kuroneko for no reason.") 

[Spoiler](/s "I really feel like I missed something with the end because the final reveal was just too sudden. Could someone explain why they pretended to date each other because it seriously pissed me off.").

The author just made it like that for some reason, even though all the fans preferred Kuroneko more... He did an AMA on 4Chan in which he answered a bunch of questions about the storyline. And I agree with you, it was pretty hard to watch that ending.

Just a nice, fun little series but sometimes that what I need haha.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that's a much nicer introduction to Yama no Susume than I had. Mine was from a barely-remembered comment in /r/animesuggest when we were talking about anime shorts. It sounded interesting, so I put it at the top of my queue. And, quite frankly, I'm glad I did.

Glad you enjoyed Kyousougiga, it is one my favorites as well. One of the few shows that I will bother rewatching.

Just watched and finished Madoka Magica in one day. WOW. Just WOW. I'm a big shounen fan--I like shows targeted for boys usually. So when I saw Madoka Magica I thought it was just going to be some "kawaii shoujo crap" that 15 year old girls would like. 

I couldn't have been more wrong! Madoka Magica is up there with my favorite anime, now. And I watched it only on a whim. :)

[**Tari Tari**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13333/Tari_Tari) (5/13) - Decided to pick up a show someone told me was very good, and it gave off a SOL vibe and that's what I like watching.

The art is superb, and I was surprised to see a comprehensible plot developing with tidbits of character development alongside it. I enjoy all of the characters, and if the show continues going this way, I'll definitely end up dropping it a 9/10 on MAL.

Finished Neon Genesis Evangelion and End of Evangelion.

I can see why there's a lot of hype about Evangelion. The storyline is interesting/shocking. The characters are portrayed in a unique way. It's really, really bleak and kind of hopeful. Overall, it's a great anime, but around the last 5 episodes and the movie I just began to hate the entire thing. It was still very interesting around that point in the story, but it got a LOT harder to watch. I'll acknowledge that it's an exceptional series, but I'd describe the latter episodes of NGE and the movie as the animated equivalent of being repeatedly punched in the face. 
>> ARTICLE
Marathoned all of NGNL, pretty decent its very overrated in my opinion though. 7/10

Also started to rewatch Bleach haven't watched since 2006 probably going to stop after the Soul Society arc.
>> ARTICLE
This is a really a "wait a week for a new episode" anime. Just waiting a week to find that [NGNL spoiler](/s "Sora doesn't exist anymore") is almost devastating. 
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari  12/12**  
This is the best show I have seen in a long time. The characters dialogues and interactions were some of the best. Every episode, a new character is introduced and we are told their reason for fighting and their original backgrounds. Yasuri Shichika starts out as a character whose only goals were those that Togame set for him, which was to protect her, himself and the swords. In the beginning, Shichika refers to himself as a tool of Togame but as the series went on, Shichika interacts with the owners of each sword and he [](/s "slowly gains humanity and becomes a human with his own emotions, desires and goals.") Togames changes are how you interpret the ending, she claims to [](/s " learned about having fun, laughing and enjoying life but her overall nature was still that of scheming and trickery") and her overall goal was still[](/s "revenge"). I also loved every Maniwani character, they were all unique and had their own personalities. The art was great in my opinion, but I could see that I might not before everyone. The OPs were average but the EDs matched each episode and whether you like all of them is personal taste. I thought 1 and 12 were the best. If you are a shounen lover and just want to see some fight scenes with katanas then this show is not for you because it is based on its dialogue. Otherwise I think this is Nisio Isin best work and everyone should give it a chance.  

**Score 10/10**


**Aquarion Evol 26/26**  
Wasnt mecha fan and this show did nothing to change that. Overall the character development was very miniscule, the MC Amata never changed throughout the entire show, he was weak and did not get anything done unless Mikono was around to Power him and was overall just a very static character. If anything, I thought the side characters had more development than the main ones. The story was not explained very well, everything seemed to come at you near the end. The last 4 episodes had so many twists and revelations that I couldnt even understand what was going on. The music was great for this show despite the mediocre story, [every insert song], OP and ED were very good. The art is nice, each character and mecha were drawn very well. Overall, if you like some cheesy romance with fancy mechas, you should check this show out and consider reading about or watching the prequel Sousei no Aquarion because it might clear up some details of the show.  
**Score 6/10**  

**Plastic Nee-san 12/12**  

This show is a series of ONAs that were around 2-3 min long each. All the episodes were just straight comedy. There was no plot, the characters did not have any development but they had great chemistry. The show delivered its comedy in the form of physical gags. I went into this show expecting pure comedy and nothing else and that was what I got. If you have half an hour to spare, you should definitely check out this show.  
**Score 7/10**

**Darker than Black: Kuro no Keiyakusha  18/25**  
The story for this show is told episodically with mini 2 episode arcs. So far, I have enjoyed each arc and the characters that were in those arcs. The plot is easily understood as most details about the contractors and characters are explained and their backgrounds are usually shown to us, with the exception of the main character Hei. At this point of the show, I still dont know much about Hei and what his motives are but I hope that gets revealed sometime during the show.

In case you didn't know, Darker than Black has two sequels. Be prepared to be disappointed by the (chronologically) second sequel.

**Bakemonogatari [15/15]** I know a lot of people really like this show, but it isn't for me. I enjoyed a few arcs, but this show gets a pretty meh enjoyment rating from me. 

Technically, however, I think it's good. There were very few instances where I spotted lazy animation and the colors are nice. 7/10

**Non Non Biyori [9/12]** I dropped this show back when it was airing and after watching 3/4 of the series, I honestly don't know what I was thinking. This is a very fun series that actually makes me laugh. 

The episodes feel quick and the characters are really nice. Renge is particularly good and even the side characters feel alive. Excited to finish this show

**Mars of Destruction [1/1]** I watched this a after seeing it on someone's MAL list as a 1/10. After watching it, why the fuck would they make a show this bad? It's not unwatchable, but it's a 2/10 at best. Who approved this garbage?

Ep 10 of NNB is probably my favorite. I hope you enjoy it!

**Black Lagoon** (29/29) - Saw this on Toonami while on vacation, then saw someone post something about how great Revy's dialogue is, so I checked this out.

Wholly recommend this series for anyone who wants a dark, yet fun action series. Hope more of this comes out.

Watched **Clannad** and **Clannad: After Story**. Yes, I cried. I cried a lot. I really liked how After Story really goes beyond where every anime stops.

Also watched **Ano Natsu de Matteru**, which was fun, and finished the first season of **Natsume Yuujinchou**, which is beautiful and relaxing.

**Katanagatari:**

This show captured my heart very fast. The lovable play between the two main characters just made me want their relationship to continue building and the action scenes were fantastic. This one climbed up to my top 5 spot instantly.

**Monogatari Second Season:**

It's Monogatari, It's great. Didn't expect this one to have some sad moments but I'm glad it did. Also Kaiki is best character.

**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 3/24:**

This show is really lovable so far. I love Dio and his audacious ways of fighting. I'm excited to see new characters appear and see what they bring to the table.

Was watching some old AMVs and remembered how much I enjoyed that series. It's unfortunate that the manga ended up turning into a stereotypical shoujo, though.

**B gata H kei** - Very humorous romcom anime with ecchi elements that I enjoyed throughout the whole season in almost one go. And then I continued where the series left off in the manga. Great ending for the manga, hoped that S2 is there but I guess that won't come true. 8/10
>> ARTICLE
So I just started getting into anime, so I am going through highly recommended shows.

1. **Angel Beats!** (13/13) - Just want to say right now that this is my favorite series of all time now, even with its flaws.  I felt that every main characters (aka all the ones at graduation) plus Yui and Iwasawa had really fleshed out stories that I personally enjoyed.  The humor was also great in it and the OST was utterly perfect.  Many tears were shed.  I realllyyyyy hope at some time it gets the FMA -> FMA:B reboot to 26 episodes or so to flesh out the other characters, but even so I have been giving them personal backrounds in my head and that helps me have closure.  **10/10** for me.

1. **Toradora!** (25/25) - Loved it!  Was way more realistic than the other romantic eske shows I have watched.  The OST is fantastic as well.  I have not seen a more powerful scene than when [Toradora Spoilers](/s "Taiga realized she cared for Ryuji in the Christmas episode and started yelling his name").  I gave it a **9/10** in the end and it's #5 on my all time favorite list.

2. **Steins;Gate** (24/24), OVA (1/1) - Had to see what the fuss was about and I really did enjoy it.  The first 9 episodes or so were a bit boring but I heard to push through and I never drop anime so it wasn't a big deal.  Not only was the story fantastic but I felt that the logic behind how time travel worked was very fleshed out and made sense.  Also...that last line in the OVA made me squeal.  **9/10** as well.

3. **Bakemonogatari** (10/15) - I don't really know what to think about this one.  I have heard it's good and I enjoy the dialogue but I feel there are way to many things that just don't feel right to me.  Was it ever explained why there are these minor gods and stuff around?  Or is it just implied this world has them?  Are the seasons after much different than Bake?  I'd give it a solid **7.5/10** right now, for I do enjoy the dialogue, just not a personal favorite really.

4. **Fate/Zero** (6/25) - I'm slowly trudging through Fate/Zero...Episode 5 was good but I am not really pulled in yet.  I'll have to keep giving it a chance.

5. **Clannad** (5/23) - I really like it so far.  Interested to see where it goes and why Clannad: AS is so tear jerking.  The scenes with the girl all alone are partially confusing but I feel like it will resolve itself in the future.  Also...does this guy know any guys other than Sunohara?  Like what.

Wow, you are watching/watched 4 of my most liked animes!  
Clannads first season was ~okay~ for me but it really shined in After Story.  
Fate/zero gets really good especially in the 2nd season so keep watching!  
How did you like Bake's episode 12?  
Steins;Gate has like the slowest start I know but it has a payoff that makes it worth imho :P

OH. Good thing I didn't spoiler too much... But yea, ep 12 is great D:

Toradora has an AMAZING OST for a show that is not action based in any way. Both OP's and ED's, AND the Christmas song, were all fantastic.

you watched the post-credits scene in the last episode of angel beats!, right?

that was beautiful.

It hurts a lot to see Angel Beats be "better" than Steins;Gate... well, everyone likes what they like.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't dislike Steins;Gate though.  It's just that first half is really drawn out, once it hits it's stride it's a 10/10 but you can't just ignore the pedestrian first 8ish episodes.

Stick with the Clannad, and keep us updated!

- Fate/Zero: 6/25 - Really nice animation, but the plot is a little confusing. I'm looking forward to the fights!


- Bleach 14/366 - I'm enjoying this so far. I'm probably going to stop at episode 63 where the soul society arc ends, and then read the manga, because I heard that there is so much crappy filler. 

- Black Butler II - 1/12 - The new main character sucks so far, he is such an ass! I'm wondering if it will be as good as Black butler I.
>> ARTICLE
For Bleach, just skip the filler arcs. Honestly, they are pretty crappy and not worth watching. 
>> ARTICLE
I wish I could watch Fate/zero again for the first time. It's getting so good especially in the 2nd season.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah in Bleach episode 64-109 wasn't really my favorite arc, reading the manga though. I'd recommend once you get to episode 110 to start watching the anime again because in my opinion the  fight scenes and scenery art look way better than in the manga.

Been watching Gintama, One Piece, Bakemonogatari, Soul Eater and Knights of Sidonia.

Knights of Sidonia is my favourite!

I've finished rewatching **Code GeassPP. I can finally understand its problems, but it still is an amazing show.

I've started **Nagi no Asukara**, currently on episode 17. It is the best drama I've ever seen (it is much better than Clannad season 1 or AnoHana). It actually has a story, the characters are really good and it isn't cheesy or boring to watch. I hope it continues to develop this well. My only problem with it is the lack of explanations on how they can actually live underwater. It has a severe lack of "suspension of disbelief", or whatever it is called.
>> ARTICLE
Been on a slice of life kick lately, watching some shows that I haven't gotten around to yet: Clannad, Toradora, Golden Time, and Nisekoi.

Finaaallly started with [Fullmetal Alchemist](http://myanimelist.net/anime/121/Fullmetal_Alchemist) (20/51), I was waiting for the summer vacation to hit before starting it and have been loving every moment of it so far
>> ARTICLE
FMA handles some of the early stuff better, like a certain character's sad little explosion, than Brotherhood does because it's more stretched out and Brotherhood rushed a little, a little, through the early stuff because, hey, it'd already been done. Brotherhood is the superior anime overall. Both feel much like the same show. 
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood is generally better IMO, but watching the original series gives you a much better idea of the quality change. Also, not sure if the same applies to the Japanese dub, but they change one or two English actors between the two series, namely Al. You get used to it quick, but it can be jarring. Fair warning.
>> ARTICLE
**Gintama** (63/276?): Began watching it for the weekly threads, but got really hooked. Just finished the Benizakura arc and it was awesome.

The first movie is also the Benizakura arc if you didn't give that a try, and enjoy the rest of the series :)

I'm slightly more than half-way through [**Revolutionary Girl Utena**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/440/Revolutionary_Girl_Utena).

* I really like the art and its stylistics

* soundtrack is also good

* the story still has many unrevealed elements and I try to avoid spoilers, anyway what I saw so far is intriguing and mostly coherent

* the shadow theatre girls are fun; I wonder if they have any plot significance apart from satirically commenting upon the events of the show

* the main minus is repetitiveness: lots of reused footage, most of each arc's episodes follow Monster of the Week convention etc.

* and finally, the only sane character is Chu-Chu

I finished the **Nodame Cantabile** series this week. I absolutely loved the first season, but the second and third season just weren't on par with the first. The ending was really disappointing [since](/s "Nodame never played in a concerto with Chiaki") But one thing I did get out of the series was the fantastic music.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the later seasons couldn't hold up though I still loved it. I have to wonder if that was because they had half as many episodes and just needed to cut a lot.
>> ARTICLE
I watched all of Eden of the East this week! Crazy stuff, I loved it.
>> ARTICLE
I've recently gotten back into anime after taking a year off for personal reasons, so I've basically been binge watching shows from the entire previous year, most of which are in the Summer and Autumn Season.

Out of all of them, the one that made the most impact on me is **Log Horizon**. It's everything I wanted SAO to be when I first heard of it, though I wished it had the same animation quality of SAO. The world made me interested enough to read the light novels, which is saying something since I usually avoid translated text works. Can't wait for the second season this autumn.

**Fate Kaleid Illya** is great on it's own merits, though for a fate perspective it's not as good as Zero and from a magical girl perspective it's no Madoka or Nanoha. Also, [Prism Illya Ep6](/s "they never explained what's going on with the lock in Ep 6, nor do they explain how exactly Emiya becomes a Heroic spirit considering the vast setting changes between F/SN and F/KLPI.") I've heard that this gets explained in the second season, but considering how it took up almost 3 episodes, the way they just dropped it after episode 8 kinda annoys me.

I've watched 3 episodes of **Kill La Kill**, and maybe I've been ruined by the hype train, but it didn't grab me by the balls the way everyone on this subreddit said it would. From what I've seen, it's a typical shonen anime with gratuitous fanservice and a really weird art style. Hope it gets better later, but with 2 entire seasons worth of shows to choose from, it's probably going to take awhile before I go back to it.

**Evangelion 3.33**. [Evangelion 3.33](/s "Poor communication kills, In medias res for too long, Pathetic Shinji.") Worst of the new ones.

**No Game No Life** My other great love of this binge watching session. Apart from the psychedelic color palette, I've liked everything about this show. It reminds me of Code Geass's before they went all in with the super robot train wreck bullshit, and it manages to mix comedic and serious elements together without having either of them overshadow the other, like what happens to most other series. Made me really interested in Sakurasou, which I'm planning to watch after I'm done with my current series.

Right now I'm currently watching **Henneko**, up to episode 4. It seems to be progressing abit too fast, since by episode 4 the basic premise of the show has basically been resolved and what's left is the budding love triangle. Basically, I don't know where this series is going to go next, and that worries me because the last time I watched an anime that resolved all it's plot points by mid season it turned into utter shit with the next episode, so I'm hoping that Henneko doesn't follow it's footsteps.

**Bakemonogatari (15/15)**

**Nisemonogatari (11/11)**

**Nekomonogatari: Kuro (4/4)**

**Monogatari Series: Second Season (2/26)**

I just finished up the last Bakemonogatari at the beginning of the week and I absolutely loved it, its easily in my top 5 series.  So I pressed on with the rest of the series and its honestly been great so far.  What's there not to like about the series?  The dialog is hilarious and amazing, the visuals are top notch, the music is top notch, the characters are also really unique and interesting.  

I was a bit wary of Nise since my friend who recommended the show said it was way more Ecchi than the first season but I loved it almost as much as Bake.  The infamous toothbrush scene was honestly one of the weirdest, funniest, and most awkward scenes I've ever seen and it might be my favorite seen in Monogatari so far.  Also Shinobu finally shows up and quickly became my favorite character.

So far so good, I'm hoping to finish up Second Season before Hanamonogatari in August but I've picked up quite a few shows (I think like 9 in total) so it might be a bit tough.

Welcome to the club homie.

Watched all of Jormungand this week. Lots of great gunporn, interesting characters, good storytelling. I particularly like the grey morality, it's refreshing to watch something where all the main characters aren't pacifist idealists that'll save everyone with willpower and guts. My only real complaint is that even some of the main characters don't really get explored all that much. While that's obviously intentional for some (the Hekmatyar siblings, for example) some of the others definitely deserved a bit more screen time. 

Also rewatched most of Kokoro Connect, barring one or two of the slower episodes. Not going to go into details for a rewatch. 

I suppose I'm also rewatching Durarara... well right now basically, while waiting for panels at RTX I want to watch. Can't get enough Miyuki Sawashiro this week. Or ever.

**Katanagatari 8/12**

I absolutely love this series. The eyes are probably one of the things I like about this show most. There are so many unique types and they look absolutely hilarious. I am a bit sad that the ending was spoiled for me, but I am not really affected by it that much. Interactions between Togame and Shichika are funny. Only things I dislike about this show so far are the overall strength of the Maniwani being so low, and how short the battles tend to be. His catchphrase felt like a bit of a joke early but he seems to fit it in almost perfectly in every fight. I thought it would have been hilarious if he went with Chesto or Cheerio though. So far a 8/10, nothing really standing out from this show so far as opposed to others. It seems like a lighthearted action series which cannot sever its bonds from romance and comedy. This show does not blow me away but it definitely keeps me in my seat watching it. 

**Kimi no Todoke Complete**

GIVE ME A KISS GODDAMIT. Not really my style of anime, was tied with bad miscomprehension drama and art was extremely mediocre at times. Overall, it accomplished its goal and established strong relationship development. The pacing was great *when* it actually stuck to the main conflict. I wish Sadako would really shut up about how Kazehaya changed her life though. I heard it twice and I was like wow this dude is an awesome guy. 7 times over, please stop being such a fangirl. This series was overall enjoyable to me, but I feel like just about anything I watch could have replaced or overtaken it.

**Gintama [9/201]**

Fell behind the weekly discussions going on and trying to catch back up. Find it humourous but still daunted by the length. Probably just need to quickly get up to the weekly discussion so that I can get more into rhythm of watching them.

**Nichijou [3/26]**

Another comedy that I just watch every now and then. Good fun to watch and I don't mind the humour which slightly concerned me before I started. 

**Selector Infected WIXOSS [2/12]**

I considered picking this up when it was airing, but decided against it since I was watching a lot that season. Pretty much on a whim just decided to pick it up today and am probably going to watch a few more episodes today. I'm getting a very similar feeling that I had with Madoka in that it feels like there's something darker going on. I've heard mixed things about the show, and am unsure what I think of it so far, it could go either way for me, I think.

**Time of Eve [6/6]**

I loved this show. Marathoned it one night and just enjoyed watching and learning about the characters. One of the few shows that made me actually cry. It's only short and I'd urge anyone to at least give it a go. 

**Fate/Zero [25/25]**

I had started off watching Fate/Stay Night ages ago but dropped it since I just didn't find it interesting. It was a great show as I expected going in given all the praise I've seen for it. I was confused a bit by the ending, but as I plan to watch the new Fate/Stay Night thing coming out at some point, I expect most of the confusion I had can be cleared up, and I'm not planning on looking anything up as I want to avoid spoilers. 

**Pale Cocoon [1/1]**

It was interesting, albeit I don't remember too much stuff right now. It didn't stand out massively to me, but I didn't dislike it, but nor did I get invested much into it. 

**Ocean Waves**

Randomly decided to watch this, and thought it was okay. Nothing much to it, though I did find the characters somewhat interesting. There were parts that I didn't like all that much, but overall I thought it was fine. May consider rewatching it at some point which may change my opinion.

**5cm per second [3/3]**

I feel like I will appreciate this show more if I rewatch it, whenever that happens. I think my mindset wasn't quite right when I started watching it, but I think knowing what's happening might give me a better impression of it. Still thought it was good, but not as good as I was expecting. 
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari (12/12)** - Not as good as the internet had led me to believe. I didn't really respond to the writing in the couple episodes of Bakemonogatari that I saw, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I wasn't as in love with this show as a lot of people are. Togame just never worked for me as a character, and I never thought she got to be more than just a tsundere. I grew really sick of the comedy that was shoehorned into the show through her. The show liked to move between grave seriousness and goofy comedy without a lot of nuance or care about tonal consistency. And really that's how I feel about the show over all, it's just really inconsistent. Sometimes the animation during the fights was great, sometimes it was a glorified slideshow. Some of the episodic characters were fascinating, some of them weren't. I didn't care for Shichika for half of the show, and then I did. Sometimes the direction and scene composition in the really dialog heavy bits was interesting, and sometimes it wasn't. Even the music was used really inconsistently, there was one track that I felt like they kept using at inopportune moments, but sometimes it was used well. I will say, I liked the final episode's climax, and the very clever character design.

**Aim for the Top! Gunbuster (6/6)** Hideaki Anno's directorial debut with Studio Gainax. I watched Aim for the Ace! a while back, and the first episode really is a loving tribute to that show. The parallels are very obvious. Still, it's kind of neat to see Anno having fun and making something because he thought it would be cool. The show does get a lot more serious later on, and due to the short length sometimes the transition feels a little abrupt, but it mostly works. One of the show's most interesting and compelling ideas was about [Spoilers for second half](/s "the timeline differences between space and Earth, and how 6 months in space could be 15 years on Earth. This means that teenage pilots would return home to find their friends have aged and left them behind or even died.") This added to some of the increased melancholy in the second half, but I thought it was effective. It's a fast watch, and has aged pretty well despite the fashion being very 80's, I'd recommend it.

The entirety of The Tatami Galaxy, wow what a show. While the start was a bit slow, the message it delivered and the way the last two episodes brought everything together were truly amazing.

Watching my way through the second part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) which covers the Battles Tendencies portion of the manga. 

I have had a weird JoJo experience. I watched the first part after catching up on the currently airing Stardust crusaders but have to say that at the moment that i enjoy Joseph as a protagonist more so than than Johnathan or Jotaro. I think it comes down to his personality, which is drastically different from the other two's more serious and brutish nature. 

Also Joseph has a spiffy scarf.
>> ARTICLE
blasted through mekakucity actors over two nights now that it's finished up.  i enjoyed the snippets of the story about the monster at the ends of the episodes, and overall the series was a lot of fun.  i liked how they did the eye powers.  three of the characters' eye powers were all based around perception - the one caused others to not perceive her, the one caused others to perceive her, and the other one caused othersto perceive him however he wanted.  that was cool.  
however, it did show its weakness as a short adaptation of a monolithic media franchise.  without listening to the songs, watching the videos, reading the manga, there's just too much left out.

i also started watching the idolm@ster.  (5/25).  it is silly and cute and i don't expect too much from it but it is a lot of fun.

I watched Girls und Panzer for the first time after much comments on Reddit being good. So I checked it out with low expectations, but it amazed me how good it is. I am now at episode 9 and I am loving it.

**Flowers of Evil** (13/13) 

Really twisted psychological show. I found myself strangely attracted to Nakamura, which I guess says a lot about me. The rotoscoping wasn't popular with a lot of people, I know, but I think it allowed the faces to be a lot more expressive, especially Nakamura's smiles. I need to read the manga since it ended with a *insert manga here* episode. I think the atmosphere created by the audio was one of the biggest strengths, as Kasuga walked through the town.

**Last Exile** (26/26) 

Something about this show made me reminisce about Eureka 7, so I was waiting for it to get super strange quickly, or for the vanships to suddenly have souls or some such. I honestly have no complaints about Last Exile though. It was fun, made me itch to go play a WWI/WWII flight game. Should I try Fam, the Silver Wing?

**Mayo Chiki!** (13/13)   
I don't know why I was expecting so much from this. It started nicely, but then it went on to the "we're not going anywhere" -route. It was dissapointing, but enjoyable.

**Steins;Gate** (24/24 + OVA + Movie)  
10/10, must watch, recommending it everywhere. Reading the VN right now as we speak. Changed my phone mail alert to Tutturuu~~! Kurisu top 2 tsundere. Got my motivation back to study physics.

The Mayo Chiki manga finished earlier this year. Not sure exactly where the anime stops but a good amount of stuff happens and the resolution is pretty good. Overall a pretty decent read.
>> ARTICLE
**Natsume Yuujinchou Season 2 (13/13 finished) & Season 3 (13/13 finished) & Season 4 (9/13)** - Yeah, I pretty much fell in love with this series back while watching S1 and have been watching nothing else since. I think this show defines the  recent "fantasy slice of life" subgenre, which has become so popular with shows like Gingitsune and Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha. In fact, Gingitsune is very similar to Natsume Yuujinchou. In both shows, the main character is one of only a few people who can see the fantasy creatures and in both shows, the main character has a lovable sidekick. Even the personalities of the sidekicks are fairly similar. In any case, I like this subgenre because of its possibilities. For Natsume Yuujinchou, that means that the episodes can be vastly different in terms of story. Some episodes are unbearably cute, others are nail-bitingly thrilling, with all of this being possible because there are very few rules you need to follow when creating supernatural creatures that are invisible to normal humans.

I don't really know what more to say about this show, since I covered a lot of it in my previous post, and the show doesn't change that much from Season 1 to Season 4. If I had to mention anything, it's that the later seasons focus more on people(more specifically, Natsume's relationships with other people) and less on the monsters.

All in all, I still recommend this to all fans of the slice of life genre. It also has some of the best Ending songs/animations I've seen in a long time: [Season 1 ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55hO1nR0b-I) & [Season 2 ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrSx8B-pwBc).

**Witch Hunter Robin 26/26**

After hearing Bana's "Shell" on an old burned CD my nostalgia over took me and I decided to watch it from start to end. I originally watched it on Adult Swim and missed the last 2 episodes due to sporting obligations and never knew how it ended. 

It was a pretty rough experience. The VA cast was filled with talented people but everything felt flat. I had high hopes after episode 14, when the STNJ is attacked that some sort of character development would grow from that episode but nothing really seems to come of it. I was really hoping for a big twist or revelation that wrapped it all up and just felt like I was left out of the story.

I'm not a big fan of detective shows like Criminal Minds or CSI and this show captured the atmosphere of that genre. I really liked the premise of the show and it had a ton of neat ideas, but character development really hurt watching this show for me. Add in the awkward dialogue of the dub and you have a flat **4/10.** 

The OP and ED are fantastic though!

Watched a movie and continued my watch from last week

**Psycho-Pass** (ep3-12)  
Really good so far. I enjoy the tension and the dystopian-ish world they live in. Episode 10 and 11 were really good and I hope to see some more of this. But why did they have to change out the Opening and Ending? I liked the first ones over the new ones. (Rating: around 9ish so far)

Rewatched **Mononoke Hime**  
I consider this Miyazakis greatest work of what I have seen from him. I watched this like 12 years ago when I was just half the age I'm now and god did I miss a lot back then. It's probably my favourite movies of all I have watched so far and it's really really hard to beat. (Rating: 10/10)

Watched 7 eps of Katanagatari. The first 2 eps bored me since I thought there was way too much talking for an action anime (saw it on the recommended list). Ep 4 was just mean, teased an epic fight and then the whole thing happened offscreen with the characters just talking about it after. I might finish the series by tomorrow but I'm kinda disappointed.

**Henneko (12/12)** (Watched 5-12 this week)

I enjoyed this. It seemed very light-hearted at first, but it slowly got darker, with some light-heartedness mixed in, or something. The idea for this anime was pretty unique, with the stony cat taking sacrifices and stuff. Hard to explain my feelings for this one. **8/10**

**Monster (48/74)** (Watched 41-48 this week)

Oh god this is intense. I can't get enough of this. I just have to find something to fill this void after I'm done with it. Ugh. So good. 

**Nanana's Buried Treasure (5/11)** (Watched 1-5 this week)

Not sure if this is appropriate here since it just ended recently, but I figured I'd put it in just to get some conversation about it if anyone's interested. I saw episode 1 when it started and figured I had more interesting stuff to watch, but the review threads interested me a bit so I bit the bullet and tried it again. Pretty good so far. I'm hoping there's some actual mystery solving processes happening in an episode. I love me a good mystery anime.

**Wolf Children (Movie)**

This was an interesting movie. At first, I felt like I was watching some furries' wet dream, but it quickly got better after the beginning part. It really was just a slice of life movie with really interesting character developments and stuff. I don't really know what else to say about it without getting into spoiler territory but it was very good. My one big downside is that it dragged a bit in my opinion. Maybe it's because I'm not used to movies yet. 2 hours is a long time! **8.5/10** 

**Porco Rosso (Movie)**

My first Ghibli movie since I started actually watching anime. It was good at first, but then it got progressively better and better until the end and by the end it was awesome. I loved the part where [Spoiler](/s "Porco and the villain (sorry, bad with names) get into a fight where they're throwing things at each other in the airplanes"). Very funny and all-around fun. **9/10** 

>> ARTICLE
I thought the same about Porco Rosso when I saw it. It started out pretty okay but just got better and better. I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
**Eureka 7** (50/50)

I watched the whole thing in three days and really enjoyed it! The only thing that bugged me about the show were the kids. Holy crap... they are the most annoying characters of any show I think I have ever seen. I think the show could have gotten away with being about ten to fifteen episodes shorter, but every episode had a plot point that was important to the story besides the soccer showdown. Overall I would give the show a 9/10
>> ARTICLE
Are they worse than the kids in the origional Mobile Suit Gundam? They were really annoying!
>> ARTICLE
I can't say that I have watched the original Mobile Suit Gundam, but that doesn't change my statement about them being the most annoying characters I have seen in a show. They got way too much air time for a story line that could have taken easily four episodes instead of over forty.

bokaru boku wa 7/10

**Toradora** (15/25) 

Really good. Humor's there. Even Taiga/Ami aren't too annoying because they show improvement, and we get to see different facets of everyone's personalities. Also really like the way they did Ryuji's "delinquent look" compared to simple references to Kodaka's hair/appearance/eyes in Haganai. I watch too many rom-coms, this was somehow funnier by being more realistic.

Taiga reminds me of someone used I know... there's a little resemblance. Rare expressions of happiness amidst a general moodiness. 

Continuing to work through the episodes, watched eps 1-15 yesterday, no regrets. 
>> ARTICLE
The Devil is a Part-Timer! Surprisingly, it was actually a really good show. I only wish there was a second season.

I'm sick this week, so here's a brief rundown.

**Genshiken** and OVA: kinda funny but mostly not. 6/10

**Green Green** and Specials and OVA: I'm in hell, aren't I... 4/10
>> ARTICLE
All of code Geass. 

Hated the art style at first but I slowly came to like it, couldn't help but compare it to deathnote though. It was pretty sad and pretty enjoyable. wasnt 100% satisfied with the ending but I think it was probably the best way it could have ended.


And im 7 episodes into Baccano.

Its pretty good so far I like the themes and stuff its brought it so far. All the characters are really nice and enjoyable and its one of the best dubs Ive heard in a while.
>> ARTICLE
Toradora. 9/10
I fell in love with the series at the bridge scene.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Durarara. Even though it was about gang wars and such, which are topics I usually don't enjoy, I really like that show. The characters were great, the plot twists were pretty good, and not over the top (if anything a bit lacking, but it fit the show, so I liked them). Oh, and Izayaaaaaaaaaa!
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first 6 episodes of love lab.

I swear, at least more than half of the people in the bus was looking at me while I tried to suppress my laughter. Lesson learnt: do not watch Love Lab in public. Woe-senpai slapping the President with a hand made slapstick is just hilarious. I personally love the style of the show and the art.

Definitely looking forward to marathon the rest of the series later.
>> ARTICLE
Watched Eureka Seven in its entirety this weekend, and watched the first episode of Astral Ocean.

Not sure what I'm expecting with AO, really...

Also finished Anohana. I was told it's really sad, and agree for the most part. I felt the cast's tears ran a little too much like rain for it to hit me all that hard though.
>> ARTICLE
[RideBack](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4618/RideBack).  I just watched it on a whim since I've got this FUNimation subscription that I was using pretty much for Ping Pong, and I finished it in two sittings.  Surprised at just how decent of a show it was; it's merely good but not great due to focusing on just one character for the most part, but it hits its emotional beats quite well and is gorgeous to look at (despite conspicuous CG).  Really loved that dub, as well.
>> ARTICLE
**Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha The Movie 1st**: Rewatched yet again. A pretty good alternate retelling of the first season, with some things chnged around. Cut out the irrelevant scenes, and improved on the places where the show shines. All in all, definitely worth watching, but helps to watch the first season first, underwhelming as it maybe in the beginning. And with Doctor Who Season 8 coming up soon (August 23, less than 7 weeks), and the BluRays on October, I would probably keep to rewatching A's, the second movie and StrikerS.  
Also, [](/s ""I don't realize things until they are too late." Quite the sneaky sucker punch to the gut at the end.
")

**Squid Girl Season 1** (11/12) and **Saki** (24/25): Not much to say here. Both has been enjoyable in there own way. Bummer that the KanColle anime went...I dunno where (goddammint Diomedea, get your crap together). Guess gonna be rewatching Squid Girl Season 2 too.


>> ARTICLE
[Sakamichi no Apollon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon) (Kids on the Slope) 12/12 eps

Two of my favorite genres are Music and Romance and this just happened to have both. I am a drummer so the second PV on Crunchyroll really got my attention. So I started casually watching it yesterday and before I knew it 5 hours had passed and I had just finished one of my new favorites. **Overall 10/10 Amazing, Must watch.**


[Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11843/Danshi_Koukousei_no_Nichijou) (Nichibros) 12/12 eps

One of the more funnier shows I have seen. Usually comedy anime doesn't completely click with me, but this one was definitely an exception. **Overall 8/10 Funny as hell**


[Ghost Hunt](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1571/Ghost_Hunt) 8/25 eps at the time of writing

I'm having a hard time with this show. The characters just don's sit well with me. I saw it on Netflix and was like meh why not. Watched the first arc and was kinda disappointed. The second arc was OK with one actual scary part that made me feel uneasy which got my hopes back up, but the third arc is back to being kinda slow. I might end up dropping it if it doesn't get its butt into gear. **So far 5/10 Boring for the most part, but it has its moments**



>> ARTICLE
The Monogatari Series. Finished bakemonogatari, nisemonogatari, and nekomonogatari. 
In like the 8th episode of Monogatari.

I never was one for supernatural shows, and I had a slight thing for harem animes (it is, more supernatural, but it is), but the one thing that grabbed my attention the most was the visual representations of... Everything. From the flying words, to the constant angle switches, to the color scheme changes, and to the classic Shaft head lean. 
The anime literally bombards the eye and the mind with so many things at once, paired with he half episode long monologues that can't get your mind to take a break on processing and pondering the thought of everything the characters say.

I would go into every detail from what makes this anime good, from the setting, to the origin of the apparitions, to the unique heroines, (gotta admit that they redefine what a tsundere can be, and that's just the main heroine.) to the random iconic fan services (dat toothbrush),  and to the MC impact to heroines of the series. 

I recommend this anime to people who already have watched anime. Doesn't needed to be many but if they watched stuff like Death Note, AoT, and (insert random Harem anime here) then this anime will definitely captivate their eyes.
>> ARTICLE
**Knights of Sidonia** (5/12) I'm pretty much a sucker for anything Sci-Fi and when Netflix finally released it I was hype. Needless to say so far, I'm pretty into it. The 3D is weird at first but once you get over it, oh man. It's great.

**Steins;Gate** (5/24) I'm waiting for it to go nuts but I'm totally into it. 

**Another** (1/12) Haven't really given it a chance yet. Will have to check back with this one.

Have you seen Star Driver or Captain Earth? If you like overblown transformation/launch/attack sequences then watch them. Captain Earth has one of my favorite launch sequences.

Gargantia on The Verderous Planet is cool for different reasons. While there's not many fights and it could have been 4 episodes shorter, it a very fresh and satisfying take on a mecha series.

I can't think of anything else you didnt mention that's not a Gundam series roght now.

**Black Lagoon** 29/29


Overall, a great solid watch. Revy is such a badass and it was a blast to watch. Roberta was also fucking awesome in Roberta's Blood Trail. Easy 9/10


**Bokura Wa Minna** 11/11

Being a romance adoring scrub, I enjoyed it. Moreso than Sakurasou actually in a shorter time. Art was actually really pretty, and characters were charming. 9/10


**Ping Pong The Animation** 13/13

Really great watch. Pretty much perfect actually. OP was great,, and art design was really unique and interesting. 10/10


**Sword Art Online** 19/25

First half was fun although the new ALO arc is a bit strange. I heard it turns pretty crap around here, but I might as well finish it. Reserving rating judgement for now.

Nisekoi is a 9 for me because once you decide that the romance will never progress, it is about a show about cute girls doing dumb things. I, for some reason, do enjoy girls doing dumb things. Umaru chan and Shimoneta are about to be some of my higher ranked shows due to that. 

Also it is the first show to make me ever read the manga after the season concluded.

So the only thing we agree on is madoka a 10.
>> ARTICLE
As for YuYuYu I like to link [this, not mine, review](http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=194159).

Death Note - I watched it really long time ago, I remember that it was boring, I didn't like the premise at all, and that [spoiler](/s "there was a (FBI?) girl who died in a stupid way, being short of unrevealing protagonist, only because the plot dictated so"). I came to conclusion (with the help of several reviews) the anime will be solely about complex ways both Ls use to trick each other and that because it is so long these tricks will probably get convoluted and ridiculous in the long term. Nothing interesting for me.

edit: added spoiler tag
>> ARTICLE
Even though Death Note is awesome in my opinion, I can't disagree with what you said. It does kind of get convoluted, but you only see it near the end when the plan is revealed.

I can't complain at all about your ratings. If you can give DxD a 10 then you are OK in my book.

I'll give you some recs:

Season 3 of DxD is more of the same, albeit a bit more serious.

Setokai no Ichizon is one of my favorite harem series of all time and a great comedy.

Trinity Seven has another great MC like Issei or Tomoki.

Shimoneta was a fun sex comedy, If you like the jokes you'll love the show.

Shoukugeki no souma is a brilliant show when it comes to hyping you up about food of all things

I feel like I see two extremes with DxD; very high and very low lol.

NGNL below a 8, what is wrong with you? No but seriously, I'm so used to be people in love with NGNL, why did you give it a fairly low score?

It was, as the mal score says, fine. Nice animation and some enjoyable hype moments pushed it over an average 5, but it really left no lasting impression on me, which is what a show needs to do for me to give it a relatively high score.

I guess that's completely fair. I said fairly low as in low in comparison to what it's usually rated.

Welllllllllllllllllllllll

I enjoyed the fuck out of it. All the characters (imo) were likeable and/or dislikeable in good ways. The story was intriguing and pacing was really good considering this is an arc of the story. The action scenes were good and had some interesting twists here and there. The art style while it had its moments is one of my favorites (besides UBW or Zero that's cheating). The MC seemed like a generic shounen protag (was strong and maybe a bit overpowered) but they explain why he's so strong, and no bullshit was used to explain his strength. As for character development, this arc didn't take place over a super long time, but they did this pretty well(Fremy). And I'm glad they left us with the open ending if it does continue. I also REALLY liked the OP. 

That's why.

Why did you give Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi a 9? I enjoyed it (especially the [](/s "first two arcs")) but I felt that the [](/s "prison school") arc was totally out of place and the [](/s "fake reality") arc was a little childish and not explained very well.
>> ARTICLE
I usually rate on enjoyment more than how good different aspects of an anime are, I gave KnIN a 9 for the gorgeous art and music as well as the lovable characters and interesting story and most importantly I really enjoyed it! If I were to rate differently then it would probably be a 7 or an 8 at best because I do agree that the story was all over the place and barely anything got explained or tied up at the end.
>> ARTICLE
Owari no Seraph at a 9 is an interesting choice. So is Danmachi.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah when I rate an anime enjoyment is probably the biggest factor and for me both were really enjoyable. 


For OnS I don't think it really deserves all the hate it gets, sure the concept wasn't overly original but the animation and art were done fairly well, the majority of the fight scenes were done brilliantly, the pacing and story were good and I enjoyed the characters especially Gurren and Shinoa!

For Danmachi I love an OP character, despite it's shitty tropes and Bell being blander than bland, I still enjoyed it. Again it had brilliant animation and fight scenes! I'll probably reduce it's score sometime soon though because I rated it right after finishing it hence the overly high score.
>> ARTICLE
It's fine really, I am one of the last people to talk about this considering my insane amount of 10's

Though I liked Seraph, It was meh in my opinion and the animation was horrible at times, feeling like a slideshow. Shinoa is still best character

Danmachi was also a fun thing to watch and the animation was great.


>> ARTICLE
I've just looked at your list, I completely agree with your score for Soma!


I gotta agree with the animation too, when it was done well I think it was done really well, I said majority of the fights were animated well because I remember one of the fights where it was literally just still action shots of the characters holding weapons haha. Shinoa is best smug.


Danmachi reminded me of SAO, although both have alot of flaws they're still great fun to watch.

>> ARTICLE
It was decent so it got the average score on MAL, can't really praise it for much other than it being a good portrayal of how civilians were affected by the war. 


Haha thanks, no point in circle jerking for the sake of it
>> ARTICLE
Yes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so I will not rag on you any further. You have great reasons to give it the score you did. 

And yea, circlejerks get out of hand, especially if they are serious circle jerks. I can take waifu battles all day, but once you start circle jerking over things and people take it seriously, I gotta stop right there.
>> ARTICLE
You didn't, no worries. Thank you!


I definitely agree, I don't mind people circle jerking their waifus or favourite idols or whatever but when I see people on here going on and on about how their anime is better than an anime that is similar or how their anime is more mature because it's a deconstruction it starts to become kinda pathetic and laughable. Each to their own!

JK we don't share the same taste in anime but if you can justify your ratings to yourself it's totally ok to like "bad" shows. I mean it's not like you are actively trying to shove down your opinion or scores down peoples throats or stating your scores as "objective" truths.

Aside from the fact that you have no sense of humor and no soul (as testified by your giving Plastic Nee-san a 2) that was established long ago, I think you give Sora no Woto too much credit. It's definitely not as good as some of the other things you've rated similarly.

Yeah...I've been thinking of doing an almost complete rating overhaul...besides a few of my favorites and the the ones ending from this season, I'm not sure how confident I feel about quite a few on my list...Sora No Woto and Clannad: After Story being high on that list since they're 10/10...I enjoyed them highly, but not even thinking that hard about them I've them I've had some after thoughts that they *weren't as good as I rembered right after I finished them*, being able to find some obvious flaws quickly...I'm kind of stubborn with keeping favorites up where they are, but at the same time...matured a bit and might be time to do some reorganization.

> Behold my barrage of 10s


Jesus, you weren't joking


Out of curiosity, how do you rate anime, what warrants a 10 in your opinion?
>> ARTICLE
If a show can induce that sensation of "post-watch melancholy/oh god what am I going to do with my life now that it's over" I usually rate it a 10. After a while I go back and knock some of those 10s down a notch (yes more of those were 10s) when the honeymoon period wears off and I look at it a bit more objectively.

There are some shows I rated a 10 for silly reasons specific to that show. For instance I think H20 Footprints in the Sand is awful, but it was awful in an incredibly hilarious way that I think was intentional. I have MM! a 10 even though it's just a silly fanservice comedy because I can relate to it.
>> ARTICLE
It's nice to see other people who rate more on enjoyment than the shows qualities, I have quite a few anime myself where I've given them a 10 because of something I love exclusively about them.

Honeymoon period is a great way to describe it haha, I'm the same. Still can't believe you had more 10s than that though, still as long as you're enjoying them.

>> ARTICLE
So after lasts weeks posts...I am not doing the rating system I said.  I will tag shows that are in my top 10 though.

**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! (12/12):**  Delightful. The ending was a bit strange but I thought it was good.  I feel as though the romance between Rikka and Mokota was really well done, unlike many shows I have seen. The animation was great and the characters really enjoyable.  I enjoyed it immensly.  **I gave Chuunibyou a 9/10.**

**The World God Only Knows S1/S2 (24/24):**  I enjoyed S2 much more than S1.  I felt the conquests had actual romance in them, and all of them were much more fleshed out.  The Haqua arc was also very good.  I also watched the two OVAs you need to after S2 and I am excited for [](/s "his previous conquests to remember him.")  **I gave S1 a 8/10 and S2 a 9/10.**

**Nagi no Asukara (19/26):** Wow is all I have to say.  This show is literally perfect so far.  Hikari is becoming one of my favorite characters ever.  The animation is simply perfect.  The [](/s "timeskip...just lord.  Episode 13 and 14 left me speechless.") I think if it ends strong Nagi no Asukara will be my #2 show of all time. I really hope it does too.

**Nisemonogatari (5/11):** Watched two more episodes.  It appears I have too be in the mood to watch Monogatari for I feel taxed when I finish an episode of it.  Still quality stuff though.  Shinobu is a very interesting character.  

I have been watching more currently airing anime...so that is why my list is a bit short.  

>> ARTICLE
Shinobu is best girl
>> ARTICLE
You're right to be excited for TWGOK S3 - in my opinion, it blows the first two seasons out of the water. Have fun with it!

Just so you know, you've seen most of what you need to, but there *are* some relevant manga arcs that never get covered in the anime. The Tsukiyo Kujy arc (chapters 43-46) and Body Switch arc (81-89) introduce a couple characters who are important for the Goddess arc, and Body Switch in particular is a really fun read. I'd also recommend reading the Mad Scientist arc (109-113) - it's introspective and a little philosophical, and it dives into Keima's psychology in a very interesting way.
>> ARTICLE
Man, ever since I watched True Tears, I've not been able to watch PA works any more. I should've known what I was getting into from the title alone :x. I'll probably try to watch NagiAsu and Glasslip sometime down the line, mostly because they are gorgeous, but I just can't do it right now.
>> ARTICLE
I need to watch True Tears it seems.  And Glasslip so far is...odd.  I don't know where they are going with it honestly.
>> ARTICLE
Nagi no Asukara is one of the best dramas around. I wouldn't say it is... perfect nor flawless (I'm pointing at the lack of explanations on how Ena actually works and how they can breath underwater), but it is really good. It touches some things other than romance, and I always like that.
>> ARTICLE
I have not finished it yet.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I didn't spoil anything. They don't explain anything else about Ena, so... Well, anyway, it is a good show till the very end.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed Nagi no Asukara but the ending seemed a little disappointing to me.  I felt like we developed the characters extremely well, but the implied ending makes me feel like a lot of that development was thrown out the window.
>> ARTICLE
Alright I just finished it, how do you feel as though the development was thrown out?
>> ARTICLE
[Its implied that Manaka and Hikari are together end of the show.  Basically, i felt that through all of his development, he had grown past his childhood crush, and would choose the girl who was strong and was always there for him, Miuna.  But instead, he chooses the damsel in distress who feels much less developed as a person, and to me, represents the immature Hikari that we see in episode 1.](/spoiler)  But that's just my opinion.

**Code Geass Episode 1-50**

I took this last week to burn through all of Code Geass. I wasn't really planning on it, it just sort of happened. Those bastards knew how to put the perfect cliff hangers at the end of each episode to motivate you onto the next one.

I think the first half was pretty well put together, and the way that everything sort of lead up to the finale was really engaging and well executed. They're able to make the show feel big, but at the same time they're able to make it small and isolate Lelouch (particularly at the end of the second season). I also like how the show actually challenged him. I came in thinking he would be a genius who just wins everything with his brilliance, which is certainly *how* he wins, he just doesn't always win.

Speaking of the second season, that was a bit of a letdown. A lot of the shit that happens seemed to come out of fucking nowhere. The things that didn't come out of nowhere just sort of happened. There wasn't anything gained, or learned, or explored. Lelouch just wins a thing and that's the end. I know the first season was also entirely plot driven, but I just wish this season were executed as well as the first. They certainly created a lot of different threads. There was paying for your sins, reason for living, and several others I forgot because my memory sucks. Despite that, I did think the ending was pretty well done. I kind of like how the show leaves you in the dark as to what Lelouch is planning until [CG ending spoilers](/s "he's pretty much dead"). 

Even though I problems with the second season, I enjoyed the show quite a bit. High quality popcorn that's over the top in all of the right ways. Well, most of the right ways. Only Jojo's is over the top in all of the right ways. Araki is a fucking genius.
>> ARTICLE
**Mahou Shoujo MadokaMagica - 12/12:** Finished this after I started it 2 weeks ago. Interesting show, not as dark as I expected to be but still pretty good - 8/10.

**Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. - 13/13:** Had to watch this before the sequel airs and I ended up binge watching it. It has a setting bit similar to your generic romcom show but this was way different and awesome in it's own way and I just love Hachiman - 9/10.

**Death Billiards:** Catching up with the Anime Mirai projects so had to watch this too. I'm still a bit confused on who went where but the idea still was interesting - 8/10.

**Plastic Nee-san - 12/12:** Wanted to watch this for quite some time and finally got to it. I was grinning for the majority of the series, damn that was crazy - 8/10.

**School Days - 12/12:** Seen this recommended all over the place and had to watch it. I kinda expected the ending since I got spoiled by the NouCome OVA's ending but still had a good laugh when it happened - 7/10.

**Daily Lives of High School Boys - 12/12:** One of the better comedies that I've seen and it has quite a number of references - 8/10.

**Serial Experiments Lain - 1/13:** Creepy and weird for a first episode. I don't know how this found it's way to my Plan to Watch list but it sure is damn interesting.

I had a pretty good laugh when that happened but felt a bit bad for the girls afterwards.

The main character is an idiot, but after the episode where like 8 girls show up at his house over the course of 20 minutes, i feel like all the girls are just as stupid.  
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Hikari tackled the issue the wrong way and just made her seem a lot more stupid. I still think that the way Kotonoha and Sekai got treated was pretty bad but Sekai shouldn't have trusted someone who was willing to cheat on his girlfriend with her.

I watched the entirety of Shiki this week and i have to say SHIKI is one of the best anime i have seen, I absolutely loved it!
>> ARTICLE
When did it hook you? I currently have it on-hold at episode 4, and I'm having a hard time finding the motivation to keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it hooked me around episode 7. That was the only part i didn't really care for in the series was how it started out slow, but it really picked up and past around episode 13-14 i couldn't stop watching.

Alright, thanks. I'll give it another shot.

This show is on my Plan To Watch. Was thinking about starting it tomorrow. Hope it'll be as nice as I expect it to be :D

I will always upvote anybody that sees Shiki as I do.

Just finished A certain Scientific Railgun, starting A certain Magical Index. Railgun was pretty good though I had to skip a lot of the SoL episodes in the middle of the season. This show was best when it was being serious and felt boring when it tried to head towards the SoL areas.

All I can say is Misaka better win. That may be due to my bias towards Tsunderes though. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt exactly the opposite about Railgun. The SoL was fun, but the actual plot was standard shounen fighting stuff that does nothing for me.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed Railgun a whole lot more when I looked at it as a SoL set in the "Index" world, rather than a side story to the faster paced A Certain Magical Index. That said I still hope Railgun S focuses more on the plot and expands on the world, because there's more than enough shows out there for my SoL fix.

PLANETES!!!!!!!! It was absolutely amazing 10/10 for me. Its like space future slice of life with no stupid highschool shit in sight. Its episodic feel was reminiscent of bebop and i can say i reallly enjoyed the whole thing

**Black Lagoon** (12/12)

The first thing that I noticed about this series was its striking resemblance to Cowboy Bebop. Dutch reminded me of Jet, Revy was like an extremely foul tempered Spike, Benny was the computer guy like Ed, and Rock definitely borrowed a few small things from Faye. Both casts also have similar jobs. Other than that, it really did stand on its own as an awesome show. It plays out like an American summer action movie, but it's also rather more intelligent and has more depth than those kinds of movies. For example, you have scenes where Revy will annihilate a small army singlehandedly without getting a scratch, but you also have scenes that develop her character well. My favorite scene in the whole show is when [spoiler](/s "Rock stands up to Revy like badass and almost getting killed in the process.") I can't remember another confrontation between two characters that got my adrenaline going like that since Breaking Bad. All in all, Black Lagoon was a hell of a good watch, and I look forward to watching The Second Barrage. 9 outta 10



**Nichijou** (26/26)


Finally finished it! Nichijou completely forced itself into my Top 5 favorite anime. It was such a fun show. I loved nearly every minute of it, and I didn't want it to end. Nonetheless, it wrapped up with a happy little bow, leaving me extremely satisfied with the ending. On top of that, it also mamaged to break me out of an artistic funk I've been in for a long time, and I'll always be grateful for that. 10 outta 10.
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou was extremely well made. And exactly my type of humor. Sadly not many people like the extreme absurdity and we will never get season 2. At least the manga is being translated again, going into chapters that weren't in the anime.

You should watch Azumanga Daioh.

**Kimi ni Todoke Season 1 episodes 1-25 (Complete):**

It took me roughly 72 hours to cover 22 episodes. That might sound to you like great, but last week I've watched 12 episodes of Sukitte Ii na yo. in one day, and 3 hours is how long it took me to get through Chihayafuru's 51 episodes, more or less.

Let's backtrack a bit. [Last week I wrote about Sukitte Ii na yo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2b91do/what_have_yall_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cj2yiz3), a show that's not the best, but which I found enjoyable, and liked. Kimi ni Todoke had been a bit more of a slog, and I keep finding myself alt-tabbing and checking twitter, while I *almost* marathon it.

Many aspects are shared between the two shows, and some aspects I've argued for as being solid in Sukitte were things I have a hard time enjoying in Kimi ni Todoke. This is a frustrating experience that's a chance for some intense analysis. Why do I like this one show, but not that other show, even as they are so similar? One could even look at two video games that seem almost identical, and yet one you enjoy, and the other you don't.

Often the answer is something minor and hard to quantify which shapes the experience, such as "controls" in a game, or in the case of these two shows, the most pervasive issue is the *pacing*. Kimi ni Todoke has 25 episodes. Cutting the OP and ED, they're roughly 1 minute shorter than standard episode length, and yet we've had a recap episode, and quite a few episodes open with a minute or so of showing how the last one ended.

This show should have *really* been a third shorter, if not a full half. When we resolved the "conflict" at the end of episode 15, I felt the series should've hit this mark at the 6th episode, or the 8th at most.

Before we delve into the meat of the problems *beyond* pacing, let's talk for a tiny bit about the production values, so we could get them out of the way - the actors are solid, Sawashiro Miyuki and Sanpei Yuuko as the best friends, and Hirano Aya as the rival in particular. I've never been a big fan of Noto Yamiko who portrays Sawako, our main character, and this show is no exception, but considering how little impact she has, it doesn't matter as much, but we'll get to it later, again.

I quipped last week that a single episode of Free! for instance has more animation in a single episode than Sukitte Ii na yo had in its full 14 episodes. Sukitte Ii na yo probably had in half a season as much animation as the all 25 episodes of Kimi ni Todoke's first season. It also doesn't have the lush and beautiful backgrounds, and instead gives us super-deformed manga-style (more like "Drawing with one's weak hand omake"-style, coupled with a lot of silly almost gags.

And that's where tie it all together. The show has a lot of still moments. Not just still shots where people don't move and talk to one another, but where people stand stock still and look at the other, or freeze and digest everything. That sort of thing is very much a standard thing in shoujo romances, but here they feel both more frequent, and longer, and actually *replace* any sort of real "happening".

I suspect I'd have enjoyed this show more if I'd read it as a manga. It helps that I'm a really fast reader. But when nothing happens, it takes you a few seconds to digest and you move on, even if you stare at each shot of people staring at one another. But here, it was hard to maintain my attention when I keep watching *nothing* unfold before my eyes. All these moments, even as I chuckle, showcase there's nothing underneath to provide adequate support. So I'd have enjoyed it more, powering through to actually see "stuff happen", but what about said stuff?

Sukitte Ii na yo and Kimi ni Todoke have a similar setup - a girl with no friends, slowly learning to form connections. But whereas Sukitte's tension comes from constructing connections, and how difficult it truly is to extend your reach, it feels as if Kimi ni Todoke contents itself with being trapped inside one's head. The "romantic interest" is as "non-character" as it gets, he's essentially a "McGuffin" one tries to obtain or a wise old man who gives us support now and then, rather than a character that feels "real". We mostly see the girls talking about their feelings, talking about talking, and feeling about feeling, rather than actually going out there into the world, to change things, and be changed. Unlike Sukitte ii na yo where the MC more or less fit these clauses as well though, there's no one else who's pushing for change here, no happening that force people to reflect and change.

These are the same issues all shoujo deal with, but it feels the show is more in love with the concepts, more in love with the concept of love, than actually being willing to tackle it, than actually being willing to force the characters to tackle with other characters. Yes, Sawako doesn't know how things work out, but even as the series is nearing its end, the level of discourse she engages on feels the sort you'd expect from a 6 years old child discussing "adult relationships" than someone who truly went through changes and is trying to integrate into society themselves. "Sophomoric" would be high-praise for what we're getting here. Yes, we can chuckle at Sawako's misunderstandings, but that level of "hee hee" does not carry a romantic series that's 25 episodes long.

This show did have two bits that rose above the mediocrity of everything else. Kurumi, the rival, and Chizuru's crush. Kurumi's bit was a bit too long and drawn out, and much of it was carried out by seeing characters cry, and Aya Hirano's voice transmitting the level of emotions, but there was still actual conflict here, one that wasn't magically resolved. Understanding that deepened the conflict, respect that fueled a rivalry. The lines uttered here were terrible, such as "I always worked hard to make sure he didn't find a girlfriend!" but I actually bought them.

Chizuru's mini-arc was short, and again fueled by tears. But it felt like a solid piece of drama. You know what it reminds me of, when one's story is more of a vehicle to tell the sob-stories of side-characters that are the *truly* interesting ones? Fruits Basket. But there we've had a lot such stories, and we kept moving from one to the next, with considerably less time spent on "nothingness". Also, I've only read the manga, so no idea how the series (which is half anime-original anyway) did.

Kimi ni Todoke isn't bad, but it's dull, and I find my attention wandering. I can't really give it more than 5.6/10 in good conscience, and even that is due to Chizuru's arc. The last few episodes were all sort of sweet nothingness, but still felt overly drawn out.

P.S. They keep writing "If I was" and it's driving me bonkers. Subjunctive, what is?

---

I've also watched a couple of episodes of **Ergo Proxy** (10-11), but a migraine stopped me. It was definitely interesting, and trippy, and though provoking, and more than a tad pretentious. Episode 11... I could've probably written thousands of words about it, but I stopped myself.
>> ARTICLE
I liked Kimi ni Todoke even though I normally can't stand shoujo. The main guy wasn't a giant unlikable twat like in most shoujos, and the main girl wasn't a standard shoujo heroine (aka wannabe strong independent woman who don't need no man, until of course she's in trouble, then only the main guy can help her) but instead she's one big blob of adorableness.

###**Puella Magi Madoka Magica**

**Episode 8 - 12**

So first I'm going to just open up with a transcription of my tweets during watching Madoka, that sort of show the progression of my impression of this animation production.  

- ["I'm beginning to appreciate Madoka more, as she seems to be getting more and more in focus #meguca"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtCWZT-CYAAVjnu.png) 

- "I'm not sure I understand Kyouko yet, which means any complaints about her may be undermined by lack of knowledge. [...] Like, I still haven't wrapped my head around how she can be concerned for Madoka losing her best friend when there is implied she's let [...] dozens of people die on purpose, just to produce Grief Seeds and fuel her power. Was that all a front? Or did Sayaka actually make her more [...] empathetic towards people? [...] It doesn't help that I still contend that her backstory was introduced too quickly and lacked impact because it was "told""

- ["Greatest comedy ever #meguca"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtLl_O9IQAAxgw9.png)

- "Oh, so NOW all the Sayaka x Kyouko shipping makes sense #meguca"

- ["Oh man the Kalafina ED is playing in the background. Shits bout go down sonnn #meguca"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtRplnjIIAACwWP.png)

- "This "threads of fate" kinda ruins that idea I had of Madoka as "an ordinary man doing extraordinary things, that an NPC can be a hero too""

- "Ok, goddamit Madoka, why do you have to make me like you so much now after I trashed you so much before."

- *Episode 12 happened...*

- "Holy shit Madoka. I'm just grinning from ear to ear - that was a great ending."

- "So much bookending. All that optimism. Such tight writing. THAT DIRECTION. Goddamn."

- "I still have some misgivings about the early sections and with Kyouko, but that was a tremendously well directed second half."

- ["Given what I know about Rebellion, these wings seem ominous... #meguca_12"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtSO0wtIgAAxDNj.png)

In hindsight, I realize Madoka is a very brave girl, and she's made me think about what I'd be willing to do to protect those I've loved, even those I've never met. Would I be able to become an aegis of hope? A bulwark against the shadows of the world, an eternal ray of light to pierce the darkness of life? I don't know; I doubt I'll ever know. 

Me saying that Madoka was a brave girl seems odd, eh? I mean, in my other posts, I've said that I thought she was a boring, passive character and that she felt more like side-character material. But /u/q_3 and /u/ClearandSweet said some things last week that I don't think understood until now. Specifically, said that /u/q_3 Madoka was a very *reactive* character, not passive, and while I wasn't sure whether I agreed with that sentiment before, I think I agree with it now. Furthermore, both /u/q_3 and /u/ClearandSweet said that the narrative was sort of "constraining" Madoka from acting on her own, and I think it was this fact that was partly what was bothering me about Madoka.

When Madoka finally took in *all* the facts, after her mother asked her if she was being deceived and she was finally sure of herself, that Madoka finally made a choice. And it was that choice that made the ending for me. In a show where every character's hand was forced by the vagaries of fate, to make a sacrifice they weren't always ready for, Madoka was empowered to make a great choice in their place. And she chose to sacrifice herself - not others; she was given the option of backing out. But she chose it, willingly, after every option was presented to her, when all the knowledge that was withheld, was exposed. 

And I think that's a really powerful idea - of choosing to willingly sacrifice oneself for the benefit of others. A lot of anime depict self-sacrifice, but few of them felt as weighty, as magnificent, or as meaningful as Madoka's sacrifice (the grand scale of it helps). For me, I think that has partly to do with my ideas of the sacrifices for utilitarianism. It's often quoted that "To make an omelet, you have to crack a few eggs." Plenty of people have spilled words about how Madoka demonstrates utilitarianism through Kyubey and the Incubators, so I'm not going to bother proving it. But something I've always believed is that the sacrifices that need to be made for the betterment of humanity, needs to be made by those willing to take that burden, after all information is given to them. After Sayaka, Kyouko, Mami and the countless other mahou shoujo before them sacrificed themselves, I think Madoka's is the first "just" sacrifice the show made.

Gripes and asides:

- I still stand by the belief that Kyouko's backstory was rushed and didn't have as much impact on the audience as it should've, in order to make her change in behavior feel more natural.

- I wanted some more backstory from Homura. I could infer, based on how it goes in anime, that girls like past!Homura didn't have a lot of friends, which is why she was so attached to Madoka. I would've preferred some elaboration on her past, though. It obviously wasn't necessary to the flow of the show, but I still would've liked it.

- Why was Kyubey surprised that Homura had time powers in the alternate timelines? His race gave her time powers, shouldn't they be able to monitor who can time travel?

- I thought it was cool how the OP was revealed to be about Homura. Furthermore, there was one line in the OP, ["the beautiful blue sky will always be waiting for me"](http://i.imgur.com/YdKCSyJ.png) that gained a lot of relevance once Madoka defeated Walpurgisnacht and dispelled the miasma - 

 [Homura finally found the blue sky that'd always been waiting for her.](http://i.imgur.com/gkYC1QG.png)


###**Penguindrum**

**Episode 14-15**

I decided to re-open the *Penguindrum* casebook. As one who's watched the show can guess, taking a 4 month hiatus from this show, and then jumping right where you left off, can leave one slightly...confused. Thankfully, because of [the great *Penguindrum* posts that were on Altair & Vega](http://altairandvega.net/?s=Penguindrum+14) that some of you kind gentlemen linked me to many moons ago (and which I was surprised to find our own dear /u/supicasupica apparently contributed to!), I managed to get back up to speed (roughly; a little wiki-ing here and there but no big deal.)

I largely skipped notes on episode 14 while I tried to re-orient myself, but I got some stuff down for episode 15. 

Penguindrum 15:

I dunno how to say this, but...this episode of Penguindrum is making me kind of uncomfortable. I mean, there's a lot of cruelty in the world of Penguindrum, but this is getting just...I dunno. I don't think it's using sexual assault/rape/abuse lightly, and it's certainly consistent in it's depiction of the way abuse cycles through families. So, it is interesting, in a twisted sort of way. I'm also finding it hard to see any personal truth in Sanetoshi's statements about family, but I can thank a supportive family for that; they're the kind of family I'd choose to be a part of. 

MAYBE PENGUINDRUM IS ACTUALY AN ALLEGORY FOR COMPETING GROUPS FIGHTING OVER LIMITED RESOURCES, REFLECTING HUMANITIES IMPENDING RESOURCE WARS. No, but actually, with the revelation that the diary can change fate (I'm assuming it actually *can* do that, or at least the characters genuinely believe it can), it means that there a supple of "hope" for the characters...but it is a finite resource. Few of the characters seem to care that the other actors in this play are also in shitty situations, and that they ALL need the diary, all to save someone precious...or save themselves. There is no sympathy, there is only a resource and those who need it. Those with information on the other have power, those who are armed have power. Deception is key, espionage is vital. 

It truly is a war. And what's so lovely about the role of Momoka is that, when she had the diary, she gave it away freely. She shared. She provided foreign aid relief and sent her fleets of hospital ships to help the wounded. 
And she did it because she had so much - she was "rich". She had the budget for it. ~~She's like the United States, except not a dick~~

Well it is said that magic girls defy all currently known laws and that they contradict reality as understood hence their ability to resist entropy. Given this knowledge and the ability to make a wish that defies reality, it is very likely that they can't monitor this stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Huh. That actually makes a certain kind of sense. I guess, then, you could even extract some statements about meddling with what you don't know (if we take your statement to be true, the Incubators are far less in control of the situation than we were led to believe.)

I think for Kyuubei being surprised about Homura's magic is because she wasn't created by the Incubators and had come from outside the timeline, appearing before her original transformation date meaning they had no information on her. 

The Incubators probably didn't need the ability to detect what the powers of the girls would be so didn't develop a way of reading anything but the amount of energy the girls would provide.

Ended up being surprisingly busy this week, so I only sat down to watch anything once. Ended up pussying out on H2O once again (I know I'll have to watch it eventually, just not this week), so instead I decided to watch something else.

**Samurai Flamenco (2-7):**

Okay, how about I divide this into two small, separate sections, both of them giving a very brief summary of my impression of the show at the time I had watched the episodes in question:

**Episodes 2-6, plus all of 7 except the last few minutes**

This show is honestly kind of interesting, taking an overall more "realistic" approach to the whole situations. No superpowers, no supervillains, just a model who is chasing his childhood dream of being a superhero, and succeeding quite well all things considered. The characters are all at least a little bit interesting or funny, and I can't honestly say that I truly dislike any of them. Maybe not feel too fondly for, sure, but none are bad enough that I can't find something I like about them.

**Last few minutes of episode 7**

...I'll just quote my Skype log to a friend for this.

[Skype](/s "What the fuck just happened")

[](/s "What the fuck just happened")

[](/s "WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?!")

[](/s "That's it, fuck this shit, I'm going to bed")

[](/s "I've been sufficiently Madoka'd for the night")

Quite literally, I have no idea how to take those last few minutes. It was so sudden I don't even know what to say, really. Maybe when I watch more later I'll know how I really feel, but for now I'm just gonna sit here and stare into the wall some more.
>> ARTICLE
I've actually been clean of anime for a couple of months until recently, where I've found myself binge-watching quite a few number of anime this past week.
 
**Neon Genesis Evangelion** *(26/26)* - I have to start by saying that this anime has one of the best openers ever, period - simply because of the awesome song. This anime had been on my list forever and I had always been skeptical about it. I have to say that I felt that this anime was ahead of its time. If I had to describe it I'd have to say that it was a psychological anime hidden in mecha. It's deeply polarizing with a great range of characters. I can't honestly say I understood everything the anime was trying to convey but for now, I got the gist of it. Everything is presented in a brutal and honest manner. The ending may seem a bit farfetched and odd at first but I think if you read between the lines hard enough you'll find the finer points to it. I took on the liberty of watching the sequel film as well, "The End of Evangelion" and it's definitely a must-watch follow-up as it attempts to wrap up everything. Personally this one hit home for me and I was conflicted as whether to give it a 10 or not. I am definitely going to re-watch it when I have the time as well and I have yet to watch the Rebuild movies but I will in the near future. **9/10**

**Psycho-Pass** *(22/22)* - I remember catching a glimpse of this anime's existence last year but never took any real interest. Boy was that a mistake!  It's not your typical action/sci-fi/police anime. It was very thought-provoking and had some compelling themes. It's very plot driven and has great character development for the main characters. In my books this is a very solid anime and not to be missed, looking forward to the next season. **9/10**

**KILL la KILL** *(24/24)* - I actually watched just the first half last year when it was airing but have just gone back to finish the latter half of it. To be honest I struggled to continue watching it several times because it just wasn't as entertaining as I thought it'd be. However, I promised to write this one off my list as I tend to finish all anime that I start and I'm glad I did. I found that all I needed to do was just not take it too seriously and just enjoy the ride, though the last half did seem to have a lot more plot to it (albeit a bit rushed). A lot of fanservice was what I didn't like too much  but I loved Mako :). I'd say this one ran it home in the end and it was pretty well done. **8/10**

**Danganronpa - The Animation** *(13/13)* - This ones been on my list for awhile as well since it started airing, it peaked my interest at first when my favourite subbing group (UTW - RIP 2014) picked it up. I think it had A LOT of potential, this reminded me a lot of Phoenix Wright in a sense that there was trials and evidence/clues. However, the main complaint was that it was only 13 episodes long and should have been 24-26 as there was little to no room for any detail or character development (or of anything). It tried to wrap it up quickly also (as do most short anime do) and gave us an out-of-the-box sort of resolution to everything. I appreciate it for what it was and what it could have been, slightly higher rating perhaps than it should be. **7/10**

**Hitsugi no Chaika** *(12/12)* - Honestly, I only knew this existed through Tumblr gifs of the girl, Chaika. I went into it without too much expectations and what I got was a fairly enjoyable but mediocre anime. That being said, I'm a slight fan when it comes to action/adventure/fantasy. It had a pretty solid main plot with some limited characters and some mystery to it by the end. There was a dose of originality to it with thrown in comedy here and there, I think this one was slightly overlooked by many and deserves more eyes, expecting more from the next season. **8/10**

**Another** *(12/12)* - I knew about this anime for awhile now and finally just got around to it. I think my expectations kind of ruined it for me. I usually don't have much expectations but when it comes to horror/mystery I genuinely want to be scared/intrigued -  I think it did the intrigue thing well for a good part of it. It was a little creepy at first and very mysterious. However, it doesn't give us an definitive answer as to why things happen the way they did and just tells us that they do. Although I did find it enjoyable as the plot kept me interested enough to watch in one sitting and kept me guessing till the very end. I think it's worth a watch if you are a fan of the genre, as it should keep you guessing all the way through. **8/10**

**No Game No Life** *(12/12)* - Not sure if I'm allowed to say anything about this one but it already finished airing so I'll keep it short. I recently checked this one out due to its popularity, I am definitely a fan of the theme in this anime but there was a little too much ecchi for my liking. The fanservice was basically shoved into your face whether you liked it or not. However, I was able to look past it and did find myself a rather enjoyable anime, just don't take it too seriously. **8/10**

**Devil May Cry** *(12/12)* - Checked this one out for giggles. Featuring our one and only Dante, being a fan of DMC this one was on my list for a long time as well. At its core, it's a very basic anime with not much development and no plot. There was one episode that caught my eye with Dante's past late into the series but other than that the rest is just about pizzas and strawberry sundaes! You'll enjoy it if you like Dante and a kind of slice of life type series. **7/10**

P.S. I hope you enjoyed reading my mini-reviews and be sure to recommend me any anime if you have time <3

> Hitsugi no Chaika 

2nd season this fall (or rather, the 2nd half of the show)

I also recommend checking out it's big sister **Scrapped Princess**. Same author, director, and studio combo, as well as a similar starting premise (and a similar naming scheme, all the characters are named after guns). Goes in a wildly different direction though and I think its the better, more ambitious work of the 2 even if there is a bit less action.

I don't know if you've seen it but since you liked Evangelion & Psycho-Pass so much, I think you should give **Texhnolyze** a look. Very dark dystopia with heavy themes. It's a slow show, but the final few episodes remind me of EoE and the Twilight Zone with how everything just went straight to shit. I think it's worth checking out.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely loved Scrapped Princess.  I'm not a big anime watcher and I occasionally watch a series here and there every year or two, but I just adore Scrapped Princess.  It was one of the earlier anime that I watched and I loved the brother and sister pair that protected her.  I was really disappointed when I looked up the reviews/reception to the anime a couple of years after watching it and seeing how many people disliked it.  I thought it was great and never found other people who enjoyed it as much as I did.

I am a sucker for the fantasy/action anime though, so I'm not a "true" anime watcher.  I feel weird reading some of these threads because a lot of the anime people hate I seem to enjoy.

Hey, I adore it too! Easily my favorite action fantasy show, while there are certainly 'better' shows, this one is one of my favorites. It also created my favorite setting in all of anime, and the characters were all so lovable.

Thank you kindly for the recommendations! They tick all of my genre boxes, will be checking them out in the future :)

**Hamatora** (the first season). It wasn't bad but also nothing special.

**Sengoko Basara (S1)**. This was awful. The anime failed to get me interested on any character or in the plot which was all over the place. Not even glorious Wakamoto saved it.

**Kidou Senkan Nadesico**. This anime. This anime had all the plot elements to be amazing. But they decided to go with comedy and parody instead. Just awful to watch. ;_;

I also watched **WIXOSS** and **Ping Pong the Animation** but apparently those don't count even though they already ended ;_;

> apparently those don't count even though they already ended ;_;

/u/cptn_garlock probably just needs to update that text with current season examples.
>> ARTICLE
You would be right. Confession: I actually use that text as a covert means to push my ideas of what was good this and last season; consider it my personal recommendations. This is the first one where I had two equally phenomenal shows from the previous season, so expect *Ping Pong the Animation* and *Mushishi Zoku Shou* to be there. Unfortunately, no new show has gotten even remotely good as either of those yet, so I don't know what to mark down for current season.
>> ARTICLE
**Gintama** (37-42/201) - A very solid set of episodes and the first three-part story featuring Kagura and her father, which improved my opinion of her by quite a bit. My new favorite episode was right before that though, with Katsura and Ikumatsu. As long as the show keeps up with the quality it finally reached here, I'll be happy watching it for quite some time. Longer post in the [Gintama discussion thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2bs66f/spoilers_ranime_weekly_gintama_episodes_3742/cj8dig4).

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (9/64) - Winry! I like Winry. And Maes Hughes too. Dont like the cartoonish style as much though. Judging by the description of the tenth episode on Netflix I'm suspecting one of my least favorite episodes is next.

**Fate/Zero** (1/24) - I finally finished the Fate/Stay Night visual novel last night (close to 60 hours) and immediately dove into this. I realized right away that I made the correct decision to take my time and read the VN first as many people suggested.

While the outcome of the war detailed in Fate/Zero is a foregone conclusion as it's a prequel, the first ten minutes of the first episode here spoil several massive character/plot points from F/SN. [F/SN](/s "Seeing the bugs swarming over the young Sakura was rough.") Its hard to tell because Im already familiar with the setting, but it seems like they do a good job of setting up the rules of the Holy Grail War and its major players early on even for newcomers to the series. Saber asking at the end if Kiritsugu is her master in the same tone as she later does with Shirou made me happy.

~~I'm already really looking forward to the new Fate/Stay Night adaptation in the fall regardless of what route they take.~~ Turns out that the series will be [Unlimited Blade Works](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2buja3/fatestay_night_unlimited_blade_works_confirmed/) and [Heaven's Feel](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2bum5b/rejoice_heavens_feel_also_confirmed_hype_hype_hype/) is getting a movie. I'm on board with both.
>> ARTICLE
Yay I'm so happy you experienced Fate the correct way :P. I actually really liked the first episode of Fate/Zero from a VN readers perspective. I think it's funny that all the newcomers hate it.
>> ARTICLE
It felt right at home for me, but after thinking about it I can definitely see where someone new to the series would be put off by it.
>> ARTICLE
So what did you think of the F/SN visual novel?
>> ARTICLE
Didn't plan on talking about it much since it's not an anime series and I don't frequent /r/visualnovels enough to comment there, but here goes:

I was biased toward Saber from the moment she spoke since her voice actress was also behind a couple of my favorite characters in other series, but even so I really liked the character and the decision to become a heroic servant that she had to struggle with throughout the story. [F/SN Fate](/s "Arturia, rather than Arthur, was a nice twist. I was having difficulty thinking of heroic female knights aside from Joan of Arc who remained my top suspect for her identity before the Excalibur reveal.")

Shirou was dense as to be expected with most main characters, but improved throughout the story. [F/SN Unlimited Blade Works](/s "I started to suspect that he was Archer even early on in the UBW route but dismissed it because I didn't think both forms of him would be allowed to exist simultaneously. Guess the Grail doesn't care. It lead to several awesome battles though and hinted at his potential fate if he made a few incorrect choices.")

Rin was just kinda awesome overall. Not a lot to say about her though. Yay tsunderes? [F/SN Unlimited Blade Works](/s "I kinda wish the good and true endings to her route were swapped though, I'd much rather see Saber hang around with both of them.")

Sakura... oh, Sakura. I was *not* prepared for that route. [F/SN Heaven's Feel](/s "In retrospect I felt terrible for neglecting her in the other routes. I don't want to know what happened to her in those. I knew Shinji was physically abusing her but didn't see it going that far, and the majority of the route just made me feel uncomfortable as I kept digging up more horrible secrets from her past. Everything just goes to hell in this route.")

[F/SN all routes](/s "Similarly with Kotomine Kirei, I found him suspicious but didn't expect Gilgamesh to still be hanging around. I spent the remaining arcs hating both of their guts and of course they're the big bads for all three of them aside from the Grail itself. I don't think the idea of a contaminated Holy Grail is anything new, but I like their take on it. Illya was an interesting reversal who I liked progressively more as I advanced through the different routes.")

That's about all I can think of right now without doing a full write-up. Overall I really enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to digging into the related works. Weird side note: for some reason I thought it was a mecha series and thus quickly dismissed it up until about a month ago. I have no idea where that impression came from.
>> ARTICLE
> it seems like they do a good job of setting up the rules of the Holy Grail War and its major players early on even for newcomers to the series

As someone who has little interest in the series but was persuaded to try the first episode, I'd say not. Using a double length first episode for exposition was utterly tedious and totally unengaging, so I didn't remember any of it and couldn't be bothered to suffer through another episode.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. I actually started writing that before I finished the episode and it did end up dragging on more than I expected. I like figuring out the mechanics of new settings so it fits right in a happy spot in my mind, but I can see where other people would not find it interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching Jojo part 1 since Stardust Crusaders got me interested in the whole Jojo franchise.

Out of all the Joestar men, Joseph has been the most entertaining. I'm up to episode 9 and Jonathan has been alright so far. He's not dull but he's not nearly as entertaining as Joseph.

Phantom Blood hasn't been as fun as Stardust Crusaders but seeing the rise of Dio is pretty interesting.

My Conquest is the Sea of Stars comes before everything. Then Overture to a New War replaces episodes 1 and 2 of the OVA. Still watch the episodes though, the show has character's names on the bottom of the screen sometimes while the movie doesn't.

Overall it's been an outstanding week for me, I've started/finished/continued watching some stuff that have been 9/10s, and I've started another that's pretty good but I think it has potential.

Finished **Nichijou** and I'm sad that it's over, I'm craving more. It was a very funny series and has become one of my favourites, I loved the animation and all of the characters personalities/quirks/mannerisms. My only complaint is that it was hit or miss at times, still 8-9/10. 

Watched episodes 6-14 of **Cowboy Bebop**, and so far it's been everything I've expected it to be and more. Normally I can't deal with episodic shows and I drop them fairly early, but Bebop has been different. I'm watching the dub and it's easily one of the best I've ever seen. Cool characters, interesting stories, great music, and great atmosphere. I have no major gripes with the show, it's at least a 9/10 so far.

Episodes 1-4 of **The Tatami Galaxy**. It's been... Interesting. I'm not sure I know what's going on and it can be hard to keep up with the subtitles and ridiculous pace, but it's pretty good. I'm interested in seeing where the show is going, the "kinda repeating stuff but kinda not" is cool and I think it has some potential. It's pretty funny at times and I love the visuals, 7-8/10.

Episodes 1-8 of **Katanagatari**. It's been a great experience so far, and I really don't have many issues with it. I love the dialogue, characters, art, and plot. I wasn't a big fan of the early episodes but it's quickly grown on me, 9/10.
>> ARTICLE
First time doing this, but I'd say I watched a lot this week.

**D-Frag!** (12/12): This show is hilarious and I just hated how it ended so fast. **8/10** 

**Elfen Lied Special** (1/1): I didn't even know they had this. Watched it out of curiosity. **5/10**

**Kokoro Connect** (4/13): I put this show on hold. It felt kind of boring, but I hear so much about it. Might pick it back up soon.

**Black Rock Shooter** (1/1): This was an alright OVA, but it felt like nothing was actually going on. Plus, the transitions got really annoying. **6/10**

**The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya** (12/28): This was a show that I've been planning to watch for a pretty long time now and finally got to it. I'm liking everything right now and have been watching it in chronological order. I'm on the endless eight arc and I plan on skipping at least half of it.
>> ARTICLE
You've got to be one of the only other people I've seen online who is not liking Kokoro Connect.


I don't want to be a person who puts someone off of a show that they're only four episodes into, but thinking about it, I would have wanted someone to tell me to stop if I were in your position. I really did not like it at all. The first arc is by far the best, and the second arc is definitely the worst. If you successfully make it through the second arc and like it, you might be O.K, but really do not expect much.
>> ARTICLE
I blasted through both seasons of **Chihayafuru** in 3 days. It was an amazing ride - and its been a while since I've loved each and every character in a show this much. Watching Taichi grow was undoubtedly the best part of the show, and it really is remarkable seeing how much he changed from the little bully that he was. And the karuta - wow! It was really great to see something so obscure portrayed in such a compelling fashion, and it really caused me to want to know more about the game. Liked how they slowly explored the depth of the game throughout its run - by the end of the show it seemed completely different from how it looked at first.

Pity that it isn't finished - this is a show I probably can blast through even if it had more than a hundred episodes. I finished the remaining manga chapters as well and it looks like it manages to get even better, and I really hope that they adapt it once we get enough material.

**10/10** for sure, definitely within my top 3, might even be my favorite. Have to think a little more about that!
>> ARTICLE
**Psycho Pass (9/22)**

This show is pretty good. The story is taking its time but it's still interesting. It doesn't hold my interest enough to compelled me to marathon it or anything but I'm slowly working my way through. The characters seem interesting enough, but a lot of the supporting cast is kind of underdeveloped (hopefully that will change). Above all, the soundtrack is definitely the stand out feature for this anime. Absolutely love it. In relation to Gen Urobuchi's other works, I'd rank this above Madoka Magica, but below Fate/Zero
>> ARTICLE
I just finished this a few days ago, I felt the exact same way. Somewhere around episode 15 I think is where it hooks you. Gets much more intense. Have fun!
>> ARTICLE
Couple from me, but this is like the last week and a half's watching 

[Yosuga no Sora: In Solitude, Where We Are Least Alone](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8861/Yosuga_no_Sora:_In_Solitude_Where_We_Are_Least_Alone.)

I'm not sure why I watched this. I have a little sister, so I'm *really* uncomfortable with incest based story lines. Neither am I a massive fan of ecchi. Still, I was genuinely surprised at how well the show came together. Some of the character arcs were genuinely emotional, and the soundtrack is lovely. My main problem with it came to the sex scenes, which either fell into being emotional high points, or cheesy bolted on fap material. Still not a bad watch overall. 

**7/10**

[Sora No Woto/The Sound of the Skies](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To)

This show took me over 9 months to finish. I got pissed off with it about half a year ago and put it on hold. Sora No Woto does such a great job of creating an atmosphere, I was in tears for some of the early episodes. I still can't hear Amazing Grace without welling up. But then that plot had to come. I mean it literally phoned in, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jji78uEW14) (if you imagine Steven Seagal is on the phone in this scene). The plot takes so much away from the atmosphere and feeling that the show built up. Still last 2 episodes are amazing, and I was crying at the end. 

**I did a full writeup [here](https://animeopinion.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/sora-no-woto-an-anime-review/)**

**8/10**

[Kuragehime / Princess Jellyfish](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8129/Kuragehime)

If you follow me on twitter (you poor soul) you might have seen me tweeting an awful lot about this. Devoured it in about a day and a half, with episodes on at work and everything. Kuragehime is like your typical NEET story, but with Fujiyoshi's, crossdressers and Kana Hanazawa. Absolutely adored it for pretty much the entire thing. And then it just ended. 

Like with no closure. 

I've just started the manga.

**Did a writeup for this too. it's over [here](https://animeopinion.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/kuragehime-an-anime-review/)**
>> ARTICLE
>Kuragehime

Oh damn, someone else who has actually seen this show? I didn't think this would happen the same week I finished it.

I really liked the fact that Kuragehime was sufficiently different from other shows in the same genre to be fresh. Sure, it uses many of the same tropes as other romantic comedies/slice of life shows, but the gender reversals made it pretty fun. Definitely worth it in my book.

But yeah, the ending was kinda disappointing. I guess that's what happens with manga adaptations sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
[Blue Comet SPT Layzner](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3079/Aoki_Ryuusei_SPT_Layzner)  
What baffles me about this show is the quality. The mecha are drawn and shaded at the high quality of 1980s OVAs, but this is a TV show. I wonder if they had a surplus of money and dropped it into this show.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Sakura Trick. That shit is the best.
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt** this week. What was up with that ending? Is it going to get a season 2? The show was pretty funny regardless. Hoping to start Gunbuster this week, can't find anywhere to watch it though.

If they ever planned a second season there's almost no chance it will ever happen now. The people behind it are no longer with the same studio.

I finished watching [SAO](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) from episode 10 and TBH it may be overly hyped, but by the lords do the Anti-fans of this show take the biscuit for exaggeration. Kirito himself was, while hardly a 3D character was not as overpowered as I expected and it was the constant deus ex machina solutions that spoiled the tension for me.

The series itself was entertaining, if flawed. I got kicks out of the little combat there was, wanted KiritoxAsusna to develop properly. It fails to use it's settings or characters to even close to their potential, villains that were somehow kind of flatter than everything else, second arc made me roll my eyes a lot [SAO] (/s "Netorare bird cage, tentacled employees, and Recon's very existence") and the unnecessa-harem Mk-1. 

All in all, was worth the time to watch it even if it was to just see what was so damn hypeable about it.
>> ARTICLE
Finished watching Madoka today and I am definitely a fan now. I really liked the art style and the animation of the witch's labyrinths. By the end of the series I really came to care for the characters and it was damn sad what some of them had gone or been through. At first I thought Madoka was a passive and self pitying character until I realized she was actually the opposite because she would think things through before making a choice instead of being impulsive. I see now why some argue this show was a deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Anyway the music was great, Homura was my favorite character, and I'm looking forward to the movies even though 1 and 2 are recaps.

Also I want to strangle Kyubey.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the recap movies after I finished the series and it was really cool to see everything after you know how it's going to end. You can definitely understand the reaction of the characters more than you might have in your first watch.
>> ARTICLE
Prompted by the insane sales of season two, I watched **Love Live! School Idol Project**.

---
**Love Live!** - 6.5/10
___

Fun. That's all I really have to say about this. It was an entertaining show with likeable characters, solid comedy, and good music (if you like these kinds of songs).

My only complaint is I felt it tried too hard with the drama in the second half, and [](/s "I would've preferred if Kotori left in the end. They built up her character arc, they could've at least finished it.")

Anyway, fun show.

**WataMote (1-12)** - This was suppose to be a comedy and there are a lot of jokes but usually at the expense of Tomoko.

Watched 2 movies and started back up on a series again.

**Paprika** (movie)  
Visually overwhelming, cool and interesting story, but some of the characters weren't as engaging as they maybe should have been. Good soundtrack and I'm looking forward to watch the other Satoshi Kon movies. (Rating: 8,5/10. 9 on MAL)

**The Girl Who Leapt Through Time** (movie)  
Awesome from start to end. I highly enjoyed this one because of the characters, story, pacing and the soundtrack. Makoto is such a good MC and I really could connect to her (shed a tear or two in the end). I thought that nothing could beat Mononoke Hime for me, but damn, this is like really really REALLY close to it. (Rating: 9,5/10)

**Baccano!** (ep3-4)  
Things are starting to get interesting, but still nothing much to say about it. Kind of a lot of characters I have to remember but most remarkable are Isaac and Miria.
>> ARTICLE
With Baccano!, the fact that most of the characters appear in the opening credits with their names helps you to remember who they each are. Also, the fact that the OP is just amazing means you always watch it!
>> ARTICLE
Isac and mira are defiantly memorable. 
>> ARTICLE
**A Certain Magical Index 2 (16/24)** Although Touma is a typical shounen protagonist he's still pretty entertaining to watch. I've always loved the idea of science and religion coexisting so one of my major gripes is how only two episodes so far have been focused on science and the rest on religion. Even thought the Remnant arc was short it's been my favorite arc. Hopefully there'll be more of a focus on science in the remaining episodes. On a side note I can't stand Index and I wish they gave her screentime to [Biribiri](http://i.imgur.com/MyjoXon.jpg) instead. Fukou da!

if A Certain Magical Index ever gets a third season you can bet there will be a lot more Science and Magic/Religion stuff going on.

I finished watching A Certain Magical Index 1 last week and just finished A Certain Scientific Railgun, have to say I liked Railgun a lot more, even though they both weren't near the best animes I've watched, I enjoyed them quite a bit. Going into A Certain Magical Index 2 pretty soon!

[x-post from trueanime](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/2bps91/your_week_in_anime_week_93/cj7zmli)

Welp it's that time of the week again. This past week I've been on vacation so I've been able to power through a lot of stuff. First lets focus on the series. 

**Nisemonogatari (11/11)**

I've gone over this show many times now and I don't need to elaborate any further. In comparison to Bakemonogatari, this show had way to much fan service and way to little character development. Not only does the show barely give much to the characters of previous arcs, it barely gives anything to the *characters the arc is focusing on!* Of the 7 episode Karen arc, I think maybe the last 3 were actually about Karen and her problems, and in Tsukihi's arc, there was about 1 conversation regarding actual development to her as a character. This show was a serious step down in quality from its wonderful prequel. How was it followed up? Well...

**Nekomonogatari Kuro (4/4)**

Wow what a refreshing change. In contrast to Nise, Nekomongatari Kuro had *loads* of character development for both Hanekawa and her relationship with Ararararararagi. Despite the obvious constant fan service of black lingerie, it wasn't nearly as obnoxious Nise. Yes you heard me, having a character perpetually in her underwear was still less fan service than Nise, that's how bad Nise's fanservice was. Overall it was a great step back into the ring for the Monogatari series, and next week I start the most acclaimed part of Monogatari, Monogatari Second Season.

-----------------

Now for something completely differnet, movies. It shames me to say it, but I am terrible on Anime Movies. My history with them consists of some series movies (Haruhi, Eden of the East, Pokemon), and Mamoru Hosoda. Yes, that's it. No Makoto Shinkai, no Akira, no Redline, hell I can not honestly remember seeing a single **Ghibli** movie all the way through. I've seen a part of Nausica, but not much else. So when the /r/anime movie bracket started up, I decided to get my butt in gear and watch some movies over my vacation. I'm not done yet but here is what I've gotten through

**Spirited Away**

Current popular favorite to win the bracket, and a lot of people's favorite ghibli movie, this was the first up to bat, and my first full experience with ghibli. And...uh...Wooooooooooowwwwww... Like holy shit that was pretty fucking great. Tight story, great characters, Sen/Chihiro was adorable and a just overall great lead, and the movie was beautiful and wonderfully orchestrated. I get now why people love this movie so much, because it's amazing. The sense of wonder I got from watching this is fantastic, just a fantastically built world and did a great job inspiring excitement just to see it. I can't help but feel a little sad I never watched this as a child, I would have adored it.

**Howl's Moving Castle**

Next up on the plate we have Howl's Moving Castle, another Ghibli classic that I remember seeing many a trailer as a child but never got around to seeing the actual dang movie. Well similar to Spirited Away, another wooooooow was to be had, with some more fantastic art and music, and more wonderfully interesting and unique characters. Howl's castle was mesmerizing to watch, and the characters play off each other beautifully. If I had to nitpick, which I do, there are 2 things I had a problem with. 1 was Sophie, Sophie was a weak character. She never seemed to change or learn anything during the film, and she seemed to let things happen rather easily. She never had the same sort of personality or growth that a character like Chihiro did, and was kind of bland. The other problem was much smaller, and just was that the plot points with the war and the prince were poorly introduced. I don't know if I missed something, but I had to look up the Wikipedia page to understand what actually happened. Maybe that was just me though... Either way fantastic watch, and Hayao Miyazaki is great.

**5 Centimeters per Second**

After getting through two Hayao Miyazaki films (I plan to complete at least 3 by watching Princess Mononoke soon.), I figured it was time for a change of pace, so I started on Makoto Shinkai. And what better place to start than the classic 5 ~~Wallpapers~~ Centimeters per Second. Funny enough, I think the show itself was so high quality my phone or MX video couldn't handle it because the sound kept cutting out randomly. Even despite that though, it was a fantastic watch. I much more simple story than Miyazaki, it dealt with love that gradually grows apart over time, not by emotion but by distance. It was a beauty to see, and the sound and animation were as spectacular as I had heard. The ending was rather sad but maybe a little hopeful as well, and a perfect way to finish this rather sad simple tale about rather ordinary people. The insert song also was absolutely perfect as well.

**Into the Forest of the Fireflie's Light**

I spotted this on the nomination list, and had never heard of it. It wasn't lauded around the same way that Ghibli or Makoto Shinkai was, and I was curious. Imagine my suprise when I found out the Director was Takahiro Omori, the director of Durarara, Baccano, Samurai Flamenco, and the unseen by me Natsume's Book of Friends! This guy is awesome! And it was produced by Brains Base! My favorite studio, more awesome! So I was hopeful coming into this short 44 minute movie, and it didn't disappoint. If 5 ~~Gahthislookssoamazing~~ Centimeters per Second was the story of a love that grew apart with time, this was the story of a love that was only given a limited amount of time. A simple but sweet tale of a spirit man and a young girl, it was a fantastic sweet tale of a friendship that blossomed into a romance, that ended it a tragedy that we all knew was coming but didn't make its passing any easier. Everything that needed to happen was wrapped up in a neat 40 minute bow, and it was tight with no saggy bits. Animation was lovely as usual for Brains Base, and the music was delightful as always. Brains Base continues being Brains Based.

-------

So now here we are and I've seen quite a bit more. I already have downloaded and ready to go

* Princess Mononoke
* Voices of a Distant Star
* Children who chase lost voices from deep below
* The promised place beyond the clowds

I plan to get some more done as well, after dropping down to 28 airing shows from my original 34 and the international being over (poor EE-sama) I expect to have more time. Next week I focus on these shows and getting back to Shinsekai Yori, as well as starting Monogatari Second Season in time to watch Hanamonogatari. If any of you out there have some suggestion on what movie to watch next, let me know. The movie tournament thread is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2bc41g/anime_movie_tournament_top_64_reveal_and_bracket/)

That's all from me, have a great weekend all you lovely people!

Started watching Brotherhood after the original, amazing ride so far.
>> ARTICLE
One of the shows I watched was **Monogatari Series: Second Season**. It was amazing, especially since I loved the first season and Nisemonogatari. I think this season was better than the first, we got a lot of loose ends tied up from the first season. My favourite arc from this season has to be the Nadeko arc, from the glorious opening song to the change of her character, it just made me love her so much considering her character in the first season.

Also I watched **Senjou no Valkyria**, a war anime about the son of a famous war hero. It started off pretty alright, but I felt that it dragged out a bit too much, especially when they started adding fantasy when it was really unneeded considering how industrial based it was at first. However I enjoyed the OVA's more than the actual anime itself, the characters in the anime were a bit to cliche for my liking, however the new cast in the OVA's looked quite promising
>> ARTICLE
**White Album 2 (13/13)**
This one definitely underwhelmed me a little bit and at the end I found myself disliking each of the main characters for their own reason. Gave it a 7/10.

**Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko (12/12)**
This one surprised me! I went in with low expectations considering the word "hentai" is in the title and I assumed it would just be fanservice nonstop (which I don't tend to like). I ended up with a series that had one of the most adorable main girls in anime and a twist near the end that I didn't expect and loved!

edit:formatting
>> ARTICLE
With White AAlbum, I'm pretty sure you're meant to dislike each of them a bit at the end. They are terrific, flawed, human characters. Still the bittersweet ending is definitely more bitter than sweet.

Henneko is a great watch, I rewatched it recently and I found that the twist was so well worked into the story. It made so much sense, ending made me tear up again
>> ARTICLE
**Fate/Zero 2nd season**

You know, I usually love a focus on characters and story. I love it when there's so much at stake, lots of unique characters with their own motivations and so on. But for some reason, I just can't get into this.

I like challenging anime where you don't just shut your brain off and enjoy, but I almost feel too stupid for Fate/Zero. Most of the time the pacing is bit slow and I'm starting to get bored because the dialogue is so extended, but when the action happens I feel lost. Who did that servant belong to? Why is he attacking that other servant again? What was the masters motivation again? 

One the one hand not enough stuff happens, but when it does, so much is going on at the same time that I can never make any sense out of it. I have so many question but I'm afraid I'll sound stupid if I ask them. I feel that I need to watch every episode two or three times in order to really understand what's happening. It doesn't help that I always confuse the church assassin guy with Saber's master. I'll put some of my questions in spoiler tags, just in case.

[Question 1](/s "Who is that Sakura girl and why does the white haired guy with the bugs in his skin or something want to protect her?")

[Question 2](/s "Who is Gilgamesh's master? What is his relation to the other characters? Why does he want to win the grail war? I think he works together with Assassin's master?")

>> ARTICLE
I thought all that stuff was pretty well explained. Sakura is Rin Tohsaka's sister, who was given to the Matou family so she would be able to keep her magic ability. Magical families are only allowed one child with powers, if I remember correctly. The white-haired guy, Kariya, also belongs to the Matou family, and wants to protect the Tohsaka family because he is secretly in love with Tokiomi Tohsaka's wife, Aoi. 

Gilgamesh is the servant of Tokiomi Tohsaka in the beginning, but [Kotomine Kirei] (/s "betrays him, kills him and assumes command of Gilgamesh after Kirei's servant Assassin dies.") He wants to win the Holy Grail, because he sees himself as the rightful king of the world, and believes that all the world's treasures, including the Grail, belong to him.

It's been a while since I saw the show, so I don't remember the details clearly. I hope it helped, though.

Started and finished **Cowboy Bebop**, finally. It is indeed a good show, though I don't really think it deserves the praise it gets, since there are much better things around. It is a fairly good anime from old times, but not definitely a "must-watch". It suffers a bit from its episodic nature (some episodes are awesome, others are just... wtf) and the strange relationship between the characters (they sometimes care for each other and sometimes hate each other, it really is weird.). I did like their backstories a lot, especially Feye's. And, like I said, some episodes are really well done. Rating is *17/20*.

Started and finished **Hitsugi no Chaika**. I wasn't expecting much, but I was greeted with a really good story, with some interesting and unexpected plot twists, funny characters and, most importantly, the lack of ecchi. It has so many females, yet I saw 1 ecchi scene, which is quite impressive. I do not dislike fanservice, but I praise this show for actually not having any when it almost seems a typical fanservice show. Rating is *15/20*.

Started **Watamote** today. Well, I must say, I'm impressed. I really like Tomoko, she might actually be one of my favorite female characters in anime. I really feel bad for her, she has so much bad luck it is almost surreal (well, it is a fiction but damn). There are some... cringe-worthy moments, but mostly it is just a fun experience. I can understand some people disliking it, but so far I would recommend it if you want a different experience from the usual SoL.

**Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) - 25/25** - Someone told me to watch it as they considered it one of their favourite, most underrated anime ever. It was entertaining enough to watch but I found it to be needlessly convoluted at times. Some of the explanations for what was going on seemed to be half-assed and only there to withhold information to keep the audience interested. Regardless of that I enjoyed the series, especially the twists at the end. No memorable characters apart from Squealer. **7/10**

**Seitokai Yakuindomo - 13/26** - Watched the first season of this and it was pretty funny. Didn't expect it to be so crude as I didn't look into anything about it before I started watching. I expected typical high school, slice of life romcom. Turned out to be something quite special. I stopped watching after the first season to watch something else as I'm not sure I need another 13 episodes of raunchy, in-your-face sex jokes, but it's probably something I'll go back to after a while. **7/10**

**Gin no Saji (Silver Spoon) - 22/22** - I didn't know I could fall in love with farming and agriculture so much after spending 20 years of my life avoiding it due to hayfever. Incredibly entertaining to watch, quite moving at times, deals with a lot of real issues that you really sympathise with, and as a bonus you might actually learn a lot about farming and agriculture. Don't skip this one because of the setting. It's an amazing series. **9/10**

**Toradora! - 16/25** - I really didn't know what to think of this one 4 episodes in. It had really high ratings as well as being a personal favourite of someone I know of (EE-sama). I'll put it out there that I really dislike tsundere girls. I don't like watching the main character get kicked in the face every 5 minutes by some antsy, borderline unlikeable character. It was too much tsun and not enough dere for my liking. Stuck with it though and I'm glad I did. It's got a surprising amount of depth to it and perhaps there'll be even more with the episodes to come. Not sure what direction it's taking. Wouldn't be surprised if it ended with a lot of life lessons about love and blah blah blah, but I'd really like a relationship to spawn between at least one of these characters.

*I watched a lot of anime this week.*

Hellsing, I would've marathoned (is that the right tense?) it, but sadly the 12th episode was in english and it really put me off.

Nichijou, absolutly amazing, after some time, the laughing just started to hurt.

Cowboy Bebop, I finally started to watch this classic, still busy though.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not usually a fan of pure comedy shows but **Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou (12/12)** actually made me laugh out loud several times while watching. 

I also watched **Kokoro Connect (17/17)** which was probably one of the better romance series I've seen. Too bad there will probably never be a season 2. Seriously what's with romcoms and awful second seasons (Oreimo, Chuunibyou) or nonexistent ones?

**Suisei no Gargantia (13/13):** Thoroughly enjoyed the world and characters, though some aspects were really underdeveloped, especially how the whole main conflict at the beginning kind of gets shoved into the background unresolved. 
>> ARTICLE
**White Album 2 (13/13)**

This show crushed my soul with all of the characters.  Best Trainwreck of a show with it's Romance and Drama, it's up there with Clannad AfterStory for sure.

**Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou.... Ahh! (7/12)**

One of the most funniest and relatable shows I've watched in a long while.  Every joke was pretty much a hit in it.  I especially like the Daily lives of Highschool girls segment after the credits for each episode.  The part where the guy throws chocolate at the girls to calm them down was hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
I've had this past week off so I was able to marathon two thirteen episode animes!

**Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!** *12/12* If any of you have dealt with social anxiety or are/have been in socially awkward situations this one will probably have you laughing. I found the main character, Tomoko, to be very relatable! (Almost felt like I was watching myself in an anime at some points.) Great share of funny moments but some serious/sad parts in there too. **8.5/10**

**Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World** *13/13* This anime was recommended to me by a friend, and I must say I did enjoy it. Going into it I thought it was a continuous plot rather than an episodic anime (my bad for not reading into it more before watching), but I liked it more than I thought it would! Some episodes really stick with you (the second episode for me, in particular.) **8/10**

As for what I'm starting this week...

**Seitokai Yakuindomo Season 2** *4/12* I loved the first season of SYD, I don't think I have ever laughed that hard at an anime ever. And so far the second season has me laughing so I hope the hilarity ensues!

**Trigun** *2/26* I have been meaning to watch this anime for a long, *long* time. I remember seeing a few episodes of this as a kid and getting quite a kick out of Vash, so I decided to finally start this after knocking off a couple of other animes that had been on my list. I am only on the second episode but I adore Vash and really like Meryl and Milly. Looking forward to seeing where it goes!
>> ARTICLE
Like several others, it seems, I watched **Evangelion** and **End of Evangelion**. I liked it. It certainly isn't perfect, but it was good. Too much was unexplained at the end, and in the movie, Shinji was made into a creeper (basically because the animator is an asshole who hates his fans).  I think it was worth watching, but I have no plans to ever rewatch it. 8/10
>> ARTICLE
**Outbreak company** - 12/12:  Just finished it up a couple of nights ago.  I'm a big fan of Scrapped Princess and Chaika, so I guess I was expecting more out of it - but it was pretty good, all things considered.  A solid 7/10.  Some of the humor fell flat for me, and I would have liked a little more resolution to some of the relationships, but i get it's based on a still-running series of light novels and they were probably hoping for a second cour.  
>> ARTICLE
Outbreak company was interesting since otaku culture was one of the primary plot points. Very few anime actually has this. Or maybe I just haven't seen them yet.
>> ARTICLE
genshiken springs to mind, and iirc there have been a few others. Definitely there are lots of shows these days which contain more self-aware elements of Otaku culture. Daru or the maid cafes in Steins;gate for example. 
>> ARTICLE
Genshiken is definitely a classic. Sure there's anime that have otaku culture references here and there but I haven't seen many that makes it one of the major plot points.
>> ARTICLE
Katekyo Hitman Reborn - the build up was ridicilous. 128 episodes and over 5 episodes of references. Too bad it ended and the 2 last arcs are not probably coming.
>> ARTICLE
**Guilty Crown (10/26)**

I admit I like this show so far. The OST is amazing, it looks fantastic and Inori is smokin hot. My main problem with this show is Shu because he is very irritating as a character. Sometimes he is angry, and then he is depressed and then he is kind of ok with everything and then he accidently grabs some boobs, I dunno he is just not very likeable for me.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/zero. Boy did I love it. I watched the first half of the first season when it aired, but stopped watching anime somewhere around there. Decided last week to pick it back up and I did not regret it. It puts a contrast on so many things for FSN, which makes me appreciate the characters in FSN a bit more.
>> ARTICLE
So this last week I rewatched **The World God Only Knows** and watched a good bit of **Shiki**.

**Shiki** is setting itself up to be a fairly decent vampire show, but the pacing is slow so far. I'm only on episode 6 but the repetition is starting to grate on me as it doesn't feel like anybody is making too many revelations. I mean... I get it. A lot of people are dying from some mysterious illness that only shows as anemia before the person inexplicably dies. What next? The only character I connected with on any level was the first girl that died because the whole episode was about her, but I hated her character so I felt kinda glad when she bit it.

Some things though are done really well. Aforementioned creepy stalker chick sneaking into the house to kill that one guy was extremely well paced, and really made use of a limited animation budget to add a lot of atmosphere to the whole situation. The creepy little obviously-vampire girl and her talks about death also have hauntingly true observations about the life vs death struggle that all living things have. 

But I just want this show to start taking me somewhere instead of going, "Hey look! Isn't that weird? Doesn't it seem like something is amiss?" Yeah, I already know something is amiss because I read the back of the box. Now lets see what you'll do with this set-up already.

I'd also like to note that this show has the worst case of bad anime hair I've ever seen barring Yugioh. Holy shit.

**The World God Only Knows** is a show I've seen before, but I'm happy to rewatch now that it's been a couple of months and my head is out of the clouds about season 3. And to be completely honest, I'm still a bit in awe at how good it really is. It's not a show everyone will like as it does have a huge "girl of the week" focus for the first two entire seasons, but it does what it aims to so well that I can't help but admire it. The show is intensely aware of it's tropes and takes a unique angle on the idea of how taking a trope's typical character flaw and solving it will cause them to fall in love. But what I like the most is that it's *because* they have that flaw fixed, but are still noticeably flawed human beings that makes them feel like they are actual characters that grew as a result of Keima's endeavors, and are continuing to grow without him. Watching how they grow out of that mold that their trope defines them as without making them suddenly super happy and perfect is gratifying, and makes Keima's analyzing interesting, and his efforts worth it. It makes every character endearing, and of course Keima and Elsie are endlessly entertaining as their chemistry with each other really shows while they play off of each other. 

I highly recommend it to anyone that likes rom-coms, and quite possibly even if you don't. It's got a huge focus on the moe aspect of things but it all plays to the show's favor in what it's trying to do. It both celebrates and satirizes anime tropes and culture without ever feeling like it's trying to hard, and I enormously enjoy it. Guess it's why it's still in my top 5 favorite shows of all time.
>> ARTICLE
**Hyouge Mono 15-32:** I have 7 episodes left, and I'm not yet seeing why it garnered so much praise from those few who watched it. It's a mess, to be honest. Most episodes have no focus due to constant timeskips and lots of little unrelated plots that never seem to converge. Things happen offscreen which advance the state of affairs considerably, and they aren't really elaborated on. I suppose this is aimed at those who know their history, rather than viewers with just some general knowledge of the era. 

There are dozens of characters that are usually lacking in distinctive features. They change names all the time, so I find easy to get confused as to who is allied with who and whatnot. Many of them have their own little plotlines, too, and they're ultimately forgettable because the characters are so minor.

There's a very limited selection of music used in the show, and it almost never works. Whatever plays rarely fits the tone of the scene, or it becomes too distracting. Then there are things like the music in the runup to the ED just cutting out in the middle.

Scene transitions aren't handled that poorly, because there's usually a message about the time and location where events are taking place. As a westerner with limited knowledge of little villages in Japan, the place names rarely provide much context for me, though. 

The plot is meandering to follow actual history, so just about the only saving grace is the main characters. Furuta has many faces and is constantly changing his outlook on life as the show goes on. It's quite interesting seeing him change as he tries to keep up with trends in the world of aesthetes, or to watch his ambitions grow. The others aren't nearly as interesting to watch, because we just don't get the same insight into them as we do Furuta. 

Comedy is another strongpoint. The premise is ridiculous, for one, and it's a running theme throughout the show. Everything is tea, imperfection, simplicity, and the life of an aesthete. It can get bogged down by political happenings, but they're often resolved by a hard bargain over tea, or the trade of a priceless piece of art. I sometimes find myself internally laughing at the situation rather than any dialogue. Although some of that is certainly sharp and witty, at least sometimes. 

Just as an aside: Date Masamune in this is voiced by the same guy who voiced him in Sengoku Basara. Has that ever happened before? A seiyuu being that attached to a historical character. 

**Jewelpet Happiness 39-43:** This last third is a bit of a slog. The red moon is now consistently controlling the minds of pets, which makes for less fun episodes than before. The events can be sillier, but there's now a hint of drama involved that just doesn't belong.

And at this point I realise that the characters have been completely static over the course of the anime. Not that uncommon or necessarily bad for a comedy, but it will almost certainly make this fairly forgettable after I'm done with it.

**Hitsugi no Chaika (12/12)**

I heard good things about season 1 and saw that the second season is coming in the fall so I decided to check it out.  I was fairly impressed, its one of the better fantasy series I've seen.  Chaika is probably the most unique character design I've seen in a while, how many other 14 year old girls do you see carrying massive coffins on their backs with magical sniper rifles?

Toru is a pretty good MC, he has some anti-hero traits that set him apart from a lot of other shounen pro tags but he still has his fair share of cliches.  I thought he was going to be another generic incompetent MC but since he met Chaika and found a purpose, he's become a much more likable character.

The world building that they've done has been pretty cool, its fairly unique, especially the fact that magic is powered mostly by fossil fuels or corpses or the like.  And its also nice that the tone is relatively grey, the MCs aren't necessarily the good guys, the antagonists aren't necessarily the bad guys.  In fact there has really only been one or two characters that I would describe as "evil" which is a nice change of pace.

On the whole a very solid show and I'll be looking forward to the next season in the fall.  I have so many questions that I want answered so it should be an interesting ride.  One other thing, why are all the characters named after cars?  Chaika Trabant, Toru Acura, Dominica Skoda?

**Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to the Animation (12/12)**

Not really sure why I decided to pick this one up but it was reasonably funny.  It reminded me a bit of SYD if the genders were flipped, but I think that the fact that its the girls making the ridiculous dirty jokes that makes SYD so funny.  That being said there were some absolutely ridiculous moments, particularly the elevator scene in episode 10, the only thing that was going through my mind was "Is this really happening?!?"

Overall not a bad show, nothing particularly special but it did have some really funny moments and the episode are pretty short so its not a big deal.

Just now I'll watch the remaining few episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. While it seemed to be a generic Shounen at the beginning, though with a nice introduction to characters, FMA:B stood out and picked up the pace in [EP. 10](/s 'with Hughes' death.') Since that point I've just wanted to continue on, and today I'll see it through.

Got back into anime recently after a childhood of Naruto, Yugioh, DBZ etc., and finished **Fate/Zero** and **Steins; Gate** this past week. Fate's action scenes were spectacular, and also had a pretty great story to boot! Excited to see how the Fate/Stay Night anime and movie turn out! 

Steins; Gate, however, was the highlight for me. The first six episodes were mostly slice of life, and started off really slow and confusing as people have said, but began to pick up pace and clarify things quickly. Having stopped at around episode 5 a few weeks ago, I'm truly glad to have finally finished this show. I was shocked when shit hit the fan in [episode 12](/s "when Mayuri gets shot in the head. People weren't joking when they said to just wait for it.") and things started picking up real quickly after that. All in all, an excellent series, mixing the intriguing concept of time travel with action and some genuinely cute, emotional, and happy moments with a great cast of characters. [spoiler](/s "Tuturu~ and Okabe and Kurisu's relationship were d'aww moments for me") 

After the final episode, I had to go and watch the OVA and movie too. I found both excellent and I feel that they brought the series to a suitable end. I was thinking about checking out the VN, any thoughts?

If anyone has any recommendations that aren't in my [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/pigofwar), I'd love to hear them!

I watched my bluray of The Devil Is a Part Timer. I watched it dubbed this time around. It wasn't as funny as I remember and I'm not sure if that's because of the dub voices throwing me off or if I'm that much more of a cynical asshole. I didn't notice the budget animation quality last time, either.

A very short week for me, as one game has a festival going on and another game has a special weekend happening. So my attention has been well-and-truly torn apart this week.

**Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: Next Chapter** - Status: **COMPLETE**

Yup. All I got to was a single 4-episode OVA that finishes off the show that finished me off completely and left me laying in the ruins of my own tear ducts. I've often mentioned that about Rumbling Hearts... And Next Chapter picked up almost exactly where it left off and gave a well-deserved full-stop to the story. 

Although I must say that I really didn't need the recap episode. Maybe some of you might have wanted one after three years had gone by, but I've got all twelve episodes burned into my brain and they will never entirely fade away. For me, it was something that I desperately wanted to skip forward through... But I couldn't, and only partly because I started crying again and couldn't find the pause button. True story. Final Score: **7/10**

Next up... Well, I'm torn. Do I want to go with [Akane Maniax](http://myanimelist.net/anime/281/Akane_Maniax) and into Muv-Luv? Do I want to go old-school and finally watch [I My Me! Strawberry Eggs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/509/I_My_Me!_Strawberry_Eggs)? Or do I want to be weird and perverted and watch [To-LOVE-Ru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3455/To_LOVE-Ru)? Or do I want to finally sit myself down and watch [Uchuu Kyoudai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai)? Decisions, decisions...

Oh god, since finals are finally over here is what I watched: 

* **Jormungand** - A good action show, watched it over the week. The high point of this show is the life of these characters they introduce to us, this being the bodyguards and Koko, however I wasn't able to remember all the characters presented to me and I just kept tracking the most important: Jonah (the child soldier), Lehm (the badass leader of the team), Velmet (the woman), the guy that got shot in the ass, Mao [](/s "the fake death flag") and of course the beloved Koko, who ends up stealing most of the show.
It was nice but not a great story since I didn't felt any of them being in danger, everyone they faced seemed to be sub par. If you like good action

* **Girls und Panzer** - I spent half an afternoon with this, it wasn't really my intention, since I was planning on taking it slow and watch it over the week and in the end it made me interested in trying out a game about tanks, but I didn't went through that. Why am I surprised? I was delightful to find out that it incorporates strategy, as soon as I found about that, my idea of the show got obscured, it was no longer these "cute girls doing cute things", at least for me. It combined the smart with the ridiculous and I loved it.

* **Black Lagoon OVA:Roberta's Blood Trail** - Liked it, specially the character development of Rock over this OVA. Bad points: you don't see much of Revy, good points: Saw a hell more of the crazy maid, more crazier and more bloodthirsty. Although the [ending:](/s "I didn't like with everyone living, even though they are badly damaged. Although I loved Rock's new battle against Chang.")
It ends with me anxious for a new continuation, because it gathered up a story, it's no longer about doing jobs it has a proper purpose now, a great battle, a gang war.

* **Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! and the OVA** - Only watched the first season, won't watch anything else. Felt like it had a solid ending (that being the reason why I won't watch season 2), the comedy was great and the art was fabulous. The great points of this anime is turning from comedy to a serious show with intense situations (Yuuta and Dekomori talk in the train station made me tear up a bit).

* **Neon Genesis Envangelion** - I liked at first and I didn't like it. Well it is the same as most of opinions are: I liked the mecha, then tragedy occurred then "that" happened. You know, when "that" happened I started to loose interest, it was clear that the budget was gone and they were using scenes that I have seen before. I liked the theory behind it though, don't get me wrong I liked the whole "there is one different you to the people you meet" speech, it got me thinking "Huh, I haven't thought about it" but if Shinji really thought that everyone hated him, that made me think that Shinji is just an idiot, also there was quite some existentialist speeches that I've heard/thought before in my early teens, that's the part I didn't like (of the end). Liked the character development was fantastic mainly Asuka. It also leaves so much open before "that" happened, seriously how did "that" happened, that's the part that leaves me scratching my head, even if it was a whole universe, why didn't they continue the universe? Maybe I didn't understand it, or perhaps the show can't explain it self. Maybe I'm going to watch the movies someday.

**Still Watching:**

* **Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (3/24)** - It seems nice, I haven't made up a proper opinion about it though.

* **Arakawa Under the Bridge (5/12)** - It continues to be entertaining and hilarious, I can see mild shaft elements. Love the characters, every single one of them is hilarious and love the first opening, once the melody gets in my head it's hard to take it out (it's that sweet voice, this and the Space Dandy ED). I don't really have much to say about this.

* **Jormungand: The Perfect Order (5/12)** - Remember when I said there were a few characters that I didn't remember from the team, well apparently it was important now and during the first season it went completely silent for me, I didn't even know he existed. Introduces an interesting character. Just the first few episodes and I already find it better than the previous season, because that danger that I was referring to, seems now present in here.

**Movies:**

* **Tokyo Godfathers** - A delightful Christmas movie, I was expecting gangster kind of film set in Tokyo. It was a nice heart-warming story.

I think I'm forgetting some.

I watched a few OVAs that came out pretty recent-ish.

**Seitokai Yakuindomo * OVA**: More of the same from this series. I'd say it was about average compared to the season itself. So, about an 8/10.

**Genshiken Nidaime no Roku**: A new year's episode for some reason! It felt a little strange a jump from the anime, especially since I haven't read the manga. It had it's share of funny moments, and overall, it felt like it moved the story forward, but I don't really know what to make of it. The engrish parts were pretty annoying though. I have no idea how to rate this one, but if I had to, I'd give it an 8/10, having given the series a 10/10.

**GJ-bu@**: I loved the main series, and this seemed like more of the same. It had a pretty weak main theme though, and ended up with what felt like less banter and comedy than an average episode of the series. Its second half is pretty weird too, and ends in a cliche, though I don't know if that's a bad thing when it comes to this series. I give this a 7/10, having given the series an 8/10

**Mysterious Girlfriend X** (10/13)

This show. This is quite unlike anything anything I've ever seen before. It does an excellent job of setting up the bizarre atmosphere it thrives on with it's sound design and 90's art style. Unfortunately, as it nears the end, it appears to be running out of things to do and is falling back on genre tropes/cliches.

To summarize; Weird People Doing Weird Things.

Anyway, to break up all of that weirdness, I started watching...

**Yuru Yuri** (12/12)

I went into this show with the "moeshit" label firmly affixed to it, and I must say, I enjoyed it so much more than I expected to. Admittedly, I haven't watched a lot of comedy anime, but of what I have, this is among the few that resonate with my sense of humour. Nothing much more to say about it, really. Funniest moment for me was probably the [](/s "tomato kigurumi.") Looking forward to watching season 2.

*^^^^TOSHINO ^^^^KYOUKOOOOOO!*

Noucome 1-10: I've heard a lot of good things about this show on animesuggest. Since the name reminds me of My Teen Romance SNAFU, which is one of the best SOLs out there, I decide to give it a shot. The idea of the show is pretty generic with a main character surrounded by 3 or 4 ladies who secretly like him. But the absolute choice ability he has is a great plot device to having him do stupid shit. One of the girls remind me of Senjouhara, so that was pretty awesome. I actually forgot I watched this show this week and it took me a while to remember, leading me to believe this show is pretty forgettable. 8/10

Chrono Crusade 1-3: The first time I saw this show was in that amv version of the song "The ultimate showdown". I know this show is a classic, but the first 3 episodes haven't really hooked me in yet. Part of this reason is because someone told me this show is suppose to be sad, so I'm feeling anxious about every little foreshadowing that could lead to tragedy.  Here's hoping they were lying and everything works out for Charlotte and Chrono. Here is the amv www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2gajRzTJsc

Revolutionary Girl Utena. I definitely did not catch the nuances of this show when I was young, but I really enjoyed the rewatch. It's surreal and can be thought provoking. The plot is pretty straight forward, but I think it's an interesting take on the magical girl genre - Utena wants to be a strong prince afterall.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time posting and I'm doing it from mobile so please bare with me but I literally *just* finished **Angel Beats,** and by God that show ended well! I'll avoid any spoilers. (Although, it seems as though just about all of this sub has seen it.) Anyway, to the point! My first impression with this show wasn't that great because a friend of mine talked the show up and the first episode didn't grab me. However, I came back to the show yesterday, after about a month since the first episode, and I loved it! It was hilarious,  especially the seen where they distracted the class in episode 5 (You know the one), but this show also did a great job of making you sympathize with the characters. I wasn't quite sure how they were going to make it end well in the last episode, but they definitely ended it well! I was nearly in tears the last 5 to 10 minutes of the show. All in all I have to rate this anime in my top 10 of all time. I definitely recommend watching it if you haven't yet!

Madoka Magica (12/12). I started it a few months ago, only got through 2 episodes. It got a lot better.
>> ARTICLE
I finished **His and Her Circumstances,** and was kind of disappointed. It was going really well for the first two thirds, and then the show's apparent complete lack of budget really came through. The animation for the last few episodes was so low-quality that I just couldn't get immersed. Paired with the lack of plot progression and the stupid read-the-manga ending, this was an unfortunate finish to an otherwise great show.

Also, I finished **Serial Experiments Lain.** Well, do I feel like my mind was violently sodomized by a jackhammer or what? I still have no clue what most of those scenes were about. Still, there were parts that were pretty enjoyable, and it did a great job at establishing a creepy, surreal atmosphere. Lain herself was a great character. Seeing the interactions between her alternate personalities and others, and even her alternate personalities with each other was fun. Overall I'd say it was good, but I might want to go over it again at some point in the future to see If I can make any more sense out of it.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't watch much this week either

**The Girl Who Leapt Through Time [1/1]** I sort of expected this to be a more action oriented movie sort of like a Steins;Gate feel, but I was wrong. This movie is great and I thought it was a nice romance with some cool time travel aspects. 8/10 really good but I could have used some more explanation.

**Gunbuster [3/6]** I watched this to see NGE in the making and I sort of see it. I like it so far although I don't understand why they have to do pushups in the robot suits...
>> ARTICLE
>I don't understand why they have to do pushups in the robot suits...

Heh, that confused the hell out of me when I watched Episode 1. It was so... parody-like, you could say. But as you know, that aspect of the show kinda changes in the following 2 episodes.

As for "NGE in the making", I agree. It's not immediately obvious from the first episode, but I think there's some truth to it.
>> ARTICLE
It should be noted that The Girl Who Leapt Through Time was a sidequel to the novel of the same name. The aunt in the movie is the protagonist in the novel. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt similarly when i saw The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.  I was not expecting the tone that the movie had, i was expecting either harder scifi or more action, and less of the slice of life tone that happens for most of the movie.  I was at least expecting it to be more serious for its entirety.  
>> ARTICLE
Nisekoi:  I liked this show.  I was disappointed that best Girl Onodera doesn't seem like she's going to win, but i'm looking forward to S2.

Non Non Biyori OVA:  Pretty okay episode, not as good as a lot of episodes so far, but its nice to be able to see more of this show.

Bakemonogatari (S1):  I finished up through episode 12, and i'm confused why there are 3 more episodes in Tsubasa Cat according to some places and in other places it ends at episode 12?  I liked Tsubasa Cat and Hitagi Crab arcs, but Snake and Monkey arks were just painfully boring to me, especially Monkey.  Where do i go from here?  Do i watch Neko or Nisemonogatari next?

Watch the last three eps, then Nise>Neko:Kuro>Second Season.

* **White Album 2** - Finished it last Friday, damn it...

[Ergo Proxy](/s "I was bracing myself for manly tears over a robot for the second half of this series, as I was sure they were building up to killing off little Pino")

I enjoyed it, but there were some episodes that seemed a bit odd in the middle there.

**Kuragehime (Princess Jellyfish) (11/11 finished)** - Not much to add from last week. Cool show that does romantic comedy in a slightly different way, though there is hardly enough romance to call it a romantic comedy. Some of the characters started getting annoying by the end of the show, and there was no real conclusion, so I think it could've been better, but all in all, it was a decent show.

**Gunbuster (6/6 finished)** - "Ah, so this is where *that* comes from!" is a thought that I had several times while watching Gunbuster. That thought may have been misguided on many occasions, as I haven't seen any of the mecha shows that came before Gunbuster, but I have a feeling Gunbuster was the beginning of many things. This OVA series walks the line between the "Fuck yeah, giant robots!" style of super robot shows and the darker kind of robot shows, and it does that superbly. It occasionally seems very much like a parody(e.g. when trainees are ordered to skip rope, run laps and stretch with their robots), but most of the time it's extremely sincere in all the best ways. War is hell, people die, people care for each other, stuff like that.

The best thing about the show, however, is how packed it is. 6 episodes, no filler. There are more battles and climaxes than in most 1-cour shows(and even some 2-cour shows), and everything feels relevant. While the art and animation can be lacking at times(or even minimalistic/nonexistent in the final episode in true Anno style), the execution is fantastic. I can definitely see this being an inspiration for almost all mecha shows that came after it(in some ways, it's even like a proto-Evangelion). Easy 10/10, storytelling doesn't get much better than this.
>> ARTICLE
**Sakurasou No Pet na Kanojo 6/24**

This is a rewatch. I decided I wanted more Sora(ta) and (Ma)shiro after watching NGNL. 

[Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo](/s "My first time through, I remember thinking Sorata and Mashiro went well together and that the canon pairing made a lot of sense. I remember having a lot of warm and fuzzy feelings about Sorata taking care of Mashiro.")

[Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo](/s "This time, I trying to be a bit more open minded, and I'm having less suspension of disbelief because of that. After 6 episodes in, I'm having a really hard time seeing why Mashiro is a good match for Sorata over Nanami other than it's the pushed relationship by the author. Having to take care of someone because they rely on you for everything isn't relationship material. Sure, it's great for the audience, but I'm finding it hard to see why Sorata would develop romantic feelings for Mashiro after putting myself in his shoes. Maybe Mashiro grows more as the series progresses. I honestly don't remember, but I'm starting to see why people on the internet were pushing hard for Nanami.")

Still, I'm enjoying the show as much as I did the first time through.

**Non Non Biyori 8/12**

Picked this one up after reading about it on the Slice of Life thread that popped up this past week. Not much to say here. It's a feel-good anime that makes you laugh out loud. It definitely deserves its spot on that list, from what I've seen so far. 
>> ARTICLE
**Samurai Flamenco (7/24?)**: Was having a ton of fun watching it because it was really similar to Kick Ass which I enjoyed. Watching the Flamenco Girls kick butt (and groins) was really fun and it made me wince a little each time it happened. Was really surprised when Gullotine Gorilla came out of nowhere though. Definitely wasn't expecting the show to take that turn.

**Welcome to NHK (3/24?)**: Still waiting for the story to really kick in. It was really funny watching the MC discover the wonders of the internet.

**Angel Beats! 13/13** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!)


It was filled with action. It was funny. It was dramatic. It was depressing as all hell at the end. I haven't been on this kind of emotional rollercoaster since Clannad. Yuri reminded me of Haruhi a decent bit with her Anti-Angel shenanigans. The soundtrack was pretty decent too. Also, I think T.K. is one of my favorite minor chracters in anime because of his random and silly Engrish. "Get chance and luck!" 8.5/10


**Angel Beats!: Another Epilouge 1/1** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10067/Angel_Beats!:_Another_Epilogue)


A 3-minute episode that gives closure to what happened to Otonashi at the end of series. Not going to spoil anything here for you guys. 8/10


**Angel Beats!: Stairway to Heaven 1/1** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9062/Angel_Beats!:_Stairway_to_Heaven)


Just about every comedic series has one of these episodes where the plot doesn't advance, but it still shows the silliness of most of the characters. 8/10


**Ergo Proxy 3/23** [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/790/Ergo_Proxy)


I started watching this series because it was a recommendation from my little brother. So far, it's pretty good. I have alot of questions about what exactly is going on, but I'm sure they will all be answered once I keep watching. 8/10
>> ARTICLE
I'm finishing Madoka Magica later today. So far, I think it's one of the best shows I've watched in 18 years of anime. Not only is the story fantastic, but the art and music are amazing in their own right.

Also, i'm watching Initial D because i'm old and i like cars.

I watched Kotoura-san this weekend for no real reason. It was recommended to me so I gave it a shot. Talk about wasted potential. The first episode was probably the best episode of anime I've ever watched. Then it devolved into an average romcom with jokes that got old way too fast and terrible plot decisions like [Kotoura-san](/s "Kotoura completely forgiving Moritani instantly, and Kotoura forgiving her bitch of a mother in the finale and somehow blaming herself.")

5/10. The first episode and Kotoura being one of the cutest characters ever are the only things this show has going for it.

Non Non Biyori, beautiful setting, music and animation was great and it has some really charming characters, Renge was the standout. 10/10

**Hanasaku Iroha 26/26**

I finished this series up this week, watching episodes **11-26** in between going to Canada on vacation and keeping up with some currently airing shows. I'm not quite sure what I can say other than this might have just knocked *Gin no Saji* out of my top Slice of Life spot. With a perfect mix of comedy, drama, and romance, and some of the best characters I've had the pleasure to watch, this is also my new favorite P.A. Works anime. I spent the majority of last night sitting in bed pounding my fist into my mattress and trying not to tear up (I'm a very emotional watcher). 

10/10, and I'd highly recommend this anime. 

I'll be watching **Hanasaku Iroha: Home Sweet Home** tonight, and I'm glad I don't have to say goodbye to the series just yet. 

EDIT: I couldn't wait, and just watched **Home Sweet Home**. I'm impressed, I wasn't expecting much from a movie that came out two years after the series ended, but that was very good. I teared up a bit (once again, emotional watcher). 
>> ARTICLE
I recently finished it too, I entirely agree with what you said. Such a great show. I'm looking forward to the new show by P.A. Works next season.
>> ARTICLE
Me too. I've spent the past couple of weeks trying to watch all of P.A. Works' shows (I watched NagiAsu when it was airing, Angel Beats! a bit later, and last week went through Uchouten Kazoku and Another). I love them all, and I'm incredibly excited for Glasslip. I think it's my most hyped show of summer. 
>> ARTICLE
I said this to /u/flubbityfloop as well, but it always puts a smile on my face when I see someone else watching the show. 

I think the show does a great job of actually capturing life at a delicate stage, and it doesn't descend into the *feels-a-tron* that other serious SoL shows can. It really is a great show.
>> ARTICLE
[**Mawaru Penguindrum**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum) was a really fun anime at the begining, with all the cuteness and charming/weird comedy you could ask for. It also has [the most fun transformation sequence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_bT16afOy0) I've seen. Have I mentioned that the weirdness factor is high in this anime?
And for the second half Penguindrum became a really great metaphor heavy pschological drama. It dealt with some heavy themes, one time it was downright disturbing even. It was a wild ride from begining to end and I really enjoyed it.

Watching Neon Genesis Evangelion, something I've been putting off for a while because I read the manga first, pretty glad I finally decided to watch it though, it's really great!

Same here buddy... Watching NGE atm too, gotta say I'm pretty sure either I've watched it already or the show is incredibly predictable.

**The Garden of Words (Complete):**

[Mini-review here](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/the-garden-of-words-closeness-is-the-absence-of-words/). Which makes it interesting, since I want to say something here without just saying all of that again ;-) So it'd be a bit more constructed, I guess.

I like Makoto Shinkai. He has a shtick, and all of his works deal with that shtick. Thankfully for me, it's a shtick I care for. Thankfully for Makoto Shinkai, it's a shtick that's sort of universal, and all of us can understand and relate to.

That shtick is talking about the relations between people by way of the *distance* between them. Reminds me of Georg Simmel's dyadic nature of things. Distance is what defines how close we are to one another.

It truly felt like a Hollywood RomCom, sans the ending, except it was shorter. We've had moments, and we've had some words, and for each minute spent on something, a RomCom film would've spent 3-5, for much of the film. And yet, I found myself smiling, or thinking that things felt real enough.

The movie is called "The Garden of Words", and in some ways it's almost like we've seen a montage, rather than actually seeing things acted out, but though it was somewhat sparse and austere, it felt as if nothing was missing. Makoto Shinkai gives us human relationships, but rather than dwell on each moment, he shows us a beautiful series of shots, and lets the distance between the characters, and the distance between us and them, tie it all together.

It still feels a bit sparse, even as nothing is missing. I smiled, and I kept tearing up. It was more drama than a RomCom, especially as there was nothing comic about it, but RomComs are often not truly comic or romantic to begin with. I had a hard time calling it as a 7/10 film or 8/10 film, so I just gave it 7.5/10.

**Haibane Renmei Episodes 7-13 (Complete):**

Before we move on, here are [my notes for episodes 7-9](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/26mmva/anime_club_watch_18_haibane_renmei_79_spoilers/), and [here for episodes 10-13](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/26z3rq/anime_club_watch_18_haibane_renmei_1013_spoilers/chvvu80).

These episodes had been the pay-off. Where before we explored the world some, it was so we'd have what to lose, and then the show's true themes came to light, themes of loss and grief, depression and community. Everything in this show is about community - grief is the loss of a community member, depression is being unable to feel as part of the community, and forgiveness and salvation is to see yourself as part of the community, and to feel forgiven by it.

It was a good show, in terms of plot-construction. Nothing came out of nowhere, and it all made sense when it appeared. It posed questions, you answered them based on what you had seen thus far, and then the characters had provided the same answers. That's not a bad thing, but shows that the progression had been natural. It also meant that there wasn't much surprise or suspense, though there had been some suspense - knowing what the options are, and even seeing all the characters say the right thing doesn't mean they'd choose to *do* the right thing.

This isn't really a plot-heavy series, and likewise, the world isn't at the center of it all, even though the series is called "Haibane Renmei", where the Renmei organization is an ever looming presence, rather than an active force. I also find it hard to call it a "character-driven" series, for the "protagonist" plays the role of a classic supporting character, shedding light on others' personalities, and chiefly Reki's.

So what is this story about? It's a story about finding one's place in the world, about loss and grieving. It also has a moral, where to be alive, and to be forgiven, are a result of a communal existence. Man cannot exist on his own. You can see the second half of the show as an exploration of grief and depression, and it makes a statement on how to get out, and how the depression itself makes you unable to accept that way out.

I think I might have liked Haibane Renmei a lot more as a book. Haibane Renmei is very much, to me, not about how good you think they treat their theme, but how much it resonates with you when you watch it. I know times in the past it'd have resonated with me much more strongly, but not this time. A lot of what an anime of Haibane Renmei could bring over a book would be its OST, which was good but sparse and subdued, and its voice-acting, which was *very* subdued. The acting and drama of the finale were spectacular, but it was just one episode.

---

I also read the 130th Chihayafuru chapter. Reading one manga chapter at a time truly is suffering.
>> ARTICLE
>I think I might have liked Haibane Renmei a lot more as a book.

I dunno if you're aware of it, but 'Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World' is a Haruki Murakami book which has two stories, and one of them [End of the World] closely resembles Haibane Renmei and ABe has said before that he drew a LOT inspiration from that story.

I haven't read it myself [I plan to], so I can't vouch for how good it is, but maybe give it a shot if you really think you'd like the story in written form? ^ ^
>> ARTICLE
I own that book, and I've heard of that! I hadn't read it yet, so I'll probably bump it up a bit. But I wonder if that'd work, as Haruki Murakami's style isn't one I think of as especially conducive to what I think of :)

Also, it's less the story that I'd have liked more, but the emotional impact? The best thing an anime/show can have over a book is the voice acting and sound to help imbue it with feeling, but if they don't, then imagination can reign supreme.

One of my all time favorite animes. There are 4 episodes after the main 13  of the show that a lot of ppl miss and they're incredible.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. The last 4 episodes changed my life.
>> ARTICLE
I'm genuinely curious, in what way have those episodes changed your life? 

I loved Kokoro Connect but it never had that kind of impact on me, so I wonder.
>> ARTICLE
I'm basically Iori. The way she reacted to everything, her words, her emotions, I fully resonated with throughout the whole series, especially the last 4 episodes. The cheerful loving exterior, the dark brooding self-condemning perfectionist interior.

Her resolution at the end was mine as well, but unfortunately it's a lesson I seem to have to learn over and over again throughout my life. The darkness inside seems to reach a new level the older I get.
>> ARTICLE
Woah I totally forgot about how heavy Iori's story was. One the one hand it's great that you can connect (heh) to the character so much, on the other hand I hope you can find a permanent solution soon and get better.

The characters I could relate the most to were how Inaba acted on the outside and Aoki in general. So... I don't seem to have troubles like you have, which is good for me I guess.

I watched [Mouretsu Pirates](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8917/Mouretsu_Pirates). **26/26** in a couple of days.

There isn't much to say about it besides it was a very entertaining anime. 

The main character was was very likable, she wasn't annoying in anyway and she was pretty capable which was nice to see. Also the character [Chiaki](http://myanimelist.net/character/49873/Chiaki_Kurihara) reminded me so much of Kuroneko from Oriemo. I couldn't help but think of her as Space Pirate Kuroneko. I guess it has something to do with the same VA, hairstyle and even similar personality's. 

There wasn't to much of a main story, kind of little arcs all over the place, some pretty laid back while others very interesting and highly entertaining. Basically the main character in space, being a space pirate and doing pirating jobs, while also trying to keep up with school and all the other things she does.

It also had a great [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcBXhDCQNJE), at first i didn't really like it, but i always watch the first 3 episodes without skipping op's and ed's. By the time the 4th one came around it had grown on me and i didn't end up skipping it once.

Over all a decent sci-fi/space anime. [Couldn't](http://i.imgur.com/qXMmb3S.jpg) get [enough](http://i.imgur.com/PSf5WMK.jpg) of those [Pirate](http://i.imgur.com/X0ZNr3F.jpg) [uniforms](http://i.imgur.com/ktyrKbv.jpg). I'm definitely looking forward to the Movie when ever it comes out on BD and gets subbed.

Yeah I actually started watching it when it started and 7 episodes in dropped it because it was so boring.

I talked about this last week, but I finally finished season 1! It was so adorable, and I ended up giving it a 9/10, heh.

**K-On!! 15/26**

After finishing the first season, I immediately started the second. It's still just cute girls being cute, so it's just as (if not more) enjoyable than the first season.

**Nisemonogatari 10/11**

As I explained in the week prior to this, my friend and I watch one episode of an anime series a day since I'm trying to get him into watching anime again. So, we picked the monogatari series and we're almost done with Nisemonogatari.~ Yay!

**Unbreakable Machine Doll 3/12**

The main reason why I picked this up is because of Yaya. She's so cute. I kept hearing mixed reviews on it, so I decided to watch it myself and make my own decisions. While I'm only on episode 3 (since I've been devoting most of my time to finishing up K-On!! and watching the currently airing shows), I still find this show pretty enjoyable.

**Fate/Zero 3/25**

Well, I said I would pick this up after finishing up Psycho-Pass since I enjoyed that show so much. I can't really say much about Fate/Zero yet, because I'm still very very early on in the series, however, I do enjoy it so far! The animation/art-style is gorgeous, it really is a pleasing show to watch. I'll probably be finishing it within this week or the next!

Once I finish watching one of these shows, I think I'm going to be moving on to either **Code Geass** or **Mirai Nikki**.~
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero  Great anime, dat ending doe, to gud 

As someone who only watches anime that comes on Netflix, or it gets enough traction for me to hear about it all.  I really enjoyed the ending.
>> ARTICLE
Oh dude Mirai Nikki is god tier, please watch it before Geass.
>> ARTICLE
So jealous that you get to watch Mirai Nikki for the first time, maker sure you really don't look up anything and spoil it for yourself
>> ARTICLE
I've resorted to making people watch this anime just so I can steal some of their "watching Mirai Nikki for the first time" emotions.
>> ARTICLE
Thankfully nothing major has been spoiled for me yet!

Now I'm excited to watch it, though! I've never heard anything bad about it and it's been recommended to me quite a few times.
>> ARTICLE
Curious, how (and why) do you decide which episode to watch next, when watching so many different shows that already ended?

I used to read multiple books concurrently, but when I watch anime that ended not as part of the watch club, I try to finish or drop one before moving to the next.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if he does the same thing I do, but even if I'm bored with a show, I don't want to stop watching it in case it does get good.

So once I get bored with an anime I move onto the next, leaving the first for another time.
>> ARTICLE
I used to be the same way, actually. Watching too many things at once drove me crazy. But eventually I would maybe watch two shows at a time, and became used to it. Then I'd add another one and become used to that, etc. But, I'm pretty much at my limit for now with the shows I'm watching. 4 different series that have ended + the 10 or so shows that I'm watching & are airing are enough for me. If I added anything else, I think I would have a heart-attack.

When it comes to how/why, it simply comes down to what I feel like I want to watch when I have extra time. All of the shows I'm watching are very different from each other, making it easy to pick based on what I feel like watching. If I'm feeling something filled with action - Fate/Zero. If I want to watch something cute that doesn't require much attention - K-On.~

Making my way through Stand Alone Complex. God damn. (Then Love Live after I finish all of the GitS series.)
>> ARTICLE
GitS:SAC is a fantastic series. Be sure to stick around for 2nd Gig (season 2), which if anything is even better than the first season. I watched the original Ghost in the Shell (1995) movie yesterday, and it didn't really do it for me the way SAC did. It was weird seeing Kusanagi with black hair and blue eyes, and her English voice actor was horrible compared to SAC's Kusanagi. Also, CGI from 20 years ago wasn't great, apparently in the future we still only know how to make green displays.
>> ARTICLE
I finished FMA Brotherhood yesterday. 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Currently watching Psycho Pass. My god this show is great. 


>> ARTICLE
How far in are you? Once you get at least half-way through you get to see a lot of really interesting George Orwell level shit. Fitting how Makishima always seems to have a copy of dystopian future books from 1984 to Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
>> ARTICLE
I finished the series a few hours after posting about it
>> ARTICLE
i can not wait for the second season and movie.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still blaming myself for not watching it earlier (currently addicted to it)
>> ARTICLE
What kind of show is it? It looks really interesting, but I'm not quite the fan of shows that rely too much on action. Does it have more to offer than that?
>> ARTICLE
If it means anything to you, it's a Urobuchi show.
>> ARTICLE
I looked it up and found he wrote the script for Madoka. I loved Madoka, so I guess that does mean at least something.

I'm going to finish Uchouten Kazoku first and I'll give at least the first three episodes a try.
>> ARTICLE
Urobuchi's shows always boast strong writing, I'd further mention you consider Fate/Zero if you haven't before, and further praise Psycho Pass. 
>> ARTICLE
It's more mystery-esque driven than action driven. But it's definitely worth a watch when you have spare time, and there's a second season coming soon.
>> ARTICLE
To aru Kagaku no railgun S
On episode 13 and it's so intense I love this world and the characters I never want the anime to end. 

Boku wa tomodachi ga sukunia
One of the most enjoyable anime I have ever watched. On episode  8 right meow
>> ARTICLE
Started watching Fate/Zero and Gurren Lagaan after them sitting on my HDD for ever. Man, they are both a blast. Fate has been especially enjoyable simply because of how gorgeous it is. Definitely makes me glad I have a large tv to watch anime on.

>> ARTICLE
Watched sora no woto and it was great the music direction was phenomenal and the glimpses of the world as shown were highly intriguing. Now started onto Kara no Kyoukai (2/7) and so far it's every pretty and highly enjoyable 
>> ARTICLE
I'm still catching up on shows that finished airing last season.

[Hoozuki no Reitetsu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20431/Hoozuki_no_Reitetsu) - Complete

This was the winter 2014 anime I was the most excited for before the season, looking at promo art and reading descriptions. Then it started airing, and people didn't seem to like it very much. Then it ended up outselling all other anime last season, but the impression I got from others was that it required a ton of cultural knowledge about Japan to "get" it. So when I started watching it last week I didn't expect to like it all that much, since I don't exactly pride myself with having incredible knowledge about Japan. I just watch anime.

It was indeed a very Japanese show, and a lot of the jokes did indeed go straight over my head, and only had some vague recollection of most of the legends the anime joked with. However, I really did enjoy the characters, and the jokes I did get I thought to be for the most part cleverly written. I am almost done with catching up on the winter 2014 anime, and as it stands this is actually one of my favorites

[Mikakunin de Shinkoukei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20541/Mikakunin_de_Shinkoukei) - Complete

Can't say I had much expectations going into this one, and I was pretty much ready to drop it after 3 episodes. But I decided to press on, and was rewarded with a middle part I really enjoyed, before it all kinda fizzled out in some mediocre final episodes. Before starting the anime I was not aware of the supernatural elements, so that came as a nice surprise. I really like the idea of mixing slice of life with supernatural/fantasy, but I also tend to have really high expectations for anime I know have the SoL/supernatural mix, and often end up disappointed. With this show it came as a total surprise, and ended up in my eyes being a nice spice to an otherwise rather mundane anime.

[Gundam Build Fighters](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19319/Gundam_Build_Fighters) - 16/25

All Gundam anime are pretty much just glorified toy commercials, and Gundam Build Fighters takes that aspect to new heights. I'm not 10 years old, and I'm not a exactly a huge fan of the Gundam franchise or a toy geek, yet for some reason I'm still really enjoying Build Fighters. Sunrise has done a really good job with making an anime that appeals to children, hardcore gundam fans, and at the same time roping more people into the fandom.
>> ARTICLE
Started watching Code Geass (10/26). Someone recommended it to me because I liked Guilty Crown and man do the two shows seem similar. Nevertheless, I'm enjoying it so far.
>> ARTICLE
IMO Code Geass goes way further with the greyed out societal ideals and develops a really memorable social/political commentary. It's also extremely fabulous
>> ARTICLE
Guilty Crown stole from Code Geass pretty heavily. If you liked Guilty Crown, you should love Code Geass. Also, FYI there are two seasons of the show. The total episode count is much higher than 26.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Toradora yesterday. Taiga is probably my favorite tsundere character ever. I recently finished Love, Chunibyo and other Delusions and adored that too. Now I am wanting something completely different so I am watching Another. It is amazing so far. 
>> ARTICLE
I finished Madoka and Space Dandy.

Madoka surprised me, I thought it would just ride the Dark Magical Girl thing the whole way, but it was genuinely good. Ending was all right, expected a little more I guess, but it is by no means bad.

Space Dandy was awesome. Totally my thing, such wildly different episodes. A few of them felt like they would be right at home in Cowboy Bebop. A ridiculously fun show, I am looking forward to season 2.
>> ARTICLE
You should definitely watch the 3rd Madoka movie which continues the series and is pretty much a "WTF did I just watch" thing. 
>> ARTICLE
I finished Shiki last week, and am kinda determined to be current on Sword Art Online before season 2 comes out, meaning this was a **Sword Art Online** weekend, complete with three new episode writeups!

[Sword Art Online 10](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/05/29/sword-art-online-episode-10/)

[Sword Art Online 11](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/05/31/sword-art-online-episode-11/)

[Sword Art Online 12](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/06/01/sword-art-online-episode-12/)

It's been an adventure! The confrontation with Kuradeel and the introduction of Yui mark the series' two lowest points so far, but it's actually been quite enjoyable in spite of that, and the writeups are a lot of fun. The conventional wisdom is that the second half is where it "gets bad," so I'm kinda excited to get to that, but I'm already having a good, silly time with this first arc.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say it gets bad, but rather that it gets worse. The first arc of SAO has a lot of strong points, but loses a few of them in the 2nd one. The arc is still good in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I think structurally, the Fairy Dance arc is actually stronger than the first in a lot of ways. It just gets exponentially more ~light novel~ as it goes on. 
>> ARTICLE
That would not surprise me. This first arc's structure is one of its most glaring weaknesses.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Fate/Zero. 
Loved every bit of it! I was a little lost concerning the ending though... 

And I recently started watching Bakemonogatari, it seems very promising! 
>> ARTICLE
The reason you would feel a little lost is because, Like me, you probably didn't know it was a prequel to an already existing anime. Fate/Stay night.

Unless in which case you did know, then I have no idea XD
>> ARTICLE
I finished **Samurai Deeper Kyo** yesterday. The show felt rushed and mediocre. I plan on reading the manga because I heard that the anime cut some stuff out and made it more kid friendly. 

Now I'm watching **Moblie Sut Gundam Wing (5/49)**. So far, so good. My first Gundam series. Seems like a nice place to start.

**Patema Inverted** - 7/10
___

So a few of my friends and I groupwatched this movie yesterday and it was a pretty fun time. The cast is pretty likable, albeit silly. The plot is slightly ridiculous. The comedic timing is infinitely better than most actual comedies I watch. 

The real star of the show is the cinematography. The combination of the gorgeous backgrounds with fantastic shots where they flipped the picture over to see the other point of view was absolutely amazing. I would watch a montage of all those scenes in a heartbeat.

Anyway it was a pretty standard movie. I would show it to even people who aren't fans of anime happily. It's by no means amazing or even great, but it's an enjoyable use of about 2 hours. Kids would probably like it a lot even though the concepts are somewhat more mature than the average kids show or movie.
>> ARTICLE
I actually watched this just 5 minutes ago... I would give it a 9.5/10, but I tend to rate more on how enjoyable it was rather than an objective 'this art was good'/'this story was good'.
>> ARTICLE
**Mononoke 6/10** (12/12) 

This was a big disappointment for me, I loved the art but after the first arc (I suppose the first Bakeneko arc was technically a prequel) the arcs got less interesting and less coherent. Maybe I just don't have the head to follow along with its artsy storytelling but after the end of every arc I only had a general understanding of wtf happened and was left confused.

I would have dropped it around episode 5/6 but the art kept me watching and although it wasn't able to carry the show the fact that it kept me around until the end says a lot. Very colourful.

**Daily lives of highschool boys 6/10** (9/12)

Again this was a disappointment for, I think if an anime wants to get by on 100% comedy then it needs to be *reeeeaally* funny for me to enjoy but the majority of gags in this weren't for me and even the ones I did kind of like weren't very funny. Whats considered funny tends to be very different from person to person though so oh well.

**Gintama 8/10** (113/201)

I'm really enjoying this, a lot of the episodes aren't very funny but at this point I've got really attached to the characters so even when it's not very funny I can still really enjoy it as an episodic series. Some of the other episodes are absolutely hilarious, episode 89 (I think) with the soul of Gintokis sword trying to teach him a special technique because the anime had been running for 2 years was great and a really clever/funny parody of the shounen genre.

What I like the most though are the serious arcs, even the silly ones tend to have a proper underlying story behind the wacky-ness which is great but the ones that get really serious I tend to enjoy the most.

I really hope theres more fights like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijx7Oy1l_0c) (Spoilers maybe)

I think by the time I finish this up it'll be a 9/10.

[I was reading the manga for **Ikoku Meiro no Croise \(Croise in a Foreign Labyrinth\)** when I saw an insert page showing it had an anime.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9938/Ikoku_Meiro_no_Crois%C3%A9e) I promptly dropped everything and started watching it. Currently 4 episodes in!

So, the show's a weird half-breed of historical fiction with little hints of iyashikei moe action. Yes, it is better than that description would imply, especially if your tastes are anything like mine are. This is the story of Yune, a tiny Japanese girl who emigrates to France in the late 1880's and so lives with temperamental Claude and his playboy grandfather Oscar, helping them tend to Claude's failing ironworks business in the less trendy part of Paris. 

The show lacks a lot of the typical anime-isms that seem to characterize so much of modern slice-of-life, being significantly more akin to *Usagi Drop* and *Silver Spoon* than to, say, *GJ-bu* or *Acchi Kocchi.* Character interactions are natural and, most importantly, human ([well,](http://i.imgur.com/lbPh7q8.png) for [the](http://i.imgur.com/io8xiwc.png) most [part.](http://i.imgur.com/k7E5ZeY.png)) While the actual character depth is merely serviceable (I doubt anyone from this show will be memorable), the show does explore the idea of adapting to a changing world, through the eyes of Yune and Claude - there is obviously Yune coming to terms with living in as alien a place as Paris, and Claude trying to keep his father business alive in the face of changing times, where blacksmiths like him are being increasingly shut out and small businesses are being phased out in favor of malls and department stores.

...And before someone asks, [there is no lolicon in this story](http://i.imgur.com/kjtJwBi.jpg). Sorry to burst your bubble, but Claude's relationship with Yune is strictly fatherly.

The art and music direction here are pretty good. I mean, [look](http://i.imgur.com/qP4AT3p.png) [at](http://i.imgur.com/5aoHN4y.png) [these](http://i.imgur.com/K6qehBY.png) [shots](http://i.imgur.com/iolmbUg.png), dammit! In particular, those shots from episode 3 of Yune in the rain really emphasized how foreign she is to Paris, how her bright red umbrella and the click-clack of her geta made her stick out from the drab, murky and silent crowd around her. It's not an original trick, but it's certainly affective. 

I was so impressed with the sound and writing, in fact, that I looked up who the sound guy was. And wouldn't you know it, it's Junichi Sato! In case you don't know him (I'm sure /u/Novasylum does), he's work on:

- Director for *Aria the Animation, the Origination,* and *the Natural*, as well as sound director and writer 

- Director for *Sailor Moon, Sailor Moon R,* and *Sailor Moon S*, as well as occasional storyboarder.

- Director for *Princess Tutu*

- Creator, director, writer for *Tamayura*

That's a pretty impressive resume, and I only listed the most famous stuff he was heavily involved in. And that experience really shows here - *Ikoku Meiro no Croisee* is a lot better than I expected.  

Also still juggling ***Psycho-Pass (06/22)*** and ***xxxHolic Kei (8/13)***; those are my next priority once I finish *Croisee.*

Finished Yugioh Zexal 2. Guilty pleasure.

**Ashita no Joe**, ~50 to 64. I can't say much without spoiling everything, but it's set to be one of my favourite anime. I find it very easy to get invested in the characters, and the pacing is close to perfect.

I think it stands up well visually even compared to anime decades younger, although its strengths lie mainly in layouts. The art itself is dated, but I'm not put off by it. 

The sound is good, too. Tange's voice actor did a fantastic job, and he has some really emotive scenes. Some of the other characters sound a bit too provincial, which is quite jarring after listening to the very manufactured voices of seiyuu today. The OST is used well, and there are several memorable themes for each character. The [ED](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBKB0Ufu7ic) is often used as an insert song, to good effect. 

The only problem I have with it is the presence of the children. A little comic relief is fine, but their voices are so shrill that listening to them is a pain in itself. And they're usually there for just a little longer than I feel necessary, too.

>> ARTICLE
Strike witches, the whole franchise. It was a series I felt was honest and genuinely likeable. It's like a grilled cheese sandwich. Classic recipe, prepared well could also be a masterpiece. No fancy tricks or plot twists. Really a simple down to earth series. But it was executed really nicely.

Lovable memorable characters. Enjoyable pacing. Great atmosphere. Cool setting. Boobs.

The movie was great too. I'd say possibly the best of the series.

Now I'm just eagerly awaiting S3 and the OVA.
>> ARTICLE
**FLCL** 5/6

This show is... interesting. *I think* it is attempting to be some sort of commentary on the introduction of consumerism and consumerist culture. Besides the enormous factory that visually dominates the town, the robot is appliance-like and when asked Naota's father calls it "the tv"/"a walk man". The relationship between Naota and the robot also seems to suggest this. There is an irony in the way that the robot literally consumes Naota to power up, which perhaps is supposed to represent how consumers are consumed themselves by their own desire. Also some of the conversations that Naota has seem to suggest that there is the illusion that Naota is in control when he merges with the robot but in fact the opposite is true and the robot is merely using him. Though... Naota himself doesn't seem to have any particular desire for the robot. In addition, the multitude of other appliances coming out of Naota's head again would seem to suggest that they are the results on industry forcing their way into his life, and yet the large one tries to destroy the factory. So this whole theory is probably completely full of shit and I don't really have any idea what is going on with Mamimi or why the "enemies" all look like hands or basically anything else that is going on in this show. 

Though aside from my infantile attempts to analyze what FLCL is trying to say (if it's trying to say anything at all), the story itself is a bit too bizarre to be engaging on its own. I do have a a soft spot for stylistically unique and interesting things, but this one hasn't really done it for me.

**Clannad** 22/22

Clannad is *just* funny and emotional enough that I would recommend it to others. I hear that After Story is much better and an entirely different animal. So, I'm definitely going to check that out though I would be completely uninterested if it was just more of the same.

       
>> ARTICLE
Hey if you even thought Clannad was bearable, you'll love After Story. Just adding my encouragement for you to watch it, don't stop now!
>> ARTICLE
This is not necessarily true. I liked Clannad, but I couldn't even finish After Story. Nothing that I liked in Clannad was in After Story, and everything that I disliked stayed. Except the parents. The parents were cool. 
>> ARTICLE
After story went up and down a lot for me, I kept thinking something I liked was *about* to happen, but it never did. A lot of people throw it out as the go-to heart-wrenching tear-jerker but I just couldn't get that into it. 

I really liked the OVA with Tomoyo though, that one gut my feels.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same about Clannad, but After Story is really great if you atleast enjoyed Clannad a bit.
>> ARTICLE
After Story is a completely different beast from Clannad, although it does start off the same. You get 12 more episodes of character building before the rails come off and Shit Gets Seriously Real. Yet I'm one of the odd ones around here, as I actually liked Clannad more than I did After Story. I think it's partly because I've been part of... Well, I won't give anything away, but an old therapist of mine laughed a bit more than necessary when I compared my life to being Wile E. Coyote trapped in an anvil factory. I think that Tomoya would have agreed.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped all of the stuff on my backlog and I'm working on what I appear to enjoy most. I couldn't get into Fate/Stay Night at all and I'm hoping that changes with the new anime, so I started Fate/Zero last night. Even the first episode has me far more interested than anything else I could've hoped to like about Stay Night. 
>> ARTICLE
You shouldn't be watching Fate/stay, you should be playing the visual novel if you really want to enjoy it. Most people will tell you the same thing, the anime version is much more inferior than the visual novel, although you might want to know the VN has nsfw material.
>> ARTICLE
**Berserk 25/25**

This show blew my god damn mind. It was great, everything I wanted from it. I wish there was more of the anime, but it introduced me into the universe and made me immediately pick up the manga and start it. 

**Nichijou 26/26** 

Hilarious. This show had me laughing quite a lot. Slice of Life for me is hard to watch, but Nichijou kept me hooked and wanting to see more.

**Monogatari Series: Second Season 1/26**

Don't have much to say about this show as of now. Having Senjou and Hanekawa together will hopefully be fun, and I hope this show holds up.

Just Finished [**Kaiba**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3701/Kaiba).


It was fantastic. The visuals remind kind of remind me of the Ralph Bakshi movie Wizards, and each episode was really well written. It was sad and confusing, but it all started to make sense close to the end and the plot really came together. It was short, enjoyable and the characters were all really interesting. What I liked most about it was the very different character designs. 



One of my few gripes about the show is that I still don't understand some things about it, and if I had the time I'd rewatch it so I can fully understand it or speculate on what was going on.



[**Death Billiards**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14353/Death_Billiards) was also awesome. In 20 minutes, it set up interesting, sympathetic characters and a really unique situation. It's only one episode, go watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Well last week I watched Yozakura Quartet ~Hana no Uta~. It was certainly good, but it ended way too early, and I can't help but feel based on the fact that this was a retelling that it may not get a second season. I could read the Manga, but I'm so lazy. I don't like reading manga because if it does get animated it ruins the anime for me, because I notice all the differences and I already know what's going to happen. 

I also watched Welcome to the NHK a while back and I didn't ever get a chance to talk about it the last couple threads. I'd seen it recommended a few times around here, that it was sort of a motivational anime. But, while I can understand why someone might feel motivated by that, I didn't. The sort of message that I got was "Abandon your dreams because real life's not like that" And that may or may not be solid advice, it's not really motivational, quite the opposite in fact. The main character was really more unlikeable than relatable, but he was also really realistic in some regards, I don't think a lot of shows really nail how anxiety attacks affect people Like Welcome to the NHK did.

Another small gripe I have with it is (And this is the first time I've really been bothered by it, I'm usually quite laid back in this regard) acting. [Finale Spoilers](/s "Misaki's in particular. While she delivered her lines really well in the last scene with the suicide and sobbing and crazy freakout that happened, the very next scene where they were leaving she delivered her lines in the EXACT same cheerful way she had been talking throughout the entire series. ARE YOU NOT AT ALL SHAKEN BY THIS? YOU NEARLY KILLED YOURSELF. AND THEN HE NEARLY KILLED *HIM*SELF. IS THIS AN EVERYDAY THING THAT YOU CAN BRUSH OFF EASILY?") I don't know, I'm kind of exaggerating my frustration from that, but it really just killed my immersion. 

Welcome to the NHK is, unfortunately, not something I can unconditionally recommend.
>> ARTICLE
I hope you watched Yozakura Quartet: Hoshi no Umi, because otherwise you've missed a chunk of the story.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't. D: I'll have to do that then.
>> ARTICLE
After you're done with that, you might give [Kyousou Giga](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_%28TV%29) a try. The style of it is very similar to Yozakura Quartet, but unlike Yozakura Quartet I would classify Kyousougiga as more of an experience rather than anything else. Anyway, give it a try if you ever find time, it's very interesting to say the least.

I've been working on Yozakura Quartet: Hana no Uta this past week, and its been fantastic! Finished ep. 1-9 as of now, and plan to finish the rest by tonight.

**Date A Live OVA (1/1)** 

Okay, this was hilarious. I love this show. On to season 2.

**Code Geass R2 (10/25)** (Watched 6-10 this week)

Definitely digging this more than R1. I'm excited to watch more. Lelouch is crazy at escaping.

**Puella Magi Madoka Magica Movie 1**

This was good, but it cut too much from the series in my opinion. I prefer the series even with it's lesser quality of animation. 

I'm watching so many currently airing shows it's not even funny. I need to work on my backlog more. 

>> ARTICLE
**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!: Ren 12/12**
I really liked the first season, it was funny, it was cute, it actually had character development and it had a satisfying ending.  When I heard there was a second season I was a bit skeptical and I think rightfully so.  The second season was reasonably enjoyable but I felt like there wasn't enough development over all 12 episodes and the ending was extremely unsatisfying.

**Kokoro Connect 17/17**
I was blown away by this show, I got a recommendation since I like romantic slice of life type anime and I was a bit skeptical.  But I think I would rank this one a very close second to Steins;Gate in terms of the best anime I have seen so far.  It might be because I can identify with all of the characters in some aspect, but this show will certainly stay with me.  Its definitely one of those shows that I wish I could just erase my memory of it and watch it over again, just to experience it for the first time again.

**Seitokai Yakuindomo Season 2 5/12**
This is the anime I've been watching to take the edge off the feels from other anime I've been watching.  So far season 2 has been just ok compared to the first one, the visuals seem to have gotten a lot better but it just isn't as laugh out loud funny as the first season to me.

I've really only recently gotten back into anime and I'm always looking for new stuff to watch.  I'm really looking for character driven anime, shows with great characters and character development.  But maybe something with a little less feels than Kokoro Connect, I think I need to watch something a bit more upbeat now.
>> ARTICLE
Re:Chunibyo, makes me glad I dropped Ren two episodes in.  I was completely disappointed that all the development that had happened in season 1 was completely undone.  Rikka and Dekomori are still hopeless chunibyo, and Nibutani is still a conniving bitch... even though they had all grown past that by the last season finale.  Made me feel like my investment isn't worth it.

I don't know if I agree that they had grown past being chunibyo, [Spoiler](/s "part of the ending to to the first season was Yuuta accepting Rikka for who she was and to stop trying to change her.")  And there are some moments in Ren that feel like its the same show as the first season but its a bit of a shadow of the first season.  That being said I still enjoyed it and depending on how much you enjoyed the first season, I would still say its worth finishing if you liked the first season.  But I think its also understandable to not want to finish it because its honestly not nearly as good as the first season.

**Bakemonogatari: Completed**

Started of boring, 4 episodes in and thinking on dropping it, I was not used to Shaft and their ridiculous long dialogues that contribute almost nothing but to fill the character. Then Hachikuji (she actually appeared in episode 3-4) appeared, then Kanbaru and finally Hanekawa which was my least favorite until Monogatari Second Season. Then I realised it was just a collection of stories, with a nice, funny, molester as a main character. Not to mention I still have that Sengoku OP in my head.

**Nisemonogatori: Completed**

The sisters chronicles, I was waiting for the ecchi to come and fill me up. But the highlight of course, would be Kaiki. He just for the first dialogue with Araragi quickly became my favourite character, curse that lovable con-man. 

**Nekomonogatori: Black: Completed**

My least favourite, but I got to know Hanekawa better, but I only could relate with her in the second season. 

**Monogatari Second Season: Completed**

In 2 days, favourite arcs Sengoku arc and the Kaiki arc were my favourites. The first Hanekawa arc was better than I was expecting, [](/s "she got better, maybe it was the hair upgrade and probably the state of her family too and her background"). [](/s "Time travel arc, I'm sorry but doing all that just for homework Araragi, makes me wonder if you ended up by doing the homework.")

Next up the Nadeko Sengoku arc, she got better as a character in my opinion and the end just proved that [](/s "sometimes Araragi himself is not part of the solution but a problem. In the end I related to her simply because of one detail: the complements, listening to the same complement over and over again, starts from being a good thing into a bad thing, that one starts to think if the others look at our other sides and then she flips and that's brilliant.")

Let's skip the next, black void/loli arc, I cried, also a little grossed out by that kiss. 

Kaiki arc, by far my favourite, simply because I liked the character ever since he appeared. Everything is brilliant here, the opening, the monologues, his personality and his view as a con-man, on analysing people and the situation, the complete opposite of the main character in personality and in his ideals, [](/s "in the end, as one was able to save Nadeko the other was able to save Senjouhara, a thing one or the other couldn't do.")

I've lost a lot of precious study time, it was worth it though (not really I'm screwed).

I've used this season to watch a bunch of shows I've had on a waitlist like **Golden Time, Nodame Cantabile, The Devil Is a Part-Timer!, michiko to hatchin, kokoro connect**

For this past week though I've been rewatching **Read or Die the TV**. I had forgotten how fantastic it was.

**Plastic Nee-san**: **COMPLETE**

Honestly, this show is practically unreviewable for me. Not because it was completely awful or anything. Far from it. Instead, it was 24 minutes of excessively hyper animation that went smoothly from craziness to insanity with only enough of a gap to let you catch your breath from laughing so fucking hard.

Rating: **8/10**  
Recommendation level: People with souls  

**Koi Kaze**: **COMPLETE**  

I had a number of problems with this show. Not the incest, because I was ready for it. And I definitely did not have any problems with the girl, as Kohinata Nanoka was absolutely adorable even with her (understandable) brother-complex. I would have wanted to take her home to meet my grandmother if I had known her when I was 15 years old. (My grandmother approved of nobody I knew.) 

(Actually, I take that back. She approved of Christina. The only problem with Christina was that she absolutely did not like boys. At all. Especially not that way. But she didn't want to disappoint either my grandmother or her father or anybody else in the church. So we pretended to date for 4 months until they were satisfied with our progress and then had a long month of nothing but inconsequential and fake fights that led to our eventual "breaking up". Last I heard from her, she is still exceptionally happily married to her wife somewhere in the back-woods of Vermont. As always, names have been changed to protect the guilty.) (By the way, while I'm on the subject of parentheticals, I wonder if anyone actually reads these side comments of mine... It's okay if you don't. I'm used to it. No, really. I'm used to it.) 

Instead, my problems came from all of the men in this anime. Because for a seinen anime, you'd think that the men would be the understandable and happy ones, wouldn't you? But no. Odagiri was just a straight-up perverted asshole who served no purpose, and I always wanted to choke him by the neck until his eyes bugged out. The father was a much older and more weepy version of what I always pictured Okazaki Tomoka turning into when Ushio got older, and there wasn't a scene that went by that I didn't feel the urge to whack him upside the head with a 4x4. 

And then we get to the crown prince of the show... Sekai Koshiro himself. He was a gigantic cunt from start to finish. He was a cunt to his father when Nanoka moved in. He was a cunt to Nanoka until the day he moved out. He was a cunt to Chidori Kaname (who really did want to date Koshiro for real) except for that six-week span when he wasn't near his sister. He was even a cunt to his ex-girlfriend, when she obviously wanted to try the relationship all over again. He was *really* a cunt when he quit his job just so he wouldn't have to run into Kaname again. 

Koshiro was just a man-child who couldn't be honest with himself about anything. I just can't help but to think that, if he just hadn't been such a brooding idiot, he would have had a normal life with a normal family and with a little sister who still worshiped the ground he walked on. And if he could have just been capable of having a normal bone in his body, I might not have loathed him quite so much. 

Honestly, Japan... Can we get an incest fantasy anime where I actually *don't* hate the main character? 

Rating: **6/10**  
Recommendation level: Guys who never had a little sister.

Steins;Gate ep13
Well this is great!
Finding another anime that I can watch is always awesome as this has everything in it, especially time travel something I've been interested in since I was a child.
Pretty awesome stuff so far!

Just finished nisekoi after 3 days. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this series. Will probably read the manga since the the ending felt unfinished. Although there will probably be a second season eventually. I give it solid 8/10.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to warn you right now if you plan to get into the manga, the plot hasn't advanced very far.  There's been a lot of chapters devoted solely to character development, and some of them don't even do anything new for the characters.  They're all a fun read, but if you're expecting to advance really far, you might get a bit frustrated with them.
>> ARTICLE
Well I've only read about 20 chapters after where the anime left off and even though not much has really happened, I don't mind the extra character development. I think it's enjoyable to see the details. I honestly don't care who Ichijo ends up with since I like all of them. XD
>> ARTICLE
Started watching Steins;Gate, I'm about 10 episodes in. So far I can say I love the humor and the characters, and the show overall is really enjoyable, but the last few episodes I watched makes it seem like things are about to get serious. I'm excited :D

EDIT: Kept watching... Can confirm, shit just got real O_O

**Death Note Ep.22**

Still working through it. Yes, surprisingly, I have not watched it yet. Really good.

**Highschool DxD**

Either I felt it was pretty good or I was on a huge downswing of emotions from Code Geass and found the upbeat nature to be more comfortable.  It does feature needless nudity, but there still is a decent amount of plot.

The only not-airing show I've been watching is Haiyore! Nyaruko-san and its second season W, which I started at Anime North last Saturday when they did a screening of the first 3 episodes. I know it's chock-full of references, but unfortunately I don't get a lot of them. I was surprised, though, that they've made a number of references to Western movies in it.

**Strike the Blood** (17-end)  
My guilty-pleasure. I liked it and I know it's not a good anime. If season2 is released I'm going to watch it. Still a bit frustrated, that they got rid of the first OP. (Rating: 7,5/10 prob closer to 8)

**Kara no Kyoukai** (movie 3-epilogue)  
A really good movie series. I started watching it because it was made by ufotable. The best of the movies were 5 (9,5/10) and 7 (9/10). All in all it was highly entertaining. (Rating for complete series: 8,5/10)

Heading into Monogatari: Second Season now and after that probably Nisekoi.

I finally finished Nichijou after starting it a while ago.  I also completed Ano Natsu de Matteru.  I enjoyed watching both of these shows.  Not sure what to watch next, but I am considering Katanagatari or Steins;Gate.

I marathoned 20 episodes of Steins;Gate with my friend after watching the first four 3 weeks ago and I gotta say I loved it. Not my favorite show but it was defiantly a damn good time travel story. I might actually rewatch it my dad sometime since he'd probably like all the science and programming talk and there was still a few scenes I didn't really understand the importance of. But anyways hopefully doing this will make me wanna go play the VN's for Chaos;Head and Robotics;Note (if that ever gets translated) now.

Do movies count? Recently I bought Princess Mononoke as I'm a big fan of Studio Ghibli but haven't seen many of their films yet. It wasn't quite what I expected but I was blown away by how great the art looked. The details were quite sharp for a movie that came out in 1997.

The protagonists were all quite likable characters and the antagonists had that villainy charm, especially Eboshi.

The one thing I'll never get over though is how creepy the Deer God looks. I mean [just looks at this thing!](https://i.imgur.com/iVgudAm.jpg?1) It will never not be creepy.

I recently finished Chobits. It was surprisingly entertaining, funny, and had some emotional moments. Plus the whole Humans and Persocoms falling in love theme was great. **8/10**

For some reason I gutted through two more episodes of **Guilty Crown (13/22)** after a very long hiatus. This is definitely the most unintentionally funny anime I've ever seen. [dumb spoilers](/s "When they explained Guy's past and that him and Shuu were best friends I absolutely lost it. I should've expected a bullshit amnesia plot coming from the gang behind Code Geass. Oh, look, they even threw in some awkward incest stuff. Great job, guys. Even better was the next episode, which conveniently skips the two weeks of fallout and societal ruin that the writers were too incompetent to actually cover. When the wheelchair girl got super legs, completely invalidating most of her struggles with self-worth throughout the episode, I cracked up. The moral of Guilty Crown: as long as you have legs and lasers, you are helpful. If you don't have either, fuck you- go sit in a corner.")

Overall, Guilty Crown is one of the most incompetently written shows I've ever had the (dis)pleasure of watching. Almost none of the characters have consistent personalities, whenever the show is written into an impossible corner a time skip is used to reset everything, and NONE of the villains' motives make any sense. I'll keep watching though, because this train wreck is impossible to tear my eyes from.

I also continued **Uchouten Kazoku (9/13)**. I honestly don't have much to say about this show. It's brilliant, and if you are a fan of anime you should watch it. Watching the struggles of Yasaburo's family runs the whole gauntlet of human emotions. I almost never tear up at shows, but I've held back some tears once or twice so far for this one. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll start questioning whether or not some of your friends are actually Tanuki. Watch this show.

Watching [Prince of Tennis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22/Prince_of_Tennis). (up to 140 now) Glad i finally started watching this series as i am a fan of sports anime but i was scared of the huge number of episodes. But once i start watching they just keep on coming!

Series is really good but it irks me a bit that every single match is just a one-set match and so far it's only been team tennis? When will i get to see solo tourneys? Will i ever?

Also there's a lot of fillers in between matches, some recap episodes and stuff which can be annoying and boring as i much prefer to just see the action and watch the players evolve. That being said they do add to the story and progress of the series so there's that!

**Rinne no Lagrange** Season 1 

As a mecha fan I enjoyed it. It's nice to see a mecha series with a female lead that didn't have blatant fanservice. Ok-ish plot and characters, but I loved the visuals and the music. Not a fan of the mecha design, but the backgrounds, especially the sea and the sky, was just gorgeous.

**Katanagatari 12/12**
I finished this show in around 2 days and it has the most beautiful animation style I've watched so far. I still can't get over the amount of talking but all of it felt natural so it never bored me. Also the character development of Shichika is wonderfully done which adds to the beauty of the show. This show even has one of the best endings I've witnessed in anime; it left me feeling satisfied that I had watched the show to the end. 
>> ARTICLE
**[Brother, Dear Brother](http://myanimelist.net/anime/795/Onii-sama_e...) 31/39**
I don't even know where to begin with this show. It's old and it's odd. It reminds me of mean girls, but darker and with lots of ambiguously and not so ambiguously bisexual characters. Honestly the biggest problem I've had with the show is its odd combination of melodrama combined with very fast reconciliation. It's one thing when a character freaks out like crazy, but to then when they seem to be perfectly at ease the next day, personally I find it invalidates the original angst. I would rather either more serious long lasting consequences or less over exaggerated reactions.

**[You Are Umasou (Movie)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9204/Omae_Umasou_da_na) Completed**
This movie was something I never expected from a children's movie. A violent story about family, and identity in a world where sometimes one's continued existence is contingent on others deaths. I guess I would call it a more nuanced and less tragic take on The Land Before Time. Honestly I was surprised by the quantity and quality of the fight scenes, but I can't complain. That being said the star of the movie was the characterization of the conflicting personality of the protagonist.

I've finally gotten around to starting this show. There's not much to say so far. It's been pretty good, some episodes hit or miss with me, and I'm excited to see where the show will take me as it's one of those legendary shows.

When the sister realizes her brother is dead, I lost it.")

HENNEKO- Most recent started and finished it all today, when I should have been sleeping but it was worth. I'd say 9/10ish. 




My Ordinary Life- Started a while ago and have only reached up to episode 14 but I am enjoying it. 



Photo Kano- Kinda disappointed with how things went after the half way mark making it more of a pick which end you want. Ends up being like 6 episodes instead of the 12 available. Will probably watch the other episodes in between other shows for the sake of finishing the show.





Angel Beats- Finally watched it after having it in queue for months. Was worth the wait and I'm glad how it ended. Will probably watch it again.



Oreshura- Had it in my queue and had trouble deciding so I picked this one. I liked the story and the artwork. Will wait for when more comes eventually. 





Hunter x Hunter- I think I can talk about this because I've only gotten to episode 23 out of 132. I really enjoyed it. Reminds me a bit of Dragonball Z and Yu Yu Hakushou. Will continue watching but probably won't marathon to 132, probably chuncks of episodes. 





I guess thats all I've watched that isn't being shown. Great week in anime watching for me.

Ano Natsu de Matteru 12/12

I just finished this the other night, and my lord this show was awesome. It was one of those shows that I put off watching because I didn't think it looked that appealing but I heard some good things about it. Boy was I wrong when I started watching it... Every episode was always filled with humor, but the humor never got in the way of the story. A lot of times while watching, even several times in one episode, I would find myself saying things like "No way that just happened." and "NO THE EPISODE CAN'T END HERE!". I feel really bad for the people that had to wait every week for the next episode. Often times in a romance anime, particularly one that has any kind of harem qualities to it, the characters are almost never decisive, but I'm glad this anime wasn't one of them. It tied up everything between the characters really well, which I was certainly happy about by the time I finished. Plus, an OVA is coming out this summer that I didn't know about until after I finished, so that was a nice treat for me!

I definitely recommend this anime if anybody has the time for it.

I've been watching Another and Golden time, I finished golden time last week and Im glad that the ending ended up like it should but Im sad that there will probably not be a season two just because other animes are more popular, the light novel and manga didn't stay far ahead of the anime and pretty much closed it up. Another has been some creepy ass stuff from the start but It really hooks you in and honestly I get creeped out if I watch it at night, getting close to finishing it.

**High School DxD**

I started watching for fanservice and stayed for story.  It was strangely addicting, although I felt as if I didn't really need to see the second season, but a friend HIGHLY recommended me to watch it anyways, so I'll see what's up later.


**Nisekoi**

This was something I meant to watch earlier, but didn't really feel like.  I heard a lot of good things about it and I decided to watch.  For the most part I liked it, there were a couple of small things that bothered me, but the story was too captivating and overshadowed them.


**Nekomonogatari: Kuro**

I'm not really sure what to say about this.  It maintained the charm and style from the earlier series and I like it for that, but at the same time I felt like it was a little boring for me this time around.  That being said, I'm still currently watching the Monogatari 2nd Season anyways.


**Tonari no Seki-kun**

I haven't finished this one yet, but it's pretty entertaining.  It's just the right length for me to watch while I eat a sandwich or something.

**Chrome Shelled Regios 24/24**

The best way to describe it would be extremely average. Everything about it was just ok. **7/10**

**Guilty Crown 22/22**

The art and OST were very good. I had a lot of issues with the plot, though. The whole time it was hard to tell who was good and who was bad. The ending was a huge disappointment. I would have much preferred it [had] (/s "Shu and Inori had both died saving everyone else, or both lived.") I felt really unfulfilled [when] (/s "Shu saved everyone and he lost Inori. The main reason he went to fight Gai was to save Inori. He ended up both losing her, and being crippled.") I was quite unsatisfied. **7/10**

I finished [My Bride is a Mermaid (Seto no Hanayome)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2104/Seto_no_Hanayome). It was fantastic! I'd say this is along the lines of Kill la Kill with respect to over-the-top, the only difference being this show is a comedy with some action.

Give it a try! Watch until episodes 7 & 8 (those two are prime episodes imo).

Oh God I haven't done one of these in so long.

So, a while ago I realised I really liked Gainax's style, and decided to try and watch all of their work. Right now I'm watching **Nadia: the Secret of Blue Water.** It's ... interesting. It is very much a kid's show, but it's really good at attention to detail, especially with the machines. It's also based off Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, so take from that what you will.

I started watching Soul Eater. I've been ignoring this for many years but I'm glad that I picked it up. It's worth it. Still on episode 24 though.

**Cowboy Bebop 20/26** 

I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this anime. On one hand, the characters are great - Spike, Jet and Faye especially. The opening and ending are both great.

Only one currently airing show that I'm watching (Hitsugi no Chaika), so I made up my own schedule for the other days complete with corny titles:

*Marathon Monday* (shows longer than ~26 episodes)  
**Legend of the Galactic Heroes: My Conquest Is the Sea of Stars** (1/1) - A prequel movie for the series. I'll admit I wasn't paying attention through the entire thing and it honestly kinda bored me. Was compared to Banner of the Stars but I honestly preferred the latter for the relationship rather than the giant interstellar war. Will move on to either the next movie or main series, I forget what the right order is off the top of my head.

*Top Tuesday* (highest average rating on my to-watch list)  
**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** (0/64) - Okay, haven't started watching it yet, just getting it on the list. Have seen the original FMA but that was years ago so I've forgotten the minutiae and I'm looking forward to it.

*Thursdub* (dubbed shows, can include rewatches of series I've seen subbed)  
**Baccano!** (1/16) - So far I'm more confused than anything. A lot of characters, some of which are connected, some of which are immortal, and a framing device for the story involving a little girl. I like the premise so far, I just need to get deeper into it.

*Feels Friday* (romance/other highly emotional series)  
**ef: A Tale of Memories** (1/12) - Also a little confusing so far, but fewer characters to keep track of. Not a lot to say, other than I'm concerned about the well-being of the girl with the eyepatch at the abandoned train station.
>> ARTICLE
This is me, sneaking [Beck](http://myanimelist.net/anime/57/Beck) into your lineup for Thursdub. There are a bare handful of shows out there that I absolutely recommend the dub over the sub, and I count Beck as being the best of them. Yes, even better than Cowboy Bebop.

**Toradora** - 25/25 - 7/10

Despite its acclaim as one of the best anime romcoms, I didn't find it to be too great. The lead got pretty boring, Taiga and Kitamura seemed pretty unrealistlic as people, and the ending was over-dramatic, feeling like it came out of nowhere (and best girl Ami got nothing). Some charming moments and nontypical characters though so it wasn't ever boring.

**White Album 2** - 6/13

Really enjoying the direct confrontation of problems and intelligent banter. The lead seems less unique than I had hoped, but I think i can feel the feels coming.

**Shinsekai yori** - 15/25

I heard the first half was slow, but I did not find it uninteresting at all. The world building is very interesting and I love how you get the same feeling the children have about the truth: ominous.
>> ARTICLE
**Canaan** (13/13) I'm a bit torn about this one. On the one hand, it has all the pieces necessary for being a solid show - decent animation, character development, a strong splash of action and forward momentum in every episode and a plot that more or less makes sense (on an anime scale, anyway).  I still don't quite get some of the character motivations (why the heck did that kid decide to get himself shot by Canaan in episode 3 or so, besides the meta-narrative purpose of driving a wedge between the two protagonists?) and some of the acting got *very* hammed up at points, but overall it's an *okay* series. Not great, just okay. It just seems to be missing that...spark. 

**Aiura** and **Mangirl!** (12/12, 13/13). Two short series of very short episodes (3-4 minutes apiece). Both are slice-of-life comedies following groups of girls. I probably preferred Aiura out of the two - standalone comedy suits the ultrashort format a lot better than the serial storyline of Mangirl! did. Still, both provided pretty much exactly what I wanted them to: calorie-light fodder to watch while waiting a few minutes for the bus.

Finished Kill la Kill and Psycho Pass. 

Kill la Kill was very entertaining, though it dragged on a bit through the start/middle. The last 9 episodes were great and felt very much like TTGL in terms of the hype and energy, which I loved. Objectively it might not be as good as something like Fate/Zero, but I enjoyed watching Kill la Kill more for the pure entertainment value. The soundtrack was pretty good, especially the female character themes, though some were unnecessarily used or over used at times (Don't lose your waaaay). I think your enjoyment of this series really depends on how you view Mako + her family, and their comic relief.

Psycho Pass was a great series. Solid characters and character development, including a great villain. He was smart, had a plan, had a point, was a good fighter, and was bat-shit insane. Loved the action (the dominator was bad ass). The show had a cool cyber punk setting, and their society, along with it's implications, was quite an interesting one to think about. I loved the dark feel of the show, and the end of every episode just made me want to watch more. Can't wait for season 2.

**Hyouka 7/22**

Visuals are pretty damn good, animations are superb, Sasuga KyoAni. Not a big fan of how every character drawn by them looks so similiar though. Sometimes I cannot tell the difference between Togashi and Houtarou. I have heard this is one of KyoAni`s last good anime before the Moe take-over. It has not topped Chuunibyou nor Haruhi for me and I am not really that impressed with the storyline. I really like how the MC is the combo of the VAs of Tomoya and that Sunohara. I am hoping that they actually keep Satoshi as a MC as opposed to what happened to Sunohara and that guy from Chuunibyou. I am a pretty big fan of the contrast of shadows KyoAni used. Probably an 7.3/10 for me atm. That episode with the `Hyouka` revelation was pretty well done. If the series continue on to have something like that the score easily rises to 8 and maybe even 9. 

**Spirited Away (Completed)**

Never been a big fan of anime movies. Only ones I really enjoyed were the Evangelion ones, and if you manage to top that, you probably belong someplace special. I have always heard the hype behind Miyazaki films. I saw **From Up on Poppy Hill** the other week and was surprised by how well it was done. Granted I watched it in english dub, in a room full of idiots who talked about other subjects, and in 2 separate sessions so my score of it would probably be a bit deflated. Nevertheless, Spirited Away did not meet my expectations. I loved the MC ; a heroine is always a nice change of pace, and even better when she is capable of actually doing things. The use of Ghibli magic to make almost everyone fall for her, in a non romantic sense, is a bit unnerving but fun to watch. I was not a fan of how quickly the main conflict was solved, and wished it had taken up more than like 1/6 of the movie. The Hollow-like no face entity was pretty hilarious to watch. Whoever VA-d him deserves a medal. I am honestly gonna expect more out of Princess Mononoke, the Moving castle one, and GoTFF. Still enjoyable to watch albeit not my type of show. 6.5/10 
>> ARTICLE
I found Spirited Away to be more of a visual experience than narrative, some people take to it and others don't, but if you like heroines Ghibli is a great place to look. Nausicaa is my personal favorite.

^(I also watched a few hentais.)
>> ARTICLE
*The Tatami Galaxy* is a pretty slow burn, but it explodes into some fireworks towards the end (literally *and* metaphorically.) That's not to say that the earlier episodes are bad - they're pretty fuckin' quality. But the last three episodes elevate the series overall. I think you're in for a good time.

It's a pretty good show. It took around six episodes to grow on me, but once I got into it I really enjoyed it.

>> ARTICLE
It was definitely a good watch. Nothing too crazy and very entertaining.
>> ARTICLE
Finished watching Psycho-Pass, and watched the first episode of Evangelion.

Psycho-Pass really deserved the hype it gets on this sub. I hadn't picked it up yet because I really don't care for crime/detective shows. I ended up watching the gorier bits through my fingers. Nasty stuff. Overall, the series was depressing, disturbing, and hopeful all at the same time. IMO, it had a really satisfying ending.

I'm picking up Evangelion now because it was recommended. I haven't had it spoiled aside from hearing that it's 'mind-rapey.' It still looks a bit cheesy, but I'm only at the very beginning of the series. One thing that's noticeable from the one episode that I've seen is that when the protagonist is asked to save the day, instead of going "Hell yeah!" and jumping at the chance like the characters in Gurren Laggan (the only other Mecha I've seen), he freaks out like any normal person would. That's just a thought though. 
>> ARTICLE
2 things to keep in mind watching NGE:

1) It's an old and "original" series. Elements that seem cheesy are often one of the first implementations of the trope (such as Rei's character).

2) You're right about Shinji's attitude; the rest of the cast will be examined through the lens of "what real life circumstances would need to exist for X character to behave like Y?" It will help you dislike them less (or maybe even like them more).

I watched a crapton of anime this week, so theres a lot here, I'm only going to talk a little about each one so this isn't too long. Just be wary that my comments have vague spoilers, but nothing explicit.

**RahXephon** *Completed 26/26*

Took me *six entire months* to watch this from start to finish. The first 20 episodes were really taxing to get through, the mystery wasn't compelling and the plot was lacklustre because of the degree of obfuscation they covered it with. The only thing that kept me going was the characters, and I wasn't impressed by most of them, just a select few.

That said, the series clicked for me around episode 20 and then I marathoned the rest this week, I do have to say it had a very satisfying ending and in the end it was a worthwhile watch. 

**Spirited Away** *Completed*

First time ever going into Ghibli movies!! This was the first one I chose and it was a good choice. I loved it, the visuals were amazing, the animation fantastic and the art super detailed, which I suppose is something to now expect from all Ghibli movies. I can parse quite a lot of the surface allegory going on in this one but I'll need to think it over to analyse more. I wasn't so fond of the quick resolution of an ending but I can see what they were going for.

**Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa** *Completed*

Second Ghibli film. I loved this *so freaking much,* possibly even more than Spirited Away. I can't even put into words the emotions and sense of awe and scale I had while watching this, nor can I do it justice with my feeble comments. This is a must watch for anyone.

**Ga-Rei: Zero** *Watching 4/12*

I've heard people saying how good the first episode or two of this series is. To be absolutely honest I thought it was terrible 3edgy5me bullshit because none of the conflict had any weight since the characters were all props which were created in order to be killed within the span of one episode, nor was the action particularly interesting to look at either. I was almost about to drop the series there, but episodes 3 and 4 redeemed it in a really strong way, going back to the origin and how the two girls met. Lot of solid drama and the building of an endearing relationship going on here, pity that because of ep 1 and 2 we already know what terrible things are about to happen and ruin everything.

**Hanasaku Iroha: Home Sweet Home** *Completed*

Watched HanaIro while it was airing, so this movie was a good refresher to get to know all the characters again. I must say I absolutely loved getting to see Satsuki's backstory and her rebellious teenage phase, it was relatable and understandable and pretty grounded in reality. I was less fond of the actual conflict engineered in the present-day scenes, it felt slightly on the melodrama side of things. Still, Ohana getting to learn about her mother was brilliant, I probably would have enjoyed this more if the series was still fresh in my mind, I had trouble remembering everyone, its been like 3 years.

**Hayate no Gotoku! Heaven Is a Place on Earth** *Completed*

The second season of Hayate came out in 2009 and I didn't watch any more of the series til the terrible 3rd and 4th seasons in late 2012/early 2013 which were handled by manglobe rather than JCStaff or SynergySP. This movie was actually the first Hayate entry done by manglobe, and it wasn't so bad, so I can't really say "manglobe are what ruined Hayate". 

It's just that I guess I have just become disenchanted with the franchise over the years, I loved the first two seasons, but I really hate the attitude the anime has with skipping the interesting arcs of the manga to get to more of the tame slice of life stuff and then pretty much outright telling the viewer to 'go read the manga'.

**Fullmetal Alchemist** *Watching 6/51*

Have already seen Brotherhood, going back to this in order to watch all the major Bones shows from 00's. RahXephon down, this and Eureka Seven next. I'm liking it so far and not much other than to say other than that the pacing is slower and theres a bit more "filler", which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

**Love Live! School Idol Project** *Watching 3/13*

This is the best thing ever. Words cannot describe.

**Space Dandy** *Completed 13/13*

Finished the first season in time for season 2. Consistently meh apart from a select few episodes, the 13th episode was really good though.

**Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei** *Completed 13/13*

I've been slowly watching this over time. I must say that I still enjoy the series but this season was not as consistently funny as the first, while also lacking the character introductions every episode which gave the first season a lot more structure and sense of progression. The visuals are even more experimental this time, and theres some sketches that are even better than season one, such as the Commodre Perry one and the detective one.
>> ARTICLE
It sucks that you watched Brotherhood first, because the first Fullmetal gives a lot more background on characters that Brotherhood, seems to just skim over.

The anime original ending (that completes its self with "Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa") is well worth watching the whole series despite having watched brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm liking it so far and not much other than to say other than that the pacing is slower and theres a bit more "filler", which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

You are entirely correct. The first FMA was slower paced, fleshed out the character interactions more, and then... ran out of source material and started making shit up. That's when it comes off the rails a bit, but until then, it's not bad at all and compares favourably to Brotherhood. 
>> ARTICLE
>pity that because of ep 1 and 2 we already know what terrible things are about to happen and ruin everything.

Considering Ga-Rei: Zero was released as a prequel to an ongoing manga and aimed at fans of said material which was quite popular, many if not most people watching it at the time in Japan were already aware of it.

I really need to read Nausicaa, own it in the 4 volume release.
>> ARTICLE
>Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa

Funny you should mention that, as it has now been exactly one week since I saw that movie. I started a Ghibli "club" with a few friends with the goal of going through the most notable films(today was Laputa). And yeah, I agree, I loved Nausicaa. I've seen a number of anime movies, but Nausicaa is one of the very few that actually feel like proper films. It's just great.

>Love Live! School Idol Project

This was one of the first shows that I watched while it was airing, and at the time I liked it very much. It's very, very formulaic, but if I had to pick the most fun show to start waifu wars or shipping contests over, it's this one. 

Oh, that reminds me, I probably need to finish S2 soon. I'm a few episodes behind on that.
>> ARTICLE
>**Ga-Rei: Zero** *Watching 4/12*

>I've heard people saying how good the first episode or two of this series is.

Strange...I love Ga-Rei: Zero and tend to pay attention anytime it's mentioned, but I don't recall seeing people describing the first episode as exceptionally good or anything. I've definitely seen it described as "shocking" or "wtf" or things along those lines, and I agree with those descriptions. It's certainly a memorable and interesting way to start a series though. First episode aside, how Ga-Rei: Zero ends is the most memorable part of it and IMO is much more impactful if you're not familar with it's sequel manga, Ga-Rei, before watching the anime. Hope you enjoy it!

>**RahXephon** *Completed 26/26*

>Took me six entire months to watch this from start to finish.

As someone that loved Evangelion, did Rahxephon's many similarities to Evangelion bother you at all? Did you ever check out the [comparison site](http://evaxephon.com/ComparisonGallery/gallery1.html) made by a fan of both series? 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I have heard people talking about Ga-Rei: Zero on twitter so thats about it. I didn't pay too close attention to avoid being spoiled, but those episodes seemed positively received.

In the case of RahXephon, its true that the show is clearly Post-Evangelion, however this wasn't a problem so much for me after maybe one or two episodes. My problems were mostly with much of the series taking such a formulaic monster-of-the-week structure that seemingly had no end in sight. (Evangelion did this too, but there was a sense of buildup due to the angel numbering and the execution was better imo). I'll check out that comparison site since theres probably even more similarities I missed.

> Nausicaa

By far my favorite and most watched. Princess Mononoke is damn close though and would definitely recommend as your next Ghibli.

> Love Live

Internet High Five. Just finished S1.

Yeah, and Love Live is brilliant. Those first three episodes actually had quite an impact on me, which wasn't expected at all from this series.

Nausicaa is easily my favorite Ghibli film. You should read the manga that Miyazaki wrote, the movie only covers maybe 1/5th of the whole story and it's amazing.

Just watched it last week! 

Was a very interesting show that had a nice balance of characterization and economics. I will admit that sometimes a lot of the stuff flew over my head because of how fast it can move at times, but what made it interesting was how they integrated economics with character development. They weren't completely different elements of the show and they did a good job of constantly trying to integrate the two. I also just realized that the times where I wasn't interested was when they were talking about economics for the sake of economics. I needed a reason to *care* about these things. 

A good example of this would be in the second season where [](/s "they started to talk about supply and demand. Okay cool, supply and demand but this isn't interesting me. Oh, but wait, This is an important detail because it has to do with how Lawrence has to try to get back Horo from that other guy! Got it, now you have my interest.")

I personally felt the first couple of episodes of the first season were just really slow. I will admit I was having some difficulty getting into it. When they got to the second arc with the armor though, that's when I got hooked. I really preferred the second season to the first as they had some really tense situations and did a good deal really honing their relationship.

Too bad there is no third season. Was going to be the one that could have wrapped up the story nicely :(.
>> ARTICLE
I see nothing but praise for this show here, does it live up to the hype? I'll probably check it out eventually but I'm curious how good it actually is.
>> ARTICLE
If you like a good,easy paced story set in medieval times then this is definitely the show for you (you will have to use your head a lot though because economics is an important element of this show) 
The show is excellently written with very witty dialogue that you would normally expect from a Shakespeare play.

>> ARTICLE
I guess it depends. I know people who love it and people who don't much care for it, both for the same reason, that being the characters. It's an extremely character driven show, so if you don't fall in love with both of the main characters then you probably won't like the show. On the other hand, if you fall for the two of them then you'll either be buying the novels after you finish the anime or suffering from severe depression as the anime doesn't finish the story. The plots are really just excuses to get these two characters to keep talking and travelling with one another : P I don't even like romance, but it's my personal favourite. 
>> ARTICLE
I had to read the novels after I finished the anime. Well worth it. I'd recommend checking them out if you're eager to know how the story ends.

**Princess Tutu 10/26**

This is surprisingly interesting so far, I've been thinking of getting into shoujo since I've seen very little of it. This is definitely the most girly show I've seen but it's nice to watch something that wouldn't normally appeal to me for a change. So far the characters seem pretty interesting and multi dimensional but it's difficult for me to take seriously sometimes when they have ballet dance offs with sad piano music playing. It seems like it may or may not take a darker turn with the forshadowing of Fakirs death. Just as a side note, I was thinking of trying revolutionary girl Utena after this, I don't hear about it much but it seems to be pretty well liked, whats the general consensus on it?

**Seirei no Moribito 3/26**

I've been getting sick of anime tropes so I've been looking for things that don't really *feel* like anime (same reason I started Princess Tutu) and so far this seems like exactly what I was looking for. The main character is well above the age of 20 which is very unusual and so far it seems to generally reject silly tropes. After watching Saraiya Goyou a week ago I've been very lucky to find another very nice historical seinen to watch, looking forward to seeing where it goes.
>> ARTICLE
Seirei no Moribito is pretty amazing, I loved it.

It turns into a slice of life show a little ways through, but picks up on the action towards the end. Not to say that the slice of life is bad, it's excellent actually. It's really important to build up the characters so you actually care for them and they do a pretty solid job of it IMO.
>> ARTICLE
According to MAL, Princess Tutu is 38 episodes. I just went to check though, and I can only find 26 episodes out there. I was planning to watch this soon, does anyone know if there's more?
>> ARTICLE
That has something to do with how it aired on television, MAL also says its 16 minutes per episode I'm not sure on exactly why but it's normal episode length and 26 episodes long if you're watching it normally. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, strange, but the math checks out (38 16-minute episodes is approximately equivalent to 26 23-minute episodes). Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
**Mawaru Penguindrum**

Just finished the first episode and it was pretty fucking good. Only reason I picked it up was because the name was cool.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, same here. The name caught my attention at first but then I read the reviews and went in expecting something awesome. Into 14 episode right now and still waiting for awesome. It's kind of... weird. Maybe it's just me but it feels like the whole show is in codes and riddles and rather than just enjoying the show, I need to figure the meaning behind everything and it just makes my brain hurt. Right now, I'm just forcing myself to continue because I want to see why so many people liked it.
>> ARTICLE
Penguindrum is a good show because it doesn't spoonfeed you everything, but there is still a lot going on , and everything in it does have meaning and a purpose. This is because it was made by Kunikiko Ikuhara, who is also responsible for Revolutionary Girl Utena, which is similar in this aspect. 

I really hope he keeps making Anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching this the last couple days and am on episode 13. It continues to remain pretty fucking good. The little blue penguins continue to be hilarious and adorable, while the story actually gets pretty dark and takes some twisted turns.
>> ARTICLE
i loved that show the entire way through, but i honestly feel like it gets better as it goes on, all the way up until the end. that show is quite a ride
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari 6/12**  
I have been putting this show off for a while and so far I love the art and the dialogue in the show. There isn't as many fight scenes as I thought, but the ones that do happen after pretty good. I do think the MC is a bit overpowered. The idea of the insect, animal and bird squad for the Maniwani ninja corps is pretty interesting as well, [](/s "but even with their ninpos they don't seem to do much other than die in 1 second after a fight starts."). Togame's Cheerio punch is also super cute. Looking forward to the [](/s "fight against his sister the next episode since apparently she is stupidly strong").

**Aquarion Evol 7/26**  
I'm not much of a mecha guy, and this show didn't really change that so far. To be honest the romance in it is pretty cheesy and needs to be toned down a bit. The only thing I really like about the show so far is the [opening song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YrxlNFJCTE). I don't know if I will continue this or not. 
>> ARTICLE
 [I want to put something into perspective for you,](/s "the insect squad weren't weak, not at all. Nanami is literally strong.")

Also enjoy the rest of the series, the final episode of Katanagatari is so damn good.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, watching Aquarion Evol before the prequel? It's not really necessary, although you might appreciate the story a bit more. The style is more of an old-school mecha anime with monster of the week, which might not be up your alley. The [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95DAk5P_6Rg) for Sousei no Aquarion is fantastic though.
>> ARTICLE
I started The Tatami Galaxy a few days ago. Four episodes in and I'm really impressed with the format of the story and the art style. Very refreshing.

Finished Shinsekai Yori today. I don't know if I unintentionally spoiled myself at some point in the past or if I'm a clairvoyant, but for some reason I had a feeling early on that  [Very Major Spoiler](/s "the monster rats used to be humans"), so that reveal had a slightly lessened impact on me. Nonetheless, it was an excellent and enthralling show. Probably one of the most engaging examples of world-building I can think of, and the progression of events from beginning to end was so satisfying.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, you're not alone on the Shin Sekai Yori boat. The foreshadowing was great, but it did allow for the viewer to guess [spoiler](/s "the secret of the queerats fairly easily") Still a great show and great ending.
>> ARTICLE
I finished **Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex**. Overall it was a pretty great show. The Stand Alone filler episodes were, for the most part, pretty horrendous. The organ thieves episode, the assassin that uses money to kill people, that awful episode where the guy falls in love with an android, etc. The only Stand Alone episodes I can remember enjoying were the bank one where the chief is a badass and the African druglord one. Luckily, the Complex episodes more than made up for the terrible filler. That six episode streak at the end had my eyes glued to the screen, and the conclusion was excellent. I'm definitely looking forward to starting 2nd Gig. I recommend this show if you're looking for a well-written sci fi detective story that doesn't hold your hand and you have a decent stomach for tolerating filler (think Cowboy Bebop levels of filler, except it's not actually good like Bebop). As an added bonus, the dub was incredibly good- no need to watch the sub for this one.

As an aside, is it ever explained in the movies or something why the Major looks so slutty? It was one of the only things in the show that really bothered me. It just felt like incredibly forced fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
Usually I don't get to partake in these, but my girlfriend and I finally finished the Alfheim arc of SAO in preparation for the upcoming season. We watched the first arc way back in 2012 when the show aired, but we just kind of fell out of it and *never* finished until just now.

I'm really glad we did though. I wasn't a fan of Asuna's character change or how completely rapey and disturbing it got, but I did enjoy the arc overall. I may have had my opinion colored by just enjoying the setting/characters of SAO again after two years, though.

>> ARTICLE
**Ima, soko ni Iru Boku (Now and Then, Here and There) (13/13 finished)** - Last week I had only seen one episode of this, but I was already digging it. Well, after that, it only got better. This show turned into one of the best post-apocalypse stories I've seen to date, and not just in anime. The world-building is done in a very "show, don't tell" kind of way, and while there is exposition, it's not overused. Characters rarely explain their thoughts in detail. Basically, the show dodges all of the stuff that annoys me about more recent story-driven shows. The reason for this is probably that the show is 15 years old, but this also has it drawbacks. Namely, the main character is the most generic run-of-the-mill cookie-cutter hero I've ever seen. However, as this is not that common anymore(nowadays characters are more self-aware and gloomy), it didn't bother me that much. All in all, a very enjoyable show from a time when anime was done in a slightly different way.

**Aoi Hana (Sweet Blue Flowers) (8/11)** - Another show based on a manga by Takako Shimura, the author of Hourou Musuko(the show I gushed about last week). This show, however, is about girls' love instead of complex gender identities. Aoi Hana doesn't sport a cast of characters as amazingly mature as the one of Hourou Musuko, but that might be a strength. However, it's not exceptionally novel in other ways either. It's occasionally very shoujo in its characters and their interactions: The main character is a shy girl and then there's the tall short-haired girl whom everyone is attracted to. There is a slight divergence in that there is a second main character who seems very out of place, though. And that serves to keep things interesting. In addition, the show alludes to classical works of literature in some interesting ways and it looks extremely nice(some of JC Staff's best work in my opinion). Worthwhile show for anyone who likes yuri.

**Kino no Tabi (Kino's Journey) (13/13 finished)** - I watched all of this, sans the "movies", in a single day. That's how good it was. Kino's Journey is a journey in several ways. First of all, it's literal. The story revolves around Kino and her travels in an episodic way. Every episode is a different story with the same main character. Secondly, the show is a journey into philosophy, as every episode usually has a theme of some sort. They're not fables, however, because there are no messages, per se. Every episode just sort of explores an idea and then invites the viewer to think about it, as Kino is not one to give many answers. The best example of this is probably the subtitle of the show, "The Beautiful World", in the sentence "The world is not beautiful; therefore, it is" shown at the beginning of one of the early episodes. Thirdly, this episode was a journey for me as a viewer, because I could never guess where the show was taking me. The first few episodes are some of my favourite episodes in all of anime, and the later episodes were even better. Hell, I had to revise my scoring system for anime just to make sure that Kino's Journey has its deserved spot near the very top. Excellent, excellent show. And even when you forget about the story and philosophy, the show has occasionally beautiful art and very nice music.

**Natsume Yuujinchou (Natsume's Book of Friends) (13/13 finished)** - A show based on a fantasy shoujo manga. Sounds interesting, doesn't it? Yes, yes it is. It's not quite as amazing as the other shows I watched this week, but it was very enjoyable. With Hiroshi Kamiya voicing the lead character, what could go wrong? Not much, but his character is not the most intriguing either. Despite this being based on a shoujo manga, Natsume is pretty much a regular main character: clumsy and mostly powerless. Luckily, his sidekick, Nyanko-sensei(whose real name is Madara), is hilarious. Also, because he's a powerful youkai, he usually saves Natsume's ass from danger. And that brings us to the story. The story of this show revolves around the fact that Natsume can see youkai, who are usually invisible to human beings. The youkai cause problems for each other as well as humans, and it's Natsume's job to take care of these problems. Not a terribly innovative premise, but the show does have some very good aspects. Most importantly for me, the youkai designs are surprisingly varied and nice-looking. Some look like humans(usually wearing masks or other odd ornaments on their faces), others look like animals. There's the big and furry bear-like Santo(and his friend, the catfish Mikuri), the humongous horse-faced Misuzu and the beautiful Hinoe. The story is mostly episodic when it comes to the youkai(most are not recurring characters), but Natsume also has human friends and classmates, who are mostly recurring characters. In this way, the show is not really about the youkai, it's about Natsume's friendship with these people and with his de facto adoptive family. 

All in all, this show is fairly standard as far as stories go. However, it gets some extra flavour from its non-romance shoujo nature, which means that there is more emphasis on bromance than romance, not to even mention the appearance of handsome older men who seduce Natsume. As creepy as this may sound at a glance, it's not that different from shows aimed at males(just with some gender reversals), it's mostly just hilarious. I recommend this show to basically everyone who likes slice of life and comedy. It's very non-offensive in most ways.

**Little Princess Sara 29-46 (Finished):** Top tier, in my eyes. There isn't much I can fault it for.

I have to commend the quality of the writing. I'm fairly sure absolutely nothing goes unresolved, and every single character, location, plot point, or story mentioned gets later used for something relatively important. All I can think of to describe the style is a russian doll, where layers are successively removed until there's nothing left. And then it gets built back up again, piece by piece. Some of the things that were mentioned earliest in the story came back right at the end (like selling matchsticks, for instance).

9/10 - cheesy ending brought it down a notch, but I was close to tears for most of the series. It has the [raisin game](http://a.pomf.se/ahnssq.webm), too.

**Ie Naki Ko 7-10:** Visually, still impressive. Compared to Sara though, it feels a lot more childish. Even though Remi and Sara start the same age (7), Sara is a lot more mature. Remi seems to be slowly growing each episode, but Sara peaked within the first cour or so.

I guess it'll be somewhat interesting to see where it goes, but I'm not hooked on it yet. 

**Jewelpet Happiness 2-18:** It actually feels like I'm watching Milky Holmes all over again. It's great, but so far nothing has beaten the sports day episode. [Megumi Han is perfect.](http://a.pomf.se/soymtq.webm)

I started watching the Monotagari series this past week. Before I began watching the show I had no idea what it was about. I thought it was a slice of life, light hearted type of show. I was wrong haha.

 The stories, different OP's and ED's, characters, animation, and writing had all my attention. I was entertained in every aspect and enjoyed what it offered. I have now just finished Nesimonotagri (famous toothbrush scene lololololol) and I am about to watch Nekomonotagari. I am really pumped for the new season coming up with Kanbaru!!! I highly recommend watching this show!!

So far 8.5/10

I completely agree. I loved the show up until the last few episodes where it felt like there wasn't enough material so the pacing slowed to hot tar on a slightly slanted sidewalk. Personally though, I did like the end, although, I've heard other opinions.

**Boku no Pico (69/3)**
>> ARTICLE
[**Aoi Bungaku**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7193) 6/12 - Quite interesting and psychedelic. Madhouse presentations and production values hold strong. This is essentially literature service, they're showing the feel of the books, not adapting them. So the material is just too cramped, making it abstract and hard to follow, there's just a certain disconnect  between the viewer and the story, so you need to interpret everything while watching and make assumptions. And without background details about Japan's state in the WW2 era, it's made even harder.

The characters are basic, and then were thrown into their psyche without us really knowing them, instead we need to pull out our own hardships and insert them into our viewing experience for it to be effective, I'm too young for this.

An incredibly well produced presentation on the literature pieces nonetheless. Just... read the books.
>> ARTICLE
After watching this I went to a local bookstore and had them order me the translated version of Osamu Dazai's 'No Longer Human'. It's been several years since I read it, but I ended up writing an essay on the book in my senior year. It was an amazing book.

Are you watching the [original Yozakura Quartet](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4548/Yozakura_Quartet) or the remake, [Hana no Uta?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18497/Yozakura_Quartet:_Hana_no_Uta)
>> ARTICLE
The original. I haven't even watched the OVA's yet. I just found out there was another season/series with the same characters and everything I can't wait to watch it.

Wait. It's a remake?? 
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend you watch the remake instead of the original Yozakura Quartet. They cover almost exactly the same material to a point, then I think the original does some "anime-only" adaptations. The the only major differences before then being the first few episodes of the original gives a little more backstory than the remake. The remake has far better animation, character designs, and pacing than the original. 
>> ARTICLE
Really? I really liked the first one a lot. It wasn't the best, but I liked it. I will definitely give it a watch though thanks.

Stens;Gate - Finished 

That show was just incredible, wow

Kokoro Connect - Still have the last 4 episodes (Michi Random) but really enjoyed it, I love character driven shows and thought all the characters were interesting

The Haruhi Movie - That is probably one of the best FILMS I've ever seen, not anime movies, just films. I would highly recommend watching the Haruhi Series, if not because its a great series, then just so you can watch the movie
>> ARTICLE
If you want my advice, don't watch Michi Random. Unless you like seething in rage after watching one of the most lovable characters turn into a complete bitch. I guess it depends on which girl you root for but both Inaba and Iori's characters take a whole 180 turn in personality.

The theme this week seemed to be monster of the week. 


**Digimon Tamers** (16-24/51)
Episodes 22 and 23 were great. And Impmon has this tragic tsundere thing going for him right now that makes him the best. I feel for him. They've had all these elements sitting around since the first couple of episodes, now it's time to put them together as they embark into the Digital World. Having characters go on a journey into the unknown is one of my favorite things in fiction. We're going to start a true adventure now. 


**Sailor Moon** (1-11/46)
Picking up a classic. I've only seen a couple episodes on Toonami back in the day, and I only remember that it was Sailor Moon, nothing else. I didn't hate the beginning episodes, but I would be lying if I said they're as enjoyable as the ones after introducing the other soldiers. Mercury's introduction episode is just so different from everything previous. Because she's going to be a lasting character, they actually took time to give her more than one personality trait. I could really feel myself dozing a bit in the early episodes. It was at [this moment](http://a.pomf.se/onjnaj.webm) (nothing too spoilery, just a moment of one character's face) when I knew that this show could get a whole lot better. [Spoiler probably](/s "She made a friend and was supposed to be enjoying first time playing a videogame, but when the game doesn't prove to be challenging, her smile fades. I don't know whether that means she's sad because she thinks her new friend won't like her for being better than her, or that she can't get satisfaction out of the ordinary and the mundane. I mean, she's a genius so maybe she's lost friends the same way in the past, or if the other point is what that expressions is getting at, then maybe being an ally of justice is the kind of life altering experience that will allow her to come into her full potential. OR maybe she was just in the zone. Who knows?") Anyway, it's a level of character depth that hasn't been shown for over half-a-dozen episodes on any character other than Moon. It really piqued my interest in the show. 


Then Mars comes onto the scene as a stricter, haughtier, and just as shallow version of Usagi. Her and Usagi have great banter. It's like two people who each can't accept the other's way of doing things even though they both have the same goal in mind. 


The show keeps getting better with each new soldier, so I'm really looking forward to when the whole cast is assembled. 


**Star Driver** (1-26/26)
I blew through this. I think this show might be in love with itself. It seems like half the things in the show are there just because someone wanted them to be there. Being fabulous for fabulous's sake. And it was great! All the characters were lively and interesting, and I'm a total sucker for any reason to show more mechs ([and did you see that ED animation daaaang](http://a.pomf.se/yacjqh.webm)), which were designed as fabulously and eccentrically as the characters and their personalities. Once I knew this show wasn't going to slow down and was going to continue to get more ridiculous is when I really started to enjoy it. It may have used the same footage over and over again every episode, but at least it was high budget. I love [this smirk](http://i.imgur.com/JHXAiOT.jpg), [so many smirks](http://i.imgur.com/cPrRvVX.jpg), and [this pose](http://i.imgur.com/xe87mdM.jpg), [so many poses](http://i.imgur.com/tSV3Eql.jpg)!

I finally crossed a milestone this past week, with my 300th completed MAL entry. 

**Mushishi**:

Ye gods, but could this anime have been more amazing... Set in such an amazingly detailed world, this was truly an anime to sit back and chill out to. In fact, I even took notes. No. Seriously. I'm going to use some of the things I saw in Mushishi to improve the background of my work in /r/worldbuilding. 

Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to fully appreciate it. I ran up against the end of the current season, and I had to rush through Mushishi a little bit too fast in order to get the series done s that it would legitimately be #300. As such, it lost a lot. This is truly not a show for marathoning. Like a fine sipping whisky, this is a show for sitting back and enjoying. And to treat it like a tray of Jello shots is a shame.

Score: **8.5/10**  
Recommendation level: *What the hell are you people waiting for?*  

**Pupipo!**  

Then again, there is something to be said about Jello shots: something fast, quick, easy, and does the job at hand. After Mushishi, I needed something like that, and so I settled on the Pupipo! shorts. 

It started off silly enough with a spooky girls that saw spooky things. But then it changed to this weird grand quest-style anime that made very little sense at all. It was still cute and sweet, but it just didn't make much sense at all.

Score: **7/10**  
Recommendation level: If you have a spare hour, there are worse ways to spend it.

**Nichijou** - 5/26


I've been threatening to watch this series for a while now thanks to all the hilarious gifs you guys have posted from it, and I've finally gotten around to watching it. I seriously think it's going to be in my top 10 favorite anime list by the end because I'm fucking loving it. The whole disconnected and free feel of the show makes it so unpredictable and fun, and I adore unpredictable and fun. I never know what's going to happen in each segment. So far I've seen massive explosions caused by a girl running into a boy, an android with a function for storing pastries, a girl annihilate a guy with various types of heavy artillery, a middle-aged high school principal suplex a deer, and a fucking epic hallway chase scene involving a yaoi doodle. It's always doing weird new shit, but not once has it come off as "lol im so randum :P." On top of that, the art style and animation is *so good*. It's weird and crazy, but it's really nice to look at. Everything's so smooth, clean, and bright. All in all, the enjoyability and hilariousness of Nichijou is just right through the roof. 
>> ARTICLE
I keep missing these topics so I'm going to post what I've watched the past few/several weeks..

**Planetes** - This anime is pretty incredible. It begins very simple and seems like it will be a lighthearted show about people in space. But slowly the plot builds on itself, introducing more serious themes that turns the show into something very unique. I absolutely loved it by the end.

**Madoka Magika** - Decided to try this since it was recommended to me. The soundtrack is magnificent, the art style is unique and it's nice to see something that's different to the usual magical girl story. However, it really isn't a show I could get into. I can see why it's successful though.

**Usagi Drop** - This anime is amazing. I have never seen a show that depicts a father/daughter relationship this well. It explores the difficulties of being a single father while showing how rewarding being a parent can be. But it does have it's dark moments which brings you back to the reality that life is hard. When it was over I was hoping to see more but then I read up on the manga and found out why. I wish I didn't find out about the manga ending haha.

**Anohana** - I heard that this anime was similar to Clannad/Angel Beats so I gave it a go. I wanted to enjoy this. The concept was great, but the execution wasn't. I couldn't stand Menma after a few episodes and the ending was very melodramatic. The characters would say why they would feel certain emotions, but there was no real portrayal to back it up. It left me feeling underwhelmed since I couldn't get into the characters.

Now I'm onto **Sakamichi No Apollon**. Yay for jazz.
>> ARTICLE
I keep on trying to watch Planetes but every time I start it I lose interest due to the slow pace and forget about it.  I've got a week before the Summer season kicks up so maybe I'll try it again. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I actually felt like dropping it after episode 3, but I decided to keep going and things slowly improve. I'd say if you're upto episode 10 and you're not enjoying it, then you probably won't want to finish. But it turns from a slow paced lighthearted show into a kind of political/sci fi thriller with some drama thrown in.
>> ARTICLE
[Cipher](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11867/Cipher)
As the name implies, Cipher is like a cipher, written in a way which only the smartest of the smartest would be able to decipher. 
Set in the 1980s, Cipher gives us the deepest insight into life that we could ever imagine, in the form of Siva and his twin brother Jay, who shares a bromance while dating a high school girl at the same time. The deliberate misspelling on the cake commercial and the 8.5 minute op of repeated scenes only added to the overall deep message that's conveyed in this film.
I strongly urge anyone and everyone to watch this masterpiece known as Cipher.
Final rating masterpiece / mars of destruction.

**Psycho-Pass (2/22)** (Watched 1-2 this week)

Okay, I only saw two episodes of this because my brother wants me to wait so we can watch it all together (me, him, his gf and his friend). That being said, the first episode was awesome. The entire episode might as well been a chase scene. I liked how the girl (really bad with character names, bear with me) defended the girlfriend of the guy that was killed, and ultimately saved her life, even though it meant temporarily paralyzing one of her allies. This was really good for the first episode, first episodes usually bore the hell out of me.

**Mushi-shi (4/26)** (Watched 2-4 this week)

This is more interesting than I thought it would be to be honest. I watched about half of the first episode a few months ago and I didn't really think it was anything special, but now I see that this is more laid back compared to other shows. It's a really good anime for chilling out. I like it. 

**Kimi ni Todoke S1 (25/25)** (Watched S1 19-25 this week)

I kinda thought the ending wasn't that great for this. If you read what I said about this last week, I was really into it (and talking about losing masculinity) but the ending kinda put me off, I was expecting them to at least start dating before the end of this season. But now I only have 15 episodes left and that means it's cutting it close in an anime like this. 

**Monster (40/74)** (Watched 36-40 this week)

Over halfway there! I don't really have much to say about this that isn't a huge spoiler for the series other than that this is amazing so far. This will be my new longest anime I've finished when I actually finish it, so maybe it's the fact that I know Tenma's thoughts without him saying a word, and that pretty much everything is coming together that makes me feel this way about it. But my feelings on it stand, amazing.

**Henneko (4/12)** (Watched 1-4 this week)

I saw this on my Crunchyroll queue and figured why not. I've always kinda admired the art style from afar, and so far not bad. It's not fantastic or anything but it's worth watching... so far. 

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (13/27)** (Watched 13 this week)

I like the way things are going here. I just need to watch more. Fuck.

**Redline (Movie)**

I didn't really like this other than the insanely awesome animation. I thought the story was okay, pretty clichd. I don't really see why they fell in love with each other, but that was pretty obviously going to happen ever since the beginning of the movie with them at dinner. It was fun. I give it a **6/10.** The dedicated animators should team up with a better writer and then they could make the best movie of all time.

**The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Movie)**

This was... interesting, to say the least. I liked the story and characters. The time travel thing was a bit confusing at first but it started making sense really fast. I liked the twist that [TGWLTT spoilers](/s " Chiaki not only came from the future, but he was the one that accidentally gave Makoto the same power.")It was a fun watch. I give it an **8.5/10.**

**Ghost in the Shell (Movie)**

This was very interesting. There was lots of boobs in the beginning, and I almost shut it off for a while, but then I decided fuck it and continued watching. I enjoyed it. It was interesting how they [GitS spoilers](/s "made the criminal something/someone totally digital. Must have been a total mindfuck when it came out, considering the movie is from 1995. It was pretty mind-fucky even today.") I give this a **8.75/10.**

**Paprika (Movie)**

Holy shit this was great. I loved this movie. I... don't even know what to say. Ummm.... [Paprika spoilers](/s "The way the dreams collided with each other and mashed together, only to eventually become reality really was crazy. I don't think this can get topped easily in it's genre.") Very unique and awesome music. Art style was great too. Jesus, pretty much perfect. **10/10**

**Garden of Words (Movie)** 

Just finished it and wow, the animation is pretty. It was kind of a touching love story, but I can see how their would be controversy with the teacher-student relationship. I'm glad she finally got her shoes at the end of the movie, but I have to say most of it was pretty predictable. It was still nice. It's mostly eye-candy though. **7/10.**

>> ARTICLE
I missed all of the shows I've been covering for the last few weeks due to watching [Summer Games Done Quick](http://gamesdonequick.com/), but I did rush through one other series because a friend got into the fandom.

**Attack on Titan** (25/25) - Quality animation and soundtrack, but the pacing is absolutely horrendous. It's very slow, but instead of using the time to develop secondary characters or the plot they just repeat information that's already been floating around. The fights are decent, but are drawn out far too long for my liking.

[Attack on Titan](/s "When Eren was saying the names of the rest of Levi's squad members as he watched them die, I spent far too long trying to recall which one of the otherwise indistinguishable soldiers he was talking about. It's only been a few days and the only one of them I can even remember the name of is Petra. The many deaths have almost no emotional impact and watching the characters I do recognize grieve over them becomes tedious as a result.")
>> ARTICLE
That's why I think it's stupid when people make comparisons of Attack on Titan with Game of Thrones, they're not even in the same league. This is coming from someone who loved AoT.

The weight of the character deaths in Game of Thrones is just so much heavier. These are characters that have been with us for entire *seasons* and have had much more characterization. AoT on the other hand has a character for maybe a couple of episodes with no real development. A quirk or two and some dialogue maybe, but that is about it.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I'm watching AoT right now (just finished ep 22) and for the past few episodes the only thing I could think was "wow, this is more brutal GoT". They're very comparable and it makes sense that they would be compared because they both have giant casts of characters are there are no clear "safe" options.

I guess the biggest difference is (as you noted) that in GoT is more about who will die and how that's a mystery... Sort of a slow unravelling of multiple plot threads... But AoT is a thousand times more brutal IMO, every glimpse of hope has been immediately dashed, sometimes episodes worth of character development and hype are dashed in SECONDS.
>> ARTICLE
>episodes worth of character development

Did I miss another season or something? The main difference to me is that I honestly *don't care* who dies in Attack on Titan because I barely know them. Sure, it's another crapsack world where the existence of humanity's threatened but I'm almost rooting for the titans to just get it over with.

You know what would make it closer to Game of Thrones? [Attack on Titan](/s "If Eren actually *died* when the titan swallowed him.")
>> ARTICLE
>Did I miss another season or something? 

Maybe you weren't paying attention to the one that does exist? Or maybe, for whatever reason, what touched me doesn't effect you the same way? Or maybe something else?

I only know that where you "honestly don't care" who dies, I was HEAVILY involved in EVERYONE's fate. All of the 104th graduating class, and then everyone on Captain Levi's Sqaud in Scouting Regiment.

No I don't think it's even comparable.

> makes sense that they would be compared because they both have giant casts of characters

The amount of on screen time, dialogue, and characterization is not even comparable to the people in AoT. They both have giant casts but the main difference is that there is not main character in Game of Thrones whereas in Attack on Titan there very clearly *is*. 
>> ARTICLE
I heard a few comparisons before starting (I love Game of Thrones so was hoping it was apt) but all of the characters are really shallow to me. Even lesser ones in ASOIAF like Janos Slynt and Beric Dondarrion feel like more interesting characters than Eren and Mikasa, but that might partially be due to being a book reader.

**Love Live S1** 13/13  
**Love Live OVA**

After seeing those ridiculous sales numbers earlier this week for Love Live, I finally decided to check it out. Definitely was not disappointed. I probably would have appreciated it more if I watched it before the knowledge of a second season. Some of the drama near the end would be been stronger.  Currently catching up on S2 for the finale tomorrow. 
^Honoka ^best ^girl, ^right?

I watched all of [Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22123/Inugami-san_to_Nekoyama-san) this weekend, it was really upbeat and enjoyable, normally not my kind of thing but I liked it. It's short at twelve 3 minute episodes and worth checking out for anyone with a few minutes to spare.     

And I rewatched Mobile Suit Gundam 00 the Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer, and [Sword Art Online: EXTRA EDITION](http://www.crunchyroll.com/sword-art-online/sword-art-online-extra-edition-movie-648529) to recap on the SAO plotline.

I started watching [Higurashi no Naku Koro ni](http://myanimelist.net/anime/934/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni) yesterday, and I binge watched all the [Elfen Lied](http://myanimelist.net/anime/226/Elfen_Lied) episodes in an afternoon the day before that, and watch all of [Black Rock Shooter](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11285/Black%E2%98%85Rock_Shooter_(TV)) in an afternoon the day before that (I've had some lazy nights).

Elfen Lied was pretty good, honestly wasn't expecting so much nudity and violence (not that I'm complaining whatsoever), story was good, I was more confused than sad at the ending, guess I need to read the books to understand the other parts of the story. 

Black Rock Shooter was confusing at first but I got it like half way (AKA when they spoonfed the explanation of what was happening), it was also pretty good.

**Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya** 3/10 - Still not too sure about this but I'll finish it though it's lower on my priority list than the other two.

I've completed both seasons of Yuru Yuri this past week. It was a pretty enjoyable series.

I watched episodes 11 and 12 of Space Dandy. Episodes 12 was the better of the two. The series has been fairly enjoyable for me.

Checked out the first episode of Tamako Market. Found it a little boring, but Mochizou was cute. I don't think I can watch it for him though.


Watched both seasons of Senyuu and totally loved them. It was a nice short.

Watched [Project A-ko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJffLvfNSnc) a couple days ago. Dang what a silly movie. The dub was especially goofy and horrible, but that gave it some charm. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to watch an older anime comedy and has 90 minutes to kill.

I went on a Studio Ghibli movie watching streak this week, and i've seen The Wind Rises, Princess Mononoke, The Cat Returns, Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, Kiki's Delivery Service, and finished Porco Rosso last night. All of them were spectacular films, especially since Spirited Away gave me a lot of nostalgia to when I was 3 and it's still my favorite(with Princess Mononoke and Porco Rosso as of now), and I finally learned that Totoro was prononced Toe-to-ro not To-tor-ro. Next on my list is Nausicaa, since I heard somewhere that it was *the* film that made Studio Ghibli famous, unless i'm wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Finished **Monogatari: Second Season** (ep19-end)  
First few arcs were a bit weaker than the last 2 but overall really enjoyable. Overall on par with Bake I would say.

Started just recently **Psycho-Pass** (ep1+2)  
Looks really promising. I kind of like the setting and I can see in what kind of direction this can go.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Psycho-Pass, so the feels are still real... You are in for a treat! Is Monogatari worth starting? I've heard good things, and know where to begin, but I'm still weighing up what I'm going to binge watch while I wait for season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is really good. But be aware that it has some fanservice (sometimes more, sometimes less) and is very dialogue heavy with many wordplays. That said it is very "special" when it comes to artstyle and other things.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching **Kokoro Connect** this week because Sawashiro Miyuki is in it (literally), and man am I glad I decided to watch it for such a trivial reason. About half way through the show and I can honestly say that it feels like this show has gotten more shit done/characters have progressed and grown up more than some shows do before the entire series ends. Loving every minute of it.

**Planetes** is the next show I'm going to finish, probably tommorow (3 episodes left). Came back to it after forgetting about it for a while, but with all the shows ending this week, I thought I should finish this up, too. The drama is intensifying on and around the moon; interested to see how this all wraps up. Real nice to see a show about space that doesn't have giant robots and laser beams.

Madouka Magica.  I'm 3 episodes in.  I like this a lot.  I was hoping it wouldn't be too much senseless action, and so far the plot has been pretty enjoyable.

>> ARTICLE
Black Bullet came out of nowhere for me. I picked up the first 2 episodes, and didn't think much of it. Then a couple of weeks ago I decided to binge watch it out of having nothing better to do, and, wow. The feels are real. You know what I mean (The bomb episode).

Watched:

**Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuiokuhen** ep. 3-4 *(out of 4)*

**Tokyo Magnitude 8.0** ep. 5-11 *(out of 11)*

**Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin** ep. 1-6 *(out of 26)*

**Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou** ep. 6-12 + specials *(out of 12, and all 6 specials)*

**Fate/Zero** ep. 1-6 *(out of 13)*

**Kemonozume** ep. 1-2 *(out of 13)*

Kenshin OVA was nice (8/10), Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 was sad (7/10), Nichibros had some funny moments (6/10).

Rainbow and Fate/Zero are pretty nice, 7/10's at the moment, kind of disappointed with F/Z so far because of all the hype, Rider is awesome though, and it's still not *bad*. I like Gen's stuff, but I don't love it I guess.

Kemonozume seems to be a good Yuasa-fix now that Ping Pong is over, reminds me a little of the manga Parasyte, which I'm reading at the moment. On a non-anime side-note, I also watched the **Adventure Time** episode that Yuasa directed, it was pretty fun and trippy.

Binged through Bubblegum Crisis and Crash (for the umpteenth time) after Mad Machine came up in a playlist shuffle.

**Capeta [60/60]**: Been going on a sports anime marathon recently and Capeta is definitely one of the more interesting ones. Really disappointed in how it ended personally, [MM! Ep. 10](/s "since we didn't get to see him and Minamoto actually race each other."). I personally found the characters rather flat and stale because the anime didn't really delve into the characters.

**Oreshura [13/13]**: Ridiculous humour, Jojo references, really cute girls and [](/s "a really well done harem ending").What's there not to like? **TEAM SILVER RANGER!** 

**Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga [10/10]**: I really like anime where they don't stick to the tried and tested formula for romcoms and this was really funny and outfield. The non-conclusive ending wasn't to my ending though.

**Kiss X Sis (TV and OVA)** *Completed*

HOLY SHIT. That's the most extreme Ecchi I've ever seen. I really enjoyed it, and i can't wait or the next episode of the OVA but DAMN. Who makes this stuff?!

**Shingeki No Kyojin** *Rewatch: Completed*

Really enjoyed rewatching this after watching it for the first time in December. The transformation sequences are amazing combined with an awesome soundtrack. I hope to hear more about S2 soon.

**School Days** *Completed*

Genuinely decided to watch this because it was advertised on MAL as a High School Romance and I wanted something light-hearted to watch while I went to bed before coming to work on Monday.

Turned out to be a very different beast that, no matter how much I hated it, couldn't be put down. Ended up finishing the series at 4AM this morning,

Probably simultaneously one of my most hated and one of my favourite anime of all time.

It's only around the halfway point I started to really enjoy Jinrui, I'd love to see another season some time it could be very funny when it shifted into being more satirical.
>> ARTICLE
Me too. 

It picked up a lot after the whole "Oyagi" arc with the robots. Was one of the first times where I felt that the series was actually very touching. Then it only picked up from there as they dealt more with origin stories. I really liked the banana arc with the assistant, her first job as a mediator and the last couple of episodes which dealt with her beginnings.

The first 4 episodes or so are still very solid IMO but compared to the rest it can be sort of lackluster.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its just such a shame that when she got some proper character development it ended.

I watched the first two Golden Boy OVAs.

There is a huge amount of Ecchi fan service stuff in this show, which in most cases, bugs me to the point I can't enjoy the show. I gave up on Kill La Kill for that reason. But being that it's a comedy and it makes sense within the context of the show, it hasn't bugged me at all. 

With that out of the way... This show is HILARIOUS, and the animation gags are fantastic. Loving it so far.

Haha, I'm the same as you in that regard. I normally can't stand ecchi stuff, but Golden Boy had me in tears at a few different points. STUDY STUDY STUDY STUDY!

**[Kaiji](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3002/Gyakkyou_Burai_Kaiji:_Ultimate_Survivor)**

Nominated by /u/KnivesMillions

> Itou Kaiji is a bum who steals car emblems and slashes tires on what seems to be a regular basis. This routine changes one day when he is paid a visit by a man in a trench-coat. Once the two get talking, it seems that the visitor (Calling himself Endou) is a debt collector. The reason for his visit is an unpaid loan which Kaiji had previously co-signed for a work-mate (Furuhata Takeshi). The original loan was 300,000 yen and once Takeshi had disappeared, the loan then fell on Kaiji.

> Kaiji is then told of a way to clear the interest compounded debt (which stood at 3,850,000 yen), which involved getting on a boat with others in his position. Once on the boat the debtors would then have to gamble with loaned money, which would end with a few winning, and others getting into deeper debt and having to work to pay of their debts. After some coercion Kaiji accepts a position on the boat, in order to clear his debt and make a bit of money as well...

Entire families are wiped out while others desert their homes. All hell breaks loose as the villagers discover their loved ones' corpses are rising from the grave with an insatiable thirst for human blood. Who is safe when the urge to kill in order to survive blurs the line between man and monster?

> /u/theWalkingGnome says: "This was one I didn't expect to enjoy so much, but I ended up giving it a 10 on MAL. As with most things, it's not without flaws but the good parts far outshine the bad. It's a thriller about a mysterious plague spreading throughout a small town after a strange family moves in. Sounds pretty generic, but the end will leave you questioning who the real monsters are in this setting."

Prince Chagum has been imbued with the power to stave off the drought and bring new life to his empire. However, this is a suspicious time, and he is accused of possession by an evil spirit.

Just so everyone knows in case Wolf's Rain wins, there's actually 30 episodes not 26. The four OVAs are actually the final four episodes and are totally non-skippable. There was a problem during production (can't remember the specifics) and four recap episodes (15-18) were included in the TV airing and the four last episodes were delayed until the home release. 

In short [these](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1023/Wolfs_Rain_OVA) have to be included in the watch or we might as well not bother. And also it might be worth glossing over 15-18 as apart from about 30 seconds of new footage in 18 it's all recap.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the notice on that one. I try to time "breaks' with the appearance of recaps episodes. Four recap episodes in a row is really pushing it though, damn...
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend just skipping them, they really don't add anything, especially not when marathoning the show. Even that little bit of new footage in 18 doesn't really affect anything.
>> ARTICLE
While I wouldn't normally look forward to a watch of a show I've already seen I really hope Wolf's Rain wins. It's my favourite anime by quite a large margin and it seems like not that many people on /r/anime have seen it. 
>> ARTICLE
So many nominations this time! It's the first time in a while that I didn't feel the need to add any old ones from past votes.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Moribito and Haibane had also been up for vote last time, hadn't they?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, they keep getting nominated. I think Moribito has been nominated 4 or 5 times now.

When I pick shows from previous votes to bring back they're always the ones that placed the highest but didn't win, though. In this case that'd be Michiko to Hatchin.
>> ARTICLE
Err, noticed an issue. Nominations thread says you can't nominate shows in the top 200 most popular shows. Wolf's Rain is #136 and Shiki is #119.
>> ARTICLE
This was noticed, I decided to let it slide for that particular show based on my own notions of how popular Wolf's Rain is on /r/anime.

I did the same for Shiki that was nominated which is also in violation of that rule, for more arbitrary reasons, you can see the nominations thread for the justification.
>> ARTICLE
Well, put against Wolf's Rain, Shiki didn't stand a chance ;-)

Then again, it's lagging behind quite a few other shows as well currently.

**[Shigofumi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3420/Shigofumi)**

Nominated by /u/OperativePenguin

> When someone dies, what should their final words be? Words that couldn't be said while still aliveof love, hate, hope, regret, or perhaps words without any importance. These words are sent through letters called "shigofumi" from the recently deceased to the living. Mikawa Fumika is a mail carrier of these shigofumi, delivering them alongside staff and her partner Kanaka. However, there must be something more behind Fumika's silent exterior; shigofumi mail carriers are deceased humans with the same appearance they had just before death. Despite this, Fumika is still aging...

I usually don't vote for things I might not watch myself, but this is probably the anime I've watched the most times (movies notwithstanding). Such a good show.

**[Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3342/Mnemosyne:_Mnemosyne_no_Musume-tachi)**

Nominated by /u/Blinkingsky

> Rin Asogi is an immortal private detective with a thirst for vodka and a talent for attracting things that go bump in the night. In a series of nightmarish vignettes spanning sixty-five years, Rin's lush body is sadistically pierced, blown up, and mulched to a bloody pulp. The fiend behind her tortured existence is Apos, an eternal being obsessed with sacrificing Rin to Yggdrasil, the tree of all life. While Rin struggles to unravel the secrets of her endless agony, Apos lurks in the shadows, eager to tear into her ripe body and devour the memories of her countless lives. Rin's no stranger to the realm of the dead, but her next visit could last forever.

> /u/Blinkingsky says: "I've only seen the first episode personally, but I think it might have potential."

**[Wolf's Rain](http://myanimelist.net/anime/202/Wolfs_Rain)**

Nominated by /u/JackTheWitch

> In some distant future, it's common knowledge that all wolves have been extinct for 200 years. However, it seems this is false as wolves have not disappeared but rather have taken human form. Kiba, a lone wolf, wanders into a city, trying to sniff out the Lunar Flowers that are supposed to lead whoever follows the scent to paradise. The source of the smell is Cheza, a girl who sleeps in what appears to be suspended animation in a lab. She and the wolves are drawn to each other, and Kiba hopes to find paradise once he finds the source of the scent of Lunar Flowers. However, once Kiba finds Cheza, she is kidnapped by a mysterious person called Darcia, and his search begins anew. Before he leaves the city, he meets 3 other wolves, Tsume, Hige and Toboe. All four wolves have very different personalities and ideas, and their friendliness towards each other is a little rough around the edges. However, they soon band together to continue to search for paradise.

**[NieA Under 7](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=800)**

Nominated by /u/camefromapsychward

> In the 21st century, aliens have arrived on Earth and live among humans. In sleepy Enohana, the dirt-poor student Chigasaki Mayuko finds herself living together with NieA, a low-caste ("Under Seven") alien. While Mayuko struggles diligently to make ends meet, NieA seems to be totally unconcerned with the consequences of her actions. As the odd couple throws off the expected sparks, the wrecked alien mothership looms in the background...

> /u/camefromapsychward says: "An aliens live with humans and it's not that big of a deal. The aliens follow a caste system and one of the MC's, NieA, is at the bottom of it (under 7). Despite the discrimination she faces it doesn't seem like it bothers her one bit. She eventually comes to live with a dirt poor human student, Chigasaki Mayuko, and this show is the story of how they live together. I felt this show was fairly interesting/entertaining because it's basically two really poor beings (human and alien) who can relate over this similar trait they share."

**[Tenchi Muyo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/696/Tenchi_Muyo!)**

Nominated by /u/blobcat123

> Tenchi Masaki may be a 17-year-old young man in rural Japan, but little does he know how bad his day will be getting. When a space pirate chased by a pair of Galaxy Police officers crash-lands at his grandfather's temple, Tenchi is sucked into a new adventure that will literally blast him off into outer space and beyond.

> /u/blobcat123 says: "The plot is rather nice, and it's a 90's anime, meaning the art style is older, yet refreshing to the current ones in modern anime."

He couldn't be troubled to stop playing GAL games to climb up with everyone else. That's why he's having trouble getting wifi down there.

also no mention of evangelion?

Haha yeah I forgot to mention Evangelion on that list, and the background is indeed from the opening to Kingdom Hearts 2, good catch!

big fan of kh. noticed the staircase instantly.
>> ARTICLE
Detective Conan is such an underappreciated anime. Any ideas why that's the case? I can only come up with the bad English dub and the horrible change of names...
>> ARTICLE
The reason I don't appreciate it is because it is ridiculously long with very little plot developement. Sure, the random mysteries are fun, but after 700 chapters or so I realized that I was just wasting my time on a story that wouldn't finish. 
It's only my opinion of course, but without main plot development I think there's a limit to how long a series can run. For me, DC crossed it.
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree, the lack of a central plot makes it a tough one to watch every single episode of, but the random mysteries are fun and I enjoy going back to it every once in a while. For me its about an anime that hasn't really changed much since my childhood, which you can take to be a good or bad thing haha.

Interesting but I can't stop twitching while looking at this picture lol. The characters are horrendously awkward in this, which is probably because of the two different art styles present. They seem to clash too much for me.
