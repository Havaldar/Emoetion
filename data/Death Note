[Sad Story=Spoilers](#konosubawot2)
>> ARTICLE
Sorry I hurt your feelings, friend.  All I said was that it's a sad story.  Personally, I don't feel that's a spoiler... the Netflix description gives away more than that.

I'm not trying to spoil anything for anyone.  I genuinely love that show and would encourage everyone to watch it, I don't think knowing it's a sad story ahead of time really ruins anything.  I found the show very profound and it touched me personally every single episode.

Please, give it a try - I haven't hinted at anything that happens or doesn't happen.  It is an emotional journey that's worth taking.

I honestly feel that Erased is going to be viewed as a great introductory anime down the line, as it has a very strong cinematic vibe mixed as a thriller. 

>> ARTICLE
This so much. I finally got my boyfriend to start watching anime when I sat down with him and made him watch the first episode. He loved it so much he just had to continue. He would watch it even if I was not there and actually finished it earlier than me.
>> ARTICLE
Can also confirm this. My dad watched half of Erased in one sitting, and watched the last two episodes by himself as soon as they came out. Totally surprised me.
>> ARTICLE
Same thing happened with my neighbor! Lol We traded shows as an anime contract and I was excited to see her reactions throughout (especially since she was a bit new to thrillers) and the next time I went over she informed me she had finished and even read the manga. I was like "Aww that sucks" at first but then I realized, hey at least I got another person that enjoyed it as much as I did. Lol 
>> ARTICLE
To me this is the answer. My wife is not into anime at all but yet she couldnt stop watching this one. Also if his wife is into ID channel and stuff like that then this one is perfect for her.

I also suggested Death Parade because of the different take on life and afterlife.
>> ARTICLE
so we're going for realism then.

In similar vein: [Monster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster)

Completely different but also very realistic: [Hantsuki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/587/Hanbun_no_Tsuki_ga_Noboru_Sora)

Thats it for now, I got loads more, but those two would be the top recommendations.
>> ARTICLE
Have her watch Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex. It's is similar to Criminal Minds and has an absolutely amazing female main. 
>> ARTICLE
Ghost in the Shell SAC and movie are pretty much my goto recommendation to a mature audience. It has such adult themes, treats it's audience like thinking adults, and the animation is beautiful and fluid. Also, the English dub is AMAZING. One of the few shows that i recommend english dubs, and i HATE english dubs. The other is FMA. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch an anime where the main character isn't even wearing pants?

While your wife rationalizes what exactly the definition of 'human' is in a society where a mind can be copied and the body replaced with a synthetic form. Asking where is the boundary between human and machine when the differences between the two become more philosophical than physical? While starring at that ass

I don't know man, maybe too much for her

>> ARTICLE
> Ghost in the Shell

I have to agree there. Just [Ghost in the Shell](http://myanimelist.net/anime/43/Ghost_in_the_Shell) (the movie)  would be better imho. (and [Jin Roh](http://myanimelist.net/anime/570/Jin-Rou) while we're mentioning movies as well)
>> ARTICLE
I only recommended the series since it is a tv series like CM. 
>> ARTICLE
Why not some romance with a tad bit of fantasty, [Spice & Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou).

Or maybe a Slice of Life movie about parenting, [Wolf Children](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12355/Ookami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki).

A good drama with a realistic theme, [Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28735/Shouwa_Genroku_Rakugo_Shinjuu).

Something darker and more psychological try [Ergo Proxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/790/Ergo_Proxy).

Just want dwelve deeper into the criminal-genre, [Monster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster?q=monster) for realistic and [Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass?q=pass) for cyberpunk. 
>> ARTICLE
For the Light Novel readers of Spice & Wolf, I am happy to remind you that the series is being re-continued in the newest issue of Dengeki Magazine!!! Hooray!!

Dude, i havent even finished Vol. 11 yet :D love that theres still so much to come
>> ARTICLE
ergo proxy is definitely not entry-level
>> ARTICLE
It depends on what they are looking for, if they want more mature anime than ergo proxy is a good choice.
 
I wouldn't recommend HxH, FMA etc. to people who are 25+ and has never watched anime before. 


>> ARTICLE
i just think it might be a little too "strong" for your normal new viewer. kinda like how you wouldnt recommend Lain or Mind Game to a normal person who just started. but i suppose if they know what to expect and it is exactly what theyre looking for then it's a good fit
>> ARTICLE
Entry level anime or entry level philosophy?
>> ARTICLE
In my experience Wolf Children is universally loved by all peoples.

I haven't watched it so I have no opinion one way or another, but I just clicked the provided MAL link, and the top 3 reviews say that it's boring and nothing happens.

No joke my brother stopped watching the movie after the wolf sex scene and basically missed watching where the bulk of the heart and the point of the movie lies.

I had to force him to watch the rest and he begrudgingly admitted it was an amazing film hahaha.

It was a general dislike for coming of age stories and a confusing belief that nothing happened.

LOL that sounds deeper than simply not liking the movie

Okay here's what worked with a 45 year old lady, my mother:

-Death Note

-Zankyo no Terror (she disregarded the bad english as a japanese person trying to speak english)

-Shingeki no Kyojin (i know... i know... she liked it a lot actually)

-Gyakkyo Burai Kaiji, she enjoyed that one a lot too

-more recently Erased almost made her tear up.

-Ore monogatari 

-Natsume Yuujinchou

-Monster up until around episode 50, it was a bit too long 

-Death Parade 
>> ARTICLE
I think she'll love these, definitely check them out:

Zankyou no Terror

Death Parade

Cowboy Bebop

Time of Eve (movie)

Wolf Children (movie)



>> ARTICLE
Monster definitely
>> ARTICLE
Has she watched Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood? Because FMA:B is a very good show to watch as a starter, or really at any time in an anime watching career. No fanservice, the fantasy/sci-fi elements aren't over the top, amazing characters with a very well-thought out and well-written story, no senseless language/vulgar jokes, plus while there are some hype fight scenes, there's nothing that I'd label excessively or ridiculously violent (there are a few moments of heightened tension like [FMA:B hype fight spoilers but with character names omitted but just to give you an idea of what happens](/s "one character burns another to a crisp... repeatedly")), and it does touch upon the cruelty of war, but overall, I don't think many people would mind the the way it handles its themes.  
  
Also, it's available on Netflix (though not the final 13 episodes the last time I checked) and the English dub is rather good (if she's okay with subtitles, the original Japanese VA cast is freakin amazing and legendary, too).   
  
Let us know what she watches next! 
  
>> ARTICLE
I second FMA: Brotherhood. I'm thinking of rewatching it (probably the first show I've ever rewatched.) 


>> ARTICLE
I've rewatched FMAB at least 2-3 times by now.

It's my all time favourite and I will never get tired of it.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend the original FMA over FMA:B as a "starter" series. FMA:B moves too quickly in the beginning because it assumes you're already familiar with its universe. The original series takes its time in developing crucial story arcs in the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
if she's a fan of Avatar, this is the show I'd go with too. sold someone into watching FMA:b based on that

I would immediately say Psycho-Pass, but you said that she's not into blood/violence. I'm not sure if she would like when the Dominators are used, and some of the crimes can be a bit bloody. (Also not sure if she would go for the futuristic setting, either...) I would give the first episode a try, though. 

I also suggest Monster, and while I haven't personally watched anything Ghost in the Shell, I'd reccomend it. I'll be watching it this summer along with Akira, so maybe give those a shot.

I'm assuming Persona 4 would be too much of a stretch with the fantasy? What with the TV world and all.. 
>> ARTICLE
Funny is that my wife's first anime was Death Note too.  She loved it.  
After that she watched Monster, Full Metal Alchemist, Attack on Titan and a few other romance anime's.  She also loves all the Studio Ghibli films, she is now obsessed with Totoro :).  As for your wife, best follow ups would be Monster and there is a new anime called Joker Game which looks pretty cool.

Woman usually have a totally different taste in entertainment compared to men. You better off asking other woman what anime they would recommend.

I am not a woman, but here is a list of shows I think you two might enjoy watching.


* [Angel Beats](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats) - supernatural, but a very emotional story if you can get her past first episodes. 
* [Baccanno](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2251/Baccano) - set in 1930 Chicago, story is told in a unique way.
* [Black Lagoon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/889/Black_Lagoon) - strong language but based in real life.
* [ERASED](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi) - pretty sure this should hit home run. It's about a guy who gets sent back in time to prevent his childhood friends from being murdered.
* [Gankutsuou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/239/Gankutsuou) - Japanese version of Count de monte cristo, a bit wierd but rather enjoyable.
* [Great Teacher Onizuka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/245/Great_Teacher_Onizuka) - about a delinquent who have a burning desire to be greatest teacher for his students. 
* [The Devil is a part-timer!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama) - devil comes to comes to earth and tries to lead a normal life. A bit of comedy, a bit of action a bit of harem/romance. Very good dub.
* [Hellsing Ultimate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/777/Hellsing_Ultimate) - very bloody vampire story set in England. What's not to like?
* [Eden of the East](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5630/Higashi_no_Eden) - a group of people are given a task of saving Japan in any way possible, no rules apply, not even murder. To accomplish such task they are given a cell phone they can use to call for favours and money. They must save Japan before running out of money or die.
* [Jormungand](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12413/Jormungand) - Traveling weapon dealer and a child soldier, the dark side of mankind.
* [Kekkai Sensen](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24439/Kekkai_Sensen) - set in New York, as supernatural as they can get, but really enjoyable. Good dub too.
* [Noragami](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20507/Noragami) - life of a minor god and his struggle to build his own shrine.
* [Planetes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/329/Planetes) - What would happen if human start living in space? Story of space garbage collector. Really good and down to earth story.
* [Rurouni Kenshin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11441/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_-_Shin_Kyoto-hen) - It is the Meiji Era, a time of peace born from the bloodshed of war. Follow the story of roaming Samurai Kenshin. Watch in Japanese only.
* [Seitokai Yakuindomo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8675/Seitokai_Yakuindomo) - Romance comedy, rather enjoyable.
* [History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1559/Shijou_Saikyou_no_Deshi_Kenichi) - rather old but good one. About a weakling becoming a martial artist. Comedy, slice of art, martial arts, dub is rather good too.
* [Shiki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7724/Shiki) - about vampires moving into a rural japanese village and slowing killing people. Can the villages figure out who the murderer is and save themselves?
* [Shokugeki no Souma](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28171/Shokugeki_no_Souma) - comedy about cooking, over the top gourmet cooking. Rather enjoyable show.
* [Special A](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3470/Special_A) - romance comedy show for woman about elite students in private school, an awesome male lead and stubborn, tsundere-ish female lead. Rather charming show.
* [Sukitte Ii na yo (aka Say "I Love You")](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14289/Sukitte_Ii_na_yo) - charming romance school life comedy.
* [Kaichou wa Maid-sama!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/329/Planetes) - school life comedy about a super human guy and a stubborn girl.
* [Ouran High School Host Club](http://myanimelist.net/anime/853/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club) - poor girl gets into private highclass school as a honor student. Winds up in a all male host club that entertains woman with male protagonist having no idea that she is a girl. Adorable school romance comedy with a good enough dub.
* [Tiger & Bunny](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9941/Tiger___Bunny) - its about super heroes in a fictional universe in a fictional city doing super hero stuff for TV. It is surprisingly good with a fair amount of action.
* [UN-GO](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10798/UN-GO) - detective show with a bit of supernatural.

>> ARTICLE
The show is rather stylized, but maybe try [Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3002/Gyakkyou_Burai_Kaiji:_Ultimate_Survivor) it covers the mind game basis you are looking for with showing "cunning and strategy in the dialogue, and is closer to "real life" than most anime." The show also avoids the general crassness that she might find off putting.
>> ARTICLE
I would like to suggest Psycho-Pass it is gory and sci-fi but the key element to the show is not the futuristic dystopia, but the chase of a criminal who somehow evades the system. If she likes it, just don't show her Season 2 The movie is good though.

Another one that might be pretty good is Requiem of Zero it's about a pair of assassins working for a underground crime Syndicate uniting all the other underground crime syndicates. Lots of Underground politicking and chess moves by various characters while others are caught in the middle of the larger schemes. There's moderate violence and gore, but I don't think it's much worse than Death Note.

Code Geass, If you have successfully indoctrinated her to Death Note and a few others this is the next logical step. While the spindly art can really take you away from the show (I hated it when I first saw it because of said art). However, the "I know that you know that I know" type logic battles are present here as they are in Death Note. There are Mech battles and does have a fantasy element to it in the form or Geass, but it's really no different than how the Death Note can kill people. Take a look at it first, you know your wife better than I do.

Long and short of it is Death Note was my gateway drug...errr anime and now I'm watching stuff like Love Live and other much more embarrsing-to-admit shows.
>> ARTICLE
I would definitely suggest Code Geass. I feel there are many similarities to Death Note (discussion of justice and vigilante justice, a MC with a seemingly overpowered ability, great antagonists, an addictive storyline, emotion that draws you into the characters). I felt it had a slow start (~5 eps) but it accustoms you to the setting and the characters so it is not boring. And after watching over 100 animes I still feel it has an umatched ending. I wish I could unwatch it to relieve it for the first time.

In case you have not seen it, it involves war so there is definitely violence, but not an unreasonable amount.
>> ARTICLE
The currently airing Joker Game.

Real historical setting, and considering that the main rule of the spy agency is "don't die, don't kill", it's unlikely there will be extreme violence. The live action movie didn't have anything overtly violent, it wasn't much worse than a typical Marvel movie.

Or if you want a completed series, try Night Raid 1931. Also heavily based in historical events. The fantasy aspects of the show are rather low-key. It's like the X-Men if they were in 1931 Shanghai, with the full weight of a coming Japanese invasion hovering over the entire atmosphere.
>> ARTICLE
Best anime to get a woman in - generalising enormously here - Erased. No competition to my mind.
>> ARTICLE
has it been really popular with the female crowd?
>> ARTICLE
In my household, absolutely. The most mature (in a good way), *wide*-appeal anime I know of. Anyone from my 14yo son to my 87-yo mother can enjoy this one.

Just a murder mystery, one single fantastical element, and a bunch of humanity. Brilliant stuff. Watching it through again now that I know more.
>> ARTICLE
Erased seems like the perfect starter anime tbh.
>> ARTICLE
Not so sure about that. A 29 year old x an 11 year old might alienize some newcomers
>> ARTICLE
Uh, a normal person won't look at that relationship sexually, because it is in no way presented in such a manner. An anime fan too used to lolis, on the other hand...

Season 2 summer hype 
>> ARTICLE
fuck yeah dude, its taken all my perseverance to not read the manga
>> ARTICLE
Personally I came to realise soon enough that Satoru only had the memories of a 29 year old. These memories may have made him seem more mature, may have given him purpose, and may have lead him to make better decisions, but as far as actual mental maturity and everything else goes, he was 11 through and through.
>> ARTICLE
I would try looking into the psychological genre of anime.  Psychological animes generally have deeper plots and a lot of hidden contexts.  Fair warning, they can be pretty dark. Also I'm seeing psycho-pass on here and it makes me happy. For this situation, I totally recommend it. Good luck!  Also sorry, mods.
>> ARTICLE
As said by slapper wolf children is a great story. And doesn't have any form of fan service. It's really touching and I can recommend d it to anyone, regardless of gender or opinion on anime.
>> ARTICLE
Trigun is my favorite ever. It is only 26 episodes. 

I haven't seen many animes but Psycho Pass seems right up your alley. 
>> ARTICLE
Someone already said but Erased is a pretty good psychological thriller that keeps you wanting more. 

Another great one is Death Parade. 
>> ARTICLE
Boku Dake ga Inai Machi might be perfect for that
>> ARTICLE
You can try Skip beat, but it's not finished. It continuos on Manga only, but it's really funny! Maybe you'll get her to try manga too

>> ARTICLE
>shows cunning and strategy in the dialogue, and is closer to "real life" than most anime. She's not a fan of blood/violence/senseless language/vulgr jokes, when used to ridiculous degrees.

Spice and Wolf? It is completely different from what a new anime viewer might expect, so it will be a nice surprise.
>> ARTICLE
[Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) or [Psychopass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass) maybe? I never watched criminal minds so I don't know what you really mean by that, but I'm guessing based off Death Note it has something to do with a very smart detective and criminal strategizing against eachother. If thats it then thats what Psychopass has with pretty much everything else you ask for, except it more scifi then fantasy, and the first episode does have a rather intense sequence that may or may not upset your wife, but past that there is not that much violence. Shinsekai Yori isn't really like criminal minds I guess, but is more of a mystery/suspense series. It has pretty much everything else your asking for, except the violence does get a little excessive near the end, though by then she'd probably be to hooked to care. Also it does have a rather slow beginning, but it definitely has one of the best plots I've watched in an anime. 

I gave Psychopass a 9/10, and Shinsekai Yori was the last series I gave a 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
I think that Erased and Psycho Pass would both fit the bill very well. 
>> ARTICLE
Erased, Zankyou no terror, Welcome to the nhk all three for realistic(although first one has a bit of fantasy I guess with MC's power) Erased and ZnT are especially about crime and so on. 
>> ARTICLE
Structure wise I thought Code Geass was a lot like Death Note. Antagonist/Protagonist mixup and the plot buildup. Also the themes. You know, the philosophy of morality, whats wrong and whats right, etc. Though I dont know how your wife will feel about the school drama and the mechas. Everything comes into play later on though. The anime is multilayered, but I think that is what gives it a juicier character development.
>> ARTICLE
I started my mom on anime 2 years ago when her only experience with it was Speed Racer and some extremely disturbing hentai from college. However,  my mom is a huge fan of action and usually needs something gripping early,  or else she winds up asleep in the theatre, so Attack On Titan was the best possible first show to get her hooked.  You say that didn't work for your wife. I'm not surprised with Bleach or DBZ. I'm thinking you'd rather go for some seinens rather than shonens. Try Fate/Zero and Psycho Pass. Both are really good,  but may be to violent for her tastes. Past that, I'd say Erased might be really good since it's extremely cinematic and emotionally gripping,  bye not very violent. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Code geass and Attack on Titan would be best
>> ARTICLE
Since she liked Death Note, she'll probably enjoy Ghost Hunt.  Un-Go is fairly similar in tone also.

[Shirobako](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25835/Shirobako) Workplace comedy set in an anime studio. Female MC, has some in jokes that might get her curious about other shows.

[Sakurako's Bones](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30187/Sakurako-san_no_Ashimoto_ni_wa_Shitai_ga_Umatteiru) is a rather odd mystery series about a bones expert and a high school student. It's dark and a little hard to explain.

I can't understand what my husband is saying, Your Lie In April, Case Files of Young Kindaichi Returns are non supernatural shows that are well done. Kindaichi usually a kind, brave, utterly reliable person but can be a crass, lecherous ass though.
>> ARTICLE
I have shown my wife some anime that she has genuinely enjoyed as well. 

The ones my wife liked were Parasyte (her personal favorite anime), Steins;Gate, Toradora, and Boku Dake ga Inai Machi

Sadly, she says she cries too much in life anyway and refuses to watch some of the other great romances like Clannad and Your Lie in April

If you want to try another shounen I suggest JoJo because the battles not involve only strenght but strategy too and has an epic atmosphere. Also the first 3 seasons have very muscular men (   ) while from 4th onward they are very fabulous.


If she is not easly bored and wants a long serious series I suggest Monster.

For something with sports Ping Pong the animation.

For mental battles with gambles Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor.

I would suggest also fma:b but it is a bit risky, she might not like it.
>> ARTICLE
ping pong might put her off, not saying its a bad show, but shes been reluctant to give anime a chance and ping pong isnt a good anime to watch when youre new to the medium (not saying its unwatchable but not great for first timers).

My only successful experience here is with Psycho-Pass, which is more realistic than most.  I chose it in particular because of the strong female lead, decent pacing, strong first episode, toned down/absent anime tropes, and similarities to western live-action series.  

fwiw, turning on the dub was like flipping a light switch for their interest.  Perhaps new viewers might be more receptive towards dubs in general, I don't know.

There's also the [josei](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/recommendations#wiki_josei) demographic specifically geared towards women.
>> ARTICLE
If she wants a show even more like Criminal Minds, then Detective Conan.  Fairly episodic, and there are a lot of episodes. There is an overarching story but it doesn't progress too quickly.
>> ARTICLE
I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying is the only correct answer
>> ARTICLE
Maybe watch some awesome movies with her. Anime has a ton of awesome movies. Actually im not sure if i totally agree with GITS. Gits doesn't have as compelling a story as Death Note. I mean it's fucking awesome, but yeah. Maybe Ano Hana, Baccono, Steins;Gate..
>> ARTICLE
<Your Lie in April>

Fantastic series that has a rewatch coming up in the next week.
>> ARTICLE
Monster. Kinda slow but holy crap the story is good. Kinda like death note but with no fantasy.
You could also try Death parade, Ghost in the shell, Mushi-shi, Cowboy bebop, Gankutsuou and Terror in resonnance. They are all dubbed and are easy entries into the world of anime.
>> ARTICLE
My friend made me watch Death Note, my first, and I went straight to Code Geass, my second, because the first episode was on related videos on youtube of the last episode of death note.

Got me into anime properly and the whole mastermind plan thing is a similar theme.


>> ARTICLE
I recently watched Death Note too. Has she finished it? Please share some of her reactions of the key moments. I have been looking for good reactors on Youtube, but there aren't almost any good ones. I was surprised since Death Note is so popular. The only good reactor I could find was from https://www.youtube.com/user/GrisslesVault . He is also watching Death Note as his first anime after not watching for a long time.
>> ARTICLE
What about physcopath?
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate imo
>> ARTICLE
Steins Gate might be a good idea
>> ARTICLE
Toradora, Baccano, and Log Horizon are great ones for her at this point.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate or anything from Hosoda or Ghibli would be good choices. Bebop and maybe Trigun too. 
>> ARTICLE
My girlfriend sounds similar. She loves Death Note and is into crime drama shows (and isn't a fan of a lot of more popular anime). A few that she's really liked are:

* Psycho Pass
* Ergo Proxy
* Monster
>> ARTICLE
If she is into more dramatic stuff then Nana would be a great choice, it's very realistic slice of life drama. Though I have been told by others that it's art style is a bit wonky but it didn't bother me.
>> ARTICLE
I'd suggest the classic [NANA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/877/Nana).

No fantasy, no blood or violence, very real life story of two young women both named Nana living in Tokyo.
>> ARTICLE
I would recommend Steins gate, its got everything in the show: abit of comedy, sci-fi, mystery , action and romance. Its the show that got we hooked on anime
>> ARTICLE
My GF got hooked on HxH so much she replayed the first episode (and on) few minutes after the last, refusing to acknowledge that there's simply no more bits.  
Your Lie in April, Shokugeki no Soma and NGNL are sureshots. Surprisingly enough she got hooked on Bleach, however I let her watch only nonfiller episodes.  
Summer Wars, Gin no Saji and Kuroko no Basuke are all amazing movie and series, although a little long shots, meaning it depends on literally first episode yay or nay.
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai yori is really great and I think it's what you're looking for.

Also, I think you should reconcider the bit about the movies, there are some *really* good movies out there. Its probably not exactly what you're looking for, but redline is a ton of fun. It's a beautifully animated silly, rule-of-cool kind of movie and I highly recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
How about Hunter X Hunter (not super realistic lol)?  FMA and FMAB are also pretty good intro anime though the science in it is more like fantasy magic sooo maybe too much fantasy stuff...  Steins Gate is another really good one that I think is pretty similar to Death Note in some ways.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like Steins;Gate will be a good choice, although there are quite a bit of Japanese Otaku references (it's set in Akiba after all, but it doesn't go overboard or focus on it)
>> ARTICLE
I just figure she is more comfortable in them. Of course I could have no way of proving this, I just figured that she wore them for comfort reasons. Or perhaps it's easier to move around with them in place of pants? 
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass for sure! 
>> ARTICLE
My wife enjoyed Bleach and Naruto. But I made sure to skip the filler. 
>> ARTICLE
Dearh Parade maybe? IDK, most are suggested already..
>> ARTICLE
It has quite a bit of gore but psycho pass is a brilliant cyberpunk crime drama following around a police team in a dystopian Japan.

And yes it's available in English.
>> ARTICLE
My mother has seen exactly one anime, Whisper of the Heart. She loved it. Then she rented Azumanga and the interest fizzled.

This was on her own, mind you. I wasn't involved.

My girlfriend absolutely loved Chihayafuru and Silver Spoon when I was first showing her a couple shows.  She's also liked Erased, Toradora, Spice and Wolf and Steins;Gate.  One that surprised me the most was that she really liked Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!?  Showed her Working!! as well recently and she enjoyed it, but I feel she found the characters to just be to overly ridiculous.

Death parade all the way

ERASED or shouwa genroku for sure
>> ARTICLE
Just did the same thing with my girlfriend. She loves Death Note, but is hesitant to try any others.

If she is a fan of romance then try Clannad.
If you can get her through the first season then Clannad After Story will probably become her all time favorite. My gf loved it and she is the same with gore and the like.
>> ARTICLE
From another post on r/anime https://i.imgur.com/q9Xjv4p.jpg
>> ARTICLE
Slice of life - Toradora, Ouran High School Host Club, which is kind of a reverse harem but I still really enjoyed it as a guy, it wasn't fan serviced all over the place.
A bit of fantasy - No Game No Life - a bit more fantasy but a fun watch in regards to thinking.
If she's into sports at all there's Haikyuu, Baby Steps, Kuroko's Basketball.  
Good luck, my wife won't watch anime at all.
>> ARTICLE
I think Death Parade is a good shot. Shows how serious anime can be with human desires and delusions, and has great plot
>> ARTICLE
Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis if she likes Pirates of the Caribbean.
>> ARTICLE
Steins gate is an obvious choice, charismatic main character and sci fi plot that is totally amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Zankyou no Terror. She'll probably think why the hell are 15/16 year teenagers somehow terrorists. But it's a great show.
>> ARTICLE
Monster for sure.. it explores many various themes that many people could relate to. It's unpredictable  and the cast of characters are very unique and memorable. The main enemy is also quite cunning and deceptive. It's a great thriller anime that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
>> ARTICLE
Most of these suggestions are good shows, but Monster is the only good recommendation I've seen based on what you told us.
>> ARTICLE
Has anyone recommended Revolutionary Girl Utena?
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so you're looking for seinen anime and low fantasy anime. Off hand, for dramatic anime, I'd suggest looking at Death Parade, Monster, Kids On The Slope, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Spice and Wolf, UN-GO, Hyouka, Silver Spoon and Steins;gate. If she's willing to watch action shows that aren't too over the top, then then the first season of Darker Than Black (which is basically a low fantasy noir anime), Ergo Proxy, Black Lagoon and Fate/Zero might be good picks. On the comedic side, she might enjoy I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying and possibly Chihayafuru (both have female leads).

Something to keep in mind though: emphasize that anime is a MEDIUM, not a genre. Just because you like soap operas doesn't mean you like the history channel. Similarly, just because you don't like one genre of anime doesn't mean that the other genre of anime is going to up your alley. It might take you awhile, but understand that the anime that SHE might find appealing might not be to your taste. I strongly suggest you find Josei anime (anime designed for adult women) and Seinen (anime designed for adult men) for her to watch. My top 5 recommendations are probably Spice and Wolf (English Dub), Kids on the Slope,  Silver Spoon, Death Parade and Darker Than Black.
>> ARTICLE
It's kind of sad that people need to be reminded that anime is not just a genre. It's part of the problem I have with seasonal anime watchers.
>> ARTICLE
...It's not a 'problem' - it's true that most of anime is interchangeable shonen anime with panty shots and shower scenes galore. That IS a problem that anime is struggles with as it slowly becomes mainstream, and the problem is widespread enough that there's a good reason for the stereotype. 

That being said, the only way to mature anime as a medium is to remind people that other genres of anime ARE available and that it's not all one genre. Just because you like Shonen doesn't mean you'll like Josei and just because you like Seinen doesn't mean you'll like shoujo. I'd love to see anime become much more diverse in general - it'd create a much healthier, more diverse audience for it.
>> ARTICLE
Well I like all of these.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Death Note, but from what you've said about what she likes, maybe [Michiko and Hatchin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4087/Michiko_to_Hatchin) would be a good try? At first glance, since it's an action adventure with the (first) titular character often wearing a bikini top and short shorts, you might think it's too violent or vulgar, but it really isn't. It has no fantasy, and is essentially set in real life (it actually takes place in a fictional country that's basically Brazil, but that doesn't really change much).

It's the story of an orphaned girl (Hana, a.k.a. Hatchin) who escapes from her miserable life with her foster family after a former convict (Michiko) convinces Hana to leave with her to find Hana's father, with whom Michiko is in love. Interposed with the violence (which isn't usually that severe), is some [funny, yet meaningful dialogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNbqvTx474Q&nohtml5=False), as well as some [well developed interaction between the main characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrnqmT3_ckI&nohtml5=False). One of my favorite things is the realistic relationship between them; they had never met before the show starts, and they're basically exact opposites, so their feelings toward each other are pretty rocky from the start, but when you get to the middle, you see their relationship start to grow. As for what your wife likes, while Hana is a child, she's a pretty intelligent, and snarky character, and her lines, especially when she's scolding Michiko, can be pretty funny. And while the show doesn't have the kind of complicated murder plot that, to my understanding, Death Note has, it's not just a show about brute force and gunplay. If the two of you would be interested in a fun adventurous show that at the same time has a strong emotional payoff, you'd enjoy it.

Also, [Funimation has the whole series subbed on Youtube for free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaVz7UYv4vE&nohtml5=False), so that's a plus. Dubs, at least, in high quality, can be a little harder to find, but not too tough. Personally, I watched with dubs and thought the voice acting was great.

My wife is the pickiest woman when it comes to basically anything, I have successfully integrated her into anime, but I have made some mistakes. My experience thus far: Introduced her to anime with Death Note similarly to you. Don't make the mistake of trying to go straight for the throat with a 60+ episode series with movies like Kenshin. Keep it short and sweet. My recommendations are classic 26 episode with solid story, plot, and ending. TRIGUN, Gungrave, Fruits Basket, Hellsing, 12 Kingdoms etc. Stay away from Berserk, FMA, Ninja Scroll. If you're having trouble with series there are always the heavy hitting movies, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke etc...
>> ARTICLE
Death parade is really fantastic and interesting. A next concept of judgi g the dead, and some AWESOME music


 A good down to earth one could be shouwa genroku Rakugo, aimed at older women. Ita also really good, and has a much more mature vibe. The story is so interesting too, being just about this japanese style of theatre entertainment.

The Tatami Galaxy.

Always my recommendation for people who have "the wrong impression of anime." It's not something that you *should* use to get someone hooked on anime\*, but it's something that will help convince them it's not all catgirls and panty shots.

*I don't think it's a good example of anime as a whole; it's my favorite, and I think it's many times better than most anime I see. It kinda breaks the norm, and there aren't really a whooooole lot of anime that do that.

Steins Gate or Evangelion to fuck her mind up

Gungrave has an amazing story.  I literally teared up in the final episode, if you do watch this though SKIP EPISODE ONE AND START ON #2

I think that your standards are set too high for this type of thing. She's a well written and complex character, who is drawn rather provocatively since it is beneficial for her work, she's even shown luring men with her sex appeal and then promptly knocking them out with ease.

Have her watch One Punch Man. Everybody loves One Punch Man.

Try Stein's Gate.

It starts off light-hearted, feels very human and gets you hooked on the characters.  Then halfway through the series, the sci-fi kicks in and shit gets real fast, without being too outrageous.

Monster
>> ARTICLE
I always hear people recommending DN to beginners but I don't think it is a good beginner anime, it has Supernatural monsters, over the top characters, screaming and intense chip eating and so on, I love it but it may turn down people who expect something more grounded. 

Go with Monster or Another, worked well with my friends.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, wolf children is good, but I, on a second thought, would rather recommend ERASED, it's great, the plot is exciting and "great for the imagination" murder mystery and not fantasy. Best anime I've watched in a year. (Also no fan service)
>> ARTICLE
I think something like Psycho Pass or even Darker than Black if she likes Death Note. Of course I will also recommend Code Geass as it is my go to recommendation for any new anime watcher :)
>> ARTICLE
This has probably been recommended a lot but if she likes a Criminal Minds type show Psycho-Pass would be very good, just avoid Psycho-Pass 2
>> ARTICLE
How about FMA:B. Story is nice. It's fantasy but not too crazy and it's something you can kind of follow, the gore isn't terrible/unnecessary and my favorite plot. 

Monogatari is a great series but I can imagine that it's not something that she'll love based on what you said. Similarly, the durarara series.

My lie in april is great and anohana is a really well done series imo.

 You could ride the hype train with boku dake ga inai machi. 

Shouwa genroku rakugo shinjuu is an enjoyable watch and I've never really watched the genre but I'll definitely be open to it because of it.

Baccano is a very enjoyable series for the most part.

I haven't finished shirobako but it's been very good so far and several people really like it.

I think haikyuu is an enjoyable series regardless of what genres you like/dislike and what gender you are.

Cowboy bebop, trigun, rurouni kenshin, ghost in shell are some classics.

There are also countless phenomenal anime movies.

[Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass) has the same aspects of toned-down fantasy, cunning, strategy, and is much closer to real life.  There's no vulger jokes or fanservice or ridiculous anime faces that turn casuals off of the medium.  The dub is also great, so if she can't stand subs, there's that.

I would suggest psycho pass, great anime and a similar criminal theme

Code Geass .

Steins;Gate

It's not that the beginning is bad, but rather that it has a lot of strange maymays and otaku stuff that really wouldn't mean anything to a new anime fan.

Cowboy Bebop? Something a little more action rather than crime scene, but the bounty hunter aspect is there.

Maybe let her 'dip' her toe into Fullmetal Alchemist? Just the initial episode with Father Cornello would tell her/you if that would be something she'd like too? So not a lot of wasted time, and that could help get her into a little more of the fantasy aspect.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann, Steins Gate and Fate Zero are good ones
>> ARTICLE
Cunning, strategy, imagination? Try No Game No Life.
>> ARTICLE
Psycho Pass for sure! And Steins;Gate is she likes eccentric characters (although there is some mild vulgarity).

If she likes cunning and strategy, Code Geass might work in an attempt to tolerate more action and fantasy.

Durararara might work too.
If she can tolerate the violence, I'd say Baccano...

What shows does she like to watch in general. That might help more in finding an anime equivalent.

Hey, all! First time watcher here. Not sure if I'll comment here every day, but I'll try to pop in sometimes. This rewatch finally gave me the kick in the pants to watch this bit of anime canon. Unfortunately, being a long-time member of the anime community, I've been spoiled on the ending. I am Not Happy about that, but I'm excited nonetheless.

Okay, today's episode! Light scares me a bit. At certain points, his actions seemed almost noble. And they do have that quality, but they're overshadowed by his hunger for power. He clearly has delusions of grandeur--except with the power of the Death Note, they're not delusions anymore. I'm troubled by his standard of who deserves to die. For example, he considered killing the class bully, whose offenses I don't believe warrant a death sentence.

Light should be a really fun protagonist to watch. He reminds me of Lelouch in a lot of ways. I'm sure it's a common comparison. 
>> ARTICLE
Death Note was an influence on Code Geass in several ways

Oh, interesting. I...am unsure about that but we'll see how that plays out then.

> At certain points, his actions seemed almost noble. And they do have that quality, but they're overshadowed by his hunger for power.

For example, he considered killing the class bully, whose offenses I don't believe warrant a death sentence.

This pretty much sums up my feelings on the dude. I always said that after all the Zodiac Killers and Ted Bundys of the world are gone, then Light's just gonna start offing people he doesn't like and then he won't seem so noble anymore. Honestly, I never really got people who supported his actions because it's never seemed all that ambiguous to me. Maybe if he was reluctant about it, even I would get it, but clearly the guy's a megalomaniac who, in the end, only has his own agenda in mind.
>> ARTICLE
There are definitely a lot of people who like to think that in Light's position they would do the same thing. So they're probably just vicariously living through the character thinking that they could be as smart and cool as Light and 'kill the bad guys'.

I do agree that once the criminals are gone, assuming Light can even get that far without being caught, it's no longer a mission of justice. That's when Light will really turn into a god, so to speak. He will have the power to shape the world as he sees fit. And while that's fun for Light, it's unfair to everyone else.

Maybe Light won't end up like that though. Maybe he'll 'do the right thing'. Gonna be fun to see how he uses the new power he's obtained.
>> ARTICLE
> assuming Light can even get that far without being caught

I actually would like to think that it's almost impossible to get caught if done correctly. It's just writing down names in a notebook, Light could even create a perfect alibi for himself by writing down names in a public place (like a library). It's not like the ordinary person will suspect that a notebook has this kind of power. 
>> ARTICLE
> Maybe Light won't end up like that though. Maybe he'll 'do the right thing'.

/Insert Jeremy from Cinemasins' laugh.

*ahem* Sorry.

Anyway, I think Light is incapable of doing the right thing, honestly. I just can't see it coming from him, especially after he's felt the power the Death Note gives him.
>> ARTICLE
I can only hope that he gets too full of himself, messes up badly, and realizes all that's left to do is attempt to redeem himself, which won't be enough to actually do so.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah! I get the sense from Light's monologue that the power of the Death Note is addictive. So after all the unambiguously evil people were dead, he'd have free rein (and freer conscience, from his perspective) to impose his own standards of judgment on the world. Scary. 

You know, it would be cool if the Death Note was sentient, or it turned out to actually have the power/motive to compel its owner to use it. No spoilers, y'all, just speculating here! 
>> ARTICLE
> You know, it would be cool if the Death Note was sentient, or it turned out to actually have the power/motive to compel its owner to use it. No spoilers, y'all, just speculating here!

That would be crazy weird, but also cool. I would then want a shot of the Death Not at the end saying, "All according to keikaku." And then it would fly off with the spellbook from Hocus Pocus.

...I... I need this crackfic now.
>> ARTICLE
Light even mentions to Ryuk near the end of the episode that he senses that the Death Note has an aura that compels people to try writing in it at least once.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, maybe not that off-the-walls nuts...It's hard to explain. Not *sentinent* but if there was something supernatural about the Death Note that turned good guys bad.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean. I'm just being a nightposter. ...I'm just gonna say nightblogger. It sounds better that way.

But it's still a really interesting idea. The evil object that slowly turns people bad is a good trope.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Code Geass is usually recommended to people after watching Death Note since the protagonists are very similar, and Death Note tends to be a very common barrier anime.

Even if you are spoiled on the ending, the journey is tremendously better.  Also I'd say the first half is way better than the 2nd, which to this day I still can't remember after 3 rewatches.
>> ARTICLE
Light's definitely Lelouch-esque.

I agree that it's tough to pin down exactly what Light wants. He believes what he's doing is the 'right thing', but he is murdering a whole ton of people. And while he wants to be the absolute ruler of a new world, he also believes that he's sacrificing himself in order to make the world a better place. Can't wait to see what's in store for us with him.
>> ARTICLE
> Light's definitely Lelouch-esque.

When I first got into Code Geass, I spent more time comparing it to Death Note than watching it, honestly.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that he thinks he's doing something bad. He just justifies their deaths by thinking to himself that they don't deserve to live or that his goals justify the means.
>> ARTICLE
He definitely doesn't. Light is far to narcissistic and self-righteous to even be able to *entertain* the idea that he might be wrong about this. It just wouldn't compute.
>> ARTICLE
When you kill someone, you change, IMO Light sacrificed who he was in order to save humanity.
>> ARTICLE
> he also believes that he's sacrificing himself in order to make the world a better place

Interesting. I didn't get that self-sacrificing vibe from what he said and did in this episode. It all seemed very narcissistic once the "I'll be the god of this new world" motive was uncovered. Mind elaborating? 
>> ARTICLE
It's during his monologue near the end, when he's explaining himself to Ryuk. He says:

"Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it... because the world *can't* go on like this."

So while he does think he is the only one capable of doing this, he also came across as, hmmm, maybe trying to justify his desire to be the one to use the Death Note. So he acts like he's sacrificing himself, even if he's really into using the notebook anyway.
>> ARTICLE
You're right! I don't know how I forgot about that line already. My translation had it as "sacrificing one's conscience and life", which gives it a slightly different flavor. Again, it's immediately tempered by is arrogance; in the following line he says that "only he" can do it. Just now I also noticed his line about how the Death Note compels everyone to try its power. Cool stuff! Now that we're digging into this, I'm understanding how much characterization they packed into this episode.

What source are you using to watch this? I'm interested in possibly switching; you mentioned yours has translation notes about the content of the Death Note, which mine doesn't.
>> ARTICLE
I just transcribed the dub. I guess the different translations could cause it to mean different things. It may have caused me to originally overplay it. You're right though, he immediately brushes it off and shows his (probable) true colors; his arrogance.

I'm using Netflix to watch the dub. They don't have any notes. I have one sub version that I'm not sure of the source, actually. That one stated the notes [like this.](http://i.imgur.com/L51R3TG.png) The other is from DarkDream, maybe. I don't know many sub groups or their names. That one stated the notes [like this.](http://i.imgur.com/RoGV9rq.png)

Your best bet is to just look on different sites or try a different download. As you can see, each version was different so *I* can't say for sure what version is best.

The moral of the story :Never look out the window during class.Pay attention.

Light Yagami before discovering deathnote is basically Oreki Haotaru (of [Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka)), both are lazy people who are very tired of life, see themselves as the greyest of the grey and are top tier energy conservationist. The only difference between them Light found a book and Oreki found Chitanda.

So I, your host for this rewatch, am also participating as a first-timer. What? Im crazy? Well, maybe just a little. Im not sure if anyone has done this before, but Im doing it anyway so deal with it. 

Ill start off by saying that similar to Fullmetal Alchemist, Death Notes premise is one I find interesting whereas with Code Geass and Baccano! I didn't know much about the series before their rewatches. So Im expecting to enjoy this one quite a bit, so lets do this.

---


Day 1 - Netflix is having trouble playing this title right now. *Hits ok and presses play again* Netflix, youre a fucking liar.

---

Oh, cool. Didnt know MADHOUSE made this show. Thats pretty neat though they may not be the exact same studio anymore.

[This guys design is great. Hes creepy af. Ryuk is his name.](http://i.imgur.com/XdZDg4h.png)

[Fanasonic. I love when shows have the sound alike names for real brands.](http://i.imgur.com/cb3iQw2.png) Damnit, though. That 'n' is just slightly misaligned. Mildly infuriating.

Really cool way of setting up the parallel between these two main guys. Theyre both bored with the world they live in. I thought Ryuk was going to be more of an over-the-shoulder type of apparition to Light, but it seems hes pretty real and might play a bigger role than I thought.

[How the hell is this not a comment face?](http://i.imgur.com/ersDUdX.png)

I like this. Lights just getting right to it. At least hes starting off by killing a bad guy.

Dub says the girls are having a speed dating *party.* [Ok.](http://i.imgur.com/PmD5C8Z.jpg) I also have two different subs, one says they're going drinking, the other says they're partying with guys. But this friggin nerd kid... he's complaining about his mom not picking him up in all three versions. Quit bitching.

Lights thought process is interesting. Wondering if the world would be better off if some of the, lets call them, undesirables, were to disappear.

Light is something else. He wants to see immediate results. So this one scumbag on the motorcycle [says his own name](http://i.imgur.com/7wspSNx.png) out loud *once*. Light notices that he might cause trouble for the girl, [so he stops, and takes in his name.](http://i.imgur.com/xV8rlCN.png) Light goes inside the store and stands by the window, [picking up a magazine](http://i.imgur.com/Je0xx3t.png) (or, umm, weird Japanese manga or book or something) to hide the Death Note. He writes [a bunch of different spellings of that guys name](http://i.imgur.com/zWbPGsl.png) to make sure he gets the right one. Light is a fucking genius. Love it. [Nice and quick.](http://gfycat.com/PoorDismalGuineafowl)

Netflix doesnt have those little translation notes so for anyone watching there, you might need another source to get some of it. The example here being that I didnt know what Light was writing in the notebook. Obviously that guys name a bunch of times, and how he should die (an accident). Actually, I had two the different sources to get all of that. Minorly annoying.

And were those guys really just going to assault that girl in the middle of the street, right outside a convenience store? Stupid.

Any particular reason that the Death Note is written in English and not Japanese?

Ryuk dropped it? Really? You clumsy fool.

[Spread your wings, and ~~fly~~ fall away.](http://gfycat.com/LazyRipeGourami)

Awww, Lights mom is so proud of his good grades. How sweet.

Holy shit. Light wrote that many names in the book. In just five days. Good lord, that was fast. Mom wouldnt be proud of that.

Be warned. Youre gonna be stuck in limbo if you use the book. Oh wait, you already used it. Sucks for you.

English; the most popular language in the human world. Alright, wasnt ready to get an answer so fast.

So Ryuk didnt really just drop it. He was bored and wanted to come down and have some fun.

Light *maaaay* be little crazier than I thought. He wants everyone to know who is bringing down justice to the worlds criminals. Well, hes also a bit self-sacrificing here. He *did* came to this conclusion quite fast though, but I guess we *are* told he is bored with the world, and this is something incredibly interesting and noble for him to pour his time in to.

And now both Light and Ryuk are no longer bored. This looks like its gonna be a fun series.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future** ^(read like Jeopardy's before and after category)

I'm liking the dub. Briand Drummond is Ryuk, and Brad Swalle is Light. Both are great. It helps that I haven't heard them in any other roles yet. Ryuk sounds better than I thought he would, and Light sounds like a calm yet slightly deranged teenager.

Ryuk also seems like a pretty fun guy for a god of death. I love the way he says "yum" and "juicy". Especially because the "yum" just cuts away, and he keeps ignoring Light so he can eat apples. [Example.](http://puu.sh/nn2Qr.webm)

I can't say I have much to go on just yet in terms of speculation. Light *did* kill a crap ton of people though, and they all likely died around the same time. Like one continuous streak of deaths. Someone's going to investigate that so let's see how long it takes until they start snooping around Light. He's going to have to get more clever with his kills if he wants to lay low. Learn about his targets to make their deaths seem natural within the context of their lives.

Also, when Ryuk warned Light that humans who use the Death Note go to neither heaven nor hell... hmmmm, so another human will probably end up using the Death Note besides Light. Maybe a love interest, if there is one. That way they can spend forever together. How romantic.

Welp, this was a long-ish one, but this was the first episode. Actually, ~6000 characters isn't *too* bad.

Also, all of the webms that I make during this rewatch are dedicated to /u/Saikimo who has tirelessly helped me through the numerous troubles Ive had. With his knowledge, I can now bring to you the highest quality clips that Ive ever been able to make. Thanks again, *Saikimo*!

Definitely enjoying it. Light is extremely interesting so I'm excited to see how he specifically handles his problems. Will he start out by just killing anyone who gets in his way? Will he learn to be cautious with his kills? Will he end up not wanting to kill anymore by the end?

Should be fun.

I'm honestly shocked he was the first Shinigami to think to do this. There's no real rule forcing them not to, and it's not like they have anything better to do.

Well, only being on episode one there doesn't seem to be any rule. Maybe later on they'll give a reason why interfering with the human world is considered a bad thing. Perhaps Light (aka any human the Shinigami interact wit) will be able to amass great power and challenge the Shinigami realm.

Honestly while Brian Drummond is the Vegeta I think is better I've gotten too used to Chris Sabat.

Did this dub ever actually finish? There was only 3 dubs right? Ocean, Funimation and Kai?

Drummond seems like he may have been a better fit in the long run, but I grew up listening to Sabat play Vegeta. That's just too much to overcome.

And I have no idea if they finished that dub. The three you named are the only three I'm aware of.

I had heard that one of the dubs never finished and I have the last volume of Funimation's dub so I assume it was the Ocean dub that was never completed.

Yeah, Funimation's dub is definitely done and Kai's is, still ongoing maybe. I guess if one never finished, it was Ocean.

The first time around I felt like I could almost relate to Light for the first few episodes but this time around he really does just feel like a villain to me from the very start.

"And I would create a new world of earnest, kind humans"
"Then you'd be the only one left with a bad personality"   
Such a great quote from this episode. Ryuk saw what was happening from the start.

Also, the writing scene will give me goosebumps no matter how many times I watch it.

It's kinda like Breaking Bad a decade earlier.

Oh man,this [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBvhzYLgZUM) is amazing!

Man, I really like rewatches to follow along with everyone's thoughts and comments day by day, but after seeing the first episode again, there's no way I'm gonna be able to restrain myself from bingeing it.

This is one of the first anime I ever watched, and it was the one that showed me that anime could offer narratives with more substance than the ones I had previously been exposed to (Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, Sailor Moon... nothing against those though). It awakened my interest in shows and movies centered around intellectual maneuvering and "battles of the wits". Even though I loved it so much when I first watched it, I've still only seen it once. It will be cool rewatching it after all this time now that i have 100+ series under my belt.
>> ARTICLE
I slept in really really late, but I'm here now guys! I've seen Death Note about 4 or 5 times already and rated it a 9 because I really love this show. Anyways let's get to business.

- Haven't seen anyone mentioning the OP yet. I really love all of the music in this show a lot and the first OP might be my favorite piece of music in it. I also really love that [Spoilers] (/s "It kind of makes this look like some sort of supernatural or fantasy anime when that's really only a small element of the show.")

- Note to all anime teachers: If there's a kid sitting in the back looking out the window all class he's going to be trouble. 

- I honestly forgot how fucking scary Ryuk can look sometimes and his English VA really captures the creepy atmosphere around him perfectly.

- The first time I watched and his mom came in the room I thought she'd be able to see him and have a panic attack or something.

- Poor Ryuk he's just a bored Shinigami with no apples to eat up there. You better take good care of him Light he's fragile :(

- Holy shit towards the end of this episode when Light is talking really fast and sounding like some sort of lunatic about how messed up the world is I got the creeps.

- "I'm a hard working honor student who's considered to be one of Japan's best and brightest" you're also a murderer Light, but kudos on the GPA.

- "And I will become the God of this new world" #justhighschoolthings

Overall I love this episode and it's a great way to at the very least gain interest from the new viewers. If I could go back and watch this for the first time ever I totally would because it's such a fun ride. But even rewatching it can be almost as exciting. Also I can't wait to [Spoilers] (/s "meet L and see the new viewer's reactions to him since he is certainly another odd character, but one of my all time favorites.")

Yeah, never understood that myself, I don't want to think that it was there just so Light can kill someone he doesn't know and get conformation immediately, but it's probably the reason.
>> ARTICLE
That's definitely the only reason why.

>that was the guy on the bike giving his full name out for literally no reason?

Death Note is my favorite anime, but that was a really dumb moment. What kind of rapist announces his first and last name? Anyways, you should probably get hooked by episode 2, it sets up the story and you should have an idea of how things will go on from there.

I think it's because the guy on the bike is an asshole and is full of himself. However, Light is quite lucky he did.

This is my second watchthrough so I'll try the English dub this time. I've heard it's great so I expect great things (and I'm looking forward to at least one "Light" pun that I know is coming). It's been years since I've watched the series though so there'll probably be a lot of minor plot points I don't remember and I certainly won't be able to compare the voice acting.

I like Ryuk's voice. Not how I would have expected it but it's great. Not so sure about Light's voice. It already grew on me a bit during the episode, and I hope it'll continue to do so [spoilers for the next few episodes](/s "though he gets replaced by a different main character soon, so perhaps the voice will simply change to fit that character"). The teacher voices are really boring on purpose, and I love that.

The End. Roll credits.

Light is correct in that it's kinda similar to chain letters, but he forgot to mention that it's way less annoying because you don't have to forward things to other people.

Silly nerd main character. Actually reads the fucking manual. Who even does that, much less before trying it out for the first time.

> Well, one can only hope for a quick resolution to this situation.

You're very welcome, news reporter. I hope 40-ish seconds is quick enough for you.

Props to our main character for properly testing his device instead of jumping to conclusions from just one result. Then again, maybe not the best idea in this specific case. And to answer your question, Light: Yes, there is definitely something wrong with you for wanting to use your magic murder book on some guy who is bullying a student into giving him the breathtaking amount of ... two or three bills worth of money, and probably not large bills.

Not related to the plot at all but once again there's characters talking about mixers. Still not sure if that's an actual thing in Japan or just an anime thing.

You got all that, random bystander within earshot who I really hope doesn't need to know my personal information for plot related reasons?

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/dIKNCxd.png) Light writes the character's name 10 or so times because he only heard it and doesn't know how it's supposed to be spelled. [Later in the series](/s "we learn that a person whose name is misspelled three times becomes immune to the Death Note. Realistically this is probably a rule the authors made up as they went along but in-universe, the chance that the series would have ended right here is pretty large.")

Top kek.

So Light expected Ryuk to take his soul or something. He also intended to continue writing names even after Ryuk showed up. I am not sure how he expected to do so without a soul.

> Be warned, any human who has used a Death Note can neither go to heaven or hell for eternity

Well you could have mentioned that a bit sooner, perhaps should have written it into the manual or something. [manga spoilers](/n "The anime doesn't mention this but at the end of the manga it is revealed that there is neither heaven nor hell, all humans go to nothingness even if they never use a Death Note.

It's like, sure, we've all thought about swerving off the road and hitting some person on the sidewalk, but in the end, we don't. So at least Light doesn't actually kill the bully. That's something, I guess.

And you know, it always seems the bullies are the ones who need the most help anyway (bad home life/tough upbringing). Simply eliminating them would be too easy and perhaps unfair.

This is going to be my first time that I've gotten into a rewatch where I've seen most of the series but haven't seen it through to the end, but I know how it ends because I've had it spoiled for me. Incidentally, that was not the reason why I stopped, I was actually excited to find out how what they told me happened would come about, but I just wound up putting it down and never finishing. I intended to watch again from the beginning if I ever was going to finish it, so this is a pretty good opportunity, I think.  

I don't remember the exact year, but I was in junior high school when Death Note was getting popular in America. I didn't give Death Note a try until a little while after the hype around it started to die down while everyone else was getting into DN I was giving most of my attention to Haruhi and Naruto, so it was really weird being in public school where a portion of the geeky population started openly talking about/wearing anime stuff, yet still wasn't into anything that I was watching.

Anyway, talking about the actual show: aren't Ryuk and Light just wonderful people/gods? "I'm bored so I want to watch a bunch of people die," "and I'm bored so I'm going to kill people I deem unworthy for his entertainment!" Our main characters ladies and gentlemen!

Looking back, I'm sure they'll care. We all do dumb things when we're younger, but anime related stuff can probably cause some strange regrets.

Though Death Note seems like it'll be pretty tame in terms of anime-ness.
>> ARTICLE
Hallo~

Yeah, it is really tame. It's not like, say, wearing a Naruto headband to school.

/slowly crumbles into dust from embarrassment.

But at least I only did it the one time. And I never did the ninja run like this one kid who my sister goes to school with. I can't be mad at him, though. He's living his life. Good for him.

Ooooooohhhh, you did it.

That sounds like a ton of fun, but some things you should just save for when you're playing around at home.

Oh jeez, I can imagine some kids replicating the look of the Death Note and carrying it around school, writing their classmates names in it. That'd get you sent to the principal's office.

Real talk, some kids in Virginia and one of the Carolinas, I think, got suspended and or expelled for having Death Notes and writing names in them. This was years ago when I was still in high school, but yeah.

Get ready for half-tired, probably really dumb observations, everyone. My sleep pattern is awful and I had a busy day, so I just woke up like half an hour ago . From (starting) typing this, anyway.

I couldnt decide what language to watch this in so Japanglish sudub it is. Until I get too lazy to watch each episode twice and just start watching it in English because the link in closer at hand, tbh. Well see.

Oh, the joys of karaoke style OPs and EDs. This isnt a joy of life I have experienced in a long time. The music in this show is just like /melts. Death Note has my favorite soundtrack of any anime. I cant tell if I like the normal stuff or the pseudo-Catholic(???) choir stuff better. But the opening song (not the OP but the first song used in the show) in this episode is so good and so perfect, and there probably arent a lot of shows that start with something like that, so it was a smart choice in terms of trying to get people interested, I think.

Honestly, Im not sure I blame Ryuk. Like, yeah, look at what happens, but seeing the Shinigami word made me feel bored as hell too and I wasnt even there. That seems like not a fun place to just wind up. In fact it seems like one of the worst places. I dont cope with extreme boredom all that well, either, Ryuk. I get it, man. Speaking of boredom, this might have never even happened if Light picked up a hobby or something. I mean, that other kid was on his DS in class. Seemed to be working out well for him. You couldnt just doodle all over your notebook, or something, man?

Fun fact, y'all: the names Rocky Balboa and Neo Anderson are in the Death Note in the first volume of the manga.

Mamo-chan is so good at creepy laughs. Its actually really uncomfortable for me. Like, eugh.

I wonder if it was a deliberate choice to make Light look so bishie when he was reciting one of the rules to Ryuk. Like I get that that juxtaposition is the point, but they put a lot of detail into those big, brown eyes during that particular moment. Later on when he says hes the most virtuous student or whatever, that was obviously the point, but that was a lot more obvious than just stating the rules. Speaking of which, I've always found it interesting that someone was narcissistic as Light only referred to himself as boku as opposed to ore. Hes totally blind to his budding megalomania and instead of having Ryuk lampshade that or something, they just use simple pronouns. You dont get that kind of thing in the English dub. ~I love it~

Im watching the dub now and Im not sure I have much to say except why is my mom so useless guy is my fave. And also, Im glad I decided to do both cause even know Im not sure which to choice having heard both. Mamo-chan is so good, but Brad Swaile is so good and I really cant pick one or the other.

OK, English dub Lights laugh makes my skin crawl too. Please stop this.

Anyway, in terms of the discussion topic, I distinctly remember having a debate with a friend in high school wherein I basically argued that Light is a trashcan, so I think that says it all.

They're singing an arrangement of the [Kyrie chant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie). (Kyrie eleison / Christe eleison / Kyrie eleison -- lit. Lord have mercy / Christ have mercy / Lord have mercy.)

Welcome to my world. Gotta make time for DN though.

> Like, yeah, look at what happens, but seeing the Shinigami word made me feel bored as hell too and I wasnt even there.

I'd be interested to learn more about that world. Like, yeah, why are all of those gods of death that freaking bored? What exactly is the purpose of their world? How is it technically connected to the human world?

> You couldnt just doodle all over your notebook, or something, man?

You don't write the persons name in the Death Note, you have to draaaaaw them. That'd be interesting to see.

> Light only referred to himself as boku as opposed to ore

> You dont get that kind of thing in the English dub. ~I love it~

Yeah, I was reading that thinking "what is boku and ore?" I'm watching the dub though... So boku and ore are pronouns, ways for males to refer to themselves? I feel like I've heard characters go, "Ore..." and then they trail off before continue speaking.

> Anyway, in terms of the discussion topic, I distinctly remember having a debate with a friend in high school wherein I basically argued that Light is a trashcan, so I think that says it all.

Yay, someone answered it! Harsh though. Poor Light.

They are. Typically boku is for boys/is deferential and humble and ore is masculine and boastful. In broad strokes, obviously. I don't know all the nuances of Japanese pronouns.

No, he's just a trashcan. No poor Light. 

(I swear I don't actually hate this character.)

First off hi how you all doing, I'm [Saikimo](/u/Saikimo) and I won't shut up about some of the German voice actor the next few episodes, if you were in the FMA rewatch you will probably know me for that.

So just explain how this will go, whenever I recognize a German voice actor by the sound of his/her voice alone I will post his role his name and the characters I associate with that voice.

Without further a do here the rundown for todays episode:

- Ryuk (Bernd Kuschmann): Voiced [father Cornello](http://i.imgur.com/AvodyEt.jpg) in FMA and FMA:B
- Light Yagami (Kim Hasper): Probably more known as the German voice of [Zach Braff](http://i.imgur.com/A5a7av3.jpg), but he also voices [Jason Biggs](http://images.enstarz.com/data/images/full/31861/jason-biggs.jpg) and [James Franco](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/James_Franco_\(Cropped\).jpg)
- Sachiko Yagami (Petra Glunz-Grosch): Also voiced [Gracia Hughes](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/59485.jpg) in FMA

---

My thoughts and notes about this episode:

Poor Ryuk bored and doesn't know what to do with his time, only gazing into the distance... Aaaand cut to Light who looks equally bored, with [those lifeless eyes](http://i.imgur.com/MbQdA6o.png).

Side note: I've always thought that what the teacher is reading there were bible texts, but apparently it's not, because searching for the quote always gives me that teacher from that episode as source, so if it is from somewhere else I really would like to know what the source is. By the way the teacher is really bad at his job, no discipline in this class room, nobody listens to him, and everyone is doing what he wants, also it looks like he is only interacting with Light here, probably the only student who is able to answer any questions. 

Another thing, Light eyes really can't decide for one colour, first we see him with [red eyes](http://i.imgur.com/MbQdA6o.png) and suddenly they [turn brown](http://i.imgur.com/rj7CBWj.png) in the next scene.

Well lucky for Light to have the MC seat in his class or else he never would've seen the Death Note falling from the sky.

[Notice the reaction of the girls in this scene...](http://i.imgur.com/H0JbPx5.png), looks like Light is pretty well liked by the opposite sex (probably also by some of the same sex).

Also why does Light need to go to a tutoring school? He is Japan's best student, according to the test, still he needs tutoring? Or is he the tutor? 

I love how Lights reason to not kill that bully is: "I shouldn't kill someone I know because that could make me suspicious" so he is over the barrier of "killing is bad, mkay", before he even really confirmed if the Death Note really works, and that what happened with the hostage-taker wasn't just chance.

Also nice of Takuo to introduce himself by full name, so it's easier to report him later to the officials for attempted rape and sexual harassment, or kill him with the Death Note.
 
[Also Light chill a bit you don't need to waste paper](http://i.imgur.com/RxJr0aC.png)

[And again his eyes turned red](http://i.imgur.com/6R72G20.png)  
[And back to brown](http://i.imgur.com/7sG8YqL.png)

>Quite the opposite, I've expected you...

Yeah I always greet visitors I've expected [like this](http://puu.sh/nnAom.webm), that's how we show politeness here in Germany.

Can I say that Ryuk is best guy in this show [Death Note](/s "at the moment")? Because Ryuk is the best. Love how he's always calm about everything.

>Do you really think you were chosen because you're so smart? How smug of you.

Yep Ryuk is the best. Also he already points out one of Lights biggest flaws, his arrogance.

[And red again](http://i.imgur.com/eR1ei9P.png)

Damn I love [Low of Solipsism](https://youtu.be/WEW1PUsPUEI) so much, would make even eating potato chips dramatic, hell it made writing down on a piece of paper exciting.

[And back to brown](http://i.imgur.com/XoHevFb.png)  
[last shot of those sexy red eyes](http://i.imgur.com/6DohoDL.png)

If someone has an eye fetish this show is definitely for him/her.

After Episode thoughts:

I must admit even after watching this episode for the 7th time or so, I still am excited. I really think that this is a very good first episode that makes you wanting more. It establishes the most important rules, it does a good introduction to our main character.

Also why I always pointed out the eyes, because in my opinion you can see how Lights intentions are always shown in his eyes, if he just wants to do evil and is corrupted by the Death Note his eyes turn red.

Also I just rewatched the episode in japanese and I like Ryuks German voice better, could be because I heared the German version first, but I think that Bernd Kuschmann has more sass in his voice, in my opinion. But I like Lights Japanese voice much more.


---

Also since I did a little time-line overview for the Baccano rewatch I could also do a known Death Note rules list:

1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.

> Also why does Light need to go to a tutoring school? He is Japan's best student, according to the test, still he needs tutoring? Or is he the tutor?

This is a thing in Japan. I'd be better at explaining it in my younger, more weebish days, but it's like you go to school and then you go to tutoring school (google has reminded me that these are called cram schools) so you can be the best of the best of the best, sir, with honors.

It's not like in America (or I guess Germany) where it's just for the kids who are having trouble. It's for the overachievers, hence the name.

> Also Light chill a bit you don't need to waste paper

If I were him I would've ripped out pages until I got it right. My poor journals T_T.

Not sure if this is a spoiler, but just in case. [DN: How to Read](/n "Every Death Note has an infinite amount of pages, so he can never run out. If he were to rip out the pages that he's already written in, new ones would just grow in their place. And if he doesn't rip them out, but continues flipping pages in the book, then it will just continue infinitely compressing the pages on either side of the one being written on, so that it always remains the same thickness and weight.")

I've tried to be better about it but every time I mess up I'm like welp time to start over even though this page only has one line left.

Don't worry. I actually do the *exact* same thing when making lists. "Oh, that doesn't look good. I can write better than that." Even if it's one of the first couple items. Whole page. Gone.

Since you understand German, I'd like to recommend you [DasNote](https://www.youtube.com/user/reki333/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=0).

Ryuk had some excellent quips already! I'm impressed. 1) Telling Light that nah, he's not special and 2) pointing out that if Light's plan goes through, he'll be the only bad guy left.

Loved that cut. Established the similarities early on.

Ryuk's eye color? You had a lot of comments about Light's eyes. I can't tell if you just think his eyes are dreamy or if you're subtly trying to say, "look, Light's eyes turn red when he's thinking about death". 

> Also why does Light need to go to a tutoring school? He is Japan's best student, according to the test, still he needs tutoring? Or is he the tutor?

I wondered this too. Maybe you don't come to be the best in Japan without going to cram school.

> Also why I always pointed out the eyes, because in my opinion you can see how Lights intentions are always shown in his eyes, if he just wants to do evil and is corrupted by the Death Note his eyes turn red.

Damnit. Maybe I should just read your entire post first.

> After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

Question for anyone who has seen the show. When Light killed the biker/rapist, how did he die so quickly? When the hostage guy died from a heart attack, it took 40 seconds for it to happen. So shouldn't this other guy have gotten hit by the bus six minutes later? It happened quite fast after Light wrote it.

My favorite part about it is the music. When you see Ryuk, you get the men's verse, and then with Light you get the women's. They're both forboding but it's like the human boy isn't quite right, but he's not as scary as the shinigami. ...Right?

Also, the verse with the women singing is super pretty and Light is super bishie so it fits~.

The time of death doesn't stretch out to six minutes just because you write a specific cause of death. Only if it takes you longer than 40 seconds to finish writing the specifics does the time limit become elongated, and even then you can just cut the time limit even shorter by making the specific time of death be before the six minute mark.

Wait I have a video to cheer you up... sadly it's German but I translated it a while back for  [Mr. Tinfoil](/u/Neawia)

#[Transcript of this video:](https://youtu.be/Jhq2zk1O7l4?t=17s)

0:18

>The rights of the left handed have always been surpressed.  
left handed need to get their rights  
like back then, with this one, do you know what this is? A N64 pad, and where is the analog stick for the delicate control?...  
 IN THE MIDDLE. AND YOU CONTROLLED IT WITH LEFT, LIKE SO

0:40

>AND NOW WHERE ARE WE NOW? I'll tell you by targeting with the right thumb, and who's fault is that? Sony with their fucking Dual Shock pad, the right analog stick, they introduced it,  at the expense of all left handed.

0:56

>And I'm the most dissapointed from the programmers and the developers, because they let us starve at the outstretched right arm, and you know why? Because they don't know what sorrows of the left handed are. They only do some sort of  pseudo left handed option, and feel great then, like "duh we support the left handed" YOU DO FUCKING NOTHING. You know why? You take the right stick switch it with the left one, call it southpaw, and think that help us, IT DOESN'T HELP.

1:28

>The right analog stick, if I'm supposed to switch the cover, so say what direction I jump... LIKE IN MASS EFFECT OR GEARS OF WAR, OR OTHER GAMES... UNCHARTED... actually  every fucking 3rd person game. Then I push the direction and then I need to push the button that gives the command to switch the position. But if this one the X button, then I can't press direction and button simultaneously, that means if you don't put it on the shoulder pad, I CAN'T DO SHIT.

2:02

>Another fact: 15% of the world population are left handed, many of them historical important persons, Albert Einstein, Bob Dylan, Leonardo da Vinci, Leonardo Dicaprio, 50 Cent. Everyone of them famous left handed people, and nobody cares.
 
2:19

>Because, we forgot, because we got turned over, like back then in the 70s, they got hit on the fingers if they wrote with left, some of them have consequential damages, bedwetting, stuttern, anxiety states, I HAVE TWO OF THEM MYSELF, well I don't stutter, still shit.

2:37

>and I know what some of you will say now, hey Eddy I'm also left handed and I have no problems with it, GREAT FOR YOU ASSHOLE, YOU'RE NOT A REAL LEFT HANDED PERSON, A LEFT HANDED PERSON CAN'T EVEN PICK HIS NOSE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND, WE CAN'T HOLD THE TOOTHBRUSH WITH THE RIGHT HAND, WE CAN'T EVEN BRACE WITH OUR RIGHT HAND, LOOK...
SEE? IT'S NOT POSSIBLE

2:57

>I'll prove it, I will now write my name with right, PENCIL... ANOTHER

>With the right hand... 

3:12

>With left...

3:20

>Don't tell me I should learn it, then you learn Japanese, well now we bring all games out in Japanese, what now with learn?
This is discrimination, I'm not invalid.

I actually don't think that bad of Light. I am pretty sure that if I got the DN, I'd probably use it as well. I wouldn't get to a second episode, I'm sure, but I'd make sure to end as much bad people as I possibly can.

Now, this whole philosophical discussion about death penalty and right to live and all that stuff kind of bothers me a little. What is the big deal? Why do we have to care about a guy that was about to rape a girl? Why is killing him a bad thing? Isn't letting live allowing him to not only hurt that girl but also others, and isn't that, by extent, making anyone who does not act to prevent that, equally guilty, to say the least?

I don't really discuss the ramifications, because to me it is pretty clear: there a considerable amount of people whose deaths are going to make the world a better place. The only conundrum is the criteria, which apart from the obvious: murderers, rapist and *Justin Bieber fans*, is probably going to be very hard to define, or impossible even.

Other than that, I'm actually inclined to cheer for Light. [DN](/s "Yeah, he's a douche that ends up bringing more pain than actual justice, but if he hadn't had to waste his time with L, he probably wouldn't have had to do any of that, and if the people who actually work for the law just stayed out of his way, the world would have been a better place, slightly unstable, but still better than it is now.")
>> ARTICLE
I personally think that Light isn't evil himself, he is just corrupted by the Death Note, the problem that we only get to know him as a narcissistic and arrogant ass, is because we only get to really know him after he picks up the Death Note. [Major Spoiler about the middle of the show](/s "I mean when he got his memory wiped and is searching for the new Kira, he shows that he is in fact a nice and relatable guy, with a strong sense for justice, like he's someone completely different, but I want to discuss that later when we reach that point"). So in my opinion it's not Light who is evil, it's the Death Note.

>Why do we have to care about a guy that was about to rape a girl? 

I don't care about that guy, and I think we aren't supposed to but the fact that Light killed someone is what we have to care about, because killing another human being, even if he is a rapist or a murderer or both, is a big barrier that you need to overcome and after that it's only getting easier to kill, and that's the evil about the Death Note it makes killing so easy and disconnected that it doesn't seem like a huge deal anymore to kill someone.
>> ARTICLE
One could make the argument that [spoilers for everything](/s "Light and Kira are different personalities. Light certainly has questionable morals but isn't outright evil, Kira is. Kira takes over some time around the murder of Lindt L. Tailor and with the exception of the memory loss arc and the anime-exclusive end scene, our main character is never seen again.")
>> ARTICLE
~~Could you tag that last little section? It's a little spoilery, not in a specific way, but more of a 'what's to come' way.~~ Thanks so much!

I agree though that I'd likely end up using the Death Note to some extent. All humans would likely be tempted to see if it worked. It's one thing to just watch an anime based on it, but if that book actually came into your own hands, you'd be curious.

Now, to go on what is essentially a murder spree might be taking it a bit far, especially in the first few days of owning the book. But as touchy a subject as it is, surely there are people whose deaths could make the world a better place. It's just extremely difficult to actually identify them without forming a bit of god complex.

Also, you could use the book for good. Like euthanasia or something. There are people who are always suffering.

Lot's of good discussion to be had based on this series, I think. Can't wait to see what everyone has to say as the series unfolds.

Where was this rewatch when [Death note spoilers](/s "Killua beat L")?

[](#hajimepout)
>> ARTICLE
Re-watching this in dub. Should be interesting for me, since I usually watch subs, and I plan on going through with that all the way til the end.  
So far, it's been alright. There were only a couple things that bothered me really - the opening itself wasn't subbed, not really a big deal but it's nice to have it subbed since it's a dub and the studio decided to keep the original OP in apanese, and that male reported guy made chuckle at the way he acted.

As for the anime itself - oh boy, the moment the chorus started chanting, I was immersed again in the world. The OST is so good at conveying what's happening on the screen, at least that's what I remember.  
I'm still not used to the fact that in the first minutes of the 1st episode we get an opening. It's just weird, but I guess that's how it was back in the day.

>> ARTICLE
> oh boy, the moment the chorus started chanting, I was immersed again in the world. The OST is so good at conveying what's happening on the screen, at least that's what I remember.

The soundtrack does this so masterfully through out every episode. Man, this anime is truly one of the best I have seen.
>> ARTICLE
i was thinking of accompanying this rewatch with you guys but after rewatching this first episode it's just too awful, i'm sorry.
>> ARTICLE
What didn't you like about it? 
>> ARTICLE
Well i'm not really directing it towards this episode in specific, but it just made me remember everything that I dislike about the whole anime. Spoilers coming up.

[Death Note](/s "So, I think Light is an awful character, he's very annoying at all times and simply not that interesting. L is acceptable and I actually quite like him. The rest of the characters are really flat and I can't help but dislike them especially Misa and Mello, Mello being extremely annoying as well. The whole first part of the anime up until L dies is not interesting and to me it was pretty obvious what would happen. After L dies it's a bit more suspenseful and hard to predict what would happen, though the second part comes with it's issues, Near and Mello, which aren't nearly as interesting or quirky as L. Apart from this second part being more well written and less predictable like I said the ending is far from unexpected.")

I probably would've liked Death Note more if I hadn't seen much anime before it however. I hadn't seen Monster yet when I watched it but after watching Monster I could really see how uninteresting Death Note's plot and characters are when comparing, since they are of course of the same genre. Despite all of these flaws and super long rant I don't think death note is a BAD anime but it wasn't very fun to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Well I love Death Note very much but still I can agree with every point of your criticism, but for me the combination that this was one of my first anime, and that I enjoy Light as [Death Note](/s "an straight up asshole and villain, really I would hate him if they would've made him relatable from the start, and that L is such a quirky and cool character") make this show so enjoyable for me. I can see the flaws of this show now that I'm older and more critical of what I watch, but still it doesn't bother me as much as it does you, also [Death Note](/s "but yeah fuck Misa worst character in anime for me"). 

Also yeah Monster! Great anime, my second favourite. Still I don't find it really comparable to Death Note, only that it is a bit similiar is the atmosphere and that it is the opposite of Death Note in some aspects.

Well I'm sad that you don't like this anime. But still I can understand your problems with it. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
>> ARTICLE
So far I'm unimpressed. Hopefully the show gets more interesting because I'm as bored of the characters as they are bored of the world.

I watched the whole episode subbed and then skipped around a bit in the dub to compare and the dub seemed rather poor. And considering it takes place in Japan it makes more sense to watch it subbed anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Episode one is only half the hook. I agree that it's actually a pretty bland pilot among all the anime I've seen. Getting the scoop on the note, Light, and how capable he is are what this episode is about. Episode two will intro the rest of the main cast in stunning fashion, particularly Lights nemesis.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 2 is the hook tbh

I feel that if by episode two/three you still don't find yourself hooked, you can safely drop it. Episode 1 is essentially L gloating~

In the end, Light was never able to overcome his greatest foe: his ego.

Victory disease. After beating L, he just became too assured in his own abilities. He makes mistakes all throughout the second half because of his overconfidence, but he never learns from them because they never cost him enough. Until, finally, his hubris catches up with him, and he makes a mistake too big to weasel his way out of.
>> ARTICLE
I never commented for the whole rewatch, but I just wanted to let you know I was always with you. I just suck at writing comments about episodes. Your comments made the rewatch really enjoyable, thanks for that!  
If I'm already here I can say a few things about the last episode(s). I have always been a fan of Light, but I still think this is a great way to end the series. He made mistakes which were unnatural for him, because he got too carried away with his "god of the new world" plan and went insane. It would have been an easy win if he stayed sane and thought of everything as usual.

Hey, well thanks for stopping by now. It's never too late.

Light's insanity/ego was definitely his downfall. I think you're right; if he had stayed sane things would've been too easy for him. He needed a weakness.

Interesting rule. I like it. You'd have to be incredibly careful with the people you wanted to kill. Even moreso if you took the Shinigami eyes deal.

Well it was a good finale overall I think.

The beginning of the last episode was super awkward though I have to say.

I'm glad they addressed Mello dying in the way he did, making it part of his plan to help Near since I didn't like his death before.

Light also wasn't totally defeated, he gave Mikami direct orders and he disobeyed them, if he didn't Light would've won.

I wasn't as big a fan of the last 1/3 of the anime compared to the start but the finale was very good at least.

In the manga he begs Ryuk to write down all their names and he refuses and kills Light on the spot, which I feel is  a much stronger ending. Shows how Light is super desperate and really completes the Ryuk-Light relationship in a better way. 
>> ARTICLE

I wish Ryuk had been around more in the second half of the show, but he really did stay true to his character. He was simply an observer who didn't take sides.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like they didn't include him exactly to avoid those awkward questions. If he was always there then investigators would always be asking him questions. Does he answer honestly? Does he lie and thus further assist Light even though that's not meant to be apart of his character (even though he's already done so)? It would highlight some plot/character holes in the show, so it's easier to just ignore him.

Such an amazing ending. I'm so glad we combined the last two episodes.

There is so much that is well done about the ending. Everything that both characters used is visible from the events of the past few episodes. The sound is great. The voice acting is great. There are so many great shots. Basically, I like it.

I love the desperation as Light's ideas are revealed. The part where he is covered in blood, rolling in a puddle making weird noises before Mikami slits his own throat as a distraction to let Light escape. They are basically just letting their insanity out at that point.

There is also the part after Light escapes and he starts thinking over what happened but his eyes have gone back to what they were for the first few. Something I have seen pointed out before is that Light dies halfway up the staircase which represents what Ryuk said about how someone who uses the death note can't go to heaven or hell. From the shot of Misa stood at the edge of the building they heavily imply she kills herself as well.

I'm glad I took part in the rewatch. I can confirm that Death Note still deserves the 10 I gave it ages ago.

In the manga Misa does not kill herself. It shows a mourning of Kira followers and she's at the front.

Yes, this was the right decision. It was /u/BaseTown's idea to combine them so thank him/her.

I agree. The ending is surprisingly well done considering that everything leading up to it since L's death was of questionable quality. The voice acting *was* great, Brad Swaile (Light) in particular. I loved Mikami's loyalty. He knew he was done for anyway. In fact, his sacrifice was actually worth it. It allowed Light to escape and die in relative peace.

> Mikami slits his own throat as a distraction to let Light escape

That's an interesting interpretation. I always saw it as him committing suicide because the person that he lived for disowned him, and was reduced to this powerless, pathetic figure. His unwavering faith in justice has been destroyed and so he was nothing to live for anymore.


>> ARTICLE
This is pretty much how it's presented in the manga (although his actual death happens off-screen). When Light turns to Mikami and tells him to kill the others, instead of gibbering wordlessly, Mikami rejects him, replying "You're not god. You're nothing more than trash!". In the epilogue, we're told that Mikami committed suicide in prison.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, OK. I recall reading the epilogue but don't remember what happened to Mikami. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
I thought that because Light was yelling at him to do something and Mikami looked like he was desperately looking for something he could do, so settled on violently killing himself.

I feel it was an act of desperation after he was backed so far into a corner the only tool he had to work with was his own body.
>> ARTICLE
Even with Light yelling, I still always interpreted it as a despair event horizon. The wikia colors it as such too. But now, it's like who knows.
>> ARTICLE
I was actually more with /u/oyooy on this one, but your interpretation makes sense too. Maybe it was both his desire to end his own life and in the process attempt to do one final thing for God.

[DELETE!DELETE!DELETE!DELETE!DELETE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv4E9175EOY) - Can I get a german version of this please?           

My man Matsuda, sorry for giving you shit for so many episodes, you're actually one of deathnote better characters, if only for what you did at the end!        

On the ending of Deathnote, credit must given that it ended and ended **well** . Extremely satisfying seeing glorious [Kira's laughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWAmoUYRNbg) and his subsequent breakdown, everything is OVER THE TOP Latin chanting .

I do have one **major grip** with the ending tho.While Kira fully deserved his death, everything went according to Keikaku but he lost because of Mikami's oversight. He did technically outsmarted both Nate and Mikhail because he gave Mikami strict order to not Kill.When you're potraying the downfall of the villian, he needs to fall by own mistakes.However, Kira in the end was practically flawless.
>> ARTICLE
I do agree with /u/cukoodev that choosing Mikami is technically Light's mistake, and it eventually lead to his downfall. However, I think I ultimately agree with you. Yes Light chose Mikami, but having Mikami's screw up being the thing that causes Light to be caught sucks.

Well *technically* his mistake was to rely too much on Mikami, but that's just spliting hairs...

FTFY.

> He did technically outsmarted both Nate and Mikhail because he gave Mikami strict order to not Kill.

But technically he didn't as well because he picked someone like Mikami who would just do shit on his own. There should've been a part of his thought process that accounted for something like this happening, I think.

[Vague movie spoilers](/s "But the movie remedied this, anyway, I seem to recall.")
>> ARTICLE
Matsuda's character can be summed up with the line "Matsuda you idiot!" by Kira, both in a good and bad way.       

It still doesn't feel complete with the final straw being Mikami's and not Near or Mello, being L's successor they should have outright outsmarted Kira.
>> ARTICLE
That's true, but I think when you frame it as Light causing his own downfall, then the ending becomes a lot better. It's actually more fitting that instead of being outsmarted, he got sloppy and screwed himself.
>> ARTICLE
Light *did* bring about his own downfall. He selected Mikami expressly because Mikami was able to think the way Kira thought, and was able to make important decisions on Kira's behalf without receiving direct orders from him. Light should have anticipated that Mikami would act when Takada was kidnapped, given that he had told Mikami that he himself was unable to make any moves. It's ironic, given how one of Light's greatest strengths throughout the series is his ability to read people and anticipate how they would act. In the end, he had simply become too arrogant to consider the possibility his plan could fail, and that was his downfall. His own hubris destroyed him.

I think he did fail from his own flaw. His ego meant he never *considered* that Near could have been one step ahead of him so never took any precautions against it and never checked the real Death Note.

Ehm Aizawa? You don't need to repeat the rules, we all know them...

The final showdown has begun. Let's see who will stand.

>Near, youre far inferior to L.
You have no right to be wearing a mask of L!

Hey something I can agree with. And that's coming from Light how rare.

Man this whole scene with Mikami the probably the most over the top scene in this show.

AAAAAND Light again is too arrogant, not that it would change anything now, but he claimed his victory too early.

Man Light admit that you lost, such a bad loser. Blaming that this is a trap do you really think anyone would fall for such a bad excuse?

Matsudas world is breaking down.


Man it is somehow devastating but at the same time so satisfying seeing Light being cornered with no possibility to get out. How he tries anything to get out of there and losing all his might and grace and even dignity.

Well /u/Neawia, looks like your prediction of Ryuk helping Light out was wrong. He quite likes Light and he probably sees him as a friend but this friendship isn't worth as much to Ryuk as his live. He also immediately tells the truth after Near discovered everything.


>Together, we can stand with L!!
TOGETHER, WE CAN SURPASS L!!!

I really want to disagree, I don't know yes they managed to catch Kira and L didn't but still I think there was too much that L found out and on what those two based their investigation on to say that it was only their win... I just begrudge those two the win. I really wish it was L who did it and not those cheap copies.

And now one of the best crazy laughs in anime. It's just too good.

>After they die, the they go is MU (Nothingness)

[Death Parade spoiler](/s "And I thought they get the chance of being judged to either be reborn or being cast into the nothingness")

[Still Death Parade spoiler](http://i.imgur.com/CjNqLcN.png)

This whole speech where he defense his kills is just so empty to me after he killed so many innocent people. And he even enjoyed doing it. It would be different if he ever showed remorse but he doesn't. He is just a spoiled brat in my eyes who needs to live out his god complex. And the end of this just shows it. He can't lose he tries to defend himself even though he knows he's wrong. He's acting like a child that was detected by doing something wrong and doesn't want to accept punishment.


And here we have it. Matsudas moment to being badass. Everything pays off all the moments where he acted goofy or stupid, or where he got belittled by everyone. He is the first to stop Kira. He was faster than anyone in this room.

And everyone of you was probably thinking I was kidding the whole time when I hyped up Matsuda...

This was my plan all along.

>MATSUDA YOU IDIOT!!

Wow the Eng dub is really is almost kid friendly with the insult here...

in the German dub Light says:

>UGLY STUPID ASSHOLE! YOU STUPID PIG ARE SHOOTING YOUR OWN BOSS? WHAT IS THIS SHIT?


But Ryuk is atleast doing the Coup de grce. As a last service of friendship. Still poor Ryuk now he must return to the Shinigami world and start being bored.

Even though the second part is very weak compared to first part, I still think it's worth it for the build up to this end. Like I said back when /u/Neawia asked if I wanted this show to end after L's death. I think this part is also important, because I just don't agree with anything Light was doing. I think it was important to see his downfall after he reached the peak by killing L. I still wouldn't mind if anyone wants to have episode 25 as his personal end to the story.

> Who of you is still a dirty Kira supporter, or who of you is thinking that Light was atleast a bit right with what he was doing? looking at you Neawia

I'm a Kira fanboy through and through (Though I think L is more similar to Kira then most people realize). He only kills those who he believes is scum of the earth, or who put his own protection at risk. If you believe you are the only one capable of pulling this off (which is true, Ryuk himself said no human had used the Death Note as much as Light had), then it's easy to justify killing some innocent people for your own protection (and indeed, most humans would do the same in his situation). In exchange for killing a few thousands of people through the years he had succeeded in bringing about world peace and slashing crime rates. Nobody else could have achieved this. From a [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) perspective he is a hero in this story. The end justifies the means.

> And last but not least question: Ending at episode 25 or this ending. What do you favour?

This is the first time I've fully rewatched the second half, and it was moderately better then I remember, but only because over the years I've built it up as a huge pile of shit in my mind. While it has some good scenes and even an episode or two, ultimately it covers a lot of the same plot points of the first half, Near and Mello are completely inferior characters who make leaps in logic. Light had made mistakes caused by his ego since the beginning, but in the second half it gets to ridiculous levels where all sense of intelligence (for both him as a character, and subsequently the show) is lost. Theres also serious pacing issues with next to nothing happening in some episodes, while a good chunk of the cast dies in another. Ultimately my next rewatch will be like my others; Ep 1-26, then jumping straight to 37. I think you can completely enjoy the glory of the final episode without the hotmess inbetween.

>1\. Kira's laugh like I said one of my favourite crazy laughs. But it was also dubbed in many different languages and I want to know which version do you like the most

After listening to that video 3 times, I have to say English. Some of the others had good things about them, a couple were almost as good, and a few were downright bad (I'm looking at you out-of-sync Russian dub), but the subtlety in how the pitch of the laugh was handled and made it feel slightly out of control gets it to the top for me.

>2\. Who of you is still a dirty Kira supporter, or who of you is thinking that Light was at least a bit right with what he was doing? 

To a certain extent I can excuse his actions. Like when he first killed that kidnapper or the man who was assaulting hat woman, sure. I think protecting the innocent and the weak is justifiable in certain circumstances. Buuuut, for the most part he ended up on a power-trip, and committed some inexcusable acts.

>3\. And last but not least question: Ending at episode 25 or this ending. What do you favour?

Eh...this one. I think it could have all been handled differently if they were written in advance, but it feels like the writers knew where the story was going and ended up forcing it there from time to time. I don't think Light needed to die, but it was poetic justice for Ryuk to take his life when things were about to get boring (if Light was going to die right then and there Ryuk would have seen it in his lifespan since he didn't have ownership of any Death Note at the time).

I was with him until he unnecessarily killed Raye Pember, not because I liked him but because it showed that Light actually is a maniac who just enjoys killing and is only doing all this to have a ego boost for his god complex.

>(if Light was going to die right then and there Ryuk would have seen it in his lifespan since he didn't have ownership of any Death Note at the time).

1. Shinigamis can see the life span of a death note owner.
2. Mikami didn't see Light's life span (this is how he identitified him as GOD), so he still was the owner of Mikami's Death Note.
3. This rule: The use of the Death Note in the human world sometimes affects other humans' lives or shortens their original life span, even though their names are not actually written in the Death Note itself. In these cases, no matter the cause, the god of death sees only the original lifespan and not the shortened lifespan.

Just wanted to clear this up for you.

What I gathered in this thread about the second half was that it was to rushed, they adapted too many chapters in one episode and left out some moments of Near and Mello that fleshed them out more. For example Near was apparently a bit more different character that made him not look like a cheap L copy.
>> ARTICLE
>1\. Shinigamis can see the life span of a death note owner.

I coulda swore I read that even Shinigami couldn't see the life span of a death note owner because they move from being victims to killers or something like that. 

>2\. Mikami didn't see Light's life span

Ah shit, I totally forgot. That's what happens when you're sleep deprived and watched death note for...well, many hours today haha

>3\. 

Yeah, this is true. I rescind my earlier comment, but stand by the conclusion I came to. Based on his wounds, I'd say they could have easily saved his life. He didn't have a punctured lung, and it didn't look like any vital organs were hit. He wasn't spurting blood, just losing it at a good rate. I think he was gonna be A-OK haha Ryuk seemed to think so too, and if anyone's knowledgeable about death I'd bet money on him XD

>I coulda swore I read that even Shinigami couldn't see the life span of a death note owner because they move from being victims to killers or something like that.

To prove my point:

> To prove my point:

Oh, I believed you haha I was just trying to remember where I read that "not being a victim" thing or however it was worded. It definitely wasn't on the rules panels or anything like that. Hmm...now this is going to bother me until I find it. It was most likely just referring to other human Death Note users though.
>> ARTICLE
> Well /u/Neawia, looks like your prediction of Ryuk helping Light out was wrong. He quite likes Light and he probably sees him as a friend but this friendship isn't worth as much to Ryuk as his live. He also immediately tells the truth after Near discovered everything.

Yeah. Honestly, I think I made that prediction before they basically took Ryuk out of the show. He hasn't been hanging out with Light for a while now. No way he'd care that much anymore.

> I really wish it was L who did it and not those cheap copies.

You. I like you.

> UGLY STUPID ASSHOLE! YOU STUPID PIG ARE SHOOTING YOUR OWN CHEF? WHAT IS THIS SHIT?

Damn, that's much worse (as in vulgar) than "Matsuda you idiot". Although I do like the charm of "Matsuda you idiot" since it's sort of a little callback to all the times Matsuda has done stupid stuff. Now he finally did something right, and Light still calls him an idiot.

> which version do you like the most

Is this blocked for anyone else in the US?

> Who of you is still a dirty Kira supporter, or who of you is thinking that Light was atleast a bit right with what he was doing? ^(looking at you Neawia)

Hehehe. I'll do it. I'll stay a dirty Kira supporter. Though I do think he's an idiot, and could've come out on top had he not been a moron at a few different points. However, I'm still a supporter of "the ends justify the means". Sacrifices have to be made. The world Light created was *different* than before he touched the DN, not better, not worse. He still had work to do.

I absolutely think he was "at least a bit right" with what he was doing. It's just that he screwed up a bunch. Also, having a single ruler for an entire world is not the best thing. He needed a group of people who wanted the same basic thing, a better world, but had slightly differing view points. Together, maybe the world could've ended up an all around better place.

> And last but not least question: Ending at episode 25 or this ending. What do you favour?

Closer to 25, but ultimately neither. If there were a couple of episodes after 25 to show the future, that would've been best, I think.

> Hmm I need to think about that a bit. I could answer it tomorrow.

Crap, that was 8 hours ago at this point. Why am I even still awake? Let's see... I really like the English version. The way the laugh stutters at the beginning is perfect, and I love the way he explodes into it when he throws his head back. So, maybe biased, but I like Brad Swaile's English version best.

I think the Japanese version is also well done. Those two are by far the top performances. I also really liked the Korean version. Most of the others are hit or miss, especially when synced up to Light's mouth. The Russian one sounds like some guy recorded it using his laptop's microphone.

1. I couldn't decide. I'm pretty sure every Light VA knows that, if there's one bit they need to get right, it the laugh, so every version is great.

2. I never was, even the first time I watched it. I opposed his idea of killing anyone. Hopefully /u/Neawia is fine following the side of good now though.

3. This ending. Firstly, Light dies so that's good. Secondly, there is so much good about the way this ending is done while L's death almost felt anticlimactic after all the fighting.

> Hopefully /u/Neawia [+163] is fine following the side of good now though.

It's over. Light finally lost. It took a while but in the end, Near finished what L started. Now, before you get all angry and start shouting that Near and Mello are crap compared to the one and only L and that the show turned into shit after his death and all that, let me stop you right there. I agree with some of your points, but let's not overreact.

* Near isn't as good as an investigator as L was, and Mello certainly isn't. Near is still pretty close though (it's even in his name damn it!) and after L and perhaps Light he's easily the best investigator we've seen all series.
* The show had some weak parts. Some of these were in the first part, when Light joined the investigation and the investigation didn't progress at all for a few episodes. Some of these were in the second part, episode 33 comes to mind as one where almost nothing happens and it's a shame especially considering how close to the end it is. Less happens in the second part, but personally I feel like it's pretty close in quality to the first one.

Now, for the big thing that a lot of people are probably salty about. Near beating Light, when L was unable to do so. It's all pretty simple really. Light let his guard down, got too arrogant in his ways and relied too much on his worshipers, and most of all ran out of luck.

Near managed to beat Light because Light outsourced all of his murders and because his latest Kira made a mistake that he didn't forsee. There's a consistent theme in the series that whenever Light relies on an ally, they always get into trouble and Light has to try and clean up the mess. It's not at all surprising that this eventually got him killed.

Near managed to deduce that Light was Kira because over years of absolute power and no rival, Light grew careless and let his guard down. Listen to some of their conversations, there were lots of time where Light wasn't even trying to be subtle anymore. He deserved to lose for those scenes alone. His premature "Looks like I win, Near" was just the final one of these.

Light lost because after a year or so of being half a step ahead of L and keeping his distance mostly through sheer luck, his luck eventually ran out. There were multiple scenes in the first part where the series easily could have ended right there - Light conveniently running into Naomi comes to mind, as does Light writing that biker's name in the first episode a dozen times and getting lucky that the correct spelling is within the first four.

I would like to say that Near managed to defeat Light because he turned his team against him but unfortunatley Aizawa & co were irrelevant in the end.

Most of all, Light lost because Ryuk was never on his side, because he so desperately wanted to make it obvious that this was one person's doing from the get go, and because he lost his temper against Lindt L. Tailor in episode 2 or 3.

----

This final episode has some really good parts and some bad ones that are redeemed by the manga.

One of the rule cards shown in this episode reveals that all humans, Death Note user or not, go to nothingness after death. I'm surprised this was in here, I thought that was a manga-only thing.

One of the more famous scenes from the anime, after Potato Chips and Keikaku and all the dramatic writing, is the "I am Kira" laugh. [It's so good that it's great in every dub.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWAmoUYRNbg). Well, except the Russian and Hungarian ones, those are _weird_. Also, I just want to add that even though I don't understand a single word of Spanish, I can still notice that that dude's Kira voice is _scary_.

Matsuda freaking out and totally going to town on Light is easily the most satisfying Matsuda scene in the anime. [After turning the viewers into Aizawa every single time he said something stupid,](https://gfycat.com/GargantuanBowedCoati) finally the character realizes that everything he believed in was a lie (and that everyone else had already realized it). This is where the anime swaps the manga's amazing ending with a weaker original one and omits the final chapter all together. Yes, this means that Near's amazing idea to just let Light go because surely he would die of his wounds is anime-original and can be ignored in head-canon. Technically the following are manga spoilers, but it's really not that different from the anime version and the final chapter isn't all that relevant anyway. There is one image I need to link here, and I can't link images within spoiler tags. Don't worry though, the same event happens in the anime, just way less awesome. [I'm referring, of course, to the final heart attack.](https://i.imgur.com/zOxI0.jpg)

[spoilers for the two final manga chapters](/s "Shot by Matsuda and bleeding out on the floor, Light is desperately looking for a way out of this situation when he sees his final opportunity before him - Ryuk. He begs Ryuk to kill everyone in the room, and eventually Ryuk draws his notebook and starts writing. Everyone tries and fails to stop Ryuk, until he dramatically reveals that he is only writing down a single name - the last name in this story, the one he promised to write in the very first episode. In a flashback, it is revealed that there is no Heaven or Hell and that Death Note user or not, all humans fade into nothingness after death. Finally, Light dies of a heart attack and the story ends. After a one-year time skip, it is revealed that the news of Kira's death has not been made public. Many of course have realized it on their own, though some still believe he is just taking a break and will eventually return. The world has returned to its pre-Death Note state. Near has taken the role of L and has taken up Mello's chocolate addiction. Aizawa (still without afro) & co don't directly work for him but occasionally assist him on a case. It is revealed that Near destroyed both Notebooks after Ryuk admitted the 'death upon destruction' rule was fake. Matsuda and Ide speculate about whether Near used the Notebook to influence Mikami's behaviour at the end of the series (honestly is an interesting idea) or if he perhaps had information leaked to Mello to provoke the events that happened. They come to the conclusion that regardless of what happened, and even though crime is now again way higher than during Kira's reign, this is the good ending because the alternative would have seen them all die. At the very end of the manga, we see a lot of the remaining Kira worshipers gathering in prayer for their lost god and there's this weird close-up of a girl we've never seen before who isn't Misa and will never be relevant or even named because the series ends right there.")

You guys really did this to me a lot. I did reactions already to my theory on who Mello was going to be. I'll try and go back and search for others. If there are any specific moments you could think of, let me know.

> Your first section about Near winning/Light losing

You bring up a bunch of good points that I hadn't really thought about yet. So well done. This was really well presented. The show did make sense 'in universe'.

However, from a writing standpoint, I just don't like it as much. I've had someone tell me the mangaka was asked to continue writing the story past L's death. I don't know if that's true or not, but it does seem like it could be the case. Either way, compared to the first 2/3 of the show with L, the final stretch just seems so different. It feels different even though they reused a major plot point, and introduced new characters that were extremely similar to L.

It's not that I think it was terrible, but I don't think it was as good.

> manga spoilers

Thanks for sharing that. That was a good read.

> [DN manga](/s "They come to the conclusion that regardless of what happened, and even though crime is now again way higher than during Kira's reign, this is the good ending because the alternative would have seen them all die.")

Guess, I'll respond with tags just in case. [DN manga](/s "I don't like that though. It makes them all seem selfish, understandably so, of course. They're just happy they're alive even though the crime rate has risen again. Matsuda was the only one who ever seemed to consider the argument from both sides.")

> Near isn't as good as an investigator as L was, and Mello certainly isn't. Near is still pretty close though (it's even in his name damn it!) and after L and perhaps Light he's easily the best investigator we've seen all series.

I was really disappointed that they cut out essentially all the lying, conniving Near from the manga. The fact that he was willing to "cheat" and use tactics that even Light or L wouldn't consider helped distinguish him from the other characters, and added a degree of plausibility to his victory over Light. Between that and trimming down a lot of his reasoning monologues, the anime makes him come across as a cheap imitation L who gets lucky the whole time, instead of a competent investigator in his own right, who uses intelligent logic to identify the killer and underhanded tactics to bring him in.

And don't even get me started on how much the anime butchers Mello. I guess at least his unique, distinctive personality is intact; they just made him look like a whiny, entitled incompetent by cutting out every scene where he actually achieves something.
>> ARTICLE
I have realized now that I should _really_ read the manga. You're the second person that mentions this today. I own a few volumes and have read those, and I've read the ending multiple times, but I wasn't aware that there were so many differences in the second part.
>> ARTICLE
I can't recommend it enough. Between volumes 8 and and 9 alone there are about a volume's worth of material that just isn't in the anime; it isn't trimmed down or simplified, it's just removed wholesale. Besides seeing characters and plot threads rendered in more detail, it's worthwhile just for the sake of getting more *Death Note* story.

While I don't like them as much as L himself, I am still a fan of L's heirs, and I feel that a lot of the vitriol they get from anime-only fans is at least partially due to how badly they were handled in the adaptation. The way the anime chooses to introduce them is by itself probably enough to put plenty of people off them.
>> ARTICLE
> Near isn't as good as an investigator as L was

One has to wonder why that is when L stats are like [this](http://40.media.tumblr.com/36ae0efbbc2524e78a8987a8471c1d29/tumblr_npmt97IqJW1u8kenho2_1280.png) and Near's are like [this](http://i306.photobucket.com/albums/nn264/G-They/13.jpg). Would motivation make L that much better than Near even if Near is the smarter of the two?

^^^It's ^^^so ^^^nice ^^^to ^^^finally ^^^be ^^^able ^^^to ^^^post ^^^those ^^^man.

This is a really good write up. Also, you reminded me of something: why the hell did I read the last chapter of Death Note when I've never really bothered to read the manga. I borrowed the first volume from my school library in high school and that's it. I don't even.

I do this too. AssClass? Read last chapter for no reason.
>> ARTICLE
> One has to wonder why that is when L stats are like this and Near's are like this. Would motivation make L that much better than Near even if Near is the smarter of the two?

Possibly because the databook is meant to reflect the manga, not the anime. The manga shows Near lying, cheating and conniving to advance the case. It deliberately leaves it ambiguous as to whether in the finale Near was saved by Mello's sacrifice and Mikami's mistake, or whether he was manipulating everybody and their actions were part of his plan all along. In the interviews in the databook, one of the creators even answers the question "Who is the smartest character in *Death Note*?" with "Near, because he cheats". So it's possible his higher intelligence stat is a reflection of that part of his nature.

> Also, you reminded me of something: why the hell did I read the last chapter of Death Note when I've never really bothered to read the manga.

If you enjoyed the show, you should absolutely read (the rest of) the manga. A lot of the plans and strategies are more fleshed out, with extra levels of thought put in and contingencies described that make it clear that the characters are crazy clever, and not just getting lucky or making improbable leaps of logic. Also, the anime completely guts the second half, going up from ~2.5 chapters per episode to ~5, and completely cutting large chunks of the story out (such as Near's underhanded cheating, or Mello achieving anything outside of the finale).
>> ARTICLE
I've never actually read those character descriptions but I suppose it makes sense. L was smart, yes, but what made him so dangerous was his stubbornness, his eagerness to act, and his lack of morals. L was convinced from the moment he had Watari install those cameras that Light was Kira and kept believing that against all evidence, and as soon as he got his hands on a notebook he had every intention of trying it out as soon as possible.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if L lacked morals, I think he just did what he had to do. Doesn't necessarily mean that he didn't know or didn't care that what he was doing was wrong.

But, anyway, did he intend on using it? I honestly can't remember.
>> ARTICLE
Not himself, because he couldn't be completely sure that the 13 days rule was fake. He wanted to have a death row inmate use the note to kill somebody, and then pardon him 14 days later if he was still alive. Doing this would have crushed Light's and Misa's alibi, and is what prompted Rem to kill him and Watari. It's a similar situation to the Lindt L. Tailor thing - it's a great idea, and it work, but most people wouldn't dare try it out of ethical reasons.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, yeah, you're right. That makes sense. I guess the motivation did make all the difference.

**Episode 36**

Ive come to enjoy the first part of the OP. It sounds similar to System of a Down. Once it gets into the screaming stuff, it loses any charm it had.

[Guys, I cant see. Aizawa, shave me down.](http://i.imgur.com/g3R0pWK.png)

1.28 is a date, Im assuming. It should be around that time since it was recently Christmas.

Ah, appealing to Lights misogynistic side. Good choice spokesman wannabe.

Ah, the 28th is the day Near and Light are going to meet up. Nears probably going to die.

[Light up close.](http://i.imgur.com/nmGb1hn.png)

Kill everyone who knows about the Death Note? Hmmm, good idea. Probably shouldve tried to do that a while ago.

[Thats supposed to an L mask, right?](http://i.imgur.com/dyzHVbv.png) It is. And I agree with Light. Near is far inferior to L.

Light really gets turned on from thinking hes right.

[That smile looks familiar.](http://i.imgur.com/6jTpTXA.png) What a poser. [The real L.](http://i.imgur.com/gZGVFck.png)

Mikamis freaking OUT!!! And now hes knows who God is. Awww good for you, Mikami. You cant to meet your God.

Ok, so Near replaced a bunch of pages. Wasnt Mikami also using a fake notebook?

Oh, shit. This is actually a great plan, Near. Too bad Lights holding back his laugh. Oh, man. He is *so* damn excited right now.

Lights exploding with happiness.

Lets see how many twists there are before the dust settles.

Cmon. Whats going to happen?

And hate the guy all you want, [these are still cool shots.](http://i.imgur.com/IbDbFky.png) I'm probably gonna make [this one my desktop background.](http://i.imgur.com/4GrZREq.png) Or maybe my MAL profile pick. I've been meaning to update that.

Light. Dont laugh. Just wait. Youre going to give yourself away. Just keep quiet, you arrogant fool.

This would be a huge moment for the task force. Theyre seeing Kira for the first time.

Cmon. Twists? Or is everyone actually going to die?

OMG!!!! Light you stupid arrogant son of a bitch. Stupid fucker.

Wow, what a cliffhanger. I dont know if I can wait. Sorry, guys. I'm weak. I know, but Im watching the next episode right now.

---

**Episode 37**

This is exciting. Finale time!

Wheres Ryuk?

God this is so awkward. No ones dying. And Light just basically admitted he was Kira. Stupid fuck face.

[Lights freaked out as shit! Wow.](http://i.imgur.com/X7x7612.png)

Ah, Nate River.

Wow, Light. This is seriously not the time to be losing your cool.

Poor Mikami. His God wont notice him. T_T

This really hurts to watch. I havent been fully on Kiras side during the second half, but I was kind of hoping hed win after all of this. In all honesty, Im pissed that Near outsmarted Light. Thats just garbage.

[Light up close](http://i.imgur.com/HEskIvb.png)

Ah, so they did it. Mello and Near worked together. Im glad they did, but Im still bugged that they were the ones to defeat Light.

Whats Lights plan here? He laughs and admits hes Kira. Ok, interesting plea. Hes simply telling them what his plan from the beginning was. Hes telling them how the world is a safer place.

This is all gonna be a bit much for everyone to take in right now.

Useless fools. As if they could ever understand.

Matsuda!!!! What a shot!

[That was the absolute best Matsuda you idiot in the show.](http://puu.sh/o31xd.webm)

Holy fuck Matsuda.

Cmon Ryuk. What are you doing, man? Stop hanging around and do something. Please. I will lose my mind if hes been writing everyones names in the book right now.

Mikami, what the heck? A distraction? Lights getting away!!!

Even if you dont like Light, his VA is fucking killing it. The out of breath, the cries, the despair.

Meanwhile. Ryuks just looking evil as shit. Not a care in the world. Ah, hes gonna kill Light. Well, its a better way to go then getting caught and going to jail. Rest easy, you maniac.

Ummm, Misa. Step back. What is she doing? Does she know that Light got caught? Misa!?!?!

What an oddly calming credit scene. That was nice.

**Post Episode Thoughts**

Well, Im severely disappointed that Near (and Mello) were able to defeat Light. Theyre just simply not as good as L so its kind of a slap in the face that they came out on top. Im not really sure the task force couldve actually done anything on their own though, so they needed Near to do it for them.

Other than that, it was actually a damn good ending following that lackluster final 1/3 of the show. Yes, in the end I wouldve liked to see have seen Light win. No I would not wanted him to win if this were real life.

I'll have most of my thoughts together for the series discussion day so see you all there (I hope).

Like I said in the German version he was a lot cruder with his choice of words:

>Well, Im severely disappointed that Near (and Mello) were able to defeat Light. Theyre just simply not as good as L so its kind of a slap in the face that they came out on top.


Totally agree. But I would say pre time skip Light would've won in this situation. After killing L Light just got too carefree and arrogant. Because of that he lost.  I mean this wasn't the kind of Light who build 3 safety nets to protect his Death Note. Or his own room. Only one plan and no backup plan if something fails.

>Yes, in the end I wouldve liked to see have seen Light win. No I would not wanted him to win if this were real life.

I posted a fanmade comic with an alternate end where Light had won. If you want to see it.

Yes, agreed. I wonder if there was anything Light could've been doing to keep his wits sharp. I'm not really sure if you can prepare for situations like this.

Nice, I hadn't seen these director cuts (this one and post L's death). Are there any others?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure why I got goosebumps while watching that. It was pretty cool. I'm not sure it helped my Light/Shinigami theory. At first I thought maybe the Shinigami looking for Ryuk was Light, but by the end it doesn't seem to be the case.
>> ARTICLE
Well a lot of people were theorising that this Shinigami was Light turned into a Shinigami and just having no memories of his earlier life
>> ARTICLE
Oh! That'd be cool. I didn't consider that he'd lose his memories. Pretty interesting. I like that clip regardless if that was Light or not.
>> ARTICLE
Yep I had the same reaction to Light losing in the end. The fact that Near outsmarted Light is kind of bullshit imo. I usually stop watching the show after Light kills L because the second half isn't as good and watching Light's breakdown is just brutal to watch.

Yeah. I guess Light still kind of screwed himself in the end (by trusting Mikami and prematurely telling Near that he lost). Still, having Near win hurt.

/sigh God, I hope the new Death Note movies don't suck :/

EDIT:

As I was replying to a comment, I looked at Mikami's name and noticed that the root words of it were mi + kami, which I know to mean beauty and God. So I thought to myself, maybe it means beautiful God, but that would be odd for this particular character and so I Googled it, and

> Mikami Name Meaning. Japanese (mostly northeastern Japan): variously written, usually with characters meaning 'three' and 'above', and meaning 'something bestowed from above' (from one's superior or a deity).

Well, shit. I don't know why this didn't occur to me before.

This was tough to watch, I never watched past 25 even when it was airing.

I really fucking hate Near. I don't think he earned this victory and almost everything he won was by chance. He actually sacrificed Mello and Matt's life for this, a lot of people gloss over that. I think the anime portrayed him in a much better way than he actually was so I find it ironic that most people still don't like him or feel he deserved to win.

I really  wanted Light to win not because of his purpose but because I really wanted to see his effort turn in the end.
>> ARTICLE
Alright last two episodes hype!

**Episode 36**

The very first rule shown here again at the intermission. Things are all coming together now.

"Near...You're far inferior to L."

I agree with Light here. Though I think Near is the perfect person to succeed L I also think he's no where near (hehe) as good as L.

Near's still not wearing any shoes. Can you imagine how dirty his socks are right now in that warehouse?

Mikami's eye just peaking in. "Here's Johnny!"

Light's trying his absolute best not to laugh.

"Kami!"

"Sakujo! Sakujo! Sakujo! Sakujo! Sakujo! Sakujo! Sakujoooooooooo!"

Gone are the calm Sakujos Mikami used to do. He's probably orgasming right now being in Light's presence.

"Omoi doori! Omoi doori! Oh my dory!"

"No, not yet. Don't laugh yet...hold it in..."

Mikami sounds right on the verge of orgasming with every "Kami!"

**Episode 37**

Light's and Mikami's faces: "Eh? Wat."

I like how people who are not japanese in this show actually have english letters above their heads so that's what Mikami wrote down.

It's really satisfying to see Light lose his cool and freak out.

Based Gevanni, having perfect forgery skills.

I like how Near and Ryuk exchange pleasantries.

Looks like Mello was actually a bro all along and did the situation on purpose to help out Near.

And that my friends, it what I consider the best evil laugh ever. It's so perfect.

Wanna hear it in a bunch of other languages? [Right here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWAmoUYRNbg) 

Oop looks like /u/Saikimo got the drop on me.

Matsuda fuckin shoots Light's hand to stop him writing on the paper in his watch! You go Matsuda!

He tries to write with his blood but Matsuda's not having any of that either!

Mikami stabs himself! He's had enough of this life.

Light escapes and while he's running, he passes his old self, before he became Kira.

Now /u/Neawia back on episode 28 you said and I quote

> "Ryuk is putting on an act so Light doesnt realize how much he cares for him. Ryuk is going to end up sacrificing himself at some point to prolong Lights life. Light, after going through some more morally question events (like this one with Sayu) will eventually realize hes not as evil as he thought, and will be more lax with killing people."

Since I knew the ending that gave me a chuckle. Did you expect anything like this to happen? I have to say though it would be interesting to see the series go in the direction you talked about.
>> ARTICLE
> I agree with Light here. Though I think Near is the perfect person to succeed L I also think he's no where near (hehe) as good as L.

Agreed, though I think Light (when he lost his memories, aka original Light) probably could've also done a good job as L.

> Gone are the calm Sakujos Mikami used to do. He's probably orgasming right now being in Light's presence.

I know it's a weird situation, but can you imagine just how amazing Mikami must've been feeling? Not only did he get to lay his eyes on Kira (the person he respects and worships the most in the world), but he was also about to be directly responsible for Kira's biggest victory. Damn, he must've been jacked up on adrenaline in that moment.

> I like how people who are not japanese in this show actually have english letters above their heads so that's what Mikami wrote down.

Oh, nice catch. Good attention to detail by the creators.

> And that my friends, it what I consider the best evil laugh ever. It's so perfect.

I'm not sure I've heard a better one.

> Since I knew the ending that gave me a chuckle. Did you expect anything like this to happen? I have to say though it would be interesting to see the series go in the direction you talked about.

I may have made that prediction before I was spoiled about Light's death (I don't remember during which episode that happened). Either way, with how little Ryuk ended up being around during the final stretch of the show, I can't say I was expecting him to do anything like I predicted there. I'm definitely disappointed that they all but wrote him out of the show.

As for Light, I'm going to have to a 180 on that prediction and say now in hindsight that he should have killed more people. Hear me out. If he realistically wanted to get away with being Kira, he should've killed everyone back when L died. Anyone connected to the Death Note investigation should've gone. He might've been able to spare one or two people, including his father, but if we're just going for it all, everyone would've had to die. Light would also be a part of this. So yes, he should've faked his own death. He could've moved far away to a lightly populated area and continued being Kira. No one can suspect him if he's 'dead', and he'd still get the satisfaction of the world knowing someone was passing judgement.
>> ARTICLE

Yeah it would've taken some work to turn into an actual story but I like the idea.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
These 2 are definitely the best episodes since L died. I will probably not write a lot, because I will probably write most of the things I can think about on the Series Discussion thread.

* Light lost both because of his fault and because of Mikami. Sure, Mikami made a horrible mistake, but he was also a little sloppy by the fact that he didn't have a backup plan. If we can get something  out of this, is that if you want your work to be done like you need it to, you probably have to do it yourself.

* It is very fitting that Matsuda is the one to shot Light. He trusted him totally, and that feeling of betrayal surely did break him.

* I can't explain why, but I love the whole sequence since Light runs away until the credits end. It feels like a good ending.

So, what happens now? I think we might have some unresolved situations that could lead to interesting plots.

* There are 2 Death Notes left in the world. Will they destroy them? It is probably a bad idea to give them back to Ryuk, as it would be possible for another Kira to appear if Ryuk gives it to someone else. Also, it would be very probable that the governments would want to keep the Notes to study them, and even use them.

* Will they reveal who Kira was, and how he did things, or just let everything vanish? Probably they will just announce Kira has been captured and stopped.

* What would happen if a copycat appeared? With Kira gone, there are some people like Mikami that would probably like to continue with the work of Kira by any means necessary.

Light ain't loyal man. To no one. Smh. Light gave away his victory by being too overconfident, but I give him credit he predicted near to a T except for one move. Mikami was high off the red eye (from cowboy bebop) the whole time. Light is a sore loser like L always said.  Matsuda took it the hardest lol. That SPK guy looks like Ray penber. Ryuk said everything perfectly.


Maybe it's just me, but the animation for light changed for these last two episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, so your rewatch is over? Just wanted to peek in and say that  Death Note never became an anime I really cared about intensely but at the same time it was one of the first ones I watched, so there is some nostalgia factor there. 

Oh, and Matsuda was my favorite. Best character, everyone should appreciate him, best thing to come out of the show.

Am I crazy to think that a spin-off of deathnote would work where the deathnote still exists but in a differen time period. Like Genghis Khan having a death note and just killing the entire world that way?

Wow, Gevanni, you're the real MVP! 

Isn't Ryuk supposed to know when someone new has touched his notebook? Ryuk has been out of the action for a long time now, he hasn't done anything big since the first time Light gave up ownership of the notebook, not that I remember anyway. I almost forgot that Ryuk said he would be the one to write Light's name. It was kind of a mercy killing at that point, I wonder what Ryuk is going to do now.

And Light found the button to press to make Misa listen to him.

>Mr. Yagami, if I die within the next few days, your son is Kira

I love how he is saying that so incidentally.

Also he basically admits that he is just guessing with his instincts, because he just doesn't have any evidence to convict Light. 

Sneak attack Hype!


This whole scene at the college is one of my favourite scenes in the whole show, such a great fuck you to Kira.

>As long as it doesn't kill me, college is a lot of fun.

That side jab at Light, so good.

Who would've thought that L would be such a perv, grabbing a girl's ass (and also stealing her phone) not nice...

>STUDENT: I wanna touch her, too.

Things you shouldn't say out loud.


Just the way how L is holding the phone just makes me laugh so much. It's just so great to see that smug get swiped right off Kira's face.

[Also that smile](http://i.imgur.com/foUxbto.png)


Still you can see that L is also not a total good guy, he commands Watari to torture Misa.

RYUK: [Huh?](http://gfycat.com/SpiritedClutteredDegus)

Such a good reaction from Ryuk, also a great episode. The urge to just continue watching is very very strong at the moment...

22. Whether the cause of the individual's death is either a suicide or accident, if the death leads to the death of more than the intended, the person will simply die of a heart attack. This is to ensure that other lives are not influenced.
23. **Even after the individual's name, the time of death, and death condition on the Death Note were filled out, the time and condition of death can be altered as many times as you want as lon as it is changed within 6 minutes and 40 second from the time it was filled in. But of course, this is only possible before the victim dies.**
24. **Whenever you want to change anything written on the Death Note within 6 minutes and 40 seconds after you wrote, you must first rule out the characters you want to erase with two straight lines.**


Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1. The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.
2. Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.
3. Gods of Death, the original owners of the Death Note, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note.
4. A god of death cannot be killed even if stabbed in his heart with a knife or shot in the head with a gun. However, there are ways to kill a god of death which are not generally known to the gods of death
5. The specific scope of the condition for death is not known to the gods of death, either so, you must examine and find out.

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. What is the most cruel or most strangest form of torture you know?

2. Misa really loves the opening, she even has it as a ring tone. What is the current ringtone on your phone?

3. Did your opinion of L change after he commanded Watari to torture Misa?

It's funny seeing Light and Misa sitting in his room like a couple of normal teenagers when they are both basically serial killers. This show is so good.

1) I dunno...to many to count 3:)

2) My ringtone has been "Death Note" from the OST for ~7 months now haha It gives every call I get a certain...weight and allows me to identify Death Note fans in my vicinity :D

3) Nah. You do what you gotta do, and it clearly wasn't extreme torture or she would have lied about something to get them to stop. That's why torture isn't effective, people can be trained against it and the majority of people will say SOMETHING even if it isn't true. They just start telling you what they think you want to hear. Very rarely does torture yield usable results.

That's a strangely clever way of identifying anime fans. There are plenty of ost tracks that sound like they could be from any number of tv shows or movies, but only a select few would know the truth. I like it.

> Still you can see that L is also not a total good guy, he commands Watari to torture Misa.

More delicious Light and L similarities. I wonder if L has done stuff like that in the past. Perhaps because he has almost nothing to go off of in the Kira case, he's resorting to extreme measures.

> RYUK: Huh?

Perfection. Had a nice little laugh, aaaaand bookmarked.

> The urge to just continue watching is very very strong at the moment...

This is the strongest it's been for me. I really want to see what Light's plan is actually going to be from here on out. He doesn't seem as worried as I would've thought considering he just lost his opportunity to learn L's real name.

> What is the most cruel or most strangest form of torture you know?

What a gruesomely interesting question. I remembered a couple, then looked up more. Ugh just imagining some of these. Medieval torture devices. The Kneecapper, The Spanish Tickler, or really any genital mutilation ones. Those seem the worst. The Judas Chair, Spanish Donkey, Breast Ripper, Crocodile Shears OH GOD, /u/Saikimo, you monster, why did you make me do this?!?!

> Misa really loves the opening, she even has it as a ring tone. What is the current ringtone on your phone?

Because I'm not cool enough to actually change it, it's just the standard one. Usually it's just on vibrate anyway. I feel like other people would be annoyed at hearing a ringtone. Plus I'd be tempted to use an anime related song, and I don't want people questioning me.

> Did your opinion of L change after he commanded Watari to torture Misa?

Just a bit. I was shocked that he was so quick to resort to torturing her. Barely a second thought. At the same time, L is the best. He knows he has to catch Kira, and if this what he has to do to solve an evidence-less case, so be it. I'll be interested to see if he regrets having to torture a young girl though.

How old is Mia anyway? 16-17? A year or so younger than Light? She looks a little younger, at least.

---

I just love how brutal Light is. Misa gets so giddy about exchanging cell phone numbers, he shoots her down. Misa gets giddy that he accepts her phone, he shoots her down. Light I can hear your voice every day! How the hell are you still not getting this, Misa? I dont like you. Im *using* you.

[Shuts her up with a kiss.](http://i.imgur.com/gxvlciF.png) Smart. [Look at that blush.](http://i.imgur.com/X3pcQwq.png) Awww.

Oh, theyre actually gonna put that shot from the OP in the anime? Standing on, I dont even know what this is exactly. A normal building? And Light and L are just super huge.

I feel kind of bad for L because he could just die without any warning, but it does seem like hes prepared.

And I know Chief Yagami is dedicated to his job, but I still find it odd that he wouldnt try having a heart to heart with his son. Like, Son, L thinks youre Kira. Are you? Not that its an easy conversation to have, but he seems more concerned with his job than his son.

Oooooh, a sneak attack. Cant wait to see what it is.

[L up close.](http://i.imgur.com/udM5pEF.png)

Kyomes there to fill the void. Lightll fill her void.

So the sneak attack is L putting himself back in the public? He knows that Light is the only person who actually knows he is L so if he dies, Light it is Kira. And like usual, hes a straight shooter with Light, telling him his plan.

MISA YOU IDIOT! Lol, hopefully she doesnt make things too suspicious. At least she can read Ls name.

[Ls face is great.](http://i.imgur.com/sI0TsqI.png) Dude looks like hes putting shit together. Probably now has Misa on top of his suspect list for Kira 2.

Also, I never delve too much into symbolism and stuff, but the colors are really something here. If Light is red and his enemy (L) is blue, why is Misa also blue? Is she going to end up being an enemy or is she going to continually screw things up for Light?

HAHAHA! L touched her butt. I still think this is an act. Maybe not. This is kind of way out of character. He seems to actually like Misa, but I wont be surprised if he still suspects her of being Kira 2.

I really like the college buddy interactions of Light and L. Id love to watch a comedy with the two them as they go through school.

And what the heck? Light, why would you kill L? He just told you that if he dies, everyone is to suspect Light is Kira.

Holy fucking shit. I fucking love L.

He swiped her phone. Amazing. The way he just lets it dangle in the air, taunting Light, playing the ED. Misa likes Death Note music.

They already took Misa into custody. Holy shit this is great. Ryuks little laugh. I just *love* that he laughs at Lights misfortunes.

So Light fucked up. Again. He shouldve destroyed the evidence himself, taken full control. As long as he learns from his mistakes and doesnt let something like this happen again, all will be well.

Wow. Straight jacket, tied up, blindfold. Theyre just going to torture her to get the information they need? And Lights the prime suspect. What will dad do?

Is Rem going to let them hurt Misa?

Misas asking Rem to kill her. Oh, fuck. Heavy stuff.

This is actually really sad.

How will Misas feelings of love remain? Well, I guess technically those feelings arent connected to the Death Note. They came into existence because Misa loved Kira for bringing justice to her parents killers. But how would she know she loves *Light* instead of just loving Kira?

Was that hair flick Rems way of tipping off L? She doesnt like Light, so now its up to L to bring justice to Light.

I just cant help but laugh every time Ryuk laughs. Even if its just a quick chuckle. Rem just pointed at Light and said she would kill him if he doesnt help Misa. Ryuk laughs. Lol.

Uh oh. Goodbye Ryuk? For a second I thought Light would get to have two Shinigami, but I think I know what might happen

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Light and Misa are going to switch Shinigami. Light will help Misa escape. Then theyll act all lovey-dovey and be a normal couple, but Light will have Misa touch his Death Note again. Then Light will forfeit ownership, giving it to Misa. He, of course, still has Misas old Death Note, which hell also let Misa touch so she can see Rem. So, bam. They switch Shinigami and can still see their original Shinigami.

The real question is whether or not Misa will still have Shinigami eyes. Maybe she has them, but wont be able to use them until she obtains a new Shinigami partner. Also curious as to if shell regain her memories once touching a Death Note or if theyll all be gone. Rem might have to fill her in and make a gesture to prove theyve been together for a while.

Misa isn't blue, she's green. She's her own, separate party. Though, considering how she is on Light's side, I believe purple would have been a better color for her, as it's a mix of red and yellow, unlike green which is a mix of blue and yellow.

"As long as I don't die, college is a fun place" Seems accurate.

Aside from that, this episode is really powerful.The extent they go to to protect themselves from the unknown powers of a suspect really shows how afraid they are. I always get little tears when I see Misa like that, especially when she cries and the tears just drip off the mask.
>> ARTICLE
Ha!

And yeah, I felt bad for Misa too. She really is kind of sweet, deep down. She barely cared about actually killing people herself, and she just wanted to be Light's girlfriend. She's always so happy about dates, and exchanging numbers, that kiss, hanging out with Light at school. Then the next second she's completely bound and gagged begging Rem to kill her. That was awful.
>> ARTICLE
How can Misa make so many smart choices but be so dumb? It's like she sees a dude and her brain turns to pudding. And not even a good flavor.

Light, why do you believe L when he says you're his first friend? Are you a donut, like???

L couldn't keep up his excited voice for more than a second. Welp, you tried, bby. That's what matters.

It bums me out that me and Misa have overlapping musical tastes *cue flashback from my visual kei days*

You try to be serious but then Ryuk laughs and it just ruins everything. It's like when there are serious moments on That '70s Show but then Fez does something stupid.

I know kink shaming isn't nice, but holy shit, L.

Rem's not for girls messing around with fuck boys like Light. She knows where it's at.

Fun fact: when Light kisses Misa, in the Japanese dub, he gasps, instead of laughing and saying wow like the English dub. And then again when L reveal's that Misa's been detailed.

I think I might like the dub more than the original. That semi-monotone voice is perfect for L, you know? Plus, Ryuk is more fun.

L's speech is so polite in Japanese. He calls Light Soichiro's 'musuko-san' instead of just 'musuko' (son).

Light's face when he's sees Misa at the school is kinda hilarious. It's also hilarious to me how much Kappei Yamaguchi sells creepy weirdo L in this scene. And that Misa things L is unique and cool. And the tense build up to the fangirling.

So in Japanese, the first fan of Misa referred to her as 'ano ko' which can be translated to 'that child (over there)' and that's really weird to me.

Rem refers to Light with a rude form of the word 'you' in Japanese.

And so concludes my time as an armchair linguist 

EDIT: ~~No questions? Wai u do dis me I'm a good person T_T~~

YAAAS

> With no real evidence on Kira, what would you have done to Misa to get the information you needed? It doesn't have to be torture. Maybe you have a less abrasive method for extracting information. Or maybe torture really was the way to go.

I don't know. Maybe torture, but tickling instead of ~~BDSM~~ forcible detention.

> What is your favorite flavor of pudding? Least favorite?

You can't beat chocolate pudding, especially after it's been in the fridge a few hours. Ironically, I don't have one, but for what it's worth, I'm a creature of habit, so I've had very few pudding flavors. I imagine caramel flavor tastes yucky, though.

Today Red Light and Blue L makes an appearance once again,where we find out that Misa is completely useless after all.Fortunately Light has a keikaku to save her.

L makes for a great professional butt  toucher, and goes straight for Misa's DNA and phone.A hallmark for all great detective is the ability to use  questionable methods to solve cases, he certainly gives no shits about physically torturing a girl, seeing that his only target is Light.

Oh snap Light giving out kisses already. He'll do whatever it takes to manipulate Misa.

Aha Misa can see L's real name!

Calling it now that it was L who touched Misa's butt.

More Death Note rules. You gotta scratch out what you wrote before erasing it.

Is that the ending theme as Misa's phone ringer? He totally touched her butt.

L found out Misa was the second Kira already? Holy Shiiiiit!

I like how Light pauses mid fall with an idea. No imagery showing him dying is going to finish until he's through.

As much as I dislike Misa I always felt this was kinda going too far, having her strapped up like this.

Light saying goodbye to Ryuk? I wonder what people watching this for the first time think Light is gonna do?
>> ARTICLE
> Calling it now that it was L who touched Misa's butt.

Who doesn't wanna touch Misa's butt?

> L found out Misa was the second Kira already? Holy Shiiiiit!

I was honestly surprised as hell. It seems though that he had some evidence from the tapes she sent in to the tv stations, but damn did I think he just assumed Misa was the second Kira simply because she knew Light.

> I like how Light pauses mid fall with an idea. No imagery showing him dying is going to finish until he's through.

This was good. Even L was surprised. It was interesting that they started using the red vs blue imagery and the buildings from the OP. Didn't think they'd do that.
>> ARTICLE
But L didn't know of the relationship between Light and Misa until the plan to arrest her was already in place... what I want to know is how did they suspect Misa at all? Having the DNA of the person who sent the tapes, and matching that DNA against a specific person are two different things.
>> ARTICLE
>But L didn't know of the relationship between Light and Misa

one of the task force members was observing Light last episode and this guy saw Light and Misa together when she jumped on Light on open street. Do you remember?


>> ARTICLE
You're completely right. He didn't take any pictures or hear her name, so I guess he followed her back to her home.
>> ARTICLE
Also it's Mogi who was observing Light. [Character spoiler](/s "and Mogi is according to L very good at intelligence gathering, so I believe that Mogi was able to find  out who Misa is himself. ") Also I think that L isn't someone who recognises a model. So I bet he did his research before coming to the college.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah definitely when he said he was such a big fan of Misa he meant 'I've just been researching everything about you, what a delightful coincidence that you happen to know Light'
>> ARTICLE
I don't know. How can you match up DNA? You have to have something to compare it to? So maybe fingerprints or something. I have no idea.
>> ARTICLE
Right, but does Japan have a national database of everyone's DNA? I didn't think so.
>> ARTICLE
I have no clue. DNA? Yeah, probably not. But maybe fingerprints. Maybe they matched the prints, and then went and dug around in Misa's room.

I don't disagree though that they could've explained it a little better. Because now I'm confused.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I almost forgot about this episode XD I love it from start to finish, but my favourite parts are by far the looks L gets during the exchanges on their way for cake, especially during the Misa incident. After all this went down they've set up so many juicy things that my hype is at an all time high, just like it was the first time I watched. Well...maybe not as high as the time the chief crashed into the tv station, but close haha

One think I'm not entirely clear on is why they picked up Misa. I was so caught up in everything that was going on the first time that it seemed natural, but this time around I remember catching L say something about matching evidence to evidence collected from her room. Why the heck were they collecting evidence from her room without any real reason to? Maybe they'll explain this a bit more later, or maybe I misheard this time around. Feel free to explain this to me if there's a legitimate answer.
>> ARTICLE
> After all this went down they've set up so many juicy things that my hype is at an all time high, just like it was the first time I watched. Well...maybe not as high as the time the chief crashed into the tv station, but close haha

That was definitely a badass moment, but the hype is pretty strong right now. L always seems to be able to figure things out. He always appears to be on par or one step ahead of Light. But now, oh boy. Light might finally have him cornered. I can't wait to see what the hell happens now.

> Why the heck were they collecting evidence from her room without any real reason to?

L said they found evidence on the tapes and the folders that Misa sent to the tv stations. So I guess they realized it was hers, and then investigated it further.

I'm pretty sure, because with the way L operates based on assumptions, I thought maybe he was just messing with Light. But it looks like they actually had physical evidence this time.

Unfortunate timing that it happened right after Misa visits Light (and L) at school.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, they definitely had the evidence (L was looking at it in the beginning of the episode). What I don't get is why, out of all the people in Japan, they investigated her. I mean, it's not like they had a DNA match to go on until they took samples from her room...wait...maybe L had his own "samples" if he's as into her as he made it seem when he met her...
>> ARTICLE
Oh.... OOOHHHH. L's a super fan. He really did want to touch the booty.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I was thinking the same thing watching this episode, and I don't think it's ever explained either... Nobody knew of the relationship between Misa and Light until she was already being arrested, so how they jumped from 'we have DNA from the tapes' to 'it's Misa!' makes no sense.
>> ARTICLE
L you crack me up!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, my memory of this part was even further off than the last time I made a comment like this. I thought I remembered that the big incriminating evidence that L got this episode was that Misa had Light's contact as Kira in her cell phone when the call happened (I also thought I remembered L being the one who made the call). But it turns that everybody, even myself, is always underestimating Misa, she's not that stupid. 

I don't think Chief Yagami or anyone on the investigation has any business being surprised that Light is the prime suspect, I mean, I know we have an unfair advantage since we already know, but based on all of L's deductions and the evidence that Light started seeing Misa-Misa at exactly the right time for when the two Kiras should have begun working together, they should basically already know it's him and are just trying to find the proof.

The 25 episodes of deathnote although by no means perfect,is one of the most tightly written and gripping trillers in anime. The death of L brings deathnote to one of anime's most famous peak.

I consider the live-action ending of Death Note to be the canonical one, where [No anime spoilers, but live-action ones](/n "L writes *his own name* in the Death Note as far out as the system allows and, since earlier entries take priority over later ones, arranges his fake death to give Light room to gloat over his 'success' and capture him doing so. Two weeks later, he quietly dies of the heart attack he precommited to. It just seemed like a much more fitting end to the duel where L demonstrates just how far he was willing to go to win, and the fatal flaw of Light - his arrogance - leads so directly to his end.") The sequel I could take or leave, though.
>> ARTICLE
This is my second time watching and I've always thought it should've ended here.

>> ARTICLE
I've watched Death Note half a dozen times but only completed ep 27-37 once. This is definitely the peak of the show, so prepare yourself first timers, this glorious adventure ends here. I think a good comparision would be SAO season 1. The second half is not terrible compared to your average show, but compared to the quality set by the first half, it's obviously 2nd rate.

Death note 1-25 is a 10/10.
Death note 27-37 is a 7/10.

While I agree with you, I don't think Madhouse was ever planning to end the series in episode 25. The anime started airing after the manga had already ended so I think they had already decided that they would follow it all the way through.

As for the deleted scene, I'm pretty sure it wasn't intended to be in the TV broadcast, rather it's an added scene in the first recap movie. But I could be wrong.  
  
I really never wanted it to end here, although Ohba, the author of the source manga intended this to be the end. The only reason it carried on was because the editorial department of Jump wanted to milk it for more cash.  
  
As for the next 12 episodes of this show, they're extremely rushed compared to the manga. You see, the manga has 108 chapters and if I recall tight then this episode's events happen in chapter 48 or 49. That means that Madhouse dedicated 25 episodes to the first 50 chapters but only 12 to the latter half. So reading the manga can definitely be beneficial. It's not like it doesn't add anything.  
  
Sorry for the lengthy explanation.

Astute. Going to have rewatch that scene, and possibly be worried for Light. Though I'm not sure who can oppose him anymore.

I think it could've ended here if they wanted it to, maybe with another episode or two after it just to show what Light goes on to do.

I think it's mandatory for all Youtube videos especially the ones with death scenes to put a spoiler tag infront of it...

I unintentionally spoiled a friend of mine because of youtubes similiar video section. I linked I believe to an AMV and in the similiar videos section was a TOP 10 SADDEST ANIME DEATHS video with a character from an anime he was watching currently in the thumbnail.

Also Google is also a spoilery fuck. Just type the name of any character and the word "death" is always the next suggestion.

I'm unsure if that's a rule or not. It's definitely within one's own judgement whether or not to view YouTube links. Most of us should know by now that the related videos can spoil you.

Absolutely not, if the story ended here I would consider it a sour, character worship of Light telling the story that he just wins as Kira and that's the end. I never saw the ending before, we're getting close to the point where I stopped watching in the past, but while having L gone is sad, I am very glad that things don't finish once he's gone. 
>> ARTICLE
> Interestingly enough, this deleted scene shows that the producers at Madhouse considered ending the series right here.

It would've been interesting to say the least. I think it would downplay L a bit though. I feel like he must have something inplace in case he died. Especially with Light and Misa just being released with him still thinking it is them. Of course this could just be the end of L anyway, in which case, yeah it would've been a good place.
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking someone like L would've had a contingency plan. 

One last thing to thwart Light's plans.

If this is it, if the game's set, match, then I can't say I'm not a little disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
It certainly would downplay L , but the show's focus until now is all about how great Light is (or at least how he sees himself). The great part about L's death is that Light never needed to know his name, at the end of the day he's still L.
>> ARTICLE
>Rewatchers and first timers,would you prefer that Deathnote should have ended right here?

[Death Note](/s "Back then as a first timer I would've said yes, just because Near and Mello weren't as compelling characters as L.

So I'm ok with the second half and do not wish that the anime ends right here.

Also to answer your question:

[Death Note](/s "Honestly mostly because he represents the total opposite of my moral compass, even though it would be something new or rare to see the evil win, I still wouldn't want to have Kira win. And while yes the second half is weaker compared to the first half I still think it's worth it for the end and I also think that the second half is still good enough. I also think that Light was always too lucky in this story (with very few exceptions), so the story of his downfall is for me a good way to end the story in my opinion.")

That foot massage scene was seriously out of nowhere. I mean they're both attractive guys so I don't mind it, but that seemed like some serious fanservice.

I can't believe he's dead, is he actually dead? It seems like he pretty much knew it was coming so I hope he set something in motion for revenge incase he died. Light ofcourse had to let him know as L died, he's so proud of himself. I'll definitely miss L :(

On a side note: I was actually somewhat right with my prediction and Rem was the one who did it. Now Misa really is defensless and Light seems like he would be unstoppable..
>> ARTICLE
Information regarding symbolism in Death Note on the wiki page: 

>Just before Light has Rem kill L, L receives prophecies of his death in the forms of images and dreams (more than once). In the same way, Jesus prophesied (more than once) that He would be betrayed and killed. Also, Jesus washes the feet of His disciples, including Judasjust before the latter betrayed Him. In the same way, L washes Light's feet after their conversation in the rain on lying (although this scene was only in the anime, not the original manga).
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty interesting actually. I didn't pick up on that at all just seemed weird. Thanks for clearing it up!
>> ARTICLE
Stylistically, this episode is really different from all the others. It feels like it's mourning from the start. Also, it contains very literal and real death flags. 

Surprisingly enough, even though L is the character I like most, I cared more about the deaths of Watari and Rem this time around. They are both people who became involved in the plan's and ideas of their own geniuses and both end up dying trying to protect someone they care about.
>> ARTICLE
The symbolism in this episode...wow. The verbal turns of phrase, the sound and music choices, the visuals...wow. The first time I watched this I noticed some of the major symbolism relating to the  bible and death in general, but there are a lot of things in there I didn't notice before. I'll put up a quick list of things I noriced since I'm on my cell, riding the bus to donate blood and maybe expand upon it later unless someone else does it for me (I'll look at /u/Neawia's questions then too).

-Edit-

Some of the things I noticed, which apparently are the only ones that stand out to me since I watched it this morning, are the wings that Light has on his back when they come in from the rain, the foot washing, the distorted view through the glass stairs, Misa unclothing herself and dressing as a maid before serving Light, and the headless panda snacks which are L's last snack. Obviously there are a lot more since this episode is so well done in that it mixes both obvious and subtle symbolism throughout. On the foot washing, I find it interesting that they've kind of turned this religious symbolism on its head. It comes from old old customs of hosts either providing the means for guests to wash their feet when they came in or washing the feet of their guests themselves. In the biblical sense, it refers to Jesus offering to wash the feet of all his disciples. In that scene though, it's perverted, as though L is serving his god and master who is only allowing him to do so out of some twisted sense of graciousness. Interesting, powerful, stuff. 

Answers to /u/Neawia's Questions

>1\. Can you recall your reaction the first time you watched this episode?

I was shocked and saddened. I just thought it was going to be the two of them until the end and that yet another curve ball was going to be thrown at Light. This is also the moment in which I went from begrudging respect of him, even if I was rooting against him, to hating his entire being. The fact that I actually felt bad for Misa during this and the last episode, and the heartbreak I felt for L this entire episode...man, I was gutted. Not many shows out there that seem to do that.

>2\. In honor of L, the king of snacks, what is your favorite snack?

If I limit myself to something similar to L's usual fair, I find a good pudding to be an excellent snack (even those little pudding cups aren't that bad).
>> ARTICLE
> the symbolism you described

Everyone today gave excellent examples. I didn't notice them all at first (like Light's wings in the rain). I can't wait to rewatch this show one day and keep an eye out for all the little things you don't tend to notice on the first run through.

> man, I was gutted

Now I'm a little disappointed that I was spoiled on the fact that L dies. I suppose it would've been more of a shock since this episode sort of wouldn't came out of nowhere.

Still, I think L did need to go at some point, even though this is only 2/3 of the way through the show. It would've been fine if the entire show was Light vs. L, but I am interested to see what Light can do now that nobody is standing in his way.

> I find a good pudding to be an excellent snack (even those little pudding cups aren't that bad).

[Snack packs?](http://prod-cdn.thekrazycouponlady.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Snack-Pack-Pudding-Coupon.jpg)

Pudding is pretty great though. It's so simple.
>> ARTICLE
> Snack packs?

Yeah - although they're not called Snack Packs everywhere, but that's what I was thinking of. Not my first choice, but they do in a pinch. 

>I think L did need to go at some point

I think, in retrospect, it was probably the perfect time to do this. I remember hating the creators at the time, but the show wouldn't have the same impact for me if it didn't rip this beloved character away. I'm excited to go forward and see how I feel the second time around.

I knew it was coming, but damn...  I'd like to think that L knew Light was Kira this whole time, and the emergence of the death note and Rem confirmed this fact.  But, L, much like Chief Yagami, now has a personal bias due to his friendship with Light.  L instinctively knows that Light is Kira, but he doesn't want to believe it 100%, hence the whole let's test the death note out.  If L stuck to his gut, he could have at least told everyone of his suspicions.  This unfortunately would not save his life, since Rem's personal connection to Misa is unknown.  L is very remorseful in this episode, he's realized that all of Light's pieces have fallen into place, and it is very likely that he will die soon.  In the end, L dies peacefully in the arms of his killer and only friend knowing he was right from the very beginning.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah like that other guy said I don't think L had any conflict over Light being Kira. They were never friends but the true Light would have gotten along with L.
>> ARTICLE
I personally think that they never were friends... Not even Light without his memories and L. They were always playing a role, L just tried to get reactions from Light with all his talk about friendship. And Light only accepted his fake friendship to get closer to him and to be able to kill him. 

>but he doesn't want to believe it 100%, hence the whole let's test the death note out.

I disagree. L knows and believes 100% that Light is Kira, he never doubted it since Light became the prime suspect. He wanted to make the test because it was the only thing that made it impossible to proof that Light and Misa are Kira... Nobody would believe him that until this rule was disproven.


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I have to agree, I was a bit off with the whole friendship thing.  They were more of rivals, but I'd like to think that Light was the closest thing to a friend that L had.
>> ARTICLE
Fun Fact it's stated that L would have done the same thing had he been the one to get the Death Note instead of Light. I think this battle was really personal for him in that regard so it's important that he was right even if he lost.
>> ARTICLE
Ooooohhh, that sounds interesting. Is that something that the author stated? That L would've done the same thing as Light?

That'd be a really interesting alternate telling of the story.

Yes, and Ohba also stated that if Light is Evil L is just slightly less evil. L is completely willing to kill someone with the Death Note to prove he's right. He has that kind of pride and stubborness which would be insane if we didn't know he was right.

Oh hey some teasing on L's backstory

Misa's outfit looks so fucking creepy, argh. But that's probably the point.

She also looks so lifeless. She looks like a doll. And I hate dolls because they are fucking creepy. But I also hate Misa, so it's fitting I guess.

Those panda things that L is eating are so fucking delicious I wish I had some of those right now. 

[Well here in Germany those things have the shape of Koalas though but still it's the same kind of treat](https://www.real-drive.de/medias/sys_master/images/productimages/8/842094_1_1_detail.jpg)

Well /u/Neawia you said that Light was probably happy that Misa shortened her life span so that he hasn't to deal with her too long anymore. But he just developed a plan to prolong her life. Looks like her eyes are still important enough for him.

But I think he mainly just wanted to get rid of Rem and Ryuzaki in one swipe.

>I hear the bell.

[Ryuzaki right now](https://youtu.be/uxzNeFiQHGw?t=35)

L knows that he's dead, he knows that he lost. And that's why he's so melancholic and quiet and angry right now.

And now ladies and gentlemen the gayest scene in this whole show. It's shipping season for all Fujoshis. Prepare tissues to stop the nosebleed. Today is the episode that probably started a lot of Yaoi doujinshi. Did you know that Yagami backwards could be read as IM A GAY? 

Two manly men one giving the other one a foot massage, while the other one is drying him.

[Luckily a foot massage means nothing,](https://youtu.be/uWAPzkm3W10?t=148) so this isn't gay in any way.

I don't get why L wants to delete all data, wouldn't it be better to have as many data as possible for the sucessor to catch Kira?

And with this the best character in this show is dead... And with that the "controversial" part of this show starts.

So this is my first time watching the anime.  I had no idea that this rewatch was going on until a couple days ago, but I'm glad that I was able to catch up by this episode.  I'll probably try to take part in the discussion threads from now on too.

I read the manga years ago when I was still in middle school, and all I really remembered was what happened in this episode, and in the final one.  But holy hell, this episode was incredible.  It probably wouldn't be an exaggeration for me to say that this is one of the best episodes of anime that I've ever seen.  (Even if it would have to fight the last three episodes of Gurren Lagann for that title.)  Despite knowing it was coming, that scene still blew me away, and I even ended tearing up at what happened to Watari, L, and REM.

As for your questions:

1) Although this probably doesn't count, I have an irrational fear of needles.  I even have to look away if I see one on television since it makes me physically sick to see someone get stuck with a needle 

2) I don't even know with this one; I'm actually very similar to L; I have a huge addiction to sweets, so if it's sweet, chances are that I absolutely love it.  I will add something really funny though; I'm currently eating a Milka Oreo bar.  It's even right beside me right now.  And I have to say; even if it's extremely unhealthy, I could probably eat nothing else but this for a couple of days.  It's that good.  (The smores bar is pretty good too.)  If anyone likes chocolate, I really recommend giving these a try sometime.

3) Honestly?  I hate Light.  And while I really disliked him before this particular episode, this scene in both the manga and the anime was what solidified my hate for him.  He's an awful human being who doesn't care for anyone else but himself, and he will ruthlessly discard anyone who he sees as getting in his way.  He has one of the biggest egos that I have ever seen in any medium, and I doubt anyone could change my mind about him.

This was exactly what I'm talking about. Physical object that give you shivers or make you feel uncomfortable in any way

>I'm currently eating a Milka Oreo bar. 

Nice I love those too. Have a empty wrapping right beside me right now because I'm a fat fuck that can't stop when he started to eat those...

> He has one of the biggest egos that I have ever seen in any medium

That's why I love him as a villain but despise him as a character. He is just so over the top that it is glorious to watch him. You just love it to hate him.

> Those panda things that L is eating are so fucking delicious I wish I had some of those right now. 

You say that like they exist. Do they? Wait... oh it's a German snack. Guess I'll just settle for Teddy Grahams then.

> But he just developed a plan to prolong her life. Looks like her eyes are still important enough for him.

Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. I mean, he could write her name in the Death Note, but those eyes are too important. Plus sex, maybe. I mean at some point he'll have to consider it, right? If he does it with anyone else, Misa will freak out and kill him.

> Did you know that Yagami backwards could be read as IM A GAY? 

Wow, just... yeah. It's not even crazy. It's actually true.

> I don't get why L wants to delete all data, wouldn't it be better to have as many data as possible for the sucessor to catch Kira?

Good question. Perhaps he still wasn't sure if he was going to have a successor. Asking Light was still too new, and he didn't tell Watari about it or something.

I'm also trying to think of a scenario in which the data moving into someone else's hands is a bad thing. The worst person to get the data would be Light, and he'd either keep it or delete himself. Deleting it just seems like screwing over the other officers who might still need it to put Kira in jail. Now they have no evidence to arrest the Yotsuba members if they still planned on doing that.

> I said earlier in my comment that I think that dolls are creepy and that I don't like them. What is it thing that you find totally creepy or horrifying?

It's not a physical thing, but when it's late at night and you hear some strange noise outside. You think maybe it's some kind of freak of nature monster just walking through the street or something. You want to look out your window to see it, but you know he'll turn and look right back out you, and then you're caught.

>>Hey almost the same question as me.

You could've just said "great minds think alike", but sure, go with the German saying. We're idiots.

To answer, cheesecake. L probably has access to great cheesecake. Or Watari probably makes great cheesecake.

What do you think?

This was my biggest fear as a kid, looking outside of a window and just seeing someone standing there (or floating in my situation) and starring. That's why I never looked outside when I was going to bed. Lights out, eyes closed, into the bed and blanket over the head.

Also this fear got probably started by the game Black and White 2 where a voice suddenly [whispered my real name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSIXZJFgBFA) one day, I thought someone sneaked into my room and was gonna kill me the first moment. I found out years later that this was actually a feature in this game that was able to parse in your name (if it was common enough) and pronunce it.

> Also this fear got probably started by the game Black and White 2 where a voice suddenly whispered my real name one day

If I had heard someone talking in addition to or instead of the weird animal noises, I would've been freaked out of my mind. I would've just stayed still and pretended like I didn't exist if I didn't move, therefore the monsters wouldn't be able to see me.

> Man I really hoped for some hover text in there.

I didn't know that was a thing. Now I do.

[Fuck that guy.](#madsaitama)

I think I would be more accepting of him if he hadn't taunted L so much. You know how he didn't want L to lipread them when he was first talking to Misa? Well I think he knew that once he was free and clear, talking to Misa about the new world they were going to create in FULL VIEW of the camera was his way of taunting L. And the way he treated L when they came in from the rain...man, what an asshole. Agh! SO MANY PENT UP FEELINGS OF ANGER RIGHT NOW.
>> ARTICLE
>I don't get why L wants to delete all data

I think it's because he knows that if him and Watari die, that everything in the investigation to this point has one or more major flaws that have kept them from capturing the real killer. He also knows that giving Light (who is most likely Kira) access to it would be like asking him to tamper with it in his favour. Those are my fast and loose explanations anyway, but I think I'm on the right track.

Light, get the fuck out so I can see if Rem follows you around. - L

[Light up close, my favorite so far.](http://i.imgur.com/TMhHBKq.png)

Why is Misa getting naked? Why are there so many jewels? Oh shes changing clothes. This outfit is creepy. Not a terrible singing voice. Fits the kind of creepiness of this new version of Misa.

So Aizawas back on the force just like that?

[Those panda candies look delicious. Hehe, its like its holding a little Death Note.](http://i.imgur.com/ftJDpQR.png)

Light is using Rem to kill L. Kind of brilliant.

What though? How is killing L considered saving Misa? I dont think those two are directly related enough to bring the Shinigami death rule into effect.

[I cant hear you. What? Can you speak up?](http://i.imgur.com/qBZVKx5.png)

Bell?

[L up close.](http://i.imgur.com/f2RyIH2.png)

Oh shit. L just called him out.

Im so uneasy. What the hell is going on with L? I feel like hes about to just attack Light because he knows hes Kira.

This is disgusting symbolism. L is cleaning Lights feet like hes a king.

Light giving him the towel to wipe away those tears is kind of touching. At least, I suppose they're supposed to be tears and not just the water dripping from his hair.

L knows? Is he just giving up? Or does he have a plan to take care of Light?

Im sorry. What the hell is happening? Theyre going to test the Death Note. Fine. The criminal is not the owner, so nothing should happen. But WHY DID REM KILL WATARI?!?!?!?!

Holy shit. Every piece of evidence is gone. Who is Rem writing in her book?!?!? Oh, fuck, its L. ITS LLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

That OST shouting Kira.

Light caught him from falling.

Lights gonna smile?

[Yep.](http://i.imgur.com/CJyhs07.png)

Seriously. All according to keikaku.

[Freaking out. Serious moment, yes, but good reaction gif.](http://gfycat.com/DimwittedPeacefulAoudad)

Thank god Light picked it up. Keeps things less complicated.

So when is he gonna kill Misa?

Is Light going to become L or what?

Well that was super intense.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Well, /u/treons, you nailed it. Rem killed for Misas sake. L is dead. We thought it wouldnt be so straightforward, but you were ultimately right.

And Light probably won't kill Misa. He can still use her Shinigami eyes to his advantage.

Bums me out that we'll never get to learn L's name.

To be perfectly honest, as much as I like Light, L was awesome. I feel terrible for him. Hes the worlds greatest detective, and he came so close (and probably couldve succeeded) in solving a case involving supernatural powers. Light was just in his way. L made two new friends, his only friends, only to have one of them be the reason he died. L was just so defeated through all of this. How tired must he have been? Continually suspecting (correctly, at that) that Light was Kira, but being utterly unable to prove it. I do feel bad that hes gone. It wasnt fair.

But we must move on. Kira is calling the shots now.

Im still confused as to why killing L *at this point in time* meant that Rem was interfering with the way Misa was supposed to die. According to the rules, isnt killing Misas killer supposed to be the way to kill Rem? So L was Misas killer? Or is this a loose rule and simply being responsible for Misas capture and eventual death activates the rule. Im a little confused on this point, a little help would be appreciated.

And now she has Rems lifespan added to her own, right? So that might help negate the second Shinigami eye deal.

Rem dropped her book too. The rules say that it has to go to the next god of death to touch it or it has to be returned to the great god of death. So Light isnt technically the owner even though he picked it up. I suppose he can give it to Ryuk.

This is not how I saw L dying at all. Honestly, I dont know where to go from here with predictions. I feel like having a theory now would be like trying to write the rest of the show. Lights in the clear! But something has to go wrong. Possibly with Misa/Ls sister or mom or whoever that woman in the OP under the grate might be. Theres also another woman in the OP, as well as one man too. So there are some new characters who should come into play soon.

Well, overall the series has been pretty great so far. The pacing has been rather excellent, and every episode has fully held my attention, which is pretty rare. Im looking forward to seeing where things go from here.

Believe me they are delicious. I want some of them NOW.

>How is killing L considered saving Misa? I dont think those two are directly related enough to bring the Shinigami death rule into effect.

Because of all the killing she is doing right now L would find out that Misa is Kira 2 and she would get executed thus killing L would prevent that and extending Misa's life.

>Bums me out that we'll never get to learn L's name.

Well not in the anime but in the Manga I believe. Also you could look up his name in the wiki.

But here is the answer if you really wanna know:

[Death Note Volume 13 (I believe)](/n "His name is L Lawliet pronunced "Eru Rraito" ")

>Or is this a loose rule and simply being responsible for Misas capture and eventual death activates the rule.

Exactly that I explained why above.
>> ARTICLE
> Because of all the killing she is doing right now L would find out that Misa is Kira 2 and she would get executed thus killing L would prevent that and extending Misa's life.

I did discuss this a little with the-banned-one through PMs a bit. I suppose it's just a bit of a loose rule. I was under the impression that the Shinigami would die only if they killed the person *directly* responsible for the human's death.

Also, what about the fate thing here. If Misa was previously going to live really long because of Gelus (even after she took the eyes deal), she what, would've died in jail I guess. This was technically her fate all along. L would've caught her and put her in jail, where she would've waited to die. So then I wonder what her new fate is.

> Death Note Volume 13 (I believe)

[L's name](/n "I can't even pronounce that. It doesn't look at all like what Lawliet looks like. And what's his first name? What's the L stand for?!?!")
>> ARTICLE
[Death Note Rule](/s "The use of the Death Note in the human world sometimes affects other humans' lives or shortens their original life span, even though their names are not actually written in the Death Note itself. In these cases, no matter the cause, the god of death sees only the original lifespan and not the shortened lifespan.")

I think this rule comes into play. If she hadn't used the Death Note her life would've been longer because L would never be able to proof that she is Kira, but thanks to using it she shorted it herself. Also the difference is that Rem used it with the intention of saving a human's life. Because if you would die as a shinigami because you unintentional extended a humans life by killing his murderer years/weeks/days before he intents to kill his victim many more Shinigamis would've died before and it would be more known in the Shinigami World, but even Ryuk didn't know about it.

Like Rem said to kill a shinigami you must make him fall in love with a human. 

Edit:

/u/Neawia ups didn't notice your second question:

>[L's name](/n "I can't even pronounce that. It doesn't look at all like what Lawliet looks like. And what's his first name? What's the L stand for?!?!")

You can still be happy. You fucking nailed it. I would be too. But yeah, goodbye L. You will be missed.

You mentioned symbolism.

I couldn't help but connect the biblical passover where Jesus washed the disciples feet which included Judas who betrayed him.

Here's a parallel which I consider really gross:

El is Hebrew for God, Lucifer means "the light bearer."

L is now dead and Light celebrates his victory as 'god of the new world.' Note his obsession with becoming god, just like the devil.
>> ARTICLE
These are really interesting. Especially the one about 'El' and 'the light bearer'. Reversed roles in the show.
>> ARTICLE
This must be that episode everyone is always talking about.

What the hell can even happen at this point? With L and Rem both dead there's no one left that can actually oppose Light/Kira.
>> ARTICLE
My guess is that they're going to try and introduce somebody. There's still a couple characters from the OP that have yet to show up.
>> ARTICLE
L and Light had a moment there at the mid way point in this episode. I feel that if Light wasn't Kira their friendship would've been strengthened there. Also it also fuels the fire for yaoi fans.

Rem's put her plan into action! What could it be?

Watari's death really gives me feels. I hate seeing elderly people suffer.

Light's honestly shocked to see L die. But then that devilish grin spread across his face. Damn Light, you scary!

Light finding Rem's remains and the Death Note,

"Just gonna slide this down into my pants."

Welp L's dead. Feels there too. But forget that! God of the new world hype!
>> ARTICLE
I think it's the third time I have watched this anime, but I still feel like this was too soon. L is such an awesome character, that it is sad to lose him. However, it still baffles me that L didn't see this coming. I understand he saw Light as a friend, but if he was suspicious enough to test the Note, then he should have also been wise enough not to let anyone know until the experiment was over.
* **

As I mentioned on a thread a couple of days ago (although I think no one read it because I was like 23 hours and 59 minutes late), I am watching this anime with my mother. This is the first anime she has ever watched, because normally she dismisses anime because "she doesn't like the style". However, she has been enjoying Death Note so far.

Here are her opinions on the episode:

* Why didn't Rem continue with the menace to Light that in case Misa died, he would suffer the same fate? (Fun fact: up until now, I never thought about it, but now it confuses me a lot, because I can't answer that).

* L should have seen that coming.

* So, now what? (I just told her to keep watching. I don't want to spoil anything).

* **

Honestly, I have never been sure on how to feel about this episode. I somehow feel like the series should have ended here, mainly because [Death Note Spoilers](/s "the successors of L aren't as good as him, and they admit that"). However, I understand why they can't end the anime here. But I feel that the main characteristic of Death Note is, beside the cat-and-mouse game, the relationship between L and Light. Now with that gone, it can still be good, but it won't be as good.
>> ARTICLE
>I am watching this anime with my mother.

Death Note was the show that got my mother into anime in the first place.

Since then I watched FMA:B, FMA, Gurren Lagann, Code Geass, Clannad, NGE, Steins;Gate, Baccano and some more I can't remember right now with her. And currently we're watching Psycho Pass together.


>However, I understand why they can't end the anime here. But I feel that the main characteristic of Death Note is, beside the cat-and-mouse game, the relationship between L and Light. Now with that gone, it can still be good, but it won't be as good.

[So sweet](#anko)

> Why didn't Rem continue with the menace to Light that in case Misa died, he would suffer the same fate?

I'm confused by the wording a little. "Continue with the menace?" Like why didn't Rem continue to threaten Light? Well, there's not much Rem can do now that she's dead. She can't back up her threats anymore.

> L should have seen that coming.

Yes he should have. I suppose that he's just rattled at this point. He knows Light is Kira, but can't prove it. He also saw a live Shinigami, and the talk of Shinigami previously freaked him out a little. And I guess maybe he wasn't quite himself now that he had a friend in Light (sort of), even if he wasn't always 100% truthful with the sentiment.

> So, now what?

Yeah, good question.

> But I feel that the main characteristic of Death Note is, beside the cat-and-mouse game, the relationship between L and Light.

I do think a full 37 episodes of Light vs. L would've been great. At the same time, Light had big ambitions to become Kira, and it's been a while since we've seen him use the Death Note. Before that he was barely doing anything. Just killing criminals. He's yet to 'hit his stride', and I think the story needs to show us what happens when Kira is unopposed.
>> ARTICLE
> Like why didn't Rem continue to threaten Light? 

Yup. Basically. Perhaps Light came to the conclusion that Rem wouldn't kill him despite of the menaces. It seems like a small plot hole, but not an important one.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, ok. I get it. Basically, why didn't Rem bother to kill Light as well before she died? Yeah, that's a good question that will probably go unanswered.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was because it was too late for her when she realised what Light was doing. The damage that Misa gonna die already happened, and killing Light would've only made Misa sad [Death Note](/s "and she would've commited suicide"). So she did what needed to be done and killed L and Watari.
>> ARTICLE
I think I hate Light as much for the personal betrayal he pulls against Ryuzaki as all of the serial killing. He must have realized how much Light changed as soon as they found the notebook, all of Light's sincerity disappeared, he must have known he lost his first and formerly best friend. Has anyone else ever had a one-sided friendship like Ryuzaki's with Light's became?

I was so sad for like a week when this episode aired, I couldn't believe it nyslef, a freaking fictional character had me depressed AF. It felt like I had lost a friend, someone I looked up to as a mentor, seriously L's a fantastic character and while he was trying to so the right thing, he also thought he has found a friend in light.

Almost cried the first time I saw this. I don't rememeber Misa singing there when she started crying. I thought I would have remembered something bizarre like that.

Not sure how the task force missed Light smiling for an hour while L died. Light wins, flawless victory

On my first watch through the anime without reading the manga and I have to say... Seeing L actually die, especially in that manner and despite all the forewarning that I didn't want to believe.... that *hurt* to watch. L was a fantastic character who truly gave the show as much life as Light took away within it, despite their eerie similarities. In a perfect world, L and Light could have been best friends, which makes their faux friendship that much harder to watch in the end, especially the way Light looked into L's eyes as he died in his arms.

**The Intro**

First, I want to thank everyone one of you for participating in this rewatch. If you were just reading and not commenting, if you were popping in periodically, and especially if you were around for the entire time, THANK YOU. I'm truly glad that this rewatch retained high participation throughout the entire series. So thanks for being a part of my first rewatch as a host. And thanks to /u/cuckoodev and /u/Saikimo who originally suggested this show during the FMA 2003 rewatch.

One other quick thanks to both /u/Saikimo and the-banned-one who helped me out like usually do. Thanks to them we didn't skip any days when I was absent. You guys continue to be awesome, so thanks again.

Hopefully some of us can participate in another rewatch someday. Until then, keep being awesome.

---

*Disclaimer* - These are all *MY* opinions, and I'm not trying to pass any of this off as fact. So don't be offended, and change my mind if you can.

**Death Note**

The anime I knew about before watching anime. I probably wouldn't have watched it for a long time had we not done this rewatch. I'll start this off by giving my score. I think the first 25 episodes were excellent, 9/10. However, the final 1/3 of the show was nothing in comparison, 4/10. Since there was more good than bad, I'll leave my final score at 7/10.

Alright, let's get on to the part where I act like I know what I'm talking about, but it doesn't matter anyway because you all just watched the same show that I did.

**Voice Acting (English Dub)**

Light (Brad Swaile) and L (Alessandro Juliani) are the real standouts. They both did a superb job. All of the other voices in the show matched their characters extremely well even if they weren't on the same skill level as Light and L. And we can't forget about Brian Drummond as Ryuk who absolutely nailed the voice of a Shinigami. Overall, this dub was pretty good, no doubt about it.

**Soundtrack**

There were a lot of tracks that were musically appropriate for the subject matter (eg the choir voices for Kira). There are a bunch that I'm sure I'll be listening to in the near future. That being said, there were a few that were repeated a lot throughout the show, which happens in a lot of shows, but it still happened here. Overall, the soundtrack was fine. No real complaints, but it could've been better.

OPs and EDs. The first two were perfect. They really fit the tone of the show, and were enjoyable songs (personal preference). The second pair felt incredibly out of place. I don't think I watched the ED through more than once, to be honest (I always watch the entire OP and ED as long as the song is good). I did like the visuals of the second OP though. Tthey were quite nice, unlike the song.

**Animation/Art Style**

It's not like the show was heavy on animation. This wasn't an action show by any means. However, it was nice when it did pop up, like when showing off writing skills in fabulous fashion. The show had consistent quality throughout. I never really noticed anything that looked weird, definitely not the faces. And for anyone wondering, the bluray does look quite nice in comparison to the original.

**Story**

This is where I split it into two sections. The first parting being up until L's death, the second being from then until the end. I think this is a pretty natural thing to do, and I now understand why people don't like the final 1/3 of the show.

The first part: Excellent. I honestly can't think of another show that held my attention so well. Light was mainly on top of his game. He was an interesting protagonist, I think we can all agree. I was on his side since the beginning since I thought he had a somewhat noble plan. I'm also a believer in the ends justify the means so this was a good story for that. L was a great foil for Light, and by the end, I was rooting for L if only so he didn't have to die. Watching those two compete against each other and then work together was fantastically fun to watch.

Of course, we had other characters being close to useless. The task force members didn't really do much until the second part of the show. There were questionable moves made my Light and convenient events that allowed the story to continue moving forward, but it wasn't enough to take away any enjoyment.

The second part: Things fell apart, though that's not to say it wasn't fun to watch. I dislike Near and Mello simply because they are inferior clones of L. If L had never existed, the two of them would've been fun to watch. However, we knew and loved L, he died, and then he was replaced by his wannabe successors who weren't entirely ready.

Then we have the biggest plot point from the first part of the show being reused. It was literally, "Guys, we think Light might actually be Kira" two times. That was kind of boring. Somewhat realistic, but boring. We also had Light removing Misa's memories again, as well as Kiyomi Takada making a reappearance for no real reason. Oh, and Ryuk might as well have not even been in the show at this point. Way to shun one of the show's best characters.

What was good about the second part? Mikami was an interesting new addition. Dude's loyalty challenges [Code Geass](/s "Jeremiah Gottwald.") Would've been nice to see more of him. Hmmm... is that all I liked about the second half? Matt was cool. Not sure why he wasn't a slightly more prominent character. I would've liked Mello and Near more had they been different from L, but they really weren't. Mello kind of disappeared at one point anyway.

The ending!

For as little as I liked the second half, the ending was well done. It makes sense that Light's undoing would be his arrogance. While I still think it's complete crap that Near was able to come out on top, watching the entire finale sequence was a joy. Matsuda stepping up and finally doing something was amazing. Light losing his mind was incredibly fun to watch. Brad Swaile did an excellent job with the whole scene, especially the laugh. I'm glad Ryuk was the one to end Light's life. He would've just bled out anyway, and had he lived, he would've went to prison.

Overall, a good story. Boy wants to change the world, succeeds, but loses his handle on things which leads to his downfall. Wish the final stretch could've been much different, but the first 25 episodes do make up for it.

**Characters**

This was both the show's strongest and weakest aspect. Light and L are fantastic. I don't need to say much about them as even if you hate Light, he's still a good character to watch. Watari was an interesting character, and so was Soichiro. It's like the older that people were, the more badass they were. Ryuk was also amazing (while he was around), and I'm still incredibly bummed that he wasn't utilized more. I truly believe he could've received ample development and been integral to the plot.

Some of the B characters were less developed, and overall, kind of unintelligent (I'm looking at you, Kira task force). Aizawa only grew balls in the final 1/3, and even then he didn't do much and wasn't responsible for Light's capture. Matsuda was comic relief and resident idiot, but he was lovable. I enjoyed his love of MisaMisa and Light's relationships and stuff. Plus he got his badass moment in the end. The other members barely did anything.

Near and Mello were ok, though I didn't like them much. They were ultimately copies of L. Mello was an insecure little jackass. He pulled crazy stunts, then disappeared. I don't really care that he 'redeemed' himself by sacrificing his life to help Near succeed. We basically had no idea that was happening until Near just said, "Oh, by the way, Near helped me do this one thing". Near could've been cool. I liked his childish attitude, and the fact that he was clearly both ready and not ready to take over for L because of it. Ultimately though, he was L 2.0, which wasn't fun.

Best character? Sayu. Fight me if you so dare.

I'd really like to watch this show in another dub than German, but for some reason I just can't I just have too many memories with what I heard first so I never get out of my comfort zone with that one. But that what I heard from the English dub is great and it is definitely better than the German dub.

I also didn't like the second opening until my 1st rewatch, but I still think that the song together with the visuals does capture the more insane and over the top side of Death Note quite well.

I really wish that the writers didn't take the easy way to make their main characters look smart by making everyone else stupid, even LoGH my favourite anime does this, and it is one of the few problems I have with both of this shows.

>Best character? Sayu. Fight me if you so dare.

I'm just happy that it isn't Misa or Light.


>You can write the name of a person who has died backwards within 3 minutes and 20 seconds of their death in order to bring them back to life. Each Death Note only has the power to do this once per owner.

I first thought of using this as a discussion question, like choose one character to revive but I always found it too early to ask this question or every answer would've been L. And I didn't want to restrict the character choice...


>Hahahaha! Anyone have any suggestions for anime starting with the letter A or E that could use a rewatch? Gotta knock 'em out in order.

*Starts looking through his MAL* 

hmmmm

I liked "Angel Beats" and "Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai" (Anohana in short) on my list, and I could recommend those. Under E I just have the three Evangelion rebuilds, don't know if you already watched that, I quite liked them though.

I don't blame you. You've forged a strong connection with the German dub. Watching it in other languages would just feel too weird.

That's true. Agreed.

Those were highlights, sure. Mikami has mad pen skills, moreso than Light.

For me, I think Light might end up 3rd or 4th after L and Ryuk.

I have seen none of those so all I can say is... maybe. Not that they're bad recommendations, I just have no idea if rewatches for them will happen, and I think if I ever host another rewatch, I'd like to do it for a show I've seen.

Besides parts of the first half of Death Note, where I think they do a fantastic job showing just how intelligent these characters are and how quickly they run through various scenarios, the BBC show Sherlock is the only thing I've watched that does this well. The only one that comes to mind right away anyway. I'd love to find more shows that can truly capture genius level intelligence because they're a real treat. Hmmm...wait, does Log Horizon do that well? I can't remember, but I think it might, albeit without running us through Shiro's every thought.

>Everything you said

Yup, can't really disagree. This basically perfectly captures my feelings the first time I watched Death Note. I think it's worth a rewatch at some point in your future though. I ended up finding appreciation for the last 1/3 that I couldn't find it in me to give before and noticed many little details along the way that I just didn't pick up on when I was enthralled by the story and trying to keep up with the L vs Light stuff the first time.

> suggestions for anime starting with the letter A or E

I'm going to double down on /u/Saikimo's suggestions and say that Angel Beats is something I very much need to watch so a re-watch would be the perfect time to do so. Anohana is...something you owe it to yourself to watch; I feel like that's the one it should be, even if I selfishly want to get Angel Beats re-watched so I can be a first-timer haha

For E I'm going to go with Elfen Lied which I've only seen the first episode of but was fascinated by. I don't have anything.

I haven't finished it, but FMA:B hasn't been good enough to give it three whole points above both Cowboy Bebop and Steins;Gate and 4 points above Madoka Magica. Maybe the conspiracy here is that you give all the best content a 7, since it's a special number and all, but only when 10 isn't quite enough to express your true feelings.

> I think it's worth a rewatch at some point in your future though

I intend to. I'd like to have a viewing from a more critical standpoint whereas this one was more for my own enjoyment. It'll also be fun to see if I can pick up on any of Light's plans as he's working them out.

> suggestions for anime starting with the letter A or E

I'll keep those in mind. Anohana seems like something I might rather watch on my own than in a group tough. Also, I haven't seen any of them, and I don't want to host another rewatch where I am a first-timer. Not yet, anyway.

> my Mal scores

Unfortunately, I'm about to enter the process of reevaluating all of my scores. So seeing certain scores isn't indicative of how I actually feel about them at the moment. I feel that I've reached a point in my 'anime career' where I have a good idea of how I rate shows. That wasn't the case back when rating most of these shows. Things are skewed and rated incorrectly for now. And like you said, I have been relatively generous with the 9s and 10s which will change.

That being said...

I need to rewatch Steins;Gate, but I'm fairly certain I'm going to lower my score for that one. I think it's overrated. No Game No Life also requires a rewatch, but will also likely have its score lowered as well. To anger/sadden you further, Madoka Magica is also highly overrated, and may or may not see its score lowered. Cowboy Bebop will stay where it is. I need to rewatch that show too, but I just didn't watch it at the right time. I really wasn't into it, and I do think it's ever so slightly overrated, but it is a great show nonetheless.

So /r/anime can hate me all they want, but I won't apologize for not liking their favorite shows as much as they do.

Shoot me a PM if you want to talk about any of those shows any further. I'd love to do so, but I just don't want to clog up this thread with a lengthy off topic discussion. And don't be too disappointed in me, scottishrob. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. T_T

Hey! First of all, sorry I didn't end up participating in the rewatch, but I did marathon through the series on my own on one of the weekends and checked out some of the threads. Thank you for hosting this rewatch!


Great write up! I found myself agreeing with you most of the time and I'm more of a light supporter as well. I think I liked the 2nd part a lot more after this rewatch. I found near and mello not to be mere replacements of L, but as their individual characters who have an interesting relationship and the same end goal of capturing light to avenge L. I remember the first time through I was pretty sour about Light losing to Near, but after the rewatch it all seemed like a suitable way to end.


Thanks again for hosting the rewatch and sorry I'm wasn't able to paricipate as actively as I hoped. I might end up writing my thoughts down after reading through the thread, but I might not either. I have not watched the live action movies myself so I might join you all for that!

In a way I hope that whenever I rewatch the series I'll be able to feel the same way. I want to like, but at the same time they'll always be way too similar to L to me.

It is indeed both a little sad and a little funny. He's permabanned now. There's definitely some drama behind it all, but essentially he posted an inappropriate comment and ban dodged, apparently twice (one time I was a part of it :P), within the span of one week.

> Ehh, everyone has their eccentricities. At least she's better than Misa.

At least? At least?!?!? Hahaha, Sayu was more my favorite character. She wasn't around enough to be the actual best overall character.

> Agreed. Compared to some other shows with large casts, they were really disappointing. Like, I remember Rival delivering pizza better than 2/3 of those guys.

Rivalz? From CG? Hahaha, what a comparison. But yeah, there are a bunch of other shows that are capable of doing more with a larger cast. CG, uhhh, sort of included.

Oops, he's so forgettable I don't even know how his name is spelled, and I rewatch CG like every 6 months or so. 

> She wasn't around enough to be the actual best overall character.

Yep, aside from the fact she and Miss Yagami are two of the "normal" characters who would have likely provided more context how Kira is affecting the daily lives of everyday people who don't do any crime. Not to mention I'd have loved to see how the family copes with Soichiro being away all the time, Light suddenly moving in with his girlfriend who happens to be a pop idol(probably Sayu is a big fan as well).

>He's permabanned 

Shame, I'll miss his shitposting in the best girl threads. Not to mention the inevitable salt when C.C loses to random secondary girl from recent generic harem #2.

You know, this really was a missed opportunity. I really would've liked to see more of the daily lives of everyone to see how the world was actually reacting to the whole Kira business. We were basically just told about it, which wasn't enough for me. All of the things you mentioned would've been nice to see as well.

> Shame, I'll miss his shitposting in the best girl threads. Not to mention the inevitable salt when C.C loses to random secondary girl from recent generic harem #2.

Yep. Perhaps one day he'll find his way back to us.
>> ARTICLE
> even if you hate Light, he's still a good character to watch

Now that it definitely can't be a spoiler any more: depending on your view on the character, Light is actually only in like 5 episodes. The theory that Light (questionable but still relatively normal morals, sees Kira as unquestionably evil) and Kira (cold-blooded mass murderer, god complex, has thrown away any sense of morals that Light still possessed) are two very different persons goes roughly like this. 

Our protagonist, Light Yagami, is silently and unknown to himself replaced by a visually identical but mentally clearly quite different character early on. There are two points where you could argue that we stop seeing Light and only have Kira (and sometimes Kira pretending to be Light) anymore. The first is Lindt L. Tailor - up to this moment, he only killed criminals. This is the first time he compromises his initial set of morals. The second is Raye Penber. While Lindt was a murder committed out of rage and while caught up in the moment, Raye's murder was a cold-blooded, planned operation. This is the first time he really decides to actively go out of his way to kill multiple innocent people, something Ep1Light and AmnesiaLight would have thought unthinkable.

Light of course returns when Kira loses his memories for a few episodes only to then again be erased in the helicopter. In the anime, Light returns in the last episode while running to his death. An argument could be made that Light already changed into Kira off-screen in episode 1 when he became a mass murderer and started shouting stuff about gods and new worlds. 
>> ARTICLE
Well said. I think this is one way to look at it, but I'd also like to present another.

I don't think that Light 'ceased to exist' and that Kira took his place. I simply think that the Death Note caused Light to change so drastically that we think he's another person. But that's just what happens to everyone. We go through experiences in life that can drastically change who we are. It doesn't mean we are a completely new person. It's still us. We've just changed our views based on experiences we had.

So I think Light is still Light, but having access to the Death Note really kickstarted a major change in his personality. He slowly changed into someone who had no problem with killing non criminals. We can see that he changed back one he lost his memories (aka he didn't have access to his experiences with the Death Note).
>> ARTICLE
Well here we are, it was a fun rewatch everybody.

Also a list of people I positively noticed in the rewatch threads:

But also everyone else who commented.

Edit: Also a moment of silence for the now banned one, we will miss you if you read this.

Thank you all for making this a great rewatch.

Now about the series. I still really love this show, it isn't my most rewatch anime for nothing. Most of those are the results of showing someone else this show and watching it along with them. Also this show got my mother into anime. And it was my first anime that sparked the love for this medium. Yes it likes to do too much exposition (I mean the unatural bad kind of exposition). And it makes jumps of logic, mostly in the second part. But the first part is one of the best paced and binge watch enducing show I can think of. It really manages to be thrilled to see what comes next. And it manages to build such a great rivalry and dynamic between Light and L. And I must say that the Death Note itself is also a great concept for a killing device. I mean Light could've made it easy and made most of the kills he did like accidents or other reasons. But this wouldn't had made a exciting story instead little mistakes and a great rival made him always be wary. And it was entertaining to watch to see Light and L being always one step ahead each other by turns. 

Yes I too think that the second part has it problems but I still like it enough and I care enough about the characters to find it enjoyable. But it also gave us in my opinion a great ending to a great show.

All in all it probably stays one of my favourite shows, and it always will have a special place in my heart.

Last but not least:

>Add your own rule to the Death Note.

Before being able to use the Death Note again: To rebalance the now missing lifetime of the last victim, an owner of the Death Note needs to do an action to extend the life of another human. Being it for example first aid, giving a starving person food or saving someone from an accident. Only a god of death is allowed to take the life of a human without doing something in return.

It took a while but I think this rule adds that it isn't too easy to kill a lot of people in short amount of time and also it gives something back for taking something away (touka koukan rules), so the Death Note could also be the cause for something good with a good action instead trying something good with an bad action. Also I like the idea that with this rule in place Light probably would become a doctor or surgeon just to have an easy source of Death Note "ammunition". First I also thought about that the owner of a Death Note only is allowed to take as much lifetime like he saved before the kill, but I think this would make the rule unecessarily complicated.

I really like that rule and I think it would balance out some of the evil of the Death Note, even if Light still would save humans without a good intent.

And you. That OP write up was great work.

> Add your own rule to the Death Note.

I love your rule. That's a pretty cool concept. How does the user extend the life of humans? Do they use the Death Note or is there another notebook that's tied to it, the Life Note?

> First I also thought about that the owner of a Death Note only is allowed to take as much lifetime like he saved before the kill, but I think this would make the rule unecessarily complicated.

So you could save a whole bunch of people and put their increased lifespans "in the bank". Then when you want to kill you can only kill up to a certain amount?
>> ARTICLE
> How does the user extend the life of humans? 

....

I gave examples in the next sentence. But any action that extends the live of another human directly counts, even if the owner of the Death Note doesn't notice that he saved someone.

>So you could save a whole bunch of people and put their increased lifespans "in the bank". Then when you want to kill you can only kill up to a certain amount?

Yes.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, sorry. I meant what action is required? Example, do you just write down the persons name and want you want to help them with. Like, "Saikimo, feed him for one year" or does the Death Note user have to actually go out, find you, and make sure you have a bunch of food?
>> ARTICLE
> does the Death Note user have to actually go out, find you, and make sure you have a bunch of food?

I exactly meant this. Extending the life span with your own hands not with a magical overpowered book.
>> ARTICLE
Gotcha. I like it. Though it might be incredibly time consuming for what Light wanted to accomplish.
>> ARTICLE
Well my main intend was too weaken the Death Note a bit. Also it should make every kill count he does. And I think that killing should never be easy, and using the Death Note is easy.
>> ARTICLE
Well, if Light stuck to killing murderers on the run, every one of his kills would be balanced out by his own actions (extending the lives of the people those murderers would have killed).

That would in fact be a pretty good way for Light to tell if he was doing more damage than he prevented. If the Death Note stopped working, he'd know that he wasn't being a very responsible God of the New World and would have to refill his Karma meter to try again.

> Add your own rule to the Death Note.

That's a pretty cool idea. It would almost turn Light into a robin hood for life; giving to the poor and taking from the rich (although it's backwards because he must give to the poor in order to take from the rich)

The Light vs. L dynamic was far more interesting, especially when they were interacting in person with L openly saying who he was and that he suspected Light of being Kira. We never got that with Light vs. Near/Mello.

Mikami was great (until the end), but otherwise everyone was meh.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about everyone else, but I found it super difficult to decide what rating to give the anime.

I kind of ended up splitting it into 3 parts in the end. 

The first episodes until Light lost his memory of the deathnote were a 9.5/10 from me. I loved the cat
and mouse game between L and Light, some of those first episodes like the one with Naomi were just great
albeit a little sad.

Then there was when Light lost his memory and the Yotsuba group took over, I still really liked these
episodes but they weren't quite as good as the previous ones. The cat and mouse game was kind of
put on the back burner and the anime took a slower pace. Through these episodes my favourite parts were 
still when Light interacted with L, the Yotsuba group were just complete amateurs though and it took
away a lot of the suspense and what made it so amazing before. This section I would've given an 8.5/10
it was still really good.

Then there was the last third of the anime. I just really didn't like the characters. Light seemed to have
lost his edge through complacency with no L. He did seem to slowly get back to form as the last third progressed
but ultimately his character wasn't as good anymore in my opinion. Then there was Mello and Near, I just
really disliked both of them, Near especially. I found both of them boring and they really brought down
the anime for me. The last 2 episodes were the highlight of the last third and brought the score back up a little and what
I enjoyed about the anime but it wasn't quite enough to redeem the last third which for me was a 6/10

I ended up giving the anime an 8/10, which could end up changing when I think about it more, it's really
difficult for me to decide.

Lastly I want to thank /u/Neawia for hosting the re-watch and everyone else who participated it was really fun!

> I don't know about everyone else, but I found it super difficult to decide what rating to give the anime.

I had a tough time too. I think your analysis of the Yotsuba arc was spot on too. I had forgot that even though I loved watching those episodes, they were slower and less interesting.

I agree with your thoughts about the final third of the anime, but I ended up rating that section lower than you. I think majority of it was bad, and the ending did its best to save it.

Thanks! And thank you for always being around and commenting.

This was the first rewatch I've taken part in and really enjoyed it. Thanks /u/Neawia and everyone else posting. It felt strange yesterday going to bed without having watched an episode of Death Note since I've done that every day without fail for the past few weeks. 

Now, series analysis. I took part because Death Note was one of the first anime I watched and was also one of my highest rated ones so I had to confirm that I still liked it after being a bit (emphasis on bit) more experienced with anime. I'm glad because I can still agree with my original rating of the show. I feel in general it holds about even with the other shows I have given a 10, currently only Steins;Gate and Psycho-Pass (and Ragnastrike Angels because we all know that that is going to be the greatest show of the new season). 

There are some flaws which I was aware of going through. There were some pacing issues on the 2-3 episodes before the final 3 episodes. There were parts which didn't fit in with the style of the show such as Light and L handcuff fighting and a lot of stuff with Misa. Near's investigation didn't feel very satisfying because most of it was based on assumptions and L's work making it hard to believe he would be able to work that out. The art was hit and miss with some really beautiful scenes but some which just looked strange or boring.

However, I feel the pluses strongly outweigh the negatives. In general the flow of the show was great with a constant back and forth. There were some great scenes and episodes like Light's interaction with Raye Penber, tennis, L revealing himself to Light, the writing scenes  and, of course, the ending. It has strong character development in many characters like Light gradually giving up on more of his ideals in the pursuit of his "perfect world", L feeling a connection and similarity with Light even though he is a suspect and best guy Aizawa struggling to balance his sense of justice with his responsibility to protect himself and his family. This is also the only show I have seen (including regular TV and film) that gets you to follow (at least to me) the villain of the story but getting you to understand the villain's point of view as well without messing it up horribly.

Now, the important questions:

> Add your own rule to the Death Note.

I'm going to steal one of the responses from a previous thread about reducing the user's lifespan but switch it to having a very small chance to kill the user. It probably wouldn't make good TV having the main protagonist die for almost no reason but it would make it more exciting for Ryuk while probably reducing how many Light kills so that's a win.

> What is your favorite potato chip?

Worcester sauce. They taste great and the name confuses Americans. It's a win-win.

Looking forward to the live-action film watches because I've never seen those before. Probably wont write this much though.

It was for me the same after the Legend of the Galactic Heroes rewatch (my first rewatch) 162 episodes +2 Movies with one episode every day. Almost half a year discussing and watching one episode a day of this show. Felt so strange to not watch the next day after it ended.

Holy crap. Kudos to you for actually sticking with that thing in its entirety.

Well, I argue that because I was able to discuss every episode with other people added so much to the enjoyment that it easily became my favourite anime.

It was a ton of fun. Thanks for always hanging around and commenting. It's always weird when the rewatch ends. You're so used to the schedule of watching an episode every day, and now... nothing. Well, the movies.

> It has strong character development in many characters like Light gradually giving up on more of his ideals in the pursuit of his "perfect world"

Yes. I was definitely pro Light towards the beginning as he seemed to genuinely want to create a better world even if he also wanted to be the absolute ruler of that world. Towards the end, I wasn't so much on his side. He lost it. He went crazy. He seemed more evil overall.

> Worcester sauce. They taste great and the name confuses Americans. It's a win-win.

Confirmed. I'm confused. Isn't that a sauce? Googled "worcester sauce chips". Google suggested correcting the word "chips" to "crisps". Looks like it's flavored ~~crisps~~ chips. And it's Lay's British variant of chips since the logo is exactly the same except with "Walker's" instead of "Lay's"?
>> ARTICLE
> Towards the end, I wasn't so much on his side.

Good.

> Confirmed. I'm confused. Isn't that a sauce?

Yeah and they are great. I've never had the sauce on its own but the crisps are awesome. Sadly they didn't use the name Worcestershire Sauce to confuse Americans any more.
>> ARTICLE
Hey guys, hopefully you all had a great time watching as i have but some questions that hopefully someone can answer. Firstly, how was Mello the reason why Near defeated Light and secondly, does anyone wanted light to win ? (I wanted him to win just to see his efforts go through but not really for his purpose).
>> ARTICLE
I can't support Light because I oppose to the death penalty, but when you look at what he did. He stopped war, crime dropped. It makes you wonder what fascist rule can do. 
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. Just thought that someone may have the same feeling but I do agree that crimes or what not have decreased dramatically when Kira was active. 
>> ARTICLE
Mello kidnapping Takada was what changed the game. When he did that, Mikami believed that he had to kill her because Mikami believed that Light couldn't at the time. By doing so, it allowed Near's agent to find the real Death Note and replace it with the fake one. Because of that, Light's plan, which was flawless otherwise, was ruined. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the reply, I finally understand it.
>> ARTICLE
Light's plan (tricking Near with the fake notebook, then having Mikami kill them with the real one) worked flawlessly. Near, Aizawa, Mogi, and all the other useless characters in the shed would have died. But because Mello kidnapped Whatshername, Mikami thought he had to kill her and accidentally revealed the existance and location of the real notebook to Near, which allowed him to swap it for a fake and turn the events of the finale around.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh got it thanks a lot ;)
>> ARTICLE
> Whatshername

Kiyomi Takada

> Mikami thought he had to kill her and accidentally revealed the existance and location of the real notebook to Near

Wait, now I'm slightly confused. How did Mikami using the notebook alert Near to the location of it?
>> ARTICLE
Near had one of his agents tailing Mikami all day every day. That's how they found the notebook in the gym locker (the fake one that Mikami wrote names in while Kiyomi did the actual killing). When Mikami killed Kiyomi, he went to his deposit box at the bank (where he hid the real notebook) to do so. Near's agent followed him and discovered that notebook. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok, that's right. Thanks, regendo.
>> ARTICLE
This also highlights one of the huge flaws and reasons people didn't like the 2nd half as much. Mikami knew the entire time that N was following him, so there's no reason he would go try to use the Death Note and think he wouldn't see it. The anime makes light of it but Near is so smug in feeling he's better than L because he won on a fluke.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, good point. Mikami really should've been more aware that Near and his crew were keeping tabs on him. Light would have definitely mentioned that to him, probably though Takada.

And yeah, Near's a little smug about winning even though *he* didn't *beat* Kira. I wonder how L would've felt if he was able to capture Kira in a similar way. Probably a little disappointed that it ended like that. L would've wanted to best Kira. Though I'm sure he'd still be happy that they finally captured Kira.
>> ARTICLE
He might have been proud that his successors were able to do it, but L was really disappointed that he got killed. He was happy to know in his last moment that he was right all along though. L never really cares about bringing Kira to justice but his own selfish desire of wanting to win. But even then they never captured Kira so much as Ryuk decided to put an end to Light, but 
[Manga 108/109](/s "Actually Kira's followers persist in the end"). 

Maybe Light still won.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately I didn't participate in the rewatch as I was already at the third half by the time the rewatch began (not that I would've contributed much anyway) but I'll share some of my thoughts.

On a whim I decided to watch DN around a month ago, I had delayed the series for over 5 years so I could watch it with a clear mind.  
The first episode immediately hooked me in, Light piqued my interest pretty quickly and the great soundtrack really helped set the mood. 

The first dozen of episodes were some of the most fun I've had watching a show, the insane game of cat and mouse between the two very engaging characters was a blast and I loved how overly dramatic and larger than life the scenes were.

My enjoyment dipped slightly when Misa was first introduced, I wasn't really fond of Misa because of how simple-minded she was and she initially felt like a filler character to me. While i never really liked her character I didn't mind her anymore after a couple of episodes and she did make the game slightly more interesting.

Then I hit the Yotsuba arc and my enjoyment dropped massively. With Light temporarely gone the new "Villain" had some very big shoes to fill, sadly he was so bland that I could barely even remember his name. It did give us some interesting scenes with Light wondering if he could've become Kira and L doing L things but I still had a hard time finishing the arc. In hindsight the arc wasn't awful but it was nowhere near the perfection of the first half.

Once Light regained his memories the show instantly gained some traction for a bit. What followed shortly after was the first time in the show that I actually hated Light. Now I was definitely not okay with Light when he killed Fake L, The FBI, Ray Penber and his wife but they were just side characters and they served their purose. What Light did back then was morally wrong but it added tons of dramatic tension so it never really bothered me. However when Light killed L it was not only cruel as he watched him die with the smuggest grin of his life but also bad because the show just lost one of the two most vital characters in the series right after an arc where the other character was in the sidelines. DN was amazing because of the game of cat and mouse between Light and L so with L gone I expected the last arc to be another Yotsuba.

To my surprise I actually enjoyed the last arc greatly, the finale in particular was a perfect conclusion to the series. From what I gathered most of the backlash was aimed at Near and Mello and how they were a poor replacement to L. I never had an issue with them because I always saw them as an extension of L, a back-up plan in case L died during an important case. [This shot](http://i.imgur.com/ybxnyh8.jpg) illustrates this perfectly and is also one of my favorite scenes of the show. While Light won the battle against L, Ultimately it was L that won the war as he said he would.

All in all if I were to rate the show this is how I'd do it :

First half : 10/10  
Yotsuba arc : 6/10  
Post-Yotsuba arc: 8/10 (Even though I liked Light more I was very salty at L's death)    
Mello and Near appear : 9/10  
Finale : 10/10

Overall : 9/10  

The strong first half and finale definitely carried the weaker parts IMO. The Soundtrack was also excellent and the visuals were good.

Lastly I also want to link [this essay about Light](http://casuistor.tumblr.com/post/100883210747/prekira) wich I think is worth a read, it delves deeper into Light's psychology and why he did the things he did. Light being pure evil from birth is a somewhat common opinion wich I heavely disagree with and the essay sums up most of my feelings towards Light as a character.
>> ARTICLE
To this day, I've seen the first 26 episodes over 7-8 times with various friends and family members. Such an amazing story with great characters! Light Yagami will go down as one of my favorite characters of all time. L was also a very strong character and it took god of death to actually bring him down, so you have to respect the fuck out of him. Solid 9.5 out of 10 for me. I've only seen the second arc 1 time and that is enough for me. I don't even recommend the second arc to people that enjoy the first 26 episodes. I tell them to treat it as if ep 26 is the end of the series. Melo and Near are complete jokes and it's too hard to watch Light make all those stupid mistakes. 

This was the show that got me into anime in the first place and its what I recommend to other first time anime watchers. Thanks for this rewatch discussion. Even though I didn't comment much, I was still here reading everyones thoughts. 
>> ARTICLE
A huge thanks to /u/Neawia for making my first re-watch a blast! I think I probably wouldn't have been nearly as active if I felt like I was shouting into the void which is usually the case with Reddit, upvotes be damned haha I'll start with your questions...

>1\. Add your own rule to the Death Note.

I think I would add a Gray Cowl of Nocturnal rule to the notebook. If you've ever played TES IV: Oblivion and done the Thieves Guild quest-line, you'll have a better picture of what I mean. I'm talking pre-curse-broken cowl btw. Anyone who uses the book will be erased from the memories of those they come in contact with or who see them with the book until such time as they give up ownership. This would mean that if the user wants to use the book, they have to fully commit and be willing to lose all ties with their friends and family, as well as being willing to never again forge human relationships, although I think other Death Note users would be able to remember each other. Yeah, it makes the book OP for someone like Light, but it protects their loved ones from a lot of the misery that goes along with the Death Note. It also prevents them from ever gaining a normal position of power since no one would remember them beyond their identity as some sort of invisible god of death. You would be both extremely powerful and not powerful at all.

>2\. What is your favorite potato chip?

This has actually been harder for me to figure out than the Death Note rule XD I finally decided that I wasn't allowed to factor dip into the equation and ended up deciding to go with Old Dutch Dill Pickle.

-------------

**Second-time Death Note Thoughts**

-------------

Death note will always hold a special place in my heart. I had only really been exposed to Pokemon and Dragon Ball Z as a child, and was fairly young, so I didn't really get the concept of "Anime" they were just cartoons to me. (Edit: Apparently I watched a lot of anime as a kid and didn't realise. I just looked up some stuff from the time I was watching and found Monster Ranch, Digimon, Metabots, and a bunch of others I recognised haha) As I got older, I had an older cousin who would expose me to episodes of this and that, and I realized that I was a fan of anime, and that I really wanted to get into it. The first show I ever chose was Death Note. 

I had never seen anything like it. Intelligent characters, epic battles of wits, the intensity of eating potato chips and it not feeling ridiculous. I was hooked.

I think what I noticed this time around especially was some of the ways in which Death Note is dated now. You can see it a lot in the expository dialogue. You can see it in the animation. You can see it in the character archetypes they pull from. But despite all that I couldn't help but love the first 2/3 as much as I did the first time because, in a funny sort of balancing act, I noticed a hundred carefully crafted details sprinkled throughout the series that really stepped it up a notch. From subtle symbolism to music themes that slowly built episode by episode - I fell in love with a series all over again. And this time, instead of being shocked, angry, and disappointed when L died with 1/3 of the series left to watch, I was rightly saddened and mourned him and Watari as they deserved.

Then we got to the part that I refused to acknowledge in my 10/10 I gave Death Note on MAL when I finally made my list this past year. I decided that the rushed last third of the series I loved with new characters I thought were sub-par and old characters I thought acted out of character wouldn't drag down that brilliant first half. I was being biased, but that's what I use MAL for, my personal thoughts and remembrance of series' I've loved, hated, and felt indifferent toward.

But you know what? This time around, I actually found myself enjoying this last 1/3. No, it wasn't as good as the first half. A lot of the pacing ends up being rushed and the smart symbolism and sound design dries up a bit. But instead of disliking it, I found myself appreciating these two halves of L a little more in what they stood for. I liked that in their own way, each was both better and worse than L. I liked that after we saw Light develop a god complex over just a few months, he was a noticeably different character after another six years of development. He was rusty, and did things that someone who is sure they have the run of the world, intellectually uncontested, would do. He made ballsy decisions and got burnt. But he learned. Characters who would have smoldered for all these years without progress on the case were more willing to suspect their leader. In the end, Matsuda showed the metal that he had demonstrated throughout the series but that no one had given him credit for. Light won the battle against Near, as he should have, but his hubris was finally his undoing. His hubris and a rotten stroke of luck concerning things outside his control that was similar to what ended up making L lose. But L had a contingency, Light did not. 

So in the end, somewhere through all of this, I ended up appreciating both halves of the series more than I would have without this re-watch. I still don't think it deserves a 10, but I can feel a little less guilty about giving it one.

I kind of wish they would do a re-make of the series, kind of like FMA:B. I have a feeling that a lot of the issues I've felt could be taken care of, pacing could be fixed, characters fleshed out, etc. etc. I think the Near/Mello arc is necessary in a way, but could probably be handled better. I also think doing something with the transition over those 5 or 6 years is important since it would help the audience understand how the characters, Light especially, have changed. It could also give us some insight into just what the hell Near and Mello have been doing since they seemed to accomplish in 5 years what L did in like, a week, which just doesn't make sense. I wonder if the movies or maybe the new series will satisfy some of these things for me in one way or another.

It's good to hear that people enjoyed my first rewatch as a host. Thanks for participating too. I think everyone did a good job of responding and discussing with each other which, imo, is crucial to a successful rewatch.

> your Death Note rule

That's a pretty interesting rule. That would *the* rule of the Death Note. That's gnarly though, no one remembers who you are. So lonely. So what happens if you give up ownership after a few years? How does your family and friends fill in that time gap where you were 'gone'? Also, how the heck do you catch someone like that? I've never played Oblivion so I don't know how that quest line resolves.

> ended up deciding to go with Old Dutch Dill Pickle.

So they taste like pickles?

> the intensity of eating potato chips and it not feeling ridiculous

I mean, it was a ^teeny ^^bit ^^^ridiculous.

> But L had a contingency, Light did not. 

Damn. I don't know what is about that line, but I feel like it's so much more important than we realize. I suppose Light's ego is what caused him to believe he wouldn't need a contingency plan. Now I really would like to see L using the Death Note to learn how he would've handled everything. I can't help but feel like he may have gotten further than Light did because of their difference in personalities.

> a remake of Death Note

I have no idea if they ever will considering (to my knowledge based of off comments here) they adaptation is close to the manga. I suppose it's still possible considering how wildly popular Death Note is.

I also agree that having a little bit of information concerning the time during the time skip would've been nice. Things changed too much without any explanation other than Kira was now in control of the world, and Near and Mello were finally ready to track him down.

Nice write up, scottishrob. Glad you stuck around for the rewatch. Hope to see you around the sub or in another rewatch someday.

[TES IV: Oblivion](/s "Basically the poor guy's wife thinks he just walked out on their marriage. He's actually an NPC that you can interact with throughout the game but, once you finally break the curse for him, he tells you that he's explained his position in basically every conversation you've had, but you and everybody else just doesn't remember him, his name, or anything information he gives you that could connect him with the artifact. By breaking the curse he's not able to prove the explanation for his "disappearance" - even though he's been talking to his wife every day for who knows how long trying to get her to see through the curse - but he gets his identity back.")

What an awesome show. Thanks for hosting this rewatch /u/Neawia! I've always wanted to rewatch Death Note but never really made time for it. 

The practice of hosting a rewatch on this subreddit is great because it forces you to choose whether or not you'll participate, you can't just keep putting it off.

1. I'd say this rule would only be relevent after the series has finished up and Light/Kira is dead.

Rule: No, you may not use this note to try and "Change the world." It won't work, trust me. Use this to get back at some asshole or something I dunno.

Ryuk would probably try to cover up this rule though haha.

Of course. You need to go read the manga. [Manga Ending](/s "I personally think the manga did he ending better. It. I can't describe it without feeling sick.")

In the UK you can buy 2 in 1 Death Note Black. There are 6 of them with 2 volumes each. They are 10 each from Waterstones or WHSmith. Or you could check Amazon I believe they have the 12 individual volumes.

Death Note is one of the only shows I would call perfect. Truly a masterpiece.

Now to check if there is a UK Blu Ray release.

I really liked how in the end Mello put aside trying to beat Near. I went from thinking he was a psychopath to really respecting him for knowing he had to work with Near to catch Kira and then giving his life for it. 

I think Lays are probably my favorite potato chip, they have the right balance of oiliness and crunch that I want from p chips. 

So are we going to watch the Rewrite episodes before the movies, or just leave them be?

Would light have been caught if he hadn't tried to challenge L and near. If he quietly killed criminals. I really noticed how good the soundtrack was this time around, Underrated. Perfect timing for the rewatch, thanks OP
>> ARTICLE
If he quietly killed criminals, he never would have achieved his goal anyway. The entire point was to be bombastic and larger than life, in order to intimidate would-be criminals into staying on the right side of the law. It's basically the embodiment of the death-penalty deterrence argument.
>> ARTICLE
Light's character is the reason he lost. As he said, he is the God of the New World. I think there is a word for thinking you are God. 

Light wouldn't not challenge L. He wished to be Godlike. He was threatend by L. 

Because of Light's personality he lost..

But yes, if he hadn't challenge L he wouldn't have been caught.  
>> ARTICLE
> Would light have been caught if he hadn't tried to challenge L and near. If he quietly killed criminals

I think if he just ignored Raye Penber he never would have been on any list whatsoever. Killing him when he didn't need to is what set everything in motion I think.

[Death Note](/s "Ugh todays episode is introduction to worst girl...")

Man the director from Sakura TV has the time of his life right now.

Also how unprofessional of Kira, not having the everything ready when starting to record... Well doesn't sound like Light if you ask me.


R.I.P. Ukita you died while trying doing the right thing.


Man this must sting for L because he just got one of his theories wrong, (well not entirely but still) So he was really risking his life when aproaching Light.


Damn Mr Yagami is such a fucking badass, recovering from a heartattack? Not now I have to stop Kira from taking over the world.

And Light is enjoying the show right now. He knows that this has caused some major confusion for the task force.

Damn L you immediately found out that this was just a copycat. 

[](/s ""Both their names were only reported in tabloids and daytime talk show." They already show what kind of girl Misa is. You get to know her before she even appeared in this show")

Damn 70 in L percent this means 290 in human percent.


I'm always looking up the transcript of the episode when quoting something so that you don't get confused when I quote something and the transcript say here:

MISA:
>It's all right. I'm sure that Kira is kind to those with pure hearts.

But in the German Dub she say's 

>Kira ist bestimmt ein ganz ganz lieber Mensch mit einem reinen Herzen. 

translation:

Kira is certainly a very very kind person with a pure heart.

Well this sounds quite different to me. So is the site where I looked up the transcript wrong or does Misa say this in this in the dub? Also everyone watching with Subs, especially fansubs, what does the sub say?

But here what I actually wanted to say about the quote (the German one):

Yeah a serial killer probably has a pure heart, I mean you know people with pure hearts are known to kill other humans, especially other people who protect the law, like FBI agents (Maybe she doesn't know about it, but Light said in an earlier episode that the public knows about the deaths of the FBI agents)

But I agree with the English version, he is kind to those with pure hearts when they don't work against him.

---

After Episode thoughts:

I really appreciate the whole plot with Kira2 just because it stirs up the plot just before it started to become stale. I mean you can't have only so many episodes of Light and L sniffing at each other without anyone of them coming closer to a result. So I like that but [Character Spoiler](/s "damn it also introduced my probably least favourite anime character of all time I just can't stand Misa, first time watching I had almost no problems with her but everytime I rewatch this my hate to her grows.")



Rules for humans:

1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.
9. The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.
10. The person in possession of the Death Note is possessed by a god of death, its original owner, until they die.
11. If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.
12. The cause of death must still be in realm of possibility for the victim.
13. It's possible to write down the cause of death first and add the name later.
14. If a human uses the note, a god of death usually appears in front of him/her within 39 days after he/she uses the note.
15. A person can shorten his or her onw life by using the note.
16. One page taken from the Death Note or even  a fragment of the page contains the full effects of the note.
17. **The instrumen to write with can be anything, (e.g cosmetics, blood, etc.) as long as it can write directly onto the note and remains as legible letters**





Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1. The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.
2. Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.
3. Gods of Death, the original owners of the Death Note, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note.
4. A god of death cannot be killed even if stabbed in his heart with a knife or shot in the head with a gun. However, there are ways to kill a god of death which are not generally known to the gods of death
5. The specific scope of the condition for death is not known to the gods of death, either so, you must examine and find out.

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. Well we only got a short introduction to Kira2/Misa, but what do you think about her at the moment?

2. What is your favourite kind of cake?

3. (first timer only) how big is the chance (in L percent), that Matsuda will become a useful part of the team?
>> ARTICLE
Greetings, the literal translation of what she said in Japanese is:  I have faith that Kira is kind to those with pure hearts.

Hope this helps.

Thank you for that. So it was just a mistranslation from the German Translation team...

The literal translation also makes more sense for me.
>> ARTICLE
1. I'm coming in with a bias against Misa. I like the main cast so much that she's just going to suck time away from them. Also, having her around skyrockets the chances of there being a ~love story~ and I'm not about that life for this show. Plus she seems unhinged.

2. Either cheesecake or yellow cake with vanilla mousse filling. God, now I'm hungry.

3. 72.3%. I figure there's a point to giving him more personality than the other cops. I'll anticipate his shining moment of badass.
>> ARTICLE
1. Well I won't tell anything yet because I don't want to influence the first time watchers first impression of Misa, that's why I also spoiler tagged all my reactions to Misa this episode.

3\. Damn what a high number, even higher than the chance that there's a second Kira. But nice that atleast someone has trust in Matsuda.

Action packed episode today, but neither Light nor L takes the spotlight.

Chief Commissioner Yagami sure is badass, no heartattack will stop him from upholding justice.He proves if your plan is daring enough, you will succeed, that glass door proves no match for a police van. Too bad Ukita didn't think this one through, alas his character design is too simple and characterisation is too short not to mention his mentality is too Leeroy Jenkins.

New Kira- Amane Meesa. Blonde with annoyingly high pitch voice, hopefully she wouldn't be as stupid as Jar Jar Binks. In her first appearance she seems to display a Yandere tendecy towards Kira (Light), going so far as to kill innocent people just to prove her might already.

Poor Ukita has the personality of a spaz in a horror movie. They have such a low survival rate in the face of the supernatural.

One of my favorite aspects of this show is that they don't drag out the big reveals for dramatic irony. For example, L has already sniffed out the Kira copycat. It keeps the pace from dragging.

The rewatch has finally caught up to my binge! I can watch episode 12, now!!

Hello, everyone. I'm back. I will be posting the discussion threads again from here on out.

/u/The-Sublimer-One has brought up an interesting idea for us. So please, take a second and read the OP (or just click [here](http://strawpoll.me/7025294) you lazy buggers). It's just to see if there's enough interest in posting discussion threads for the live-action Death Note movies. Thanks.

As for me, it might take a day or two to catch up to the rewatch. So for those of you lovely bastards who enjoy my reactions and theories, you'll have to wait a little longer. On the plus side, I will be doing my usual write-ups for all the episodes I missed. So expect me to join back in on Thursday, Friday at the latest.

What about watching the Deathnote: Rewrite episodes?

I don't see why not. At the very least, it can't hurt to ask everyone if they'd be interested. I'll make a straw poll again sometime in the near future. I just want to figure out the live-action movies first, then we'll move on to the Rewrite episodes.

Man, I get so pumped up when Chief Yagami just lets go of procedure and smashes into the damn building. And then the anticipation of what the hell L has planned so that Yagami can leave out the front of the building and the symbolism of the police standing up to "Kira" with their body blockade...awesome :D I know they're relatively cheesy points in the show, but they just work here for me haha I think going forward my reaction to the series will be the same this second time through as it was the first time (as opposed to the first 6 or so episodes which gave me very different feelings and had me noticing all sorts of things I didn't notice before). 

I was always afraid that rewatching Death Note would tarnish my teenage love of the series, my first true anime love, but I'm finding that it stands up - even if they spout copious amounts of expository dialogue compared to the quality story-telling of today. Looking forward to the coming episodes since my thinker-box has somewhat hazy memories from here on out and things keep moving faster than I remember.
>> ARTICLE
Today is the day that we meet one of my least favorite anime characters of all time. If you're watching the dub prepare for some serious ear damage. 

- They haven't found Naomi's body? That's really kinda strange I can't remember if Light forced her to kill herself in a way that she wouldn't be found.

- Ukita... We barely knew you, but for some reason I'm more sad than last time I watched this. Poor guy tried his hardest to be a hero.

- Damn everybody is ganging up on L, I mean he's risking his life just as much as you guys now, even going so far as playing tennis with captain psycho. God dammit I'm actually tearing up with L shaking like that, he feels guilty.

- MR. YAGAMI CONFIRMED FOR BIGGEST BADASS EVER HOLY FUCK HOW DID I FORGET ABOUT THIS! Oh my god seriously even pulls a gun on pedo stache God I love him so much right now.

- All of the first time watchers are probably pretty confused about how all these people are dying and how Light could do it.

- "what about your condition?" "I've never felt more alive." Chief Yagami confirmed as Bruce Willis for Die Hard 6

- "Thanks, but I think I'm gonna drive myself. Your green suit is ugly as fuck."

- Finally we see what Light has been up to all this time, and apparently this incident has nothing to do with him. 

- Fuck yes L can already tell that this isn't the original Kira. This is kinda random, but if there's another Death Note movie I want Keanu Reeves to play Matsuda. They both have that look of surprised retardation locked down.

- And we've finally met Misa and Rem. Can't say I'm too fond of the characters, but I don't wanna spoil anything so I'll just shut up.

This episode was way more emotional than I remembered. L being all shaken up after Ukita's death was something I forgot and it was a nice touch. Chief Yagami is the star of the episode for sure though I mean if anyone tells me they knew he was going to drive a fucking bus through the door and pull a gun the first time they saw this I would just laugh at them. See you all tomorrow and welcome back u/Neawia!

He did.
>> ARTICLE
Wow.

A blast of a episode. Where do I start? Kira the second shows up and not only messes with the game board, she changes the entire game.

The whole broadcast section was fantastic and very realistic up to a point. A bit of a strange police response but I like it. L's knowledge of Kira's powers have been upturned but he soon figures its not the original kira. Her actions are far too different and almost totally agents Light's vision, she is almost child like with the powers.

L though he doesn't show his feelings he is very angry at the whole affair. Not only are the needles deaths but he looses one of his team.

The little stunt seem to have done one good thing for L, they now have a better place in media consensus. 

I could go on about all the little parts of this episode for ages but I will leave it here. Bloody fantastic episode!
>> ARTICLE
I would say this is a real turning point in the series if you love the idea of another Kira you will absolutely love the series going forward. But if not it might dampen your opinion on the rest of the series. Personally i think/thought it was an amazing addition when i first watched and even now i am still hyped to see how everything will unfold. 


Also welcome back /u/Neawia
>> ARTICLE
Well, thanks. Good to be back. Nice to see everything went smoothly while I was gone. Now I'm off to watch an episode or two!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I really remembered the events of this episode wrong. I had completely forgotten that it was actually the Chief who drives into the building with the bus, and I thought I remembered that happening nearer to the end of the episode, and I also forgot the part about the whole police force using lights and riot shields to protect Chief Yagami. That was a great moment, with even the reporter standing up to Kira by announcing his name and saying that opposing him was the right thing to do. 

Having L and the task force being put up against a wall is just as thrilling as the episodes when someone gets the upperhand on Light in the game of wits; except I like it for them because I enjoy watching them fight hard and overcome difficulties where I liked it when it happens to Light just because I like seeing him have problems. It is now a three way game! Between Misa, L, and Kira! Who will win? Find out next time! 

Oh yeah, and that mid-episode text was intriguing, it said even the Shinigami don't know much about how the Death Notes work. Odd, I wonder who DOES know everything about them. 
>> ARTICLE
> Odd, I wonder who DOES know everything about them.

Light, what the fuck are you doing? Killing innocent people. For the greater good maybe. Interesting. Hes trying to get the people on his side. Telling them he wants to make a better world, that he doesnt want to kill innocent people. Still, hes basically holding all innocents hostage in a sense by demanding that no one investigate him. Bold strategy, Cotton.

Is Light watching? Did he see who left the building and wrote his name in the book?

[Such a badass shot.](http://i.imgur.com/AEh4dFc.png)

Badass, Chief. Holy fuck! He pulled a gun on the producer! What a badass. A little crazy, maybe, but badass.

How does Light have the names of random police officers and is capable of recognizing them so quickly?

L's phone switches, haha. So stupid. So awesome.

Oh, lord. Is Light going to have to kill his father to retain the appearance of innocence.

Wow. Nope. What a response from the police. This is a big moment against Kira. Yet we will have to wait to see how many people will end up rallying with Kira.

WAIT! Wait. Oh, man. This wasnt Light. Holy shit. They got me. I got got. Is the new Kira [actual spoilers sort of](/s "going to be the girl that hasnt shown up yet? Misa Amane I think. Ive seen her name before.")

Sweet. So L wants to use Light (aka Kira) to find the other Kira. I love it. His dads really committed to the job too because hes probably not going to tell Light that they suspect a second Kira. Just withholding info from his own son.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

> actual spoilers sort of

It is her! I'll be honest. I was not expecting her to be the one with another Death Note. I thought that maybe she'd find out who Light really is, but admire him and fall in love.

Misa could still fall in love with Light. She said she believes in what Kira is doing. She made the tapes so Kira would notice her. She wants to meet him. I'll take a guess and say that if this show was going to have a love interest, it's going to be her.

She's definitely going to be a fun addition though. She has the Shinigami eyes. She clearly has an edge on Light because of that. I don't remember for sure, but I don't think you learn how long your life is when you take that deal, do you? Perhaps you could look at yourself in the mirror or something? So I wonder how long she has left to live.

I'm also curious as to what will happen if Light and Misa are in close proximity to each other. Will their Shinigami be able to see each other? Then they could tell their human, 'hey, that person there has a Shinigami'. Misa's Shinigami also seemed much friendlier with her than Ryuk seems to be with Light. She even said she *gave* Misa the Death Note. So why would she do that? Why specifically choose her?

Ugh. So good. Much to learn still. I still get to binge a couple more episodes in order to catch up.

Today L makes his awesome first appearance so to celebrate let's talk about the characterization of the master detective:

This archetype is not new,the genius,eccentric, doing it for art **private detective** with occasional substances abuse and social issues was first popularised with Sir Conan Doyle's [*The adventures of sherlock holmes*](http://www.readsherlock.com/adventures.php). His work inspired the anime homage Detective Conan and afterwards Deathnote took the western audience by storm. My other favourite L archetypes include :Batman, Oreki Houtarou of [Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka), Usami Haru of [Devil of the G-string](http://store.steampowered.com/app/377670/), ^(and some say lelouch)

What makes Deathnote so popular are the battles between **L and Light**. These two people are essentially two sides of the same coin, they share a very strong sense of justice,  arrogant when winning, and are batshit genius insane.Light yesterday finds a book, revels in killing and becomes god; L today wins his very first skirmish, and he revels in winning , taunts Light, and even offers god some friendly advice. Whichever side you choose to ultimately support, spoilers : **I am justice** totally wins.
>> ARTICLE
I've never thought Light has a strong sense of justice or was a "the ends justifies the means" character specifically because of what happens in this episode.

If he truly were doing what he's doing for the sake of justice, he wouldn't have been goaded by L into killing who he thought was L. He literally tries to KILL someone over some petty insult.

He's a narcissist going on a power-trip and I'll never see Light as anything else.

>> ARTICLE
Wow, this episode was really good! That fakeout from L was great, being able to pinpoint an area and pretty much working out that he needs a name or face to do it.
Another thing I can see being picked up on is the time that all the killings happen at because they kind of made a point of it(just speculation though).

Light took the step in killing L, who would've been a complete innocent, very easily. Before that I thought he might just have a warped sense of justice but
he definitely crossed a line in doing that. I'm wondering what his next step will be, I could see him overcompensating to prove a point, if anything ever does
get him caught I really do feel it will be his overconfidence/delusions of grandeur. That being said I don't have a clue how L could ever catch him no matter
how smart he is.

Those final lines were great too:

L

Kira

I will hunt you down wherever youre hiding and I will eliminate you.

I am-

I am-

Justice!


If I wasn't following the rewatch I would've gone straight to episode 3, I can see why people said episode 2 is what got them hooked on the show.



>> ARTICLE
> That being said I don't have a clue how L could ever catch him no matter how smart he is.

Me either. Light's literally just writing names in a book. There's no evidence that he was the one killing people. Sure L narrowed it down to one region in Japan and the killer needing a name/face to kill. That's not really that much to go off of. Looking forward though to seeing how L goes about his investigation.


>> ARTICLE
That is the best part about Death Note that makes it my favorite anime. It's such a simple premise - like you said, Light is literally just writing names on paper. How is it possible for L to catch him? How does one even investigate something like this? It's great.

[Still eating apples too.](http://gfycat.com/AffectionateWideBarebirdbat)

Lights younger sister, I presume. Sayu. [Awww, shes really cute. Honestly adorable.](http://i.imgur.com/NkrYlcr.png) *I really fucking hope nothing happens to her.*

[Another wonderful up close shot of Light's face.](http://i.imgur.com/iFxG1qo.png)

Theyre already investigating. Im assuming the heart attacks didnt all happen at the *same* exact time, but ~40 seconds or so apart, give ~5 seconds to write each name. So 100 deaths at 45 seconds each so everyone died over the course of an hour and fifteen minutes. Also assuming that Light made a separate list and copied them one after the other into the Death Note instead of writing them in the Death Note as soon as he settled on the next name. The latter would take even more time.

Oh jeez... L is some mysterious guy who they dont even know who he is, and yet he solves all his cases? How? How do you not know the guy? He hides in the shadows. Really? [Mfw.](http://i.imgur.com/H5Mr8x1.png)

Its good to see Light being so careful already. Hes certainly not an idiot, but we already knew that, I guess. Love this elaborate setup he has though to keep the DN hidden. I though he hid it inside the diary. Too simple. Then I thought the false door would be enough. Nope. Can't forget the fire. This Death Note is rigged to explode!

This whole spell is just rather true. People giving the politically correct answer, hiding their true selves in public, but showing their colors when they have anonymity.

Except that one guy. He showed his face in that video. The one where he shoved his head in a dirty toilet. Who was that guy anyway? What a crazy person he must be.

*Thats* L. Thats not L. He decides to show himself now, on a case that *should* be incredibly difficult to solve? He's not risking it.

I wonder if L has met a Shinigami.

Ok, real name, but wrong guy. Now, how the hell did L pinpoint the killer to Japan. Ok well now I feel like an idiot because the first guy who died of a heart attack was in Japan.

I love that Ryuk is just laughing at all of this.

[Familiar pose kind of.](http://i.imgur.com/NiqyhUH.png) Leleouch-esque indeed. ^sort ^of... ^^it's ^^not ^^that ^^^far ^^^a ^^^stretch... ^^^^is ^^^^it?

Things are moving along quickly. Light vs L. Im not the only one who thinks they couldve picked a better letter for L, am I? Too similar to Light. Perhaps theres a reason his name (nickname) is L....

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

... HOLY SHIT. L is **L**ight from the future and he's come back in time to make sure his past self learns the skills that he learned during this whole ordeal. Light said that if found he would just tell people the names in the book are criminals because he wants to become a detective one day. What's L's profession? DETECTIVE!

A good second episode. Theyre not wasting any time. Someone is already investigating Light. I think his first fuck up was killing too many people right away. He shouldve been patient. Apparently a lot of those criminals were going to be executed anyway. Why arouse suspicion if they were just going to die so soon? Light should slow down and kill people in more natural ways, sort of like how hes killing the minor offenders over time by means of disease or accidents.

Listen to me giving a fictional character my thoughts on how to murder people with a notebook. Sheesh.

If Light does slow down and think things through, I wonder if hell resort to killing innocent people along with the criminals to mask his presence. If just the criminals are dying, its suspicious, but if everyone is dying, well, a ton of people already die every day so

Realistically he should stop using the Death Note for a little while. When he starts up again, he should target another country. He can still use the internet to find information and faces for people. Then he can expand to other countries as well, eventually making his way back to Japan. This way there will be -

Here I go again. I'll stop now.

Predictions? Eh. I have to think that someone else currently alive has met a Shinigami. Maybe they have a Death Note or maybe they have some other godly device. Maybe its L, but I dont think so.

I dont think weve seen Light physically touch Ryuk yet, unless it just passed me by. I wonder if the two can touch because perhaps that means Ryuk can kill the humans he can speak with. Or maybe he can just kill them anyway, regardless if he can speak with them. Either way, I think that Ryuk will eventually become friendlier towards Light. Right now hes just messing with him and laughing at him, but if they grow closer because of their similarities, maybe Ryuk will help him out and kill someone for him in a time of need. After all, Light is interesting and fun to him. Can't lose his entertainment.

Maybe Light will be tied up, but coerce L to touch the Death Note. Then Ryuk would be able to kill L and save Light. Something like that, I dont know.

See that bit of black hair next to him? Do you think that could be L's mom?


>> ARTICLE
One day, rascorpia. One day. You'll get yours. And I'll wait patiently until that time. Until then...

We can obviously deduce that the black hair belongs to Ryuk. Now, we could speculate that Ryuk is L's mother. Perhaps L's mom used a Death Note at one point in her life. It may have caused her family great pain. When L found out, it was too late. His mother was cursed with being a Shinigami because of all the death she brought to the world. The transformation wasn't a pleasant one. She looked nothing like herself, nor did she remember her past life.

L retained his memories. Pissed off at the Death Note and the Shinigami realm, he swore his revenge. That's why he became a detective. He would track down killers in hopes of eventually finding someone who could have access to the Death Note. Lucky for him, he thinks he's finally found it. And he's right, he has found it. But little does L know that Ryuk (his mother) is hanging around the person he's getting vengeance upon.

What a confrontation that will be when L finally meets his mother again.

> So 100 deaths at 45 seconds each so everyone died over the course of an hour and fifteen minutes

Actually, if he did nothing but write name after name, they all likely would have died at almost the exact same time, or at the very least each death would only be a few seconds after the last one. The Death Note doesn't have to reset every time you write a new name. If you were to write two people's names in quick succession, then in 40 seconds they would both die at almost the exact same time, rather than the first person dies in 40 seconds, then the second person dies in another 40.

> He hides in the shadows. Really?

He may not be Chinese or Electric, but he's definitely anime Batman.

> Its good to see L being so careful already.

Think you mean Light. It really doesn't help that both their names start with the same letter.

Sounds like a guy with good taste.

Nope.

But that was his intention. He *wanted* to be noticed. He could have taken his time, but he's too arrogant. He wants people to know who he is.

> I wonder if the two can touch because perhaps that means Ryuk can kill the humans he can speak with. Or maybe he can just kill them anyway, regardless if he can speak with them.

Actually, [DN: How to Read](/n "Shinigami are specifically forbidden from killing humans through any means other than their Death Notes. Doing so results in a level of punishment so severe that in a level system of 8 to 1 it's in its own category: "Extreme."")
>> ARTICLE
> The Death Note doesn't have to reset every time you write a new name.

Oh, that's interesting. Ok, so then they did all die relatively close to one another. Within a few minutes, actually. Rookie mistake by Light, even if he doesn't know the timer doesn't reset.

> Think you mean Light. It really doesn't help that both their names start with the same letter.

Damnit, yes on both accounts.

I just want to say that Death Note has a great OST and I remember loving it when I first watched this anime.
>> ARTICLE
Light has a nice plan to protect himself but his small time plan pails to the one L puts in motion. This is what hooked me the first time around. L's intro and his victory against Light. 

We see more of Lights personality he is smart and good at planing but easily goaded. We see little of L but can infer much, he is through but is willing to take a chance (a educated one at least). The are things that can be and most likely have been said about the duality of Light and L (hint: its the point) but here we see L well on top.

1 nil to L
>> ARTICLE
I think it makes perfect sense that L came out on top here. We were told that he's been solving the most impossible cases for quite some time so he's clearly experienced in this sort of situation. Light on the the other hand, only recently acquired the Death Note. While he may have previously thought about doing this sort of thing, actually putting the plan in action might prove to be more difficult than he thought.

>> ARTICLE
Psychological warfare. He wants Kira to slip up, and he wants Kira to change his tactics so he can see the full range of his capabilities. Informing the public is useful as well, since it takes a bit of the magic out of Kira if he can be narrowed down publically like that.

It happens in real life, too. A silent investigation has its benefits, but the rats won't scurry if you don't make noise or leave out a bit of bait.

Wow just noticed that the English teacher has a very German accent in the Ger dub, well don't know if that's fitting or not.

Again what terrible discipline in this classroom, atleast the teacher is not so stupid to ask anyone else than Light to translate because otherwise he would only get akward silence, like everytime a teacher calls up a student who clearly doesn't know the answer.

Man poor Ryuk, leaves the boring world of the Shinigamis only to be stuck and bored in school

Light isn't a very social guy. Atleast if it doesn't profit him in any way.

[Man Light can switch back to his innocent self very fast](http://i.imgur.com/6yrt63l.png)

Ryuk hid the fact that anyone touching the Death Note can see him purposefully just to tease Light a bit.

Ah that Interpol meeting, love how they all disagreeing with each other, like a big discussion on the internet.

Fuck yes it's time for the real star of this story, we finally meet L.

> I want to protect my family.

Yeah Light sure, you don't want to save your own ass

What he builds is quite impressive, still I don't think everyone would "understand" that you risk to burn down your home just to protect your diary.

Yes people of earth feed his ego more.

And now we see why his arrogance his is biggest weakness, he both underestimated L and he easily took that obvious bait.

[ALSO STOP WASTING PAPER LIGHT](http://i.imgur.com/CWMpiza.png), you probably don't know that but still there are (probably) almost no trees left in the Shinigami world, so Death Note paper is very expensive. You want to make the world a better place, maybe you should start by respecting nature, you self-righteous prick.

Well L played you like a damn fiddle, Kira. Damn this is so satisfying to see Kira getting owned. Ryuks reaction is exactly the same as mine.


Now the series really has started, and I'm pumped. One of the greatest cat and mouse games just started and you will never know who is the cat and who is the mouse.

Revealed rules of the Death Note:


1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.
9. **The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.**

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. We know Light's stand on the subject, but I want to ask you the question. Do you think that some people deserve the death penalty? If yes, where do you draw the line for when they deserve it?

2. Light's sister Sayu sucks at math. What was your worst class in school?

3. Do you own or have you ever owned a diary?

(No need to answer if the questions are too personal for you)


----

>What was your first reaction to L's introduction? Did you like him more than Light at the time or were you rooting for Light to triumph over him?

I'm in camp L, it was just to sweet to see Light getting owned like that. Also Light is just not a very likeable character, he is an enjoyable villain but not someone I root for.

>Did anyone download and play Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow on their 3DS? If so, which version and why?

Don't have a 3DS but I have two ways of answering that:

If I go into buying one of them with the intention of maybe buying Sun/Moon, and using the still kept in glitches in combination with the PokeBank later, I would take Red because it has the cooler game exclusive mons, for me. Otherwise I would take yellow because Pikachu is awesome and it follows me around being all cute.

Wait. Didn't Mustang win the last contest or something. Shouldn't winners be banned from entering again? At least for the next year if nothing else.

An interesting comment. If L is able to interview people at Light's school, the students might say something like, "Yeah, Light? He just comes to school and spends the rest of his time at home." Well, what's he doing at home all night. Suspicious.

> Yes people of earth feed his ego more.

I'm kind of surprised it happened so fast. Everyone was that willing to believe some omnipotent power killed what, a few hundred people max?

> We know Light's stand on the subject, but I want to ask you the question. Do you think that some people deserve the death penalty? If yes, where do you draw the line for when they deserve it?

Loaded question. Love it. Some people do deserve it. Of course, where do you draw the line? There are some people who you could label as 'defective.' Mass murderers who feel no emotion towards their victims and do it for fun. Mentally, there's really no coming back from that. You can't fix people like that.

Then there's the problem of executing them. While beheading or putting them to a firing squad is cheap and effective, it's incredibly inhumane. Apparently using drugs is more expensive than letting these criminals live out their lives in prison though. So if it's that much of a moral dilemma, why bother? Just leave them be, and keep them out of society.

This is definitely a dark subject that's difficult to discuss. Even with anonymity on the internet, we all have our usernames associated with us, and delving too deep into this can be harmful to our online reputations. Good question though.

> Light's sister Sayu sucks at math. What was your worst class in school?

Also math, technically. I was always in the honors/advance placement classes for math. I would get A's and B's in the normal course for my grade level, which was great. Best subject. But then in the honors/AP classes I'd get C's and D's, so not great. Idiot. Worst subject.

> Do you own or have you ever owned a diary?

No and never. Always loved the idea though. However, it was always viewed as girly. So a young boy would never be caught with a diary.

> Also Light is just not a very likeable character

I'm just the psycho sitting here loving every minute of Light.

A high school student being in his room all day after school is suspicious to you? Well you are a paranoid person then...


> Mass murderers who feel no emotion towards their victims and do it for fun. Mentally, there's really no coming back from that. You can't fix people like that.

Yeah while I agree that there is probably no fix for people like that I just can't wrap my head around the idea that killing them would be the **right** choice, We just can't show people that killing is wrong by killing. For some reason I just never can fully justify it no matter how bad the person is.

>I'm just the psycho sitting here loving every minute of Light.

No I also enjoy Light he is a pretty great evil villain and I enjoy every minute of him being all evil. First time watching I couldn't even decide if I wanted Light or L to win, because seeing Light win could just be so interesting, but after some rewatches I just can't root for Light anymore because he represents the total opposite of my moral compass.

For some reason I just never can fully justify it no matter how bad the person is.

Devil's advocate: Well, it surely isn't the same form of killing. One contains murderous intent. It's malicious and messy and emotionless. They kill innocent people for fun. Executing that person isn't the same. Yes, it includes death, but it's usually done in a humane manner. It doesn't need to be a spectacle or be used as an example. It's simply assuring the world is a slightly brighter place.

Good lord there are different contests for different users. Get your shit together, /r/anime. So everyone's gonna be salty if Mustang wins twice in a row even if they are 'different' contests? Sounds like fun. Then again, everyone seems to looooove Mustang so maybe not.

And ShaKing's posting them now anyway so...

I would never root for someone like that in real life. Who would? But in a tv show/anime. Fuck yes. He's great, and I can't wait to see how far he can actually take his plans.

Speculation-ish time; If he can fully succeed, maybe he'll become a Shinigami himself because of the large number of people he killed.

I'm awake bright and early as always, damn you Call of Duty and your double xp weekends. Anyways let's watch Light's super happy fun time with heart attacks part 2.

- Even though he's a God of death and all Ryuk is so difficult to dislike, he's just in it for the apples and the lulz.

- Oh god... [Major Spoilers] (/s "I forgot Matsuda even existed can't wait to see all the WTF reactions when he ends up killing a certain angsty high schooler.")

- Honestly as insane as Light acts sometimes he really is a genius. That whole set up with the drawer and setting the Death Note up to burn if someone breaks it open is really smart.

- And so Kira was born. This certainly won't go to Light's head. Seriously he looks like he's got a woody while he's telling Ryuk about the website.

- "Someone's making the bad guys disappear one by one." Because everyone knows the right way to deal with criminals is by killing them all! 

- "YOU THINK IM EVIL MOTHERFUCKER?! YOU GONNA OPPOSE THIS GOD?! 1 V 1 ME RUST M8!" Killing someone just for calling you evil. #justlightthings

- "His execution was set for today, that wasn't me." get rekt Light

- Ryuk is just having a blast over here watching all this suffering. We have so much in common.

- All jokes aside L is really outwitting Light right now, I mean seriously pinning it down to Japan and figuring all of this out about "Kira" in the first episode he's introduced is pretty intimidating.

- "I accept your challenge L" Last kill 360 or it doesn't count scrub.

- "I am Justice!" I'm sorry Light, but you seriously JUST killed a dude for doing nothing at all except for calling you evil bud.

Well this was a good episode and introduces us to L. All I can really say is that I love the back and forth between Light and L while they try to outsmart each other. See you all tomorrow! Sorry I went overboard with the COD references, I've been told I'm a faggot too many times in the last 24 hours it's getting to me.

A decently fast pace so far. Can't wait to see if the show keeps it up.

> Last kill 360 or it doesn't count scrub.

This hadn't happened to me in years, and then it did the other day. He failed though, and I shot him, but I couldn't believe people still do that.

> I've been told I'm a faggot too many times in the last 24 hours it's getting to me.

Yeah, well you are a... really nice person, -METHOD_MAN-. Glad to have you around for the rewatch.

[Spoilers](/s "But Matsuda shooting Light isn't what killed him. Ryuk writing his name in the Death Note was. Ryuk could clearly tell that Light still had a lot of time left on him, and now that was undeniably Kira he was gonna be spending all that time locked up in prison, which would be really boring. So he just wrote his name down, and saved everyone a lot of time.")
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion looking back on this series this moment is the single biggest mistake Light makes. By taking the bait and killing that guy at that moment he gives L so much information.
>> ARTICLE
Wow Sayu is shorter than I remember.

Aww shit it's Masuda. One of my favorite characters here.

What was Light doing in the old building though? It's a little unclear what he does with those chemicals.

I had forgotten where the word Kira came from. It's literally engrish.

And there's the first Keikaku Doori.

I like how L actually stutters here. Even he can't fathom how Light could kill someone without direct contact. He then goes on to learn a lot about Kira, easily narrowing down where Light is based simply on where he had the broadcast shown. He's good.

That's pretty extreme just to hide a notebook. Setting up a system that has the potential to set your desk aflame.

**Discussion topics:** I'm kinda rooting for both of them. They both make for very interesting protagonists.(Can I call them both protagonists? Or would L be called the antagonist?)

I plan on getting Pokemon Blue for my 3DS and I'm gonna try to get my hands on the Special Charizard 2DS that has Pokemon Red preinstalled on it. I already own an original Yellow cartridge.
>> ARTICLE
> What was Light doing in the old building though? It's a little unclear what he does with those chemicals.

I was kind of confused at first, but I guess he was making the trap for the Death Note. Maybe he didn't want to be at home if he messed up so his house wouldn't set on fire.

> Discussion topics:

Hey! Thanks for answering! I suppose Light and L could both be protagonists. Perhaps both antagonists depending on who you're rooting for. And those special 2DS's look great. Wish I could just buy them all, but I don't really have a reason for 3 of them.
>> ARTICLE
> I was kind of confused at first, but I guess he was making the trap for the Death Note. Maybe he didn't want to be at home if he messed up so his house wouldn't set on fire.

Makes sense. No need to burn his house down just testing it.

Yeah the only reason I'm buying more than one is since I've only ever owned Yellow.

L is too smart right now. Light has definitely gotta get better at keeping his cool. Let the games begin.

On a side note: the episode name does not appear on the slide before the episode begins on the blu rays. IIRC the DVDs showed the episode titles
>> ARTICLE
So we haven't seen *too much* of him yet as we're only on the 2nd episode, but Ryuk is easily my favorite character in the show. I'm interested what people who haven't watched the show before think of him so far and I'm interested to see people react to him throughout the show
>> ARTICLE
First time watching, I love him. He's hilarious. He has a scary design and is a god of death yet he's just kind of hanging around. Just mooching off of Light, eating all his apples and laughing in his face. He's great.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah he just gives no shit, he is a spectator like us and he just enjoys the ride.
>> ARTICLE
That sudden decision to write L's name in the Death Note seemed rather out of character, although I guess you need those kind of things to happen occasionally to fuel a plot. Light didn't strike me as a character who would make emotionally charged decisions.
>> ARTICLE
He would like to think he's above his emotions.  His actions tell otherwise.

Just goes to show how pissed Light was. Someone was standing in his way and acting superior. You can't act like you're better than a soon to be god and get away with it, after all.

Late by a day but why not ill re-watch this it's been a few years since last time.

This might be weird, but this is easily one of my favorite episode of the series. The last ~5 minutes are amazing. The back-and-forth between Light and L leading up to the "I am justice!" is cheesy in the best possible way
>> ARTICLE
Now wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute.

L's tactic of broadcasting in certain areas was clever and all but . . .

What would have happened if Light wasn't watching TV, or, hypothetically, didn't even own a TV?

L would have gotten no where, as he would have had to search the whole world for "Kira"
>> ARTICLE
Good point. Maybe L should've advertised his speech more. Made it like an event. Sunday at 6pm, L stands up to Kira! At least then Light would've been intrigued enough to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
The biggest flaw in his plan is that the plan is only effective in the first let's say, hour or two, of broadcasting. After that, it would be all over the internet and the fact that it was being broadcasted by prefect/region instead of globally would become more apparent. 
>> ARTICLE
Kira clearly watches TV, he deduced that Kira only kills people who are in the news, or that Kira gets his victims from the news. It was still a risk but still very possible that Kira will see it.

Uhhhhh well I was hype as fuck the first time I watched this episode and saw L, and I had no clue Pokemon Red/Blue were available on 3ds thanks brah I haven't gotten it out in months

Yeah, I think my hype is just about ready to go off. This episode was exciting since it sets up what the rest of the anime will be about, but I'm waiting for some stuff to unfold before really letting the hype fly.

Intro to one of the more famous anime rivalries in the past ten years! 

I know L loves the challenge that Kira presents, but wouldn't it have been a lot smarter to not announce himself to Light like that and instead allow him to think that he did eliminate the guy who was on his trail?
>> ARTICLE
The reason he announced himself was so that it would put psychological pressure on Light to act rashly, just as he did, making him open to mistakes, like the one he committed.
>> ARTICLE
That's a completely different announcement, killing the fake was the mistake L needed Light to make and it was already done before L started poking him further. Stop spamming my account already, you failure of a troll. 

I am really tired of that guy spamming me.

The mistake? That was the only chance that L had to talk DIRECTLY to Kira. How is it not smart to use that opportunity as much as possible? Obviously you lack any formal detective training.

So its not Rem using the Death Note, its someone else. So who is it? A random person perhaps? Striking a deal? So maybe some shady businessman

Ugh, theyve been in there for way too long. And wow. Misa. Shes been tied up like that for nearly two months. Poor Misa.

[Mr. Yagami has great reactions.](http://gfycat.com/WholeJitteryHamadryad) Basically all of your faces when you can't believe /r/anime would vote your best guy/girl out of their respective contest even though you knew it would happen from the start.

I wonder what L is planning here.

Misas still looking pretty good for being tied up that long.

WHAT THE FUCK? Execution? No. No. I dont believe it. Its a bluff.

MISA! What kind of a father are you anyway? This is your own son youre talking about! My girl.

LIGHT! You trust L more than you trust me, your own son? My man.

L will kill himself if Light and Misa arent Kira. This is so batshit crazy. I dont believe any of this.

Kill Light and Misa, then himself. This is fucking insane. I dont believe this at all. Is anyone actually buying this?

No! Wtf?!?! Take that gun out of Lights face!

[Chief up close.](http://i.imgur.com/ntTLi3d.png)

GUNSHOT WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!!!!!!

What is happening? What was up with Mr. Yagami's eyes and the crow? Is he

Right. Bluff. This was fucked up. L tortured Misa and kept her tied up for two months, he kept Light (and inadvertently forced) Mr. Yagami in isolation, and now this shit.

[Light and L up close.](http://i.imgur.com/19Z28ie.png)

Damn that was intense though. My hearts still racing.

Ls a pervert, Misa. You said so yourself. Hes on *every* side of the fence.

But yes, I suppose I would be watching. Yep. Pervert.

[Misa Amane pout.](http://i.imgur.com/zKyJG5u.png)

Misa really does talk too much. Shes giving away info about when she met Light, that she fell in love with a stranger at first sight, that shed love Light more if he were Kira.

What?!? L built that massive skyscraper all for himself?!?! DAMN.

How could you miss Matsuda?!?! Aizawa, you dick.

So it was a businessman, huh? These guys come in every week to pick one of themselves to die. I guess theyre planning that if the one who is Kira is chosen, he wont kill himself, and then theyll know who Kira is and can go from there. Whether they would bother going to the police or not is unknown, but I bet they wouldnt. Especially after Rems comment about humans.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

First off, another amazing episode. Im really impressed with how many of them are so engaging from start to finish.

I have some respect for Mr. Yagami for doing what he did, but at the same time, this is the kind of shit that you don't live down. This was a horrible thing to do even though it had to be done.

There was also the brief flash of Mr. Yagami's eyes and that crow. I'm taking that as more symbolism than reality. I thought, "Oh what a twist if Mr. Yagami had connections to a Shinigami", but it was probably shown just to illustrate that he's been forced to do something awful. He's in the same evil vein as his son, so to speak.

Didnt really have time to go through old stuff, so Ill bring new stuff.

Both Misa and Light have no recollection of their time as Kira. This is going to work to their benefit because Light can now fully devote himself to the task force. He told Rem to give the Death Note to a high level businessman. So now that businessman is Kira. Light will work with L to hunt down the businessman Kira. Once hes captured, Light and Misa will be cleared and theyll be able to meet back up with Rem and Ryuk and continue their plan.

However, L is involved so he will still think that Light is Kira and possibly continue the investigation on his own after the official one is wrapped up.

Should I answer my own discussion topics for once?

> Did your perception of L change after watching this episode for the first time?

It did. It has already been changing a bit over the past few episodes, but it seems like hes going to more extremes in order to catch Kira. Its obviously the toughest case hes worked on, but I honestly did not think L was going to be one to pull stunts like these.

I got that they all worked for the same company. So what you're saying is, they are all aware that one of them is Kira. They're using that fact to chose a higher up from other companies to kill. However, none of them know which one of themselves is actually Kira. So it's an anonymous killing.

No, not themselves. They're picking higher-ups of other corporations to die, so that they get wealthier as a group. None of them are interested in exposing which one of them's Kira since it would mean trouble for them, financially, legally, and possibly lethally.

Literally 11 seconds before I did, in fact.

That seems kind of dumb if it were true. If all of his coworkers but him died, even through means other than heart attacks, that would look pretty suspicious.

Yeah, that would be dumb, but I figured that this new guy was just an idiot who made a deal with Rem. Having someone else continue to be 'Kira' was merely a distraction so Light would be off the hook. I didn't realize that Light likely planned this out himself and likely has something up his sleeve.

> Have you watched that TTGL Regular Show episode yet?

Haha, I did. A while back actually. It was pretty awesome, though I could probably stand to rewatch it as I might get a few more of the references now having watched a number of other shows.

Come on, Rem isn't Ryuk. She doesn't just drop her Death Notes willy-nilly.

So much Gundam.
>> ARTICLE
> Come on, Rem isn't Ryuk. She doesn't just drop her Death Notes willy-nilly.

I know. I still figured Light was like, "Go give the Death Note to some idiot who will slowly make it obvious who Kira is." Not that that would be any better since it would be painfully obvious this new Kira isn't acting like the old one. And that's basically happening anyway, to an extent. Sure he's still killing criminals, but also CEOs or whatever of major companies. That'll be odd and suspicious to L.

> So much Gundam.

Yeah. I haven't even watched Gundam. Probably some Gunbuster/Diebuster stuff though.

Speaking of which, I can't blame you for not watching those, but I bet you never watched Little Witch Academia. Whatever, it's not like I care or anything.

Wow something I didn't do for a long time:


Higuchi(Bernd Vollbrecht): German voice of Antonio Banderas, and Christoph Eccleston, he also voiced Samuel Sullivan in the series "Heroes".


L must be really pissed that everything is working against him in the moment, everyone is doubting that Light is Kira. He will lose the support of the task force if he continues like that.


>Souichiro: Please. Just keep quiet.

Well in the Eng dub he's relatively polite but in the German dub he says:

>Halten sie ihre Klappe!

translation: "Shut your mouth!" And that's much ruder than what the English dub said.

But still he used the polite personal pronoun "sie" here. 

Little digression into German personal pronouns:

German| English
---|----
Ich | I
Du  | You 
Er Sie Es| he she it
Wir | We
Ihr | You
Sie | They

As you can see wie have the same word for 3rd person singular female and 3rd person plural "Sie", but in German the word "Sie" can also be used as a polite 2nd person singular.

Example:

Phrase you would say to a friend:  
"Du siehst aber heute frhlich aus." translated: "You look happy today"

Phrase you would say to your boss (same meaning):

"Sie sehen aber heute frhlich aus."

End of the digression.

What I want to say is that it is a bit strange to use a rude phrase like "Halten sie ihre Klappe!" because in my opinion "Halt die Klappe!" or more colloquial "Maul halten!" would sound more natural. If Chief Yagami would like to sound more polite and not rude he should've said "Bitte, seien sie still." that would also be the translation of what he said in the Eng Dub.


I think that Misa looks better with her hair down.

And the best dad of the year award goes toooooo...

Probably not Souichiro Yagami, but we could consider to give him best actor. He played his part very well.

The problem with that plan of L is that he assumes that Kira kills with his thoughts and not with an object or weapon, so even if both or one of them would be Kira they still couldn't do shit there without the murder weapon. I believe that this whole thing didn't prove anything, it was just there to entertain us.

>L: I'm not telling you to do anything, but yes, I suppose I'll be watching.
MISA: That's so gross. You really are a pervert, aren't you?

Well the further we get into the story the more it's revealed that yes L is a pervert and voyeur.


The site where I look up the transcripts for quoting just changed Matsuda to Matsui, very funny.

> Ryuzaki, as much as I wanna help you,and as important as the Kira case is to me, I can't manipulate woman's feelings like that.  
Please try to understand.  
To me, exploiting another person's feelings for a personal gain is unforgivable.
And I won't allow myself to stoop that low.


That clearly proves to me that Kira and Light are different persons AND that the Death Note made Light evil.

>Matsui: Excuse me, I can't help but notice you missed my name.

Poor Matsuda. [Death Note](/s "But his time will come, he's the only character with a episode title named after him")


>Despite the fact we are all relatively young, all of us are now front runners to become Yotsuba's next CEO.

My god they started to talk in exposition again. Fast get better writers.




Rules for humans:

1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.
9. The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.
10. The person in possession of the Death Note is possessed by a god of death, its original owner, until they die.
11. If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.
12. The cause of death must still be in realm of possibility for the victim.
13. You may also write the cause and/or details of death prior to filling in the name of the individual. Be sure to insert the name in front of the written cause of death. You have about 19 days (according to the human calendar) in order to fill in a name.
14. If a human uses the note, a god of death usually appears in front of him/her within 39 days after he/she uses the note.
15. A person can shorten his or her onw life by using the note.
16. One page taken from the Death Note or even  a fragment of the page contains the full effects of the note.
17. The instrument to write with can be anything, (e.g cosmetics, blood, etc.) as long as it can write directly onto the note and remains as legible letters.
18. Even if you do not actually possess the Death Note, the effect will be the same if you can recognize the person and his/her name to place in  the blank.
19. The owner of a Death Note with Shinigami eyes can't see the remaining life time of another Shinigami owner
20. The Death Note will not affect those under 780 days old.
21. The Death Note will be rendered useless if the victim's name is misspelled four times
22. Whether the cause of the individual's death is either a suicide or accident, if the death leads to the death of more than the intended, the person will simply die of a heart attack. This is to ensure that other lives are not influenced.
23. Even after the individual's name, the time of death, and death condition on the Death Note were filled out, the time and condition of death can be altered as many times as you want as lon as it is changed within 6 minutes and 40 second from the time it was filled in. But of course, this is only possible before the victim dies.
24. Whenever you want to change anything written on the Death Note within 6 minutes and 40 seconds after you wrote, you must first rule out the characters you want to erase with two straight lines.
25. The time and condition of death can be changed but once the victim's name has been written the individual's death can never be avoided.
26. If you lose the Death Note or have it stolen you will lose its ownership unless you retrieve it within 490 days.
27. **If you have traded the eye power of a god of death, you will lose the eye power as well as the memory of the Death Note, once you lose its ownership. At the same time, the remaining half of your life will not be restored.** 
28. **You may lend the Death Note to another person while maintaining its ownership. Subletting it to yet another person is possible, too.**

Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1. The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.
2. Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.
3. Gods of Death, the original owners of the Death Note, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note.
4. A god of death cannot be killed even if stabbed in his heart with a knife or shot in the head with a gun. However, there are ways to kill a god of death which are not generally known to the gods of death
5. The specific scope of the condition for death is not known to the gods of death, either so, you must examine and find out.

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. What are your *two* least favourite characters at the moment?

2. Do you like the new or should I say old Light? Or do you wish Kira to be back?

3. Who is the best dad in anime?

---

/u/Neawia's questions:

>Did your perception of L change after watching this episode for the first time?

Don't know why it should, he is still right with everything but because this case has so much to do with supernatural things happening he can't use normal deduction and investigation like in normal cases, he needs to do all that what he did do come even close to Kira, he is just at a big disadvantage here. So I think it's very impressive how close he came to solving this case.


>It's raining today where I live. What is your favorite type of weather? Any particular reason you like it?

mild but sunny weather. Not too hot to make sweat out all my body fluids but warm enough to wear a T-shirt.
>> ARTICLE
> 1\. What are your two least favourite characters at the moment?

1. Misa

2. Death Note Misa

> 2\. Do you like the new or should I say old Light? Or do you wish Kira to be back?

I kinda wish there was an alternate timeline of sorts. I would love to see more of the new Light who seems like an equally intelligent counter-character to L. That being said, I find Kira way too interesting to let go.

That's 99% of the dialogue tho.

> What are your two least favourite characters at the moment?

Light and Misa are trashcans whether or not they have their memories. But those Yotsuba butts suck too. But they're just side characters, so.

> Do you like the new or should I say old Light? Or do you wish Kira to be back?

I don't see him as the old Light. There was never a time before when he was like this, even in the first episode. It's like erasing his memories actually made him a new person.

> I think that Misa looks better with her hair down.

Hmmm. I can't decide. She looks fine both ways, but something about her usual hairstyle just fits her personality.

> And the best dad of the year award goes toooooo...

I can't tell if this is comedic or serious. Perhaps a bit of both.

> Probably not Souichiro Yagami, but we could consider to give him best actor. He played his part very well.

I'm confused by the first part of this, and maybe it's just a language thing. Are you trying to say that person wasn't Soichiro Yagami? Or that he simply wasn't acting as his normal self?

Either way, like father like son. Both good actors.

> The problem with that plan of L is that he assumes that Kira kills with his thoughts and not with an object or weapon

Ah crap, I forgot to mention this myself. This is a huge point. This is really the one thing that L doesn't know about. I'm surprised with the talk of Shinigami that L has heard he hasn't theorized that the Shinigami are the ones actually killing people. Especially since he saw Misa's hair move on its own. Perhaps they can't be seen and that's how everyone is dying.

> The site where I look up the transcripts for quoting just changed Matsuda to Matsui, very funny.

They changed his name so that he could go undercover as Misa's guard or whatever. Though reading on in your comment, it seems your transcript really did change his name overall.

> That clearly proves to me that Kira and Light are different persons AND that the Death Note made Light evil.

I want to argue that it didn't *make* Light evil, but was simply able to pull out all the 'worst' qualities that were lying dormant inside of him.

> Rules for humans:

Hahaha! This just keeps getting bigger and bigger. This is half your post now. Always a good reminder though.

---

> What are your two least favourite characters at the moment?

Tough question. Maybe Aizawa and Mrs. Yagami. Mrs. Yagami feels like cheating though since she's barely around, and isn't bad when she is around. Aizawa and the new businessman Death Note guy. He looks like he'll be a real pain in the ass.

> Do you like the new or should I say old Light? Or do you wish Kira to be back?

Give me Kira. The new/'old' Light is boring. It'll be fun to watch him work to catch the 'new Kira', but I can't wait for that moment when he gets his memories back. What a glorious reintroduction it will be.

> Who is the best dad in anime?

Maes Hughes always comes to mind. Actually, him. I'm scrolling though my MAL and most of the shows don't even introduce a dad. Parents truly don't exist in anime (for the most part).

---

> because this case has so much to do with supernatural things happening he can't use normal deduction and investigation like in normal cases, he needs to do all that what he did do come even close to Kira

I *KNOW* that you can't compare what Light has already done to what L just did, but I like seeing you defend L. I'm interested to see if L continues to go to extremes and what you'll have to say about him then. Can't wait.

> mild but sunny weather. Not too hot to make sweat out all my body fluids but warm enough to wear a T-shirt.

As if Kira wasn't evil enough as it is, now he's even selling out to the man! 

I think I got my answer to what I was asking yesterday, it is just the newly broadcasted criminals that L was talking about and who's murders resumed, if my interpretation of what Rem was saying in the beginning is right. 

Is it just me, or wasn't Light raising tons of red flags when he was claiming that he couldn't take advantage of Misa, and yet made it clear that he kissed and led on Misa, while also dating another girl they know he wasn't interested in? The Chief already did a good job as a father trying to make sure his son wasn't a serial murderer and that took a lot out of him so I guess he'll be saving the talk about not using ladies for later.

Looks like Rem has given her Note to someone new.

At least they let Misa start sitting last episode. I can only imagine what it's like to be forced to stay standing for hours on end.

Fifty days in those cells. That's gotta be agonizing.

Oh snap Soichiro is taking them to be executed! Holy shit Soichiro's gone crazy!

**Death Note Rules**

So if you give up ownership of the Death Note while you have shinigami eyes your eyes will return to normal.

Haha it's a blank! How many of you guys were freaking out during this scene? As this is my second time watching this series I managed to remember this part. This is probably what L was talking with Soichiro about.

Haha Soichiro's face when Aizawa slams his hands on the table. He actually has to drag and push Misa out of the room.

Now that Light isn't Kira anymore he's actually a pretty awesome guy. The light has returned to his eyes and he thinks playing with Misa's feelings is now unacceptable.

L's little pout, "That's too bad...."

Seems like the comedy has risen a little with this episode.

Ah I forgot all about the Yotsuba group. So someone in that group is the current Kira with Rem's Death Note.

Phew, emotions were running high during that scene with the three of them in the car. I remember when I first watched this and I almost believed it, although I was feeling rather incredulous. This time around I was more able to appreciate the subtle imagery and art choices - man, what a good episode. This is also the only episode I've seen so far where they use some stereotypical anime sfx and visual gags (during the scene where Misa is being annoying as hell). 

> 1\. Did your perception of L change after watching this episode for the first time?

Nah. I was still on team L. I think the biggest thing was that you know he's right and you just wish he could prove it any way any how. You do what you gotta do. (Although, I suppose this mentality is why I was on Light's side for the first few episodes XD)

>2\. It's raining today where I live. What is your favorite type of weather? Any particular reason you like it?

Rain. Definitely rain. I can't express how much more content the sounds of rain make me feel. And when it's a warm rain, I love walking and experiencing it outside. Thunderstorms are less pleasant, but they definitely help me sleep.
>> ARTICLE
> I think the biggest thing was that you know he's right and you just wish he could prove it any way any how. 

This is so true. It's actually a bit frustrating that we know L knows it's Light, but we just keep watching him dance around it all.

So I started watching Death Note for the first time late last year before the rewatch started, but I've been watching it at a much slower rate, so the rewatch has been able to catch up to me. I'm interested in finding out what other people think of the show, since I can't take it seriously, and not in a good way. To me, it's an even worse version of Code Geass R2. It's just as ridiculous, but also lacks a compelling protagonist.

Stick around and voice your opinion. Always good to hear from the people who don't like something as well.

And I'd have to disagree. While Light isn't exactly too relatable or everyone's favorite person, he's definitely an interesting lead. Much more so than a lot of other anime.

Lol thanks. I'm probably not gonna stick around, simply because I'd probably enjoy the show even less if I forced myself to watch an episode a day. I was just curious as to what other people thought about my qualms with the show.

I'm starting to see why people might like Light, and I can't deny that he has some scenes that are entertaining to watch. But for me, they're few and far between, and the rest of the time he just acts like a fucking edgelord.
>> ARTICLE
> but also lacks a compelling protagonist.

\> Light

\> Not compelling

Dafuq?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I missed it, but he fails to provide any compelling reasons for his crusade. Sure, bad guys suck, but it's not as if crime has caused society to spiral into chaos. He claims he'll create utopia, but countless stories have shown us why that's impossible. He just comes off as a psychotic brat who has nothing better to do than to murder anyone who gets in his way. I will concede that he is entertaining at times, but his character is so ridiculous that I can't take him seriously.
>> ARTICLE
The first episode gives you glimpses as to why he became that way, with multiple news reports of violent crime. It can be assumed that those are only a fraction of the number of death-worthy crimes being reported on, and even more that aren't reported on. He starts off nobly, but the Death Note corrupts him. Having that much power at his disposal turned him into a "psychotic brat". Were it not for the notebook, he would have gone on to become a extremely well-respected detective, even growing to be real friends with L.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call a handful of news reports indicative of social breakdown. The initial news reports and establishment of the setting gives nothing to suggest that society is in ruins, though I'm inclined to believe that this is a problem of the adaptation, since friends that have only read the manga also love this show.

As for Light, I get that absolute power corrupts absolutely, but he can't be coming from a rational perspective if he decides to wield this power by subjecting the entirety of the world to his judgment and kill anyone who opposes him. He even doesn't struggle with the morality of his decision. It seems like this has been something he has wanted to do for some time, and now he has his chance. Perhaps the notebook did allow his depravity to manifest in his personality, but the speed with which he settles into killing bitches left and right leads me to believe he's been a murderous shit from day one.
>> ARTICLE
> I wouldn't call a handful of news reports indicative of social breakdown. 

I never said they were. But to Light, they act as a catalyst for his belief that the world is rotten and needs to be remade.

Whoever said he was rational? Of course the guy's lost his fucking mind. Everything that you're saying is completely right, and the show isn't painting him as the hero whatsoever. It just tells the story from his point of view, and it's doing that even less now that all the other characters have been established. Had the show started from L's point of view, Light would be seen as even more of a villain.
>> ARTICLE
Well then since I'm clearly missing it, what makes him a compelling character?
>> ARTICLE
The fact that he's a villain, but he's an incredibly intelligent one. It's seeing his mind work as he battles with L, and how he constantly has to pull the most unthinkable shit just to make sure he doesn't get caught. Really, were it not for L, Light would be pretty boring. Just a genius, OP kid fucking around killing criminals. The mental battle of wits is what's so compelling.

Problem is, I just find most of the mind games to be utterly ridiculous and usually forgettable. But that was also the case with Code Geass, so maybe I just hate fun.

Day 3 - Im still coming down from my hype high after watching some Hunter x Hunter last night.

---

I still think things moved a little fast concerning the character of Kira.

I am very curious as to how L is this good. I can understand that he might figure Kira could be a student. Even still, that was his first and only guess based off the times the victims died. Then he also goes on to say they could be dealing with a god figure. Which, sure, I suppose you could deduce based on the fact that only criminals are dying. The killer(s) might want to create a perfect world. But L just nails it. Damn, hes good.

Crime rates down. Nice. Progress, Light.

I cant fucking take it. [Ryuk is the best.](http://i.imgur.com/VfVQ1sq.png) Look at the way he is lying, [resting on his arm.](http://i.imgur.com/zQYSF12.png) Lol. Just watching them do homework. I seriously was not expecting him to be like this at all, but he is simply amazing.

Both parents exist! An anime miracle!

HOLY FUCKING SHIT PLOT TWIST. I wasnt ready for this. Lights dad is the chief.

Seriously. I love Ryuk. He just calmly laughs at Light, but not even really in a mean way. And he never closes his mouth.

Here we go. Light, your genius is showing. Specifying the time of death so that criminals die during school hours. Though maybe theyll think its one of the policemen since hes doing this right after they suspected a student oh, yes. L thinks so too. And oh snap, Light wanted him to think that?

Smart stuff, Light. Making the police investigate L. I like it.

Kira does seem to only be killing criminals, but its rather wise for these cops to want to bail now. It might come to be that cops start dying because they get closer to finding out who Kira is. I wonder how many more of them will follow suit.

[Close up Light face, number 3.](http://i.imgur.com/2YpeO1M.png)

So one of Ls people is following Light. No. Thats too obvious an assumption.

Shinigami can actually die. Interesting.

Damn, Ryuk is talkative today. This is all quite good stuff. Is Light going to be tempted enough to take this deal? I dont think he should.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Im kind of blanking on anything to really say here. Predictions are slow rolling this early on. Hmmm, I think that Light wont take Ryuks deal just yet. Hell probably wait until he gets closer to finding L. Perhaps even going so far as to begin talking to Ryuk in front of L. L will have no idea whats going on and Light will just say, Ryuk, Ill take the deal now. Light gets Shinigami eyes, kills L, and surprisingly goes on to live for a long time.

Im just speculating random things as we go here. Eventually Ill be able to form a cohesive theory that I can stick with instead of making new ones each day that poke holes in each other.

Guys, I seriously SCREAMED when they revealed Light's dad's identity. It's not even like it was a huge twist or anything, but it was pulled off to great effect. For me it was really surprising because I had just spent the past couple of minutes thinking, *Oh he's a likable police chief in a crime drama...he is totally going to die by the end of the show.* I was expecting there to be an upcoming arc in which Light figured out the identities of the higher-ups in the department and offed them. You know, I'm not sure if the fact that he is Light's father actually keeps him safe. You wouldn't *think* that Light would commit familicide, but the story is only just kicking off. If he reaches a point where the sacrifice of his father is necessary to progress toward his new world, I could see him rationalizing it. More cynically, he has a stake in keeping him around, so that he can keep tabs on the investigation.

I find myself rooting for Light despite the fact that he's a total megalomaniac. This is in no small part due to his interactions with his sister. They are SO cute; I'm a sucker for big brothers. And there are several moments where he seems noble. He is a murderer, but as of now the net result of his actions is still very positive. 

I don't think he's stupid or desperate enough (yet) to take up Ryuk's bargain for the shinigami eyes.   
>> ARTICLE
Light actually already talked about potentially having to off his family members if they discovered his secret in one of the episodes before this. I honestly think it wouldn't be that huge of a deal for him if it comes in the way of his dream. He would look at it as a necessary sacrifice.
>> ARTICLE
I too could see Light eventually rationalizing his father's death as necessary. It might get to he point where his dad can no longer be a source of protection.

> This is in no small part due to his interactions with his sister. They are SO cute

Sayu is too adorable. I want to see more scenes with their family, honestly, but I'm worried the more we know them, the higher the chance of them dying, either because of Light or even L.

I pre-wrote my comment since I was in class, so here are my answers to your questions! 

1) Counter-question: Are the life spans that the shinigami see set in stone? Or can they be changed by circumstances (your actions)? That's what would make the bargain worth it. Personally, I still wouldn't take it--I only care that much about a few people in this world, haha. I feel like Ryuk is still hiding many things, so it's a Kyubey-esque situation where you don't fully know what you're getting into.

2) I played varsity field hockey.

Good question. As of know it seems we're supposed to believe that those are set in stone. The lifespan was decided by fate. Could end up being your way though seeing as Ryuk keeps revealing new information. He's probably hiding stuff, like you said, similar to the Kyubey situation.

> I played varsity field hockey.

Is field hockey a rough sport? Seems like it could be.

>> ARTICLE
Field hockey is contact-avoidant. There aren't deliberate tackles or anything but it gets a bit rough what with running side-by-side and trying to maneuver the ball away. The biggest danger is getting hit on the legs by other players' sticks. It hurts like a mofo even through the shin guards.

Well Reddit just decided it didn't want to work for me this morning the one time I got up early. I have classes today, but I'm still here because you know gotta get those priorities straight.

- Matsuda and Kira sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G. Pretty cool that one of the cops thinks differently from the others somewhat. 

- "Nobody said it would be easy to speak the truth, but it has to be done." This guy right here is such a great guy honestly. 

- Aaaaaaand it's Light'd dad. Bet you didn't see that coming first timers, or maybe you did and I'm just impressed really easily.

- Mass murdering is just so much easier when your dad is a cop. Thank god for father-son relationships.

- Nothing like a game of soccer with your pals to get you relaxed after a long day of serial killing. You gotta eat your vegetables too Light if you wanna grow big and evil like Mr. Manson.

- Light has an emergency reserve of criminals to kill just in case he's having a bad day. Or I guess you can use them to trick L some more.

- Well Light is officially setting up the investigation team (which his father is on) to make it look like a mole is working for Kira or at least leaking information. #justgoodsonthings

- "L doesn't have to risk his life, but we have to show our faces!" Don't worry guys he needs names to kill people too and none of you were important enough to be born with names. Just relax and go fade into the background ya useless fucks.

- L is looking at the files of people on the investigation team and checking out their family members and those close to them. Things are getting exciting!

- Ryuk just flat out admitting that he isn't on Light's side haha, at least he says he isn't on anyone else's side either.

- "You're being followed by another human, he's watching you right now." Not gonna lie I kinda zoned out for a second and that creeped me out.

- Kinda interesting that Ryuk (and other Shinigami) can see names and life spans of people just by looking at them. So Ryuk already knows when it will all be over.

- Oh shit this music is intense, Light can have Shinigami eyes but has to give up half of his remaining life span. 

- God dammit Death Note why you gotta leave us with that cliffhanger? :(

Pretty interesting episode and once again a shit load has happened. Light's dad is one of the guys on the investigation team, we learn that L is investigating the investigation team and their families, Light has a secret admirer following him around, and we learn about Shinigami eyes. Will Light accept the deal? Will this stalker finally tell Light his true feelings? Will Ryuk finally eat something other than an apple? Find out next time on Dragon Ball Z.

Jumping on board with my first Reddit rewatch - woo!

Just gotta say one thing at this point that kinda sums up all three episodes for me so far. When I first watched this, I was on board with team Light for a long long time. This time around Light just creeps me the fuck out and I don't want him to succeed in any way, shape or form. Is this just the aftershock of me having watched it already, or is it a reflection of my much more grown-up eyes on the world? I'm curious if anyone else (first time watchers or rewatchers) can relate to this.
>> ARTICLE
I think I could relate. When I first watched this in 2012, I was more leaning to L side because what would you expect from an awkward 14-year-old girl. Now, I can think more clearly and I don't see anything TOO wrong with anything here. Heck I'd probably do the same if I got a Death Note, but more out of disgust and I'd start removing irrelevant alcoholics first. But then I realize that I'm not that smart. So in the end I realize that I'm actually team Ryuk, I don't really support anyone, I just want some entertainment.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely Team L all the way (I'm sure I will be this time too), but there was something about Light that made me want him to succeed, but cleanly without anyone getting in his way. Push came to shove though, and I would pick L over light every time.
>> ARTICLE
> Jumping on board with my first Reddit rewatch - woo!

Yay! Enjoy it!

> Is this just the aftershock of me having watched it already, or is it a reflection of my much more grown-up eyes on the world?

I suppose only you could answer that properly. It could be either. I'm sure for a lot of people this was one of their first anime, and I'm sure they watched it a young-ish. Your views on nearly everything change as you grow up, so from then til now, who knows.

I'm watching for the first time and personally, I enjoy Light. I think it's a bit of both not having *as much* of a problem with what he's doing and also the fact that it's just a work of fiction. So for now, I'm rooting for Light, though I'd likely never root for him in real life.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably because you've aged. Like L said last episode, Light has a very immature sort of philosophy he's acting on. Most teenagers aren't very good at seeing in anything other than black and white.

That being said, even when I was in high school, I didn't support Light, so I can't really relate but I get it. It's probably cool to have your reaction change like that. I'm a little jelly~

Something to do with us high-achieving cerebral types that are ahead of others our age but still not full of those life experiences that open your eyes past the logical train of thought maybe. I guess identifying with Light would have only been natural for me as I had a similar academic and social life at the time. Although I don't know if I saw it as black and white per say - if I did, I probably wouldn't have condoned his actions. I saw it as a more acceptable dark grey haha

German voice actor rundown

- Soichiro Yagami (Erich Ruker): **The** voice of [Gendo Ikari](http://www.nervarchives.com/images/icon.200x150.gendo.jpg) for me, also voice of [Liam Cunningham](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Liam_Cunningham_2013.jpg) and [King Bradley](http://i.imgur.com/QfYYUHw.jpg). I wanted to do this yesterday but there was no way to do this without spoiling so I do this today.

----

Always astounding what people do for attention, I mean saying that you a serial killer just to be noticed, why?

MATSUDA!!! You are doing the right thing don't listen to this sighing haters. I mean he had the guts to tell the fact that Kiras methods are working, even though we know that what Kira does is wrong, it still has influence on the people. 

Damnit L he already figured out that Kira is a student, and on top of that he has a hunch that Kira needs the faces of his victims.

DA DA DA DAAA! The chief of the NPA is Lights father, who would've expected that? No really who expected that, I want to know that.

Ryuk standing there behind Light and watching everyone eat looks kind of creepy and stalkery. Aw both mother and sister are so proud of the model student.

So either Light is also a good hacker or Mr. Yagami has a very bad password, it always bugs me that in movies or series the most important secrets are stored on a disk with a ~~passwort~~^(my German is leaking) password you can just guess very easy when knowing the person it belongs to. As if a scientist who discovered the formula to end the world would use the password "Anna" to protect it.

Now it's time for some experiments.

OH NOOO NOT INMATE 148! He was my favourite. Rest in Piece. DAMN YOU KIRA!! Can't wait to nominate him in the best guy contest next year though.

And Kiras plan is working, the police is already turning against L. But the three man resigning have a point here, L is very safe with his way of investigating, and the fact that police officer have to identify themself before arresting the person is a huge weakness in this case, because for what they know until now is that Kira could kill anyone of them whenever he wants after knowing their name and picture, they don't know if  restraining him will help in any way.

[Well look here, the bully from episode 1 is still alive](http://i.imgur.com/6xcOZ6v.png). Looks like the plan of purging the world still hasn't reached the bully phase.

Wow episode 3 and Light [Not yet explicitly revealed](/s "already gets monitored by the FBI, who would've thought?")

[Ryuk has special eyes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-fRuoMIfpw)

I really want to know how to convert [Shinigami time](http://i.imgur.com/uA8JS7X.png) into human time.

And cliffhanger. I already hear the groan of all the first time viewer.


----


Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

~~1. If you were in Lights place would you make the deal with Ryuk?~~ (Neawia already asked the same sort of question)

2. Rest in piece Inmate 148. In his memory I want to know, what is your favourite number?

3. [Man L's desktop background looks really bland](http://i.imgur.com/GLgAofL.png). So I ask you, is your desktop background better?

> Light didn't seem that good at soccer, but at least he was playing. Do you currently play any sports? Did you play any when you were younger? Were you any good?

> I really want to know how to convert Shinigami time into human time.

[spoilers for the entire series](/s "I don't think it's ever revealed how the numbers are converted. Assuming the numbers chosen by the mangaka aren't random, they could easily be seconds. That would mean Light has just about 3 years left. I don't remember how long exactly the series runs but isn't that reasonably accurate?")
>> ARTICLE
> Soichiro Yagami

He even looks similar to Bradley with that emotionless face and moustache.

> even though we know that what Kira does is wrong

All opinion based, really. I think most people would agree that what he's doing is wrong. However, it's an end justifies the means kind of situation, to an extent. Light does want to be a god, but making the world a better place is a noble goal. Though most people won't always agree that killing a select few, criminals at that, is the best way to prevent future crime. Even though, as we see this episode, it does work.

> Ryuk has special eyes!

Hehe. The final line, "My brand!" has always sounded like Zoidberg from Futurama to me.

> I really want to know how to convert Shinigami time into human time.

Same. The weird thing is also  that the Shinigami acquire the years of the humans. Must be annoying to have to concert each time. I guess the Shinigami might age differently than humans.

> And cliffhanger. I already hear the groan of all the first time viewer.

I've already done this three times, so I can behave myself and wait. But damn can I see how easy it would be to just keep watching one after the other. Lucky for me I'll be able to binge a few episodes since I won't be around for 5 days and will need to catch up.

> If you were in Lights place would you make the deal with Ryuk? 

The questions are a little different. In Light's position, I wouldn't accept it. I think he has great plans, and he wants to be a god. Even assuming he can live another 60 years, cutting it in half doesn't leave him much time to achieve his goals and enjoy his success.

> Rest in piece Inmate 148. In his memory I want to know, what is your favourite number?

Thanks for highlighting my typo. I quite like the idea of the Shinigami throwing a concert every time they learn someone's death date.

I've always guessed that all Shinigami are "born" looking the exact same way they'll look for the rest of their lives. Killing humans just keeps them around longer.

That's an interesting way of thinking about it. So without tricking and killing humans, they could live very short lives.

You just chose a number that has a meaning to you or has cool and interesting properties.

For example I really like 1729 for the [anecdote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_number) it has.

Fourteen is a cool number because it's light blue, I guess???

I can see how it might get hard to not watch ahead with this show, I felt like the episode lasted 10 minutes if that!

I'm kind of happy that I was right about them picking up on the time usage, though they did make it pretty obvious. 
I feel like L is actually starting to hone in on him a bit though. I feel  like changing the deaths to 1 every hour 
won't make L dismiss it being a student and then him most probably having access to the records actually narrows 
it down a massive amount. I do get why light did it though as he said he wants to make them fight within themselves 
he's just starting to walk a dangerous line.

I'm wondering who this is following him though? There's a lot of police working on this case and there's probably a good
chance a lot of them have kids; are that many people really being assigned to follow every kid of someone who works there?
Also, light was talking about killing him, but wouldn't that just put a massive red light on his head? I also have a feeling
he won't take the offer on the eye because he is too proud, but we'll see.

There's a lot to think about for sure, the cat and mouse game is getting really interesting. 

1. I wouldn't take the deal, I don't think it's even remotely worth it.
2. I played Tennis/netball in School, I was OK at both, not great though :3

Oh yeah. That guy at the end. Perhaps an associate of L, or maybe someone unrelated to both L and the police. Maybe someone with a connection to the Shinigami.

I like the montage of Light being in school while the prisoners whos names he wrote down are dying in the middle of the day. Its like hes thinking, oh, how was my day, mom? Well, we got our assignments in homeroom, I killed a man, we sorted the athlethic equipment, I killed a man, I read some more English lit for my foreign languages, I killed a man, we won in soccer, I killed man.... and so on. 

I am definitely biased because I am in the camp of people who does morally object to killing prisoners like Light has been doing, but I really like it when hes the one who gets surprised or tricked, thats why yesterdays episodes was one of my favorites; but today was great too, I got a little giddy when Ryuk told him about being followed. The smarter Light is set up to be, the more satisfying and tense things are when hes not in control, and its a great Ryuk moment too. Sometimes L and Light take up the spotlight as the chess masters so much that I can forget that Ryuk is no fool, really hes the puppet master of it all, no one has anything on him in this game. 

>> ARTICLE
> Ryuk is no fool, really hes the puppet master of it all, no one has anything on him in this game.

Really, Ryuk could be the perfect Kira if he wanted to. He could write down all the names and never have to even think about getting caught. Any Shinigami could.

But where's the fun in that?

This episode starts out a little slow, with L shredding a little light on Kira , pointing out the childishness of his actions and aided by a bumbling idiot Matsuda  (Let's call him M). Soon after Light helps his sister with homework of all things, eats dinner and has a  *I am your son moment with the chief. Then we learn that Light has been a manipulative with his killings conveniently after L's deduction , picking one off* ***one hour after another,leading to infighting within the police ranks , resignation and shit***. 

#Ryuk  decides that now is the perfect time to reveal some deathnote rule which will have profound consequences backed by fucking epic choir music!

I like how Ryuk has a [resting "oh shit" face](http://i.imgur.com/vjVdkUb.png), it makes him pretty relatable

The game board is starting to fill up, and pieces have started to move.

This is where the game of cat V's ~~mouse~~ cat gets going; both L and Light are making big moves to find each other out. Light's use of the police both helps him kill but also gives away information to L that he hope will turn the police against him. It's a bold plan from Light but bit much this early imo, but a calculated move non the less.

The music really stood out to me for the first time this episode. I liked its use in the mini montage of deaths.

Not much action but things are explained and information is gathered. It dose a good job of setting up the next few mini story arcs.

That's actually kind of cool. You get to be surprised again.
>> ARTICLE
I feel very sorry for Commisioner Sochiro, his talented  son is a prime suspect in a murder investigation but he still believes his son being innocent and fights for a lost cause.Yet he also uphold a very strong sense of justice, so powerful in fact he is willing to turn himself in to help with the investigation. Truly one of the best dads in anime.

I remember first watching this episode, I was as clueless as L's investgiation.However, being a part of the audience you can clearly see all this is part of some clever meddling of the Shinigamis and deathnotes.

Now that light does not have any memories of being Kira, let's assume that he is proven to be Kira, would this Light be **innocent or guilty** in this case?
>> ARTICLE
Guiiiilty???

I actually have no idea. That's a good question.
>> ARTICLE
I would say innocent since he has no memory of doing these things. Considering the system in place in most of the world however he'd probably be placed in prison anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Innocent. While it was the same body who committed the murders, it wasn't the same mind/soul. You can't really place him at fault for that, especially if they rule that Light actually was under Kira's control somehow.
>> ARTICLE
I think that the new Light would be innocent since there's such an extreme distaste for what Kira is doing and a desire to see him brought to justice. I dunno. You renounce his ways and show that kind of panic about catching him and I think you're in the clear in my book.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with **innocence** is that by doing so, Original Light (and Misa by extension) gets away with his crime scot free and no one gets arrested for the massacre. Since no one is convinced there will be a huge public uproar over the issue, current Light will probably be shunned by the public too. 
>> ARTICLE
Soichiro's face when Light said he could be Kira is the best thing I've ever seen. It was a work of art.

In which Soichiro randomly becomes capable of filicide.  Seriously, wat?

It's OK, Ryuk. I could really go for some chunky applesauce, right now. You're not alone.

Fucking hell, Soichiro, chill out.

The affect is kind of ruined when the last shot of Light looking up is all mushy like that, guys.

Later. Goin'na steal some apples now. ~*Deuces*~

Light's entire face changes once he turns good. Stop staring at me with them big ol' eyes.

Trying to sweet talk a stalker by calling him stalker-san. I think calling him a stalker might cancel out the politeness of an honorfic, Misa.

Fucking hell, Matsuda, chill out.

OK, either the dub conveniently left it out or I missed the nod to urophilia. But, like. Why, Death Note writers?

Is prosciutto and melon good? L misses out on a lot of pleasures in life by casting savory foods aside.

Fucking hell, Soichiro, chi- ^^^OK ^^^I'll ^^^stop ^^^now.

I wonder why Light said 'purido' in the Japanese dub. Is it for emphasis? Is there no native Japanese word for pride in Japanese? I doubt it.

I mean, techinically, just because Light could be Kira and not know it doesn't mean that *Kira* wouldn't be operating with self-awareness  if you believe in Dissociative Identity Disorder, that is.

Thinking about ham and prosciutto has suddenly made me feel a little nauseous again :/

Misa would be the type to refer to herself in the third person instead of with pronouns.

Rules for humans:

1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.
9. The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.
10. The person in possession of the Death Note is possessed by a god of death, its original owner, until they die.
11. If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.
12. The cause of death must still be in realm of possibility for the victim.
13. You may also write the cause and/or details of death prior to filling in the name of the individual. Be sure to insert the name in front of the written cause of death. You have about 19 days (according to the human calendar) in order to fill in a name.
14. If a human uses the note, a god of death usually appears in front of him/her within 39 days after he/she uses the note.
15. A person can shorten his or her onw life by using the note.
16. One page taken from the Death Note or even  a fragment of the page contains the full effects of the note.
17. The instrument to write with can be anything, (e.g cosmetics, blood, etc.) as long as it can write directly onto the note and remains as legible letters.
18. Even if you do not actually possess the Death Note, the effect will be the same if you can recognize the person and his/her name to place in  the blank.
19. The owner of a Death Note with Shinigami eyes can't see the remaining life time of another Shinigami owner
20. The Death Note will not affect those under 780 days old.
21. The Death Note will be rendered useless if the victim's name is misspelled four times
22. Whether the cause of the individual's death is either a suicide or accident, if the death leads to the death of more than the intended, the person will simply die of a heart attack. This is to ensure that other lives are not influenced.
23. Even after the individual's name, the time of death, and death condition on the Death Note were filled out, the time and condition of death can be altered as many times as you want as lon as it is changed within 6 minutes and 40 second from the time it was filled in. But of course, this is only possible before the victim dies.
24. Whenever you want to change anything written on the Death Note within 6 minutes and 40 seconds after you wrote, you must first rule out the characters you want to erase with two straight lines.
25. **The time and condition of death can be changed but once the victim's name has been written the individual's death can never be avoided.**
26. **If you lose the Death Note or have it stolen you will lose its ownership unless you retrieve it within 490 days.**


Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1. The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.
2. Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.
3. Gods of Death, the original owners of the Death Note, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note.
4. A god of death cannot be killed even if stabbed in his heart with a knife or shot in the head with a gun. However, there are ways to kill a god of death which are not generally known to the gods of death
5. The specific scope of the condition for death is not known to the gods of death, either so, you must examine and find out.

>  Soichiro Yagami. Good dad. Yay, nay, or simply okay? He's finally showing true worry for his son, but maybe he could've talked to him about being a suspect before this.

I think he is a good father, I mean he managed to raise a smart and responsible son, it's not his fault that an evil enormous power is corrupting him into a serial killer. Also he legitimately cares for his son.

I knew this already! Hmmm, where did I learn this from...

> What are your three favourite characters at the moment?

Sayu, Ryuk, Light. Wish I could get more of the first two. Oh, man how cool would it be if Sayu touched the Death Note and started palling around with Ryuk.

> What is the strangest combination of two kinds of food that still tastes good even though it shouldn't for you?

Hmmm, either peanut butter and butter (margarine), just on some crackers or something or peanut butter and cheese whiz, just a sandwich. I don't know how weird they actually are, but I don't personally know anyone who eats them.

> What was the last thing that made you as excited as Matsuda telling the chief that Kira killed again?

Maybe when they announced they were going to make the Mahouka movie. I genuinely enjoyed the series and didn't think anything else would be animated.

> I think he is a good father, I mean he managed to raise a smart and responsible son, it's not his fault that an evil enormous power is corrupting him into a serial killer. Also he legitimately cares for his son.

Fair enough. Though since he is the one who helped raise him, you could argue he's responsible for Light being the way he is. He did think like this before the Death Note. Now he just has a way to act on his thoughts.

L, Matsuda, and Ryuk (but English Ryuk), in that order.

I seem to recall ramen and vanilla ice cream being pretty good. But not mixed together in the bowl. Also cheez-its dipped in kool-aid.

One of the great things of this episode is the transition from Kira to Light.

The original manga artist commented that it was difficult to switch back to Light's original drawing style after gaining experience in drawing Kira in a certain way.

That's a cool little tidbit. I haven't seen the manga, but if the anime artwork is mostly based off of it, they did a good job. Light really did look different than his Kira side.

---


Ok, so this isnt going the way I thought it would. Not yet, at least. Looks like Ryuk is going to help out Light a little bit. I like seeing that.


L. Youre obviously a pervert, you pervert.


Weird. Misa remembers that Light is her boyfriend. Well, boyfriend. Actually, maybe she doesnt remember it the quotations way. So perhaps losing ownership of the Death Note made her simply lose all knowledge pertaining to the Death Note and Shinigami and stuff, but things that happened *because* of her possession of the Death Note she can remember. Theyre not technically Death Note related. Death Note adjacent, really.


[Nice face.](http://i.imgur.com/JqEYmKq.png) Cant believe his own son would admit he could possibly be Kira. Well, maybe this couldve been avoided, Soichiro, if you *talked to your son.* What a weird thing to admit though. Yeah, I guess I could be a mass murderer.


I wish Light would just say that perhaps L is technically just as guilty of being Kira. L is alone most of the time (when hes not with the task force). Nobody actually knows anything at all about him. Why so trusting?


And L is now positive that Light is Kira. Here we go.


Alright so maybe Light is going to pretend to actually be Kira but like, oh, how would I know if Im Kira. Oh, ok. Yep. Thats what hes doing.


[Cameras in my room? This is news to me.](http://i.imgur.com/FkYjFtD.png)


Matsuda. Fuck yeah. Stepping up. Knows that killing certain people might be for the best, but doesnt actually act on it. Good guy.


Hmmm, so maybe Light will volunteer to be put under constant surveillance to prove his innocence. Maybe he told Rem to go and kill some people while he is under watch. But what would Rem get out of that? Perhaps both Light and Misa could be proven innocent which would mean Misa would be safe and happy with Light. Because if Kira still kills people while both Light and Misa are tied up, it shouldnt be much of a stretch to think Kira controls others (makes Light a scapegoat, plants evidence of Misa).


And then L immediately calls out Light (and me) on our bullshit. He seems sure that Light is still going to be Kira. Of course, L hasnt forgotten about the talk of Shinigami or the fact that Misas hair moved on its own.


Hahaha, poor Ryuk. Dudes gonna be bored as hell sitting in there with Light. Plus Lights gonna have to deal his boneitis once he goes into apple withdrawal.


[After finishing any kind of work at all because were all lazy bums on the inside.](http://i.imgur.com/d6z5gou.png)


So Light didnt have a plan set up to kill the criminals. Interesting. I wonder if his plan is something as dark as making the argument that his father was confined at the same time so maybe his dad is Kira.


OOOOOOHHHHHH Hes gonna start acting like Kira. Gonna try and convince everyone that hes being possessed or something. Maybe he set something up so hes going to threaten to kill a bunch of people at once, and thats when Rem will be set to write the names in her book.


Oh, well shit. He just told Ryuk to get rid of the Death Note. Love his little, Got it, later. So is Light going to forget being Kira now. Hell have no memory of the Death Note and stuff. Ryuk will meet up with him at a later time and then that's when Light and Misa will switch Shinigami. Something like that.


So theyll hopefully make the connection between Misa and Light. Both were confined in one mental state (aka Kira suspects), then later they completely act out of character. Thats the plan to make L believe Kira is controlling them somehow. Maybe?


YES FUCK YES ALL AT ONCE!


[Light up close.](http://i.imgur.com/Vknc8q6.png)


[L up close.](http://i.imgur.com/phNGOp7.png)


L doesnt understand. This was a fun way to end the episode. Dudes confused. Ugh. I want to keep going.


**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**


None, I dont think. I just want to keep watching. Perhaps Ill take some time now to analyze my past theories and organize them.


For a quickie reminder: I still think that Light is going to end up with Misa's disowned Death Note and Rem while Misa will end up with Light's disowned Death Note and Ryuk.


Light will still hold on to both Death Notes, and they'll each touch each others (   ) so they can see and speak to their old Shinigami partner.
That is, of course, assuming "get rid of it" meant giving up ownership and not physically destroying the Death Note. But I don't think that's what happened. I think they're gonna switch once they get out of confinement.

[Just to be safe, Death Note spoilers](/s "This episode starts a string of episodes that I consider to be probably my favorite of the entire show. This is a brilliant plan Light has put into action.")

I forgot that Soichiro gets himself locked up too.

Light's face makes such a dramatic change when he gives up ownership of the Death Note. He looks truly innocent.
>> ARTICLE
Of course Captain Yagami is a good dad, it doesn't matter if he wasn't especially kind to Light while the the torturous investigation was going on; making sure your kids aren't megalomaniac magical serial killers is one of the most important things you can do! 

Light is taking a huge gamble on this strategy, the only thing that can actually put him in the clear is if they actually catch someone else on the same evidence that made him a suspect. 

I think I also must have some kind of misunderstanding, did all Kira Murders stop indefinitely, or just those of criminals who were broadcast since Light's imprisonment? Because as I recall, Light wrote the names of criminals in the Deathnote several months in advance so that his targets would continue to die on that 23 a day schedule even if he got caught up in stuff and couldn't keep writing names, so unless he purposely delayed or stopped all those deaths, there should still have been several old inmates dying while he was in there. 
>> ARTICLE
i agree, this "arc" is my favorite
>> ARTICLE
Good question. I don't think he could've stopped the murders based on the rules in the Death Note (6:40 to change the info) so if he still had deaths planned, they should be going on.

I think it must've just been criminals who were 'new'. One's who were made public for the first time *after* Light was in lockup. Though they definitely don't make it clear if the other murders continued or not.

&nbsp;

>Soichiro Yagami. Good dad. Yay, nay, or simply okay? He's finally showing true worry for his son, but maybe he could've talked to him about being a suspect before this.

He's definitely a good dad, just a little strict maybe. But even with that, he's raised an intelligent, athletic, successful, otherwise honorable son (although that "otherwise" is a pretty big one).

This is the thing, it's like, are you really ok with your son being like this? Not that Soichiro knows though. It's a pretty huge extreme. The alternative exteme though is that he gets a lot of credit for helping make Light be such a successful young man.

I feel Light killing all the FBI officers is crossing the moral point of no return, not only are these officers all innocent, they uphold the very "justice" he believes it just not as extreme.The real world irony is USA has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world.  Kira is a hypocrite and there is no point in worshiping  him anymore, there are other [Gods ](http://imgur.com/r6AZh2w) more worthwhile.

By the way Light, don't you know that the less people investigate you, the [more powerful they actually are](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu)? Particularly in this case as this a war of information attrition, the side which actually makes the least mistake, the more people in the investigation the higher the likelihood of them investigation you. Now the entire investigation consists only 5 police officer (including Afroman and L) , a butler and Mats.

1. It wasn't a good decision ,neither morally nor [tactically](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/48ikwn/spoilers_death_note_rewatch_episode_4_discussion/d0jtw3p), the only good thing that came out of it is Low of Solipsism playing again.

Wait. Light just told Raye that he wouldnt tell anyone he was an FBI agent, including his father. To Raye, why would Light mention that? Light's perspective should've been: "What reason would this FBI agent have to know who I am and that my father is the police chief?" Did I miss something or is it weird that Light said this?

Just another unfortunate accident. Oh, and that one kid who had a smug look on his face the entire time. Hes not suspicious, just sadistic.

Ok, *Miss* L. Who the hell are you, making correct assumptions? 'Hard to believe it was a coincidence.' Let your husband do his job. Hes the FBI agent. Ok well, shit. She was an agent once.

Backstory for Penber? Maybe hes not going to do so soon. Or maybe theyre just trying to make us connect with him; talk about his wife and kids and stuff.

Light just gave L a note that says gods of death. Ok. Game fucking on. Hes just straight up cluing L in. Give him hints on shit that hed never be able to figure out otherwise.This is gonna be fun.

More Death Note rules. The name can be written after the cause. Even Ryuk didnt know about it. Ill leave it /u/Saikimo to detail it.

Light is arrogant as fuck. Just out in public as himself, threatening Penber. I love it.

[Close up Light.](http://i.imgur.com/zubGDXo.png) Slightly zoomed out to show that sinister stare.

That whole train sequence was thrilling. I dont think Penber deserved to die, but damnit do I love Light being an arrogant little prick. Just looking down at Raye as he dies, letting him know the true identity of Kira.

Explanation? Was this an experiment of Lights? It seems that because Penber knew the names and faces of those FBI agents, he was the one to authorize their deaths, not Light. Yes? Did Light know the Death Note was capable of that?

The message was a two parter. Did you know gods of death love apples?

Sayu cute as ever. [Resting her head on her hands,](http://i.imgur.com/Ao9DRGN.png) praising her dad yet concerned for his well being.

So now Penbers wife is gonna start her own investigation.

[How is he reading Ls laptop from that far away?](http://i.imgur.com/ytScFfo.png)

I like Ls tactic of waiting for the task force to whittle down. Smart move. Didnt think hed actually show his face to any of them, especially not so soon. I also love that hes just doing this to set a trap for Kira in hopes of reeling him in.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Episode 5 - Light is Arrogant and Loves Messing with People

Shows off in front of Penber, reveals his identity, sends messages to L, tells his dad he'll avenge his death. Another good episode for Light. Things are still going his way, but I'm sure that will change.

Severe lack of Ryuk this episode.

Light has taken his first step and killed people who even he should consider innocent. There was no reason for Penber to die. I'd like the think that the smallest justification for his death was that Light was able to use him to get the FBI names. I guess killing them all was necessary to mess up the dynamic between the police and L. Still, Raye didn't deserve to die, but he was the only one Light could use. After their interaction, he couldn't risk Raye being suspicious of him, so Raye had to die.

I want to have something on Penber's wife. I think she's going to be a better investigator than her late husband. She'll probably be a thorn in Light's side, if nothing else. She'll eventually die.

I'm going to make myself sad now...

Penber's wife is able to ascertain that Light Yagami might be Kira. She has connections (maybe L) and sends a team to Light's house to investigate when his father isn't around. Sayu is sitting at Light's desk working on homework while Light goes downstairs to get them drinks or something. The 'swat' team busts in and captures Light. He screams like mad because they're going to his room. They start snooping around and... boom. The Death Note trap goes off, killing all the swat members and Sayu. This is also where the second Death Note comes into play. Light has to find the second one so he can continue killing people to avenge his sister's death.

I don't even know what about the episode we just watched caused me to think that.

Damn, so that could've just not worked. Light would still have the names on the paper, but Penber could've walked away. Curious as to the terms of Penber's death as written in the Death Note. Perhaps we'll get answers next episode.

Oh.

So many heads. Almost *too* many heads.

His would work for something like 'I can't believe I just read something this fucking stupid' or something similar. He just has that resting face that looks like he's in shock. Just intently staring ahead.

Well my DVD decided today to not play episode 5 for some reason, it crashed every single of my media player on my computer, I suspect the copy protection. So I needed to sail the high seas for todays episode. Well atleast I get to enjoy the English dub for today, so let's look how this goes. 

Damnit Raye you're far to gullible, well it's easy to say as a viewer. Still he didn't need to mention this.

Well looky look Rayes fiance is smart and beautiful, man Raye is such a lucky man. She immediately picks up that everything happening on the bus was just too perfect to be a coincidence.

Oh no Raye started to [talk in exposition](https://youtu.be/7jz7rFuZZZc), fast get some better writers.

>You're my fiance right now we talked about this. I'm Man I work I  bring food. Women no work. Now make sandwich women.

You wouldn't believe what this guy named Kira found out! Shinigamis hate him. Killing so much easier with this simple trick...

Damn Kira brings himself into danger, risky plan he's doing.

No believe me guys Kira is a good guy, he's just blackmailing and threatening this FBI agent for the greater good.

So who still believes that Kira isn't evil and doesn't do it for his own ego? He just made an innocent man kill his superiors and colleagues and killed him afterwards, not only that he revealed himself to that man just to taunt him and to see his last moments. If he would do all that just for sake of the world, or even his own sake and the world, he wouldn't enjoy all this. But there is no regret, he is just an evil human with no good in him left anymore.

Well I personally think everything Kira did here was unecessary and too dangerous considering what he gained here, he already wasn't under suspicion anymore. But he managed to bring the FBI to not work with L anymore. And that could help him far in the future. And he also raised suspicion towards L in the Kira investigation team. 

Wow Light, really? What a fucking cheesy line, didn't sound on bit believable.

So again Matsuda maybe a bumbling idiot, but he has more balls than probably 70% of the investigation team right now. He didn't leave.

And it was L's plan all along to get anyone who doesn't have the guts for this case out of the team. So Kira kind of played into L's hands here.

In the next episode the big reveal of L's face **cough** opening **cough**.


---

After episode thoughts:

Everytime I see this episode I get angrier than the last time I saw it. This whole plan is just so unecessary, especially considering what he gained from all that. [Death Note](/s "Also I see this as one of the biggest fuck ups from Kira in the whole show. He just set Naomi on his trail. But atleast this episode is a great setup for the next episode that is probably my favourite episode in the whole series.")

Rules for humans:

1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.
9. The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.
10. The person in possession of the Death Note is possessed by a god of death, its original owner, until they die.
11. If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.
12. The cause of death must still be in realm of possibility for the victim.
13. **It's possible to write down the cause of death first and add the name later.**

Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1.The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.
2.Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.

I know that particular line you wrote was meant more for comedic effect, but is it not crazy to believe that you might have to do some questionable things to get the job done? I'm not condoning Light killing Penber (or any other killings he may do in the future), but it'd be too difficult to get things done if you were being nice all the time.

This is Light's situation. He had a dream for the world (albiet, a crazy one), but he stumbled upon the Death Note. This is what he has to work with.

> So who still believes that Kira isn't evil and doesn't do it for his own ego?

I can't call him evil yet, but this episode was all for his own fun. He had a task to accomplish, but he made sure to enjoy himself doing it.

> But there is no regret, he is just an evil human with no good in him left anymore.

And I definitely know where you stand.

> But he managed to bring the FBI to not work with L anymore.

This is definitely important. Like we've discussed, he went a little too far with his actions, but I think the head of the FBI said he's pulling everyone off the case, right? So that's a lot of manpower off of Light's ass. Correction, Kira's ass. They wouldn't suspect Light, but the Kira case would still be high profile. Now there's only six guys worrying about Kira.

> Wow Light, really? What a fucking cheesy line, didn't sound on bit believable.

Yeah. He kind of just blurted out the fact that he'd execute Kira, and then he walked away. That was kind of strange, but whatever.

> RIP coffee shop guy. So are you more of a coffee or tea person?

Tea. I don't drink coffee at all.

> Well Raye didn't recognise Kiras voice early enough. Which voice actor do you recognise no matter what role he plays? From either anime, games, cartoons, or even audio books.

[Recognize is spelled with a 'z'.](http://i.imgur.com/9frmLYp.jpg)

The thing is, I think I mainly recognize voice actors who always use the same voice, i.e, they can't use any other voice. Bryce Papenbrook, Nolan North, Jennifer Hale come to mind. And I don't dislike them though. They typically give good performances, but it's always the same voice. Then there's voices like Kristen Schall or Gilbert Gottfried who have such crazy voices that they'd never use a different voice anyway.

> I really love the Atlantis movie, my mother and still quoting mrs. Packard to this day.

I agree. For me, Light lost his moral ambiguity when he killed L's double on TV. And his stunt with Penber solidified him as an evil narcissist. No shades of gray anymore.

Wow the pace isn't slowing down how do they get this to stretch out to 37 episodes. A very good episode Light is on the war path and L seem to be lagging behind.

Taking out all the FBI agents as well as the handler in on stroke was inspired from Light he could have just taken out the one guy but here he eliminate a major threat and hid the blame. Side not why FBI and not the CIA?

Trust is a a all time low with the police and things are getting real for them as they see them selves in the firing line. Though at the end the is a formation of a core team to work directly with L. Oh and now the is one former spook out for revenge.

Well, I'm sure they still suspect that Kira is the one who killed the FBI agents. Penber just had to write their names down.

Once again Raye's stupidity made me want to bang my head on the wall. There were so many moments where he could have done something, but he just kept doing whatever told like a complete moron without any metal capabilities for themselves.

By the end, I just gave up and was fully rooting for Kira, even if he was doing it for selfish reasons, but someone as stupid as Raye are basically a waking hazard, not just for themselves, but people around them too, so removing them from the face of the earth would be doing a world a favor. Still it was too late, and they obliviously killed so many innocent people because of their stupidity before taking their own life.

If Raye were a real person, he'd definitely qualify for a Darwin Award. Now let's see if the fiance is any better. Fingers crossed Raye's stupidity didn't rub off on her. They don't even have to be a genius, they just need to have a normal functioning brain.

My favorite Disney movie hmm... there are just so many but if I have to choose one, I'll say Tangled.
>> ARTICLE
Harsh words for Raye, but not necessarily untrue. I'm surprised that guy is an FBI agent. They probably could've written him to be a little more competent. I guess he's just there to have Light show off and to introduce us to his wife who will now be hunting Kira and looks to be quite skilled.

> My favorite Disney movie hmm... there are just so many but if I have to choose one, I'll say Tangled.

That's a good pick. I saw it a little while back and was surprised that is was so enjoyable. Definitely a nice movie.
>> ARTICLE
So here Light reveals that you don't need to write a person's name in the Death Note first. The details can be done first then the name added later. I didn't remember that at all.

A very sneaky trick to get Raye to kill all his coworkers. Now we see why Light actually wanted to kill him instead of just getting him off his case.

I recognize Afro guy's voice. Just can't put my finger on who it is.

So next episode the crew meets L. One thing I wish had been different is that this was the first time we see him as well. We've already seen enough glimpses of him before this that, besides his face, we pretty much know what he looks like.

It would have been nice to keep him completely as a voice before this so as to make the reveal a bit more surprising. We would've had no idea before this that L was a guy who lounges around in jeans and a white top.

Only 3 hours late, I'm making pretty good time today. Sorry about that, just decided to sleep through my alarm today and forget about my responsibilities. Anyways let's watch episode 5 of No Murder No Life. 

- And here we go, today we meet one of my favorite characters from Death Note that isn't Light or L. This woman is so cool to me for some reason.

- Raye you're kinda being a sexist dick man, she's a special agent for a reason so she probably knows more than you do and at least she isn't stalking high school boys in here spare time.

- Episode 5-7 is one of my favorite stretches of episodes in any anime, we're in for a fun time friends.

- "Mr. Raye Pember, turn around and you're dead." Light is that you? Oh for a second I thought it was someone intimidating.

- "He managed to get away due to a lack of evidence." Ya Light if the cops don't think he's a criminal and you do I guess he does deserve to die!

- So Light is now threatening to murder Raye, his fianc, and his entire family now. If you're still thinking Light's a good guy then what show are you watching?

- I actually watched Code Geass after Death Note, but when Light is communicating with Raye through the earpiece he really reminds me of Lelouch.

- OH MY FUCKING GOD. Is Light having Raye write their names in the Death Note since he has their faces in mind?

- This is where I start to really fucking hate Light, yes he's a genius and kind of a badass, but he just killed a shit load of innocent people and even taunted Raye as he was dying.

- Chief Yagami is another one of my favorite characters. He's probably the best guy in the show as far as being a good person goes. 

- Poor girl, her fianc is dead and if Raye had accepted her help then maybe this wouldn't have happened. God damn you sexism you've taken another life!

- "If anything should ever happen to you I'm gonna find Kira and make sure he gets executed!" You smug prick ughhhh God I really hate him in this episode.

- I'm sorry, but the music playing when the investigation team is talking to L through the camera sounds like it should be in a porno.

- I have no idea why, but every time Matsuda speaks I'm either smiling or laughing even if it's a completely serious scene, he's just such a cute little retard.

- And finally the investigation team is meeting L face to face. Even though he's sort of a weirdo from what we've seen so far he's easily my favorite character in the series so I'm always excited for episode 6.

Overall I loved this episode and the next 2 or so are also some of my favorites. Sorry I was so late today guys, but tomorrow I'll try to get up before 4 PM. Gotta start making some life changes haha.

> This woman is so cool to me for some reason.

Because she's actually a prominent woman in what's otherwise a massive sausagefest.

> Ya Light if the cops don't think he's a criminal and you do I guess he does deserve to die!

To be fair, [Future Episode Spoilers](/s "Light was right about the man who murdered Misa's parents, and it looked like he was gonna get off due to lack of evidence, too, even though Misa saw him kill her family with her own eyes.") So it's possible Light was more than just guessing there.

> If you're still thinking Light's a good guy then what show are you watching?

A show where he's really the only character I have any emotional connection with.

> This is where I start to really fucking hate Light

Hope you enjoy that heart attack.

Sigh. And this was the beginning of my distaste in Light the first time around. This time it's only a minor solidification. Although the person I'm watching it with made a good point - doesn't this episode meant that Raye Penber can go to neither heaven nor hell now? Poor bastard, it's even worse than I always thought :'(
>> ARTICLE
Raye is an idiot. Light didn't even tell him to read the names of the FBI agents back to him, there was nothing stopping him from lying about all of the names. Even if you didn't know about the death note, why would you give the names of FBI agents to any serial murderer?!

At least Mrs. Penber is smart, she knew that the criminal who did the bus-jacking was no coincidence.

Cant wait to re watch this with you guys.  New to the group, glad I found you in time because I was just about to re watch DN.

I would probably have to agree. There are plenty of great moments in other episodes but this episode is consistently great. I like it when it puts this much emphasis on the actual thought processes instead of just the  conclusion they come up with.
>> ARTICLE
What thought process? Anybody with two brain cells would have alarms ringing with the way Light was acting. It's almost funny how this show is so out of touch with reality and human behavior.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 7 is honestly my favorite episode in the series (or at least one of them) so we're in for a fun ride guys.

- Just gonna say it again "The World" is an amazing OP, fuck the haters. I could just be biased since this is one of the first anime I had ever seen and still have no clue what the lyrics are saying.

- Ryuk's wheezing laughs when Light is writing her name in the Death Note is so hilarious to me for some reason. Probably because he knows when Light's fucking up all the time.

- Even the way L holds a phone is odd looking. Seriously just go take some classes on proper social skills ya little hunchback.

- Naomi seems like she's onto you buddy, oh ya and the name you wrote down? She gave you a fake so go fuck yourself Light. #naomibestgirl

- Are you just gonna keep following her around all day Light? You're kinda coming off as a creepy stalker guy. You keep it up and you're gonna start reminding her of her fianc.

- Oh shit I honestly forgot about the Shinigami eyes deal for a while, and of course Light says fuck it because he's not willing to give a second of his life away when it could be used killing criminals! Someone's gotta put those pot smokers in the dirt.

- Watari handing out aliases and Batman belts. The idea of Matsuda as a superhero is hilarious to me. Oh god and he's already getting shit on for having a good time, that poor little retarded boy :(

- We're at the halfway mark, if you're still reading my commentary I'm sorry there's nothing of substance here.

- One of the many strengths of this show is the placement of music in tense situations or situations where Light is trying to outsmart an opponent.

- "I'm on the task force I swear, I work for K... I mean L and we do lots of police stuff and believe that killing is wrong sometimes." God Light is such a great liar.

- "You remind me of L, there's something about you that's just like him." Yes they both enjoy talking to themselves very much.

- Uh oh a real member of the task force is nearby, what are you gonna do Lord Yagami? 

- When the background is all red and Ryuk is laughing maniacally I was legitimately creeped out the first time I watched, they just capture the atmosphere so well.

- NOOOOOO DONT GIVE HIM YOUR DRIVERS LICENSE NAOMI!!! FUCK FUCK FUCK.

- "Why do you keep checking your watch?" "I guess it's because I'm Kira." You smug smug asshole god dammit. I want to hate you, but you're so cool sometimes.

- "What's the matter?" The way he says this is so condescending I just wanna smack this kid. So long Naomi Missora, the greatest female character that Death Note ever knew.

Well this episode is always rage inducing for me since I really liked Naomi and Light turned up the smug prick meter as high as it could possibly go. Honestly I can't think of many more episodes where I hate him as much as this, but I'm sure I'm forgetting things. See you all tomorrow!

But I will hold my comment about the opening back for a later thread.

>Seriously just go take some classes on proper social skills ya little hunchback.

No he doesn't need that, he is perfect how he is. He doesn't need to conform to social standards, because he has the style and money

>\#naomibestgirl

[Death Note](/s "Well not difficult considering that we have only worst girl, Mrs only appear in the later episode after first introduction, and only to here to be cute and imouto Sayu, as the rest of the female cast"), But yes Naomi still was great on her own. If only she had a better taste in men.


>NOOOOOO DONT GIVE HIM YOUR DRIVERS LICENSE NAOMI!!! FUCK FUCK FUCK.

What would I give for an alternate scene where she had a fake license just to because she knew already who Kira is because Raye had a file about him lying around and she did all that just to taunt Kira back, and Light still would've done the whole "I guess it's because I'm Kira", and she would just make a smug face and say "Well but I'm not Naomi Missora, brb calling the police bye". Or something along those lines.


>You smug smug asshole god dammit.

It's infuriating but so glorious at the same time so that I never know if I should grin like a maniac or be sad for poor Naomi.

You should watch Red Garden.

It's one of the few times I've ever seen him actually stand on the ground and not just float above it.

> I want to hate you, but you're so cool sometimes.

Light is like the anime version of Gaston. You just love to hate his manipulative ass.

> The way he says this is so condescending I just wanna smack this kid.

I always wonder if the real Naomi is fighting inside, internally screaming while her body forces her to walk off and commit suicide.

> Honestly I can't think of many more episodes where I hate him as much as this, but I'm sure I'm forgetting things. See you all tomorrow!

Really wish /u/Neawia was here for this episode. This is really the one where people decide whether they root for Light or not, and considering that so far he's been pretty forgiving of him, I would like to see what his opinion of him is now.

Noooo Naomi

I'm officialy on team L after this, Light really is so arrogant/awful. I think he is a great character I just don't particularly like him right now. Also, it's so difficult to not open the next episode right now, heh.

Oh, that wasn't a compliment. Light isn't supposed to be likable. In the sub, that scene literally made me see red and want to throw something at the screen. Here it's almost as if Light made a mistake and is regretting his decision. That's why he seems likable.
>> ARTICLE
> In the sub, that scene literally made me see red and want to throw something at the screen.

It still utterly infuriated me in the dub.
>> ARTICLE
And this. This is where I jumped off of Team Light the first time. 

You know, I had no idea how early in the series this was, kinda crazy how flawed old memories can be. Also, I've been finding that there are a lot of little things in the show that I'm appreciating more, subtle differences in how the lines around eyes are drawn, or how certain musical themes aren't quite reaching their climaxes, but getting closer and closer every episode (the music thing really impresses me).

Anyway - about this heartbreaking betrayal of humanity by Light. This is way sadder than I ever thought - here we have a man (Penber) who can go to neither heaven nor hell because Light tricked him into writing names in the Death Note. Now we have a widow who's not only tricked into committing suicide, but had every last bit of hope drained from her soul in her last moments. The utter despair she must have felt before the Death Note took over her actions (and whatever she felt when she was compelled to kill herself)...sigh. And to top it all off - she's not even going to meet Raye in the afterlife because he can't go to heaven or hell. Jesus...this is rough.

On a happier note - who else loves Ryuk's laugh? haha Man, he's been loving this.
>> ARTICLE

[Manga](/n "I mean, it's not like he would have gone to either anyway. There is no afterlife in the Death Note universe. You're either reborn as a Shinigami, or you're gone.")

Man, I really have to get around to reading the manga. I have trouble reading manga for some reason, but I think I'll have to give Death Note a shot. There's a lot of implications in that sentence for my head-canon.

This is my first time watching and I'm really surprised people actually root for Light. I knew he was a prick the first time I saw him. His demeanor, the condescending way he looked at everyone and everything. But when he claimed himself god, I knew he was the worst person to get their hands on the Note.
>> ARTICLE
I have liked Light's character from the beginning to the end.

I'm not all for killing people left and right, but the way he tricks people and gets them on his side is really amazing to me. I like the fact that he analyzes everything and predicts every single move of the people he is talking with, then he manipulates them into doing what he wants.

 This episode is my favorite, because when I watched it the first time, the tension I felt when they were walking towards the police station was insane. I had never felt tension like this from any other form of media.

 When Ryuuk laughed after she gave Light her fake name, I couldn't be any more hooked than I was. When he finally convinced her to give him her ID, my jaw literally dropped. I was speechless as to how he did it so swiftly. 

And then the combination of Ryuuk's evil laugh, Light's smug and the soundtrack to top it off... This has to be one of the greatest episodes in anime in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, it's not really that amazing tbh. I've mentioned this several times before too, but Light only seems smart because everyone else is stupider than a bundle of sticks. They don't act like real people. All these characters were written for the sole purpose of being manipulated by Light.

And not only that, but the entire universe is written to play out in his favor too. Just take this episode for example. How convenient it was for Light run into Naomi at the police station. And how convenient it was for Light not to smugly declare himself Kira the first time.

I'm also really surprised you think convincing Naomi to give her ID went swiftly. That whole scene seemed so forced. Forget a former FBI detective, any normal person would have alarms going off in their head with the way Kira was acting; desperate and almost stalkerish. But Naomi, so cautious and even though she noticed Light kept looking at his watch, yet completely oblivious of this fact.


In the end, it's not really well written when you think about it, although I'll concede with your point that the show does a great job of hooking viewers. It's a lot like SAO in that regard. As for a show that does the whole genius manipulator thing right, you have Code Geass and Monster.
>> ARTICLE
What a beautiful episode, the desaturated colours and the music made for a fantastic and powerful presentation.

Although all that happened for the most part was people talking or walking and talking it flowed well. The tension built dipped and built again to the climax and another victory for Light.

Oh, and how well did Light play her. You could almost see Light shake with anger at failing to kill her the first time around. He almost made a rash choice but cooled down and went to work. She did well but fell for a good ploy and is now walking to her grave. Did we need the noose at the end? It felt a tad bit heavy handed in a other wise sublime episode.

Not much on L's half today but we get Q... I mean Watari to hand out gadgets to the gang. L's team is equipped but it seem like they have a touch fight ahead of them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Ryuk's reaction is the same as mine here, too funny how smug Kira is while having the wrong name.

> I have to admit, I'd really love to see how she dies.

Nope still he is still a good guy. Don't see how anyone could call him evil

Well you have the wrong name sucker! Not everyone is a stupid gullible FBI agent, Kira. Also isn't it a bit suspicious that he still follows her?

Woah Kira what kind of language your using, suddenly he's using slang in the German dub, words like "Die Alte", something equivalent in English could be "the broad", not as profane as bitch but still offensive.

I love how Kira is basically in panic mode, he's grabbing straws right and left, also how he doesn't think of turning off his phone immediately shows that he has too many thoughts crossing his mind at the same time. He even is considering to attack her physically. Man he is so close of being busted.

And he just called her stupid cow in his mind, man he really lost all his cool.

> Our names and ranks are false.
> Why did you give us fake IDs?

Man how dense can someone be?

Love how L is talking to those detective like someone who talks to kids, because they proven that they're not smart enough to do the logical thing without someone telling them.


Man Light is really talented at improvising bullshit. Also almost everything he's talking about is actually true.

Damn Naomi you really let Light sweat here, he almost had you but you're still doing the right thing.

This whole episode is so fucking tense in my opinion. Time is almost up.

Damnit, No Naomi don't listen to him!

Ryuk you just have to much fun.

How much luck can someone have? Fuck you Kira.

And again he shows his biggest weakness, his arrogance, he taunts Naomi with revealing that he's Kira, if she would've handed him a fake ID or something he would be in big trouble now.

What a fucking smug ass.

---

After episode thoughts:

Yes it is still my favourite episode, tense to the last minute, and also so close to ending the show prematurely. If not for Light's talent to improvise a believable story. Man I really feel sorry for Naomi. That realisation just before the Death Note takes control over her.

Rules for humans:

1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.
9. The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.
10. The person in possession of the Death Note is possessed by a god of death, its original owner, until they die.
11. If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.
12. The cause of death must still be in realm of possibility for the victim.
13. It's possible to write down the cause of death first and add the name later.
14. If a human uses the note, a god of death usually appears in front of him/her within 39 days after he/she uses the note.

Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1. The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.
2. Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.
3. Gods of Death, the original owners of the Death Note, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note.

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. What kind of cool spy equipment would you like to have?

2. What does the scouter say about Light's smugness level?

3. No third question for today sorry.

Huh. That's interesting. He just refers to her as 'this woman' in English and Japanese. I mean he could be calling her something else in Japanese, but I only recall hearing onna, which means woman. German dub going in on 'em.

> Fuck you Kira.

Preach.
>> ARTICLE
I think being so rude in his mind shows perfectly how dire the situation is right now. He just lost all his cool and has probably difficulties to hide his anger right  now. Like "how dares she being all intelligent and stuff and not being a mindless sheep like the rest I've killed until now."
>> ARTICLE
That's true. Tfw the story has more or less depth depending on the language it's in.

It's been years since I first watched this so watching Light think up how to get Naomi's real name out of her is quite interesting. Pretending to be on the task force is a good one.

"Two years ago in america, I worked on a case under L."

For anyone who doesn't know this premise was turned into an actual book called Death Note Another Note. Not real long but a good read.

This is one of my favorite episodes. The steps Light goes through to learn Naomi's real name are great and shows just how clever he is. It's a little sad though. The despair that comes over Naomi's face is hard to watch.

She really started to trust Light, only for things to get smashed into oblivion.

Oh shit, you guys are doing a rewatch? Awesome, I've been waiting for an excuse to finally watch this show. I watched the first episode, but something about it just didn't really grab me I guess. It's like, I knew it would probably be a good show and I would enjoy it, but for whatever reason I just wasn't feeling it that day. 

I'm in the mood for it now though. I love being part of discussions like these. So I think I'll spend the night catching up to you guys before I go to bed.

I thought the same about episode 1, episode 2 however hooked me on it, really enjoying it a lot so far.

The biggest thing for me at the time was that I just wasn't in the mood to deal with how much of an edge lord the MC was. I'm kind of looking forward to it now though. I still hate him (I just don't like those types of characters), but that usually doesn't affect my views on the shows I watch that much. 

I'm excited to watch a show where I don't want the MC to "win". In fact, I'm hoping that he falls on his face really hard and realizes how much of a giant smug hypocrite he actually is (don't spoil if that happens or not though, lol). 

I don't know if my opinion is the minority or not, but I really am rooting against this fucker. Either way though I think it will be a good show. 

BRB, starting the first episode now.

Oh man, this episode! *So tense!*

I really love this episode, I think it's one of the best Death Note episodes out there, and the only one that gave a strong impression.  
I remember my experience when I watched it. I was watching from my laptop while lying in my bed, before sleep. Dim lights, earphones ready. I just couldn't get distracted while I was watching this episode. It was very suspenseful - oh no, she gave him the fake name, what is Light going to do, he is losing his cool etc. All these thoughts while I was watching it. Not even my cat, who usually would jump around on me and walk on my keyboard, just sat there, patiently. Probably the most heartbreaking moment was when an actual task force agent passes by them, right before he opens his umbrella to block his vision. [Death Note slight future spoilers](/s "He would've recognized Light, because he helped them solve cases before.")  

And, with this re-watch, I just noticed something. While all this is happening, Ryuk is just having a time of his life. Well, so did I actually, when I first saw it. Wonderful episode!
>> ARTICLE
> oh no, she gave him the fake name, what is Light going to do, he is losing his cool etc. 

Wait, you were actually rooting for Light? I was hoping Naomi would roast him alive. And the ending almost made me throw my keyboard across the room.

Also, your spoiler isn't really a spoiler. He actually specifically mentions that several times this episode to convince Naomi of his being on the task force.
>> ARTICLE
Did that came off as if I was rooting for him? I wasn't really, it's just how I was thinking "so what's he going to do about it".

As for the spoiler..... can't be too careful. And I don't remember finer details myself to be sure if it's relevant or not, but I think it comes up later in better detail.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely the best episode of the series. I don't need to explain why other than the fact that everyone needs to see the ending.
>> ARTICLE
I almost screamed out of frustration at the end of this episode. *So close* but so damn far. I'm hoping against all hope that Naomi comes back. She has that amazing shot in the OP (sitting on a throne with Penber's body) so it feels like she is/was destined for more.

This episode was an amazing, incredibly tense ride. I left the episode hating Light but also very impressed by his acumen.

Geez, Ryuk, you said you didnt want to help him out, but you completely gave it away by laughing! She was on the verge of finding him out even without Ls help. Oh well, its not just the lawful good protagonists who get luck on their side in a pinch.

Well played Light. Dude is a genius, give him his props. I probably would have taken the eye deal just for ryuuk to stop laughing

He's only genius because everyone else is stupid as nails.
>> ARTICLE
I don't completely agree with this statement but there are a lot of moments where this is the case.

I was thinking about it as I was watching today. It's super annoying to me that a lot of the time, instead of just having Light's intelligence show through his actions, they make most everyone else a moron so he seems super, extra smart. Like, he could've seemed super, extra smart if they just wrote it that way. I wouldn't go so far to say that his intelligence is an informed ability, but the writing treated it as such sometimes.

Not doing the re-watch but I thought I would drop by for ep 7. It's like showing people game of thrones for the first time. Enjoy.

Isn't it great how Light conveniently didn't reveal that the first time around. Seriously, Light, you need to chill with the sadism.

I love this episode because seeing Light sweat is hilarious, but my precious bby Naomi T_T_T.

I've never really read the translated lyrics of Alumina, but it's subbed where I'm watching it and I can't but wonder if Nightmare was commissioned to write these songs because the lyrics are word for word perfect for describing Light. I know they weren't and that this song is on an actual record of theirs, but still.
>> ARTICLE

Im a little surprised shes so trusting of Light. I mean, she was an FBI agent. Just because hes the police chiefs son shouldnt make her spill her plan to a teenager. It was interesting to learn though that Light has helped solve cases in the past. Perhaps thats why shes trusting.

[THE best laughs.](http://puu.sh/nAD5S.webm)

[Seriously.](http://puu.sh/nAD8v.webm)

[Ls cell phone is blue.](http://i.imgur.com/XPoQ9YC.png)

Surprise! Its not her real name, Light. Ryuks been laughing his ass off at how dumb youve been.

[More laughing.](http://puu.sh/nAD9p.webm)

Shes a woman, after all. I suppose if I had to I could use force. Geez, Light.

Matsuda! Fuck the haters. Live it up. Youre a spy.

[Close up of Light.](http://i.imgur.com/b5CcSOI.png)

This is good stuff, Light. Keep talking. What else can you come up with?

[Seriously though, I cannot keep making these.](http://puu.sh/nADb9.webm)

Oh ~~Light~~ god, whats gonna happen? The other detective is moving back towards the headquarters and Light/Mrs. Penber. Plus the music playing.

[Ok. One more. Probably the best one.](http://puu.sh/nADce.webm) Plus creepy walking on the ground. Hes just laughing at how stupid she is to believe Light. Its just amazing.

So shes going to die, but this other detective is going to eventually remember seeing Light stand next to her.

Oh, man. The silence. The near black and white colors. The fucking arrogance. Naomi. Now the music kicks in. The steps. Wow. What a good ending to the episode.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

First things first. Ryuks laughs. They are perfect. Thank you, Brian Drummond.

I honestly thought it wouldve taken Naomi more time to figure out who Kira might be. I wasnt expecting her to die so soon. I think she was a little too trusting of Light, which was obviously her downfall. Damn though did he play her.

It sucks because she was forced into this situation because of Light. Raye was much more innocent than Naomi. He hadnt done shit to deserve death. Thats not to say Naomi deserved death. From Lights perspective though, she needed to go. She has come the closest anyone ever has to figuring out who he was. Ls task force wouldve had no trouble identifying Kira if Naomi had brought them her theory.

Sad to see her go. She couldve been cool to have around a while longer. Im assuming Lights going to have to kill more people like this to keep his identity secret. It probably wont be as easy to get all of their identities either.

Perhaps the one detective who just walked passed Light and Naomi will become a threat to Light. Light might have to ask his father who the others working on the task force are. If his father tells him because he thinks he can trust him, he might end up realizing the only person he revealed the names to was Light. That could cause a rift between father and son. Light might have to kill his own father.

Alternatively, it would be interesting to have Lights father bring him in as an addition to the task force. Light and L are going to have to meet somehow. I think Light could lie his way around Ls one-on-one talks, but hed still have trouble finding out what Ls real name is.

And of course, I still cant write off the fact that someone, somewhere has a different Death Note or other Shinigami object.

>I honestly thought it wouldve taken Naomi more time to figure out who Kira might be. I wasnt expecting her to die so soon.

I totally agree. Funny fact that's been pointed out to me is that the writers wanted her around a lot longer too. Unfortunately, he wrote her (or, she wrote herself if I remember his words correctly) into a corner since she was so good at her job and had access to too much info. In order to keep the story going, he had to write her out pretty quickly which is probably why:

>Im a little surprised shes so trusting of Light. I mean, she was an FBI agent. Just because hes the police chiefs son shouldnt make her spill her plan to a teenager.

At least, that's my out-of-show theory.
>> ARTICLE
> At least, that's my out-of-show theory.

Yeah, I suppose that all makes sense. I guess because she was able to figure everything out so fast, she had to go. Had she spoken with the task force or L, Light would be screwed. They had to bend reality a bit and make her extra trusting.

Oh well. I liked her, but it makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so happy that I can finally read your thoughts on my favourite two episodes of this show.

Interesting that you still defend Kiras actions.

>So shes going to die, but this other detective is going to eventually remember seeing Light stand next to her.

He doesn't notice Light because his umbrella blocks the view. It was just there to again show what a lucky motherfucker Light is.
>> ARTICLE
> Interesting that you still defend Kiras actions.

[Yes. Interesting.](http://gfycat.com/BelovedBossyArieltoucan)

I can't say Light's been particularly smart about the whole Death Note thing. I know he wants everyone to know that there's someone bringing justice to the world, but he still makes a bunch of avoidable mistakes.

At it's core, his ideal of weeding out criminals isn't a bad one. Still, however smart he may be, he's still a high schooler, and high schoolers are dumb. So we're seeing someone who is impatient and thinks too highly of himself trying to carry out a plan to become god.

It really irks me that Light's so impatient. He went to town on the Death Note when he first got it. Like, damn. Take a fucking breather. You have the rest of your life to use the book. It's fine if you want people to know there's a 'god' but make sure that you cover your tracks, at least regarding the people who are trying to find you.

> He doesn't notice Light because his umbrella blocks the view. It was just there to again show what a lucky motherfucker Light is.

Ok. Well, I know the detective wasn't shown explicitly noticing Light or Naomi. I thought maybe he could recall seeing Naomi. "Oh! I saw her recently... where was it again?" He realizes it was near the police station. Then the receptionist notes that Light was seen walking away with Naomi. Maybe they're suspicious of Light, and then they use that piece of info to look more into it. Something like that.

**semi quick edit**

There was also a user who slightly hyped up this episode a few threads ago. They kindly removed their comment soon after, but I was aware something was going to happen this episode. So my reactions weren't 100% pure. Once I knew the episode was a favorite among fans, I could tell which way things were going to turn out by the end.

That's terrible. I've been an active member of three rewatches now since CG and they've all be very good about not hyping things up.

They need some rules and etiquette.

Favourite funny clip:[Nichijou:Mio loses it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z30Y572EmCk), tells the tale of closeted yaoi fangirl~

A recap to Deathnote so far, RIP minor characters, and an introduction to two ophans;a blonde and a Killua-lookalike.       
If that guy were Killua, how do you think would Deathnote change?
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou clip. Always good. A classic clip at that. Always funny. Good choice.

If that guy were Killua, I'm pretty sure this show would end pretty quickly. If he's bringing his out of universe powers into the Death Note universe, it's just unfair. He's faster and stronger than literally everyone. Light would have no idea what would be about to happen to him.
>> ARTICLE
Ah yes, the recap, I forgot that this happened. But it isn't that bad, at least it fits to put the recap at this place. They also found a pretty good in-universe reason for the recap, and we got just a bit of the proper episode afterward, which was interesting. More stuff tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I suspect the thread might be a little empty today. I didn't know this show had a recap episode, but at least it was only half of the episode.

Excited to see what happens tomorrow after the time skip. I suspect Light will be in full god mode, and L/Watari's people will aim to stop him.

I'm back, its been 12 days but I've just binged myself back up to date today. Just a small bit of catch up first:

Dear God is the new op bad,that makes it 0 out of 2 for me. I love me some metal but I can't stand that kind of stuff and I don't even think it fits with the tone of the show. 

My second thing is also music related, at the end of last episode and at some other times there was some music I think I recognised. Or something that sounds similar. At L's last moments I think they used [Tubular Bells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0leQaU-8si8). Love that music, plus it fit in with the bell thing L has.

On to today:

And we have a catch up episode, well half a episode. Wow so much has happened over the last 25 episodes and they do a good job recapping some of the more important parts.

Light is a master at getting what he wants and the team are just to easy for him. Dose he miss L? Could do but he has work to do and a new world order to start.

And we get a fantastic montage like sequence where Light sweeps all the mess from the last arc under the carpet. So many characters die, most with not much fan-fair but his desire to kill criminals is still strong and he takes down so many.

Then we get more cuts and time moves on Light replaces L and the world starts to shift.

But in a quiet English? orphanage two kids learn of L's demise. Now we are just getting started.

Yeah, I always skipped opening 2 (though in a way it kinda does fit with season 2's tone imo).  It really hurts my ears honestly.  I don't understand why people like it so much  :I
Just my opinion though.

My sweet bby L  T_T_T_T

I wonder why the Death Note is referred to as shi no nooto as opposed to desu noto.

Fucking cleaning house, aren't you, Light? 

How did no one make the connection between Light joining the police force and he Kira murders. Like I get that we all want to pretend that L was just spinning his wheels and that the only reason he thought Light was Kira is because he had no idea who it really could be, but in the beginning, we knew that Kira had to have access to police files. Now Light become Kira and the death increase exponentially. Come on, guys.

I don't remember where my little card is that has L's real name on it. I'm hoping it's in my copy of the Los Angeles BB Murder Case novel.

> Besides Light, who would you choose to take over as L and Watari?

Not Light, that's for sure. But, currently there's no one else who's smart enough. Light has all the ~~trapezoids~~ little dots* of smartness.

Good, you're back. Been missing you for a few days. Cheating on us with the Devil Is A Part-Timer! threads? Just kidding.

Hmmm, I guess it's possible that other people should suspect Light. Maybe if he was in charge of the entire police force since the police don't seem to want to oppose Kira. But still, I guess it would depend on how dedicated to the Kira investigation Light still is. I mean, if he was all, "Yeah, guys. Let's pack it in. We can't catch Kira." "Light, it's only been one day. We can't give up!" "Listen, man, I'm L. I know. I know we can't catch Kira. Let's go home." Yeah, then everyone should suspect Light.

Last time I checked there were about 15 going on right now. That's way too many, imo. I agree. So. Many.

I also agree that the task force crew should've noticed something. At some point they should've became suspicious just out of curiosity, out of respect for L. I know they were all convinced that Light was innocent, but c'mon.

I get why Soichiro wouldn't but the rest of them need to take a step back an be objective. It's not like Light is one of the most important people in their lives. He's just some dude who's dad happens to be this one guy.

FOUR!?! Impressive.

Yes, Soichiro wouldn't suspect Light. I agree with you that the others should've. Still, the way things have played out they all seem to respect Light. He's a genius, he's smarter than they are even though he's younger. Kid's barely in college and L wanted him to be his successor. Plus, they all felt terrible for him when he was locked up for 50 days. They think Light's proven himself multiple times to not be Kira. *At some point though* they definitely should've reevaluated Light being Kira, especially with L being so sure the entire time that Light was Kira.

 *shi no nooto* means Death Note. In American culture, sometimes we translate titles into English instead of saying their names in their original language. They're doing the same thing here.

>> ARTICLE
At first I just thought this episode was a recap episode...and it is, but it's also more than that. My roommate noticed that it's retelling the episode from L's perspective (which matches the story written out as the legacy he's leaving behind), but there was also at least one thing introduced during that flashback that I don't remember seeing in the show. It's that Mogi was sent to follow Light right around the time that he was getting involved with Misa. What this means is that there was actually a reason for them to investigate Misa's apartment and that whole random matching of forensic evidence found on the tapes to Misa makes more sense now. They weren't just randomly deciding to investigate her out of all the people in Japan.

And what's up with the Twin Towers still being there in the Death Note world? Does it mean something? Because in both the manga and anime timelines, the towers would have been demolished long before Light got his hands on the Death Note to start building his new world, so that's not it. I dunno, that last shot seemed significant to me.

/u/Neawia's Discussion Topics

>1\. Besides Light, who would you choose to take over as L and Watari?

In the context of the show? No one really. There aren't any people there who have the deductive capacity to take over. Might as well make it Matsuda since he's shown aptitude for playing characters and everyone working together could solve the crimes I guess. He'd basically be a mouthpiece. Heh...Matsuda as Watari and L...that's a funny picture.

2\.We could all use some cheering up, right? Post a funny clip from your favorite comedy anime.

Oh! Good find! I didn't notice that.

> And what's up with the Twin Towers still being there in the Death Note world?

Yeah, that was weird now that you mention it. *Maybe* we'll get an answer during the rest of the show or maybe it's just a slightly alternate world (since there's Shinigami and stuff).

> Heh...Matsuda as Watari and L...that's a funny picture.

Ha, if we had to choose someone I suppose I'd also choose Matsuda. He's young and could be molded into a better detective with help from Soichiro and other detectives. Maybe Soichiro could be Watari.

Prison School is probably the anime that made me laugh out loud the most out of any I've seen XD And, for some reason, I showed my dad a clip and we ended up watching the whole thing together which probably should have been awkward, but it was too hilarious and didn't leave any room for awkwardness.

Day 26 - You now know my cake day. Been a whole year already since I joined all you crazy animals. Been tons of fun.

So what is this, a recap of sorts? Hopefully just for a short bit of the episode, and not the whole thing.

Honestly, after seeing these clips again and getting nearly one month of episodes thrown back in my face, I do like L a lot more. Not that I ever hated him, but I was definitely a bit more on Lights side. L is interesting though because he doesnt have any powers. Hes just highly intelligent. And yet in the end, he really didnt have a way to protect himself. So just to see someone like that die so easily, and fall out of his chair and slip away without saying anything, its rough.

Light has also made some huge mistakes. I dont care if he wanted people to know there was someone handing out justice. He still made poor choices. Up till now, he hasnt really done anything to actually change the world. He hasnt killed enough people to make much of a difference. So it actually kind of hurts to see Light win. He absolutely needs to step shit up from here on out or it will be hard to fully be on his side by the end.

Basically, the ends justify the means. Light needs to make sure his endgame actually accomplishes something. Otherwise, this will have been a huge waste.

Thankfully, not entirely a recap episode.

Its damn cool that Light will take over as both L and Watari though.

[Light up close.](http://i.imgur.com/LyXKh0Y.png) Bright picture, we can see his face, and his eyes are brown.

Light is going to town on the Death Note. Likes hes conducting a symphony. Oh, snap. Hes killing the thief and the con man. No. :( Hes dead in front of his kid. Yotsubas are gonna go or just the one? All of them. Goodbye.

Time skip? Lights 23 years old now? Kira is equally loved and hated. Theres nothing the world can do.

Oh, yes! A countdown! To what?

What? Who were those people?

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Ok, Light is still losing his humanity, killing without thinking twice, even if Wedy and Aiber were technically criminals.

Ls almost completely gone from the show now. Really weird to not have him around anymore.

As far as predictions go. Im thinking that perhaps L was raised by Wataris family or perhaps an organization or orphanage that brings out the best in bright, young children. Oh wait, and they said Watari used his money to establish orphanages, right? Ok so maybe they gave him the skills he needed to eventually become a detective. Now that L is dead, theyre going to be pissed off and seeking revenge.

Curious as to why it took the countdown timer 4-5 years to send the message that L is dead.

Thanks! And your gif game's on point, as always.

Look, I'll say this. When the series started, yes, I was on Light's side. Still am, for now. However, as you read in my comment, Light hasn't actually done much to make his utopian world a reality. At this point, he just looks like psychopathic murderer pushing his personal agenda. The new world isn't looking great.

I promise, if Light pulls some kind of shit to better himself instead of the world, I won't be on his side come the end of the show. He had an honorable dream, but he's barely made good on it. We'll see what happens after this little time skip.

What exactly do you want to see from Light to make this all of this justified? The world to be filled with sweet smelling flowers and dancers in the street?

Flowers and dancers would be nice.

Honestly, a world with minimal crime would be nice. One where people barely fear for their lives (save for accidents). The more I think about it though, Light becoming a god isn't the greatest thing for the new world. To have everyone bow before just one person isn't going to be a good thing.

Agreed. Which is why he is a major asshole, and will stay that way unless he can actually manage to do something worthwhile for the world. Killing criminals is one thing, but Light's gonna find it ain't easy being a god. There are gonna be problems.

Blondie and Killua-lookalike were still kids when L died, the timer is probably set for their 18th birthday.

And maybe I'm a little confused, did the timer go off before or after the time skip?

If the timer is set for their 18th birthday, was it set to go off regardless if L had died or not, or did it only activate because L died? And why 18? I guess maybe they'll answer that in a later episode.

I was talking about this with one of my roommates tonight as well. At first we were confused, but we ended up deciding they just played out those events out of order to make a cliffhanger like you said. This was confirmed by a manga timeline we looked up (which I recommend you don't for the sake of spoilers XD).

I will absolutely not look things up from the manga. Don't want mores spoilers than I already have. So thanks for looking that up and confirming it.

So, recap episode. Ok. At least the reasoning is that this is L's report on the investigation. But, why leave it to the team that already knows all of this? Could he have done this for someone else?

My mother was like *Why is he killing them* during his killing spree. I think it is probably because he, as Kira, saw them as criminals, so they had to be punished. He wasn't like L in the sense that he didn't form any emotional attachments with them.

Not much to comment on today besides that. Except for that time skip. Normally I don't like them, but here it is pretty clear that it is supposed to tell us that, since L died, they have made no progress in the investigation.
>> ARTICLE
Cake day for you too! Nice.

I think this time skip could be alright. I don't personally mind them, but here it makes sense since we need/want to see the world that Light is going to create. It'd take too long for that to happen without a time skip.

Ok I'm convinced now, Mikami has some kind of brain damage, always saying DELETE while writing. He should get himself checked

Hmm was wondering the Death Note is now used for 5 years, and it is still not run out of pages, could it be that this thing has endless pages? Because it looks like it's really small and has not more than 100 pages or so.


And Near figured out who 4th Kira is. (Seriously X-Kira? Stupid name) Well that was easy...

> No, there is a very high probability that Mikami is X-Kira.

Let me guess the very high amount of 10% or even 15%?

If Misa had her memories (and a Death Note), Takada would be so dead right now.

New (Shinigami) rules:

46\. In the event that there are more than 6 Death Notes in the human world, only the first 6 Death Notes that have been delivered to humans will have effect.  

47\. The seventh Death Note will not become active until one of the other 6 Death Notes is burned up or a god of death takes on of them back to the world of gods of death

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:


1. Misa or Takada? Who would win in a real catfight?

2. We know what Mikami's favourite word is, but what is yours?

3. Misa tries herself at singing at the moment, who is your favourite idol? (Either 2D or 3D)

---

/u/Neawia's questions:

>During your first time watching this episode, did you think Kiyomi was going to take the initiative and kill Misa?

No I didn't think that...

>What is your favorite holiday season/time of the year?

I don't really have a favourite, but I like christmas (only the day not the whole time around it). 
>> ARTICLE
>1\. Misa or Takada? Who would win in a real catfight?

Takada. I mean, Misa is smaller, and much much dumber. Although maybe if I knew her in real life I could attribute more to Misa's scrappiness, especially if I'd seen her start fights before. Takada doesn't look like someone who's ever been in a fight. 

>2\. We know what Mikami's favourite word is, but what is yours?

I love so many...I honestly can't decide. I legitimately get an email every day from Dictionary.com with a word of the day and save them all, some of which get added to my favourites if I love them enough. Ninnyhammer, kenspeckle, factotum...I've probably got over 100 favourited by now. The word I use the most though is "eh" like a stereotypical Canadian. I tack it on to the end of questions that I expect people to agree with like "Man, Misa is the worst eh?". I suppose it could be roughly translated to "isn't he/she/it/etc.?"

>3\. Misa tries herself at singing at the moment, who is your favourite idol? (Either 2D or 3D)

My mind has blanked on this one. Last question I had too many, this one I don't have enough XD
>> ARTICLE
> Mochi has the power to change his eyebrows in seconds

Maybe he just has crazy eyebrows like Frank Dillane.

> Misa or Takada? Who would win in a real catfight?

Takada seems too prim to win a fight. Misa's so crazy about Light that she would crush all who stand in her way, that poor, stupid girl.

> We know what Mikami's favourite word is, but what is yours?

I don't know if I had a favorite word but just today I was remarking on how much I like the word [verkakte](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/verkakte).

Ha. Very close to the German word "verkackt", colloquial for "botched". While having the German word for poop as the root word. 

*reading further to adjective* well shitty is also a close translation...

I didn't know there was a German word close to it. I also learned that schmuck can be German, too. Weird.

I thought maybe it was you who mentioned this early on in the series. Guess not. Maybe it was that-one-guy (who is permabanned now fyi). Well, someone said that the Death Note has unlimited pages in the book. You can write on/tear out as many as you want, but there will always be more. Seems weird since the notebook always stays the same size. Whatever. Shinigami magic.

> Misa or Takada? Who would win in a real catfight?

Tough question. I'm gonna go with Misa. I think she's a little wilder and scrappier. Kiyomi would put up a fight, but just wouldn't be crazy enough to finish Misa off.

> We know what Mikami's favourite word is, but what is yours?

Favorite word, huh? I have no idea. Maybe 'miscellaneous'. Long, fun to say, interesting spelling, cool meaning.

Nice mine is "hipopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia" or in short the fear of long words... But you probably wanna know a German one. For that I need a bit more of thinking. Probably "Schweinebacke" because it is such a nonsensical insult and just sounds so funny.

Most definitely. Everyone needs to continue it. Even if they haven't started it. Just continue.

Basically the latter, but it's mostly known in Germany as the insult Bruce Willis is saying in the Die Hard movies. I mean he says ["Yippy aye yay Schweinebacke"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YMyM3diusU) instead of motherfucker...

Maybe whenever a new page is created at the end, the first page is _deleted_. Mikami has noticed this, thought it would be a brilliant inside joke, and started saying "DELETE!" all the time.

I bet Misa. While neither of them would be particularly good, Misa could probably take a hit a bit better than Takada

That's nothing compared to Misa, who had facial surgery between cuts while drinking wine.

Takada, because she has pages from the Death Note. Ignoring that, probably Misa. Takada has the height and probably strength advantage but I feel like Misa is a tad more crazy and won't hold back at all.

Not a lot happened this episode. Kyomi grows a bit of a personality today, which usually would be a good thing except her personality is trash. Misa is less likeable than last episode. N gets closer to finishing the game, and LKira lays an interesting trap.

I don't have a real comment prepared for today. I didn't find a lot to comment about and also just didn't really feel like it today. Sorry :/

Yeah, he actually does look like he could be a slightly older Raye Penber.

You mean loving Light/Kira and doing what he says doesn't constitute having a personality?

She seemed like she really wanted to, especially after her little laugh before she left. I guess she didn't want to do something like that in front of her guard.
>> ARTICLE
The scene with Misa/Kiyomi was interesting and pretty funny. They both left thinking they have "won" but
I don't think Light actually cares for either of them to be honest.

So I take it Mikami is getting caught on purpose here? That was way too obvious.

I'm guessing that was the fake notebook and he sent a picture to Kiyomi who then wrote the guys name.
I guess this might actually throw Near off when the killings continue and they have the note.

Interesting episode but what is Mello doing all this time exactly? We barely see him.

You're right. He did take a picture. I'm assuming of the bully on the train. But how would that help Kiyomi? Did she also take the Shinigami eyes deal? How could she have?

>> ARTICLE
Definitely a slower episode this time. Near challenges Light by moving to Japan while Light gets Mikami to set up a fake notebook to use. The big scenes with Misa and Kiyomi sadly don't do much to progress the story. However, we are getting near the end so I can forgive it in a "calm before the storm" way.

> During your first time watching this episode, did you think Kiyomi was going to take the initiative and kill Misa?

I don't think I did. Kiyomi is generally quite logical and calm so I didn't think she would act in an emotional way that could hurt Light.

> What is your favorite holiday season/time of the year?

Christmas. I don't really get excited about it any more but it looks pretty and gives me a much needed break from working AND I'm not expected to go outside.


Also, I'm not sure if this is happening but were there plans of a live action Death Note rewatch? I seem to remember hearing about it but I don't know what happened or if I made it up.

It's pretty good, well paced, and changes just the right amount of stuff in my opinion. Knowing the plot of the anime/manga will tell you a lot (the basic plot of L vs Kira is obviously still there), but there are many surprises that you won't be able to predict. Definitely worth watching in my opinion. There are a few weird thing (like [slight spoilers](/s "Mello is a ventriloquist dummy")), but I'd say they're all reasonable.

Nears such a child. Its so weird. He cant board a plane on his own, and hes playing with toys on the plane.

Why would Light (as L) just outright admit that hes personally investigating Kiyomi? Near just said hes in Japan so hes probably watching Kiyomi himself. If Light is seen with Kiyomi then Near can make the assumption that Light is L since Light also has a background in police work. I know Near already believes Light to be L (and Kira), but Light doesnt know this.

Lego mini figures! Good choice in toys. You need more actual legos though.

[Near up close.](http://i.imgur.com/a0AKcIq.png)

Yep, theres the one extreme side of the original L. Near is incredibly smart and unwilling to kill people for the sake of his investigation.

Oh, yes. How convenient that they only have audio of the room.

So Light wants Kiyomi to start acting a bit more like Kira. Interesting.

It looks like Light wants to keep mixing up whos using the notebook to kill. Maybe hes going to frame MIkami if he wants him to keep a fake notebook.

I still find it slightly odd that Mikami is this devoted to Kira. He himself had such a strong sense of justice that I thought hed want to be the one calling the shots.

Good guess, Light. /s That chick is on Nears team.

Any person alive is a viable target. Shit just keeps getting more real. Also Kiyomi wants people to teach their kids that Kira is good.

And Near has figured out that Mikami is X-Kira. This is probably working into Lights plan.

[Smug Kiyomi. "Oh look, its that girl who cant satisfy Light."](http://i.imgur.com/74kntgk.png)

Fuck this bitch, Im gonna go kick her.

Ah, Christmastime. Somebodys going to die tonight.

This fight between Misa and Kiyomi is great. Hows your relationship with Light? I know you cant see him that much. Im going to announce my engagement to him at the festival youre MCing.

Stop Lying Kiyomi. Youre gonna kill people.

Kiyomis really infatuated with Light. I do think she is the better fit, but this has happened so fast that it seems like Kiyomis just being a spoiled brat.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Prediction: Near sets up a room where the floor is covered in legos. He sits safely on a chair on the opposite site of the room. He writes his name on a piece of paper and tells Light that if he runs barefoot across the room, he can see the piece of paper. Light somehow manages to get halfway before collapsing in agonizing pain. Kira loses.

I honestly thought that Kiyomi was going to kill Misa. The two seem to have that typical hate for each other since they both love Light. I figured shed just get Misa out of the way.

It still looks like Mikami is going to get caught/framed. He should have both the real Death Note and the fake one he made. Id assume the SPK would confiscate both so whats the point of the fake one? Unless he sent the real Death Note away.

I guess Lights plan is to eventually eliminate Near and then Mello and have Kiyomi be the only other person standing by Kiras side. The God and Goddess of the new world.

(not a spoiler, just speculating based on this episode and past episodes) I'm pretty sure Kiyomi is gonna die the moment Near and Mello are eliminated. Just like the two criminals helping the taskforce died as soon as L did, and like everyone in the task force and everyone at Wammy's House is gonna die once Near and Mello are defeated. Light has spent the last 2 or so years being annoyed at Misa, and I'm certain that once he has eliminated all opposition he's not going to bother with Misa or Kiyomi any more.
>> ARTICLE
That's highly reasonable speculation. I won't be surprised at all if Light does this. He'll need to clean house and kill anyone who has ever suspected him/opposed him as well as anyone who knows his true secret.

A small part of me thinks he'll keep *just* Kiyomi around. She's a better fit for him than Misa, and if he can convince her to take the eyes deal somehow, then she'll be of use to him. Plus, someone needs to be the voice of Kira. Also, Light will need to release stress from time to time. Kiyomi will do *anything* Kira asks.

Haha Near's never been on a plane before. To be fair though the only time I've been on a plane was for a student exchange my class did when I was in grade 6.

Mikami literally says "Sakujo" for every name he writes.

I find it odd that only the first 6 death notes will work in the human world. What makes more than that amount work in the shinigami world as opposed to the human world?

I love that Near has a Godzilla toy. Legos too.

Ah it's christmas now. There's people going around with notebooks that kill people but christmas is still very important. I wonder if this episode originally aired during christmas. Anime seems to have a thing with christmas episodes airing at random times of the year.

That's right Misa doesn't know Light's Kira anymore because she gave up ownership of her Death Note again. Jokes on her.

Mikami says "Sakujo" even in public. I can't help but think he's made a pretty bad error here. 

Meanwhile Gevanni's like,

"Holy shit Near Mikami's writing in a notebook!"

This would be hilarious. Like she'd bust in on Light and Kiyomi's meetings and 'catch them in the act'. She'd scream, "what are you writing on those notes" and wrangle them from Kyomi. She'd start reading them, and the task for would have all the proof they need.

>1\. During your first time watching this episode, did you think Kiyomi was going to take the initiative and kill Misa?

Nah. I was just under the impression that their little spat was going to cause more problems for Light than it did. It was nice to see a woman NOT tear apart Light's plans for a change, although Misa tried her damnedest.

>2\. What is your favorite holiday season/time of the year?

Early spring when things smell fresh but it's still kind of cool and the bugs haven't come out in force. It also happens to be around Easter which I have fond memories of. Oh, and my birthday. There's just a lot of positives and no negatives past the mud which I don't mind.

L has to stay in shape some how.

And what does the face symbolize? Kind of like chuckling at someone, but about to burst into hysteric laughter because you can't keep it in anymore. You can't believe they said something so dumb.

Basically.

It's actually crazy to see how much the Death Note changed Light, I'm so used to hating him and now he's the most cheerful guy there. He's basically a completely different character at this point, was he really this cheerful before the Death Note? He jumped to killing people super fast after obtaining it.

>> ARTICLE
He jumped into killing people because he was bored and wanted god-like power.  Now that he is working with L, he is fulfilled and mentally stimulated in a different way.
>> ARTICLE
I never thought of it this way. People keep saying he changed and I don't see it. He was always shady. But I guess his boredom made it worse. If he'd had something to keep him preoccupied, he would've stopped being shady.

Damn, kid, just take up sudoku or something.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, OK. It's just he's like polar opposites at the moment, strange to see.
>> ARTICLE
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

That question has been bothering me but awaken's response kind of makes sense, like how extracurricular activities can prevent kids from joining gangs.

Ultimately Light always wanted to do the right thing, his usage of the Note was to create an idealistic world so his sense of justice isn't all that different.
>> ARTICLE
So much security in this building.

Please Matsui stop saying Misa Misa...

Well Aizawa already said it.

As always L is on point with the whole situation. Yes Light and Misa were Kira, but they aren't anymore.


And everyone is picking on poor Matsuda, again.

>Higuchi: Look at all we've done. No one suspects that thing.

Yeah nobody...


So now it's on. The people who really want to catch Kira no matter what need to give up their job.

Matsuda when will you learn to shut your mouth at moment like that.

All this talk from L was just a test at how determined everyone is.

Everyone is picking on poor Matsuda, poor guy is just so useless because of his inexperience.

Man no matter how little the role was that Aizawa played I always liked him, and this end of the episode always gets me a bit. He gave it all but he was not ready to do the next step in this case. Must be really frustrating to give up something where you had risk your life for over half a year.

Rules for humans:



1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.
9. The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.
10. The person in possession of the Death Note is possessed by a god of death, its original owner, until they die.
11. If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.
12. The cause of death must still be in realm of possibility for the victim.
13. You may also write the cause and/or details of death prior to filling in the name of the individual. Be sure to insert the name in front of the written cause of death. You have about 19 days (according to the human calendar) in order to fill in a name.
14. If a human uses the note, a god of death usually appears in front of him/her within 39 days after he/she uses the note.
15. A person can shorten his or her onw life by using the note.
16. One page taken from the Death Note or even  a fragment of the page contains the full effects of the note.

Even after the individual's name, the time of death, and death condition on the Death Note were filled out, the time and condition of death can be altered as many times as you want as lon as it is changed within 6 minutes and 40 second from the time it was filled in. But of course, this is only possible before the victim dies.
24. Whenever you want to change anything written on the Death Note within 6 minutes and 40 seconds after you wrote, you must first rule out the characters you want to erase with two straight lines.
25. The time and condition of death can be changed but once the victim's name has been written the individual's death can never be avoided.
26. If you lose the Death Note or have it stolen you will lose its ownership unless you retrieve it within 490 days.
27. If you have traded the eye power of a god of death, you will lose the eye power as well as the memory of the Death Note, once you lose its ownership. At the same time, the remaining half of your life will not be restored. 
28. You may lend the Death Note to another person while maintaining its ownership. Subletting it to yet another person is possible, too.

Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1. The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.
2. Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.
3. Gods of Death, the original owners of the Death Note, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note.
4. A god of death cannot be killed even if stabbed in his heart with a knife or shot in the head with a gun. However, there are ways to kill a god of death which are not generally known to the gods of death
5. The specific scope of the condition for death is not known to the gods of death, either so, you must examine and find out.

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. What is *one* thing you would like to change in this show?

2. What was/is your favourite thing to do with your family? 

3. On a scale from Matsuda to Chief Yagami. How useful do you think are you at work/in a group project?

/u/Neawia's questions:

>Which character do you feel has contributed the least to the task force so far? Do you wish those who arent L could play a bigger role in solving the case?

Aiber and Wedy, the only thing they did until now was breaking into the building. Did nothing in catching Kira.

>What type of fighting style would you want to learn (if you dont know one already)?

I did a bit of Judo in elementary school, but I pretty much forgot all of it because I stopped a long time ago. 
>> ARTICLE
>1\. What is one thing you would like to change in this show?

Misa. Or her voice actor...but I think the voice actor suits the character...so Misa.

>2\. What was/is your favourite thing to do with your family?

Play video games and watch anime. And eat. And chat. I like lotsa stuff.

>3\. On a scale from Matsuda to Chief Yagami. How useful do you think are you at work/in a group project?

...L or Light. Carry the team to my standards while appreciating the rare person (chief) who contributes meaningfully and accepting the common person (Matsuda) who means well. Hey, they can always make the coffee runs, right? Man, I sound so full of myself :/
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah nobody...

Except a god. ^^^hehe

> All this talk from L was just a test at how determined everyone is.

This was weird to me. He already had them be sure that they'd risk their lives to solve this case. I don't see how losing your job is worse than dying. L also acted strangely during that scene.

> Must be really frustrating to give up something where you had risk your life for over half a year.

And in my opinion, he's just as 'much of a man' as those who stayed on. He knew that he had to quit and take care of his family. Good guy, in the end.

---

> What is one thing you would like to change in this show?

This question could probably use some more thought, but the first thing to comes to mind is a little more focus on the outside world. Kira is a murder who continues to kill criminals, but I don't have any idea who the public feels about this. Could you imagine if this happened in real life. That shit would be all over the news all over the world. I want to know more about what the public is thinking about all of this.

> What was/is your favourite thing to do with your family?

Visit my grandparents house at the beach. Sometimes it was just my immediate family who went, and others the extended family came out too (though it's an overall small family). I have nice memories of doing all sorts of things there.

> On a scale from Matsuda to Chief Yagami. How useful do you think are you at work/in a group project?

I suppose it depends on my interest on the specific project, but probably Chief Yagami, though I'm not sure how useful that actually is... ^^^shots ^^^fired He's the most useful besides Light and L though.

---

> Aiber and Wedy, the only thing they did until now was breaking into the building. Did nothing in catching Kira.

I bet you think you're such a clever guy answering like that.

I think everyone in the task force is admirable person, and Aizawa left because he doesn't trust L anymore, added to the stress of not being with his family.

That's true. I'm not sure I'd care much for L if after all of that he still didn't trust my conviction. I guess with the news of the police abandoning the case, it's a new situation, but still.

Aizawa is just fed up with everything. Ah, but hes having a tough time with his home life. Looks like he still hates that Matsuda is a Misa Misa fan.

Oh ho! No he didnt! Wait. Yes he did! Actually, I find that you dont gain any weight as long as you burn calories by using your brain.

[L, youre a cake-hungry pervert.](http://i.imgur.com/Qj0DFdQ.png) 

Ah, Ls getting closer in stating that Kiras power passes among people. Thats not entirely wrong since there can always be new owners of the Death Note. Im still surprised he hasnt done any research to see if anything like this has happened in the past.

So now theyre just acting like children and beating each other up.
[
HAHAHAHAHA!!!! This guy. Yes? Gets in a fight. Holds phone like a weirdo.](http://puu.sh/nHIiv.webm)  Haha, hes still in a fighting stance.

If someone could trace the deaths back to us, theyd have to be a god heheh.

Eh. A little crazy that the police are caving like this, but whatever. L and Light, buddies till the end. And honestly, the Chief is old. He could make this his last case. Retirement. Wait. Dust off his resume, please.

Watari coming in and undermining L. Ha. Aizawas VA here is really nailing it (dub). Ah, it was another test.

Im amazed that you noticed that, Chief. What the fuck? Its just dates. Literally look at the time of death and you would notice that information.

So you really wanna be useful? Yeah, its about time Matsuda. Then could you get me another cup of coffee? Dont burn yourself.

Oh, a con man and a thief. Interesting additions.

New Light is a boring goody two shoes.

Aw, Aizawa. I was worried for a second that as he leaned forward he was going to have a heart attack. But that wouldnt make sense.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

I have no idea. Nothing new. Same old stuff. L and Light are going to catch Kira. Light will get a Death Note back. Real Kira continues killing. L pursues.

... I should really get my expanded thoughts together already.

----------

> Which character do you feel has contributed the least to the task force so far? Do you wish those who arent L could play a bigger role in solving the case?

The least? Mightve been Aizawa with Matsuda in a close second. I cant remember much that theyve done as L seems to steal the spotlight. I do wish they could help out more, but if they were too competent it would be tough to make L look like a genius.

> What type of fighting style would you want to learn (if you dont know one already)?

[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido). I think it fits me well. Plus Im fairly certain it was what [MC of a nickelodeon show that has similarities to anime] based off of. Its using your opponents attacks against them, and doing your best to not hurt them in the process of defending yourself.

No, he was literally being serious when he said that he burns Calories through brain power. That's the legitimate explanation by the mangaka for how he stays so thin.

And remember he is a former tennis champion.

Quite ironic that now Light is acting more than like L than L is, and he seems to like him more than Misa. For episode titled Ally, L now loses the help of the police, but the Japanese police seemed pretty useless besides Sochiro, Mogi and Afro cop. Poor afro cop choosing to leave the taskforce like this, the ominous spotlight falling at him at the end doesnt help too.

It's okay Matsuda, you're not useless after all. After all your name is the title of the next episode, which also happens to be the season 1 finale of deathnote.

**Discussion Topics**

1. I feel like Mogi hasn't contributed much but they might be because we barely ever see him. He doesn't get a lot of screentime.

Haha Aizawa having trouble with the metal detector.

Since the Lucky Star rewatch wasn't too long back I'm still hearing Konata whenever Misa talks.

You'd think L and Light would get it through their heads that it's hard to fight someone you're chained to.

All this fighting and when Matsuda calls the room L's calmly like, "Hai?"

Poor Matsuda. He's just really enthusiastic about Misa but no one cares.

It's easy to see that quitting his job would be hard for Aizawa who has a family to support.

Aaaah Aizawa's daughter is precious.
>> ARTICLE
Matsuda might seem like he's the obvious answer, since he's the one with the least smarts on the force, but it's actually Light because he's the only one who has been actively detracting the investigation from finding the real Kira and making more Kiras, negative help is worse than zero help! 

Misa had a few wonkily-drawn faces this episode, but she was still cute, especially with the sound she made when she stepped in the cake. Poor Aizawa, it's not right for either L nor the police to jerk him around like that. I'm glad he's back with his family, he can keep them safe without catching Light! Light and L are both really not thinking today, since they didn't even realize smacking each other across the room sent themselves flying too! 

I already am a Shotokan Karate-ka, so does that mean I can't answer the second question?
>> ARTICLE
This episode is definitely one that tugs at the heart strings a little bit. It kind of brings the horrible perspective of reality to the whole thing :/ These people are really people...people who have lost friends and family relationships because of this thing. Sigh.

>1\. Which character do you feel has contributed the least to the task force so far? Do you wish those who arent L could play a bigger role in solving the case?

That's a loaded question. Depends what perspective you come into it from. Matsuda is helpful in how he's always there to bolster people's spirits, even if they pretend to be annoyed by his optimism. But out of respect for Aizawa, I'm not going to say him even though he really hasn't seemed like he's done much besides miss Light talking with Naomi Misora just before her death (damn umbrella users). So...I guess I abstain?

>2\. What type of fighting style would you want to learn (if you dont know one already)?

Historical European Martial Arts I suppose - seems the most interesting to me. Although I find Thai Boxing quite intriguing as well.

I fucking hate all of you. She is a dude.

Mello and Near (spelling might be off). Near seems more like L. Mellos a little rebellious asshole.

He really is like L. Sits kind of weird, wears the same type of clothes, twirls his hair (like L played with his lip).

Oh my god. Grown up Sayu. [She's gorgeous.](http://i.imgur.com/DEEBrtk.png) MATSUDA BACK OFF!

Nice beard Aizawa. Guess we really are right back to hunting Kira without a second thought, huh? Cared more about L being the lead than staying alive to support your family after all.

So Mello and Near are working independently. I didnt think Mello was going to go off like this. Hes surrounded by a bunch of thugs, and what, he wants to kill Near. What a sore loser this ~~girl~~ guy.

SAYU NOOOOOOOOOO!!! I swear to god. I swear to fucking god!

[More great Soichiro faces.](http://i.imgur.com/jJp2pG2.png)

So what, they kidnap Sayu and when she doesnt die (I swear to fucking god, Light) then theyll suspect Soichiro Yagami is Kira.

[And another Soichiro face.](http://i.imgur.com/BwEP2SO.png)

Near also holds paper weird.

You can address me as N.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

An ok episode, did a good job of setting things up for whats to come.

Light, you better save Sayu. If you only do one good thing this entire series, it better be saving your sister. I will never forgive you if you dont. She only just came back.

Soichiro, if you save Sayu then I completely drop all charges of you not being a good father. You are redeemed for a thousand life times. Save your daughter, you mustachioed badass.

Id like to see Light take Misa on vacation to LA and use her Shinigami eyes to kill Mello and the kidnappers. Itd be tough to actually see them in person, but they can figure something out.

/u/rascorpia, did you trick me? You fucking fake me out? None of those predictions were right. Shes a *duuuude.* Is this why you were looking forward to this episode so much? This was your personal reason? To see me fucking wrongly accuse a dude of being someones mother for the **second time**? I cant believe this. I ugh, Im impressed and ashamed and angry.

I really didnt think this would happen again. I thought these days were behind me.

Horizon Organic is the bomb.com.

Info dump alert! Wow they are not wasting any time setting up the new battle lines. 

So we have the introductions of Mello and Near, and I must say i do like them. Near is very much like L even down to his idiosyncrasy's  but Mello is rash and very passionate.

The time skip is to be expected and we get a small catchup with the crew just in time to familiarise ourself's with a new damsel in distress. Nice trick by Mello and it get Light in a trick spot.

Light has his work cut out not only do the kidnappers know of the note but so do the FBI. Then to top it off he gets introduced to N who gives off very strong L vibes.

Strong start to the second part and were are going places new and getting bigger plots. I can't wait for more.

Some random thoughts:

Nears voice actor in the original sound very female, granted he is young but nit that young.

Off out of Japan for the first time and it bashes home the lack of language disconnect I've felt from the start.

How hard it it to do a puzzle where most of it is blank?
>> ARTICLE
> How hard it it to do a puzzle where most of it is blank?

And he was doing it in order from the top and right to left. That's crazy. N probably has the potential to eventually be better than L. Then again, I guess we never saw L doing puzzles or anything.

Mello and his damn confidence. 

"I'm almost 15 anyway." 

Dammit Mello I'm 23 and I'm still a scrub. You know nothing.

Soichiro: It's impossible to censor the internet.

Damn Soichiro got it right all the way back in 2003-2006.

Oh damn Aizawa with dat facial hair.

Mello with dat chocolate. [I remember the video that sprouted from Mello's love of chocolate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThfLiStXljo)

Ooooh the rules page has changed to a red background.

What no don't kidnap Sayu! She's too pure!

M-My tablet got a notification as soon as it showed Sayu's cell on the ground. Is Mello coming after me?

That ending shot. Connected to L again eh Light?

**Discussion Topics**

1. Near is shit for me. For me he'll never replace L. Damn if he isn't perfect to succeed L though, being probably emotionless and all. He's got a badass theme too.

2. You mean like chocolate or white? Or 2% and stuff like that. If I could I'd probably have chocllate milk all the stuff but shits expensive. I drink 2%.

He thinks he knows everything. How adorable. Actually, not really. Mello seems like a little shit.

You can never be too sure. Time to start using an alias.

Oh, yeah, I meant like 2% and stuff like that. Chocolate milk is expensive? Why not buy regular milk and mix in chocolate syrup? Shouldn't be too expensive. Plus the syrup will last you for a while.

Also 2%, right on.

Looks like the FBI's back, and they've gotten better at elementary anti-Kira measures. I guess some of them are more competent than Raye Penber. Still probably doesn't have anything on Peter Burke.

> It's reasonable to assume [Kira] has ways of obtaining information from within the police force

Amazing deduction Light. Not at all a deduction ProperL made like 5 years ago or something. I love how KiraL comes to the deduction that Kira killed the director because he knows he did, but NearL comes to the deduction because it would be interesting if it were true.

How is Soichiro the deputy director of the police force? Didn't he quit to keep working with ProperL? Does the police just re-hire people into lead positions?

Great episode, and a much better start for the second half than I remembered it being.

Good question. Maybe they did re-hire everyone because of how well they performed during the original Kira investigation. Would suck though if you were the new director and they told you the old guy was coming back.
>> ARTICLE
And now we see L being a spooky ghost and catching Kira from beyond the grave. This was the bit I was curious about with the rewatch as I want to see if I have any problems with it like everyone else seems to this time around. The feel is definitely different but I don't have any complaints about pacing or style yet.

In some ways, this bit can be more interesting because of the fact that there are three parties involved in the investigation and they all hate each other. N & M hate each other because of their rivalry and Light's group hates everyone and is hated by everyone because he is Kira. You get to see conflict in the investigation which didn't happen when it was just L.

This episode is a lot better this time around. Man, I'm actually enjoying everything coming to a head :P And while I now like Near, I still think Mello is a pouty little dunce that needs to be erased from the show - I don't give a damn what he represents. Any screen time for Mello is too much time...ugh. Maybe it's just the voice acting though? I dunno. Ugh again haha

/u/Neawia's Questions

>1\. Did you like Near the first time he was introduced or were you still too saddened by L's death?

I hated the pants off him. He just felt like a less-good version of L. Like a copy, but not quite as good. This second time around though, I have a much deeper appreciation for what Near and Mello represent. Not that I didn't get it the first time, but I just appreciate it more this time around. I'm also starting to really like the little soulless bastard.

>2\. What type of milk do you drink?

2% all the way
>> ARTICLE
> I still think Mello is a pouty little dunce that needs to be erased from the show - I don't give a damn what he represents.

I'm hoping that Light can actually kill him sometime soon. He needs to get rid of both Mello and Near, and I think Near is the better opponent so I'd rather have him around.

> I'm also starting to really like the little soulless bastard.

I do like him, but I agree he is a less-good version of L. I think he's cool because if given enough time (and in a perfect world, training from L) he could be just as good as L. He honestly seems like L's little brother.

> 2% all the way

Yes! I'm surprised that so many people here said 2%. Whenever I ask people I know, they think I'm weird for drinking 2%.
>> ARTICLE
>If you can't solve the puzzle if you can't win the game. Then  you're just a loser.

Oh shut up you second class L. You fucking wannabe. I bet you would've died weeks ago in L's place.

Sorry but I never like how Near is always taunting L who just fucking died. Asshole.

Hey /u/Neawia I think Sayu is now legal. Quick before Matsuda gets her!

So Mello and Near are just like L but two sides of his personality split up, and maxed out to the extrem.
Mello is the ruthless part that would do anything to solve the case, even illegal or criminal things. Also he loves to eat sweats.
Near on the other hand is the genius quiet part who thinks quick and has everything under control, also he has the playful part of L. You know the part who build tower out of empty cups and so on.

And both are just not as compelling as a character as L because they just half ass L. That's also a reason why the second part is described as weak part of Death Note.

>If you write "die of accident" for the cause of death the victim will die froma a natural accident after 6 minutes and seconds from the time of writing it.

But does this rule not clash with the first episode? Or was "traffic accident" specific enough for 40 seconds?

I... don't know. I guess it was good enough, though I suppose there could be some complications with the plot.
>> ARTICLE
Kidnapping head of Japanese police to get the Death Note? Logic makes sense. He commits suicide, and you deduce that it was Kira, and therefore Kira has access to sensitive Japanese police information? Also makes sense.


So obviously the only course of action then is to kidnap the deputy director's daughter. Because the rest of this show doesn't give a fuck about logic. (Yes I'll prob be making bitter posts from now on)

This show is not friendly to its characters. And this episode is titled "Father". That can't be a good thing.

You were expecting Soichiro's face, or an establishing shot for a room after that title card. [But it was me, Ryuk!](https://i.imgur.com/pIBD7OJ.png) And the creepy guy.

[I like to imagine somebody looked to the sky in this scene and saw an apply floating through the heavens.](https://i.imgur.com/xxy9Kd0.png)

What? *Near*wia was intended to surpass L? But he didn't even know that Mello was a boy! It doesn't make any sense!

Light opening the door like ["Dafuq are you wearing? Can't you leave me alone for one afternoon? I just want your crazy overpowered eyes."](https://i.imgur.com/PDwENVw.png) Using the eyes like that to find the notebook is really damn smart though. I love that creepy guy is standing in the room with them and that we can see him. I don't know how I could forget about this guy, his scenes are brilliant! His mouth isn't. (Actually I do know, it's because he only appears in yesterday's and today's episode)

Crazy magic notebooks flying through the air like ["Tag, you're it."](https://i.imgur.com/fzbZffC.png) Shinigami reaction scenes are always so amazing.

Good idea Light, [but does it _have_ to touch your dick?](https://i.imgur.com/sTl7b1b.png)

Mello being pretty smart and stuff. He's come to the same conclusion L has, except L assumed the rule to be fake and Mello has a reliable source telling him so. In a show with shriveled up gods of death and crazy freaks that have unique laugh tracks, [Mello easily takes the the first place for most bizarre and disturbing facial expression.](https://i.imgur.com/MnDdfPp.png)

I'm kinda sad that we don't get to see everyone's reaction when Ryuk is revealed. He looks a bit more freaky than Rem does after all. Poor Soichiro gonna give up half of his remaining life. Though considering all the stress he's been in and how visibly he has aged that probably isn't much anyway.

I think we can all agree now that [the life spans beneath the names](https://i.imgur.com/mW2Zf4H.png) are made up and don't mean anything. They're not time remaining in any format, otherwise Light's number would have changed in the first couple of episodes. They're not dates either, seeing how the length of the number is pretty arbitrary. They're supposed to represent either time remaining or the deadline, otherwise Rem wouldn't have reacted the way she did when Misa's number shrunk (and otherwise the number wouldn't have shrunk), but they clearly don't. It's a shame. Time in hours, seconds, or whatever would have been great.

Crazy secret police got magic notebooks and grenades and stuff now. This got nothing to do with Soichiro's sense of justice anymore. He probably doesn't mind dying after this. Stupid Kira doesn't understand that Soichiro is anti-murder - Light would have known.

"Don't worry you're still worried about that chief" - Stupid Matsuda, everyone except you has kept worrying about that for the entire time, and with good reason. Kira's last effort at killing Mello is some really bad pretending-to-be-Light acting, as usual he starts to fall apart when he's desperate and backed into a corner. He got lucky nobody noticed except me.

You think so? I thought Rem was way freakier. She just looked like bones. Ryuk seems normal in comparison.

> Time in hours, seconds, or whatever would have been great.

True, but I guess they want us to be in the dark on that so we don't know when it's gonna happen. So we can be surprised. Alternatively, I do think they could've used hours/minutes/seconds and worked it into the story in an interesting way since building up the suspense to the moment of death could be fun.

Light, chill the fuck out, dude. Youre smart. Everyone knows that. No need to announce it to yourself every fucking time you egomaniac.

Thats gonna be one hell of a long flight for Sidoh. How is he gonna get them to see him if he doesnt own the notebook? Wait, what? I thought the only way was to touch a notebook that belonged to a Shinigami. Is that or isnt it Sidohs notebook? Or did he just regain ownership when he took the notebook back?

Ill explain everything to you right now. Scene cuts away. Cmon.

Hes human, but hes scary. Damn right. Mello is freaking out.

Matsuda, what the hell. Soichiro!!! Why is anyone considering making the eye deal for *this*? What! Where is this coming from. How is this your fault, Soichiro? Anyone wouldve made that exchange. Killing yourself? This is a little too much.

This is kind of stupid. Maybe Im not getting it. He really took the eye deal JUST to confirm they died? Thats stupid. Not like you couldnt have tried asking Ryuk to look at the photos.

Matsuda! Nice shooting.

Side note. I think its really cool that Light calls his dad deputy director and Soichiro calls his son L.

Is Soichiro going to have to die now since he can see Mellos real name? Or can we actually get the kill on one of these two L successors?

Light! You have a notebook too. Why cant you write his name?!?!

That would hurt like hell getting shot that many times with the vest.

Matsuda!!!! KILL THEM!!!!

!!!!!!!!!!

Oh, good. Some of them are ok.

Oh well this is fucking killing me. Im crying. Soichiros going to die thinking his son isnt Kira.

Fuck you, Light.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Sayu T_T Please come back.

I think this was the weakest episode of the show yet.

Why did Soichiro take the eyes deal? It seems like it was just to check that the people inside Mellos hideout actually died. The chances of him actually writing Mellos name down in the notebook were slim. He shouldnt have been the one to take the deal. Of course, then he couldnt have looked at Light just before he died and seen that his son wasnt Kira.

Maybe I missed something, but I dont think they needed to take the eye deal. I cant believe everyone was so willing to take it, and then kill Mello. They knew Mello was going to be there. They couldve captured him like normal instead of attempting to learn his name and kill him. 

I mean, why was Soichiro even using the notebook like that? Why didnt he just have a gun? Youre telling me that once Mello was cornered, writing his name in the Death Note would be quicker than pulling the trigger on a gun? Dont think so.

All that being said, I think Soichiros death was touching. I felt extremely bad for the guy. He didnt deserve to be deceived like that. Ignorance is bliss. Also, he went out knowing that his daughter was recently kidnapped and may never be the same again. Quite sad.
>> ARTICLE
> Noooooooooo! Sayus dead inside. Fuck.

This is the weirdest thing about the episode for me. From what we can tell, she was being well-fed and treated fairly well minus the whole kidnapping thing. Given that there are MANY people treated MUCH worse for FAR longer who don't end up looking like wheelchair vegetables, I don't see what's going on here unless there's something I missed.

>Why is anyone considering making the eye deal for this?

If I had to guess, it's because they don't know for sure whether or not Kira is leading them into a trap. They ARE one of the few groups still opposing him after all. Getting the eyes means they can confirm that Kira is working with them, and make sure they don't just all show up only to be slaughtered. Heck, most of them didn't even want to go after Mello since it posed a pretty big risk to their safety. Beyond that, I'll just chalk it up to people following Light's orders without thinking about them too hard for 6 years and Soichiro not being in a great frame of mind. 

>Killing yourself?

Honestly a [Japanese thing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/suiciderate.html). It's pretty crazy. Soichiro is a man of honor, and he feels like he did the wrong thing for selfish reasons - I get it given their societal quirks.

Yeah, I thought she was stronger than that. Kind of disappointed she turned into a zombie.
>> ARTICLE
>Why did Soichiro take the eyes deal? It seems like it was just to check that the people inside Mellos hideout actually died. The chances of him actually writing Mellos name down in the notebook were slim. He shouldnt have been the one to take the deal. Of course, then he couldnt have looked at Light just before he died and seen that his son wasnt Kira.

One thing you're missing - Nobody wrote Soichiro's name in a Death Note right?. Think about it, the eye deal halves the lifespan of the person right? Well, he took the deal and pretty much died immediately after, he wasn't long for this world anyway. I don't have any speculation on whether he would have died from the same wounds or killed himself or whatever. The reasons you outlined were pretty much why he took it though. That peace of mind for a father, after all this was really powerful even if it was a lie.

> Light! You have a notebook too. Why cant you write his name?!?!

It seems like no one has answered this yet. The reason is that Soichiro Yagami was the only one who had seen Mello's face (he was wearing a mask when the others came in). Light knows the name now, but he's missing the face. That one photo of Mello just became extremely valuable.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh, yes yes. I think I did realize this by the end of the episode. Light also would've drawn attention to himself if he wrote the name since at that time, only the investigation team would know Mello's true name. So it'd be weird if Kira suddenly knew his name.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, Sayu looks traumatized, she's in a wheelchair too. She was so happy and cheerful before =/

Now Soichiro taking the deal and cutting his remaining years in half, damn. Light's family is
really getting messed up now because of him.

Ryuk is actually helping too, for the most part he just seemed to observe, Light didn't know the
other Shinigami was there right? If so Ryuk did that on his own, maybe he is starting to care for
Light in some way?

Now Soichiro is dead too... Light keeps finding new ways to make me hate him more. Even while his Dad
is dying he is standing there scheming.

Also, I'm a little surprised Light didn't factor in his father not being able to do the killing, he
is definitely the sort of person that wouldn't do it unless he absolutely had to. Light seems
to have gotten a bit sloppy after the timeskip in my opinion.

What a sad episode...

Very good point. Ryuk kept Sidoh from entering the building and messing up Light's plan. Ryuk does care.

Agreed. I don't think Soichiro should've taken the eyes deal, especially when the others were also willing to cut their lives in half.

Sochiro,you did a great job raising Light, now go home. Truly one of the best dad, in this show he is the only pure good character, an undying sense of duty and devotion to the family.Thus, even though it is ironic, it's fitting to see him die in peace. It reminds me of [FMA:B](/s "King Bradley's death, they are visually similar,both men are in the their 50's.Both times Light and Lan Fan spend so much time debating and talking that they couldn't finish their deed.")

He died hours after

* he halved his remaining life time
* he got shot at
* he survived a giant-ass explosion

I'm not sure if the deal had much to do with it.
>> ARTICLE
It still does, because cause of death by murder still counts. Remember the story of Misa, her Shinigami could clearly tell her lifespan was up and it's was by a maniac murderer as well.
>> ARTICLE
You're right, I didn't remember that.
>> ARTICLE
"The use of the Death Note in the human world sometimes affects other human's lives or shortens their original life-span, even though their names are not actually written in the Death Note itself. In these cases, no matter the cause, the god of death sees only the original life-span and not the shortened life-span." Rule from the deathnote we was told before. 

>> ARTICLE
Shit, I should have read the terms and conditions.
>> ARTICLE
Poor Sayu man. This whole situation last episode left her broken. Makes me sad.

"I want my notebook back."

"Yeah....I figured it'd be that."

Poor Sidoh. He's so sneaky though, standing behind Light and Misa knowing they can't see him.

"Kyuuu....ston."

Interesting that Snyder couldn't see Sidoh despite being the current owner until Sidoh made him touch it. How had he not seen Sidoh if he was the owner?

Naturally everyone freaks out and tries to shoot Sidoh.

"The thirteen-day rule can be proven in thirteen days..."

You don't say.

So now Ryuk is Soichiro's shinigami. He takes the deal pretty much right away, feeling guilty about losing a Death Note in the first place.

I think this is the first time we actually see the eye deal happen. Ryuk presumably puts his hand on Soichiro's face.

Can you imagine showing someone the Mello vs Soichiro scene out of context? Some man threatening to kill a younger guy with a notebook? Holding a notebook in his hands instead of a gun?

Oh my god Soichiro! Shot in the back by a guy faking death!

Mello blows up the entire building!

And Soichiro dies. My feels. Not quite as tragic as L's death but still pretty damn sad.

And now off to the Jojo rewatch, where [Jojo Part 3 spoilers, just in case](/s "things are a cryfest there as well.")

**Discussion Topics**

1. I would say Aizawa. He's pretty capable but I do think Soichiro was the best for the job.

The music this episode was on point. From the light hearted tone when the two shinigami met to the high action scenes with blood pumping music. Then the sorrow of the ending.

Awesome but again a bit fast paced, Mello goes from being more or less on top to being systematically take out. Light's plan was awesome, from his use of Misa's eyes to finding the location and the assault on the mob. His plan failed because he wanted his dad to kill. 

Light you are nothing like your dad.

Soichiro will be missed.
>> ARTICLE
heheh, Ryuk is having a great stare-down with that apple. Don't you let him go without giving you a notebook, Sidoh! He can't play tricks forever! 

Jesus, Misa was just waiting in her underwear for Light! 

OH DAMN! I completely forgot they still have Rem's notebook too! I was asking myself why there are three notebooks being used by humans now, since I didn't think Ryuk would think of giving his own away, but I'm just dumb. 

Wow! I can't believe I've never had the Chief's death spoiled for me! Is this a development that Death Note fans just don't ever talk about, or am I obscenely lucky for not having that spoiled for me yet? I can't believe that's never brought up when people talk about sad character deaths, because that took me by surprise.

Is it true what Ryuk told Light in the beginning of the series, that humans who kill others using the Death Note don't go to heaven or hell? If that is true, Light is an even bigger asshole for trying to condemn his father (and Misa too) to that fate than he already was for making his father half his own lifespan (and effectively killing him in this operation). At least it was a mercy in the end that he didn't have to find out his own son was a serial killer, even if it was a lie. 
>> ARTICLE
> Jesus, Misa was just waiting in her underwear for Light! 

Light's a lucky man. (   )

> I can't believe that's never brought up when people talk about sad character deaths, because that took me by surprise.

I've also never seen anyone talk about it. I guess people don't consider it to be too sad. Or they've just forgotten about it.

> Light is an even bigger asshole for trying to condemn his father (and Misa too) to that fate than he already was for making his father half his own lifespan (and effectively killing him in this operation). 

Ok, let's see. Misa definitely used her own Death Note at some point before meeting Light so she was already going to limbo (or wherever).

You're definitely right on the mark about trying to get his dad to use the Death Note, effectively sending him to limbo. I wonder how many of the rules are written down in the book, and if Soichiro and the team knew that risk.

The final part, Soichiro was a police officer so I think he knows the risks of going into dangerous missions. I wouldn't place that blame entirely on Light.
>> ARTICLE
> I guess people don't consider it to be too sad.

Soichiro died after having gone through hell for years and already having considered ending his life multiple times. This death was probably a relief to him. Additionally he died after not betraying his principles (after not murdering Mello) and in the belief that after years of worry, he could now be sure that his son was innocent. [manga](/n "Since there is no afterlife, Soichiro will never find out that the last few years of his life have been a lie.")

That's true. This was an all around good death for him. [manga](/n "That's truthfully very sweet and heartwarming, in a slightly sad way.")

And Sayu is broken... quick hide her from /u/Neawia so he doesn't need to see her in that state.

I guess Neawia hates Mello right now. Also Light probably because he isn't the great Oni-chan Neawia thought he was. He was ready to kill her to protect the Death Note...

[Laughed at the sudden cut to Ryuk because I was in the same pose as him when this happened.

Aizawa without afro... he looks so generic right now. Argh I wan't afro Aizawa!

[Welcome in America Shinigami-san](http://i.imgur.com/akdk94z.png)

Shido is so cute, is totally afraid of Mello.

Damnit Soichiro why? He accepted death, and Light would've killed him either way in order to keep the 13 day rule..

Well Soichiro died atleast happy, thinking that his son is innocent. But still Light is an asshole through and through. He is not a bit sad to losed his father, just angry that Mello didn't die.
Man Matsuda is probably the saddest one in this room. I believe that Soichiro was a father figure for him.

That summary by Ryuk perfect.

Really the second part is not a big cat and mouse game with two equal minds always fighting each other anymore. It is more action orientated in my opinion. It's just very different. But it is still good at it.

Also the longer this show is going the more unsympathic Light is getting. I mean he was always a self indulged prick but he loses is cool more often lately and get's angry and is just so cold.

I was also rooting for him until the timeskip on my first watch (To be fair I never could decide if I wanted him or L to win) , but after rewatching this show so often I can't find anything to like him. Especially after becoming such an ass in the second half. He has really no redeeming features, I guess his biggest weakness his arrogance grew and grew over the last five years without anyone challenging him....

Ok, so sorry I haven't been here. Literally, I have no better excuses than my sleep pattern is really fucked so I stay up all night and sleep from the afternoon till almost midnight (last night, anyway) and the only way for me to fix it it to let it work itself out. I started typing this a little before 3PM, so I think from now on I won't miss anymore unless I get lazy or my pattern reverts back to the way it was before today. The other excuse is that I don't really feel right posting in an old discussion thread after say 4 AM. I know how arbitrary that is, but yeah. And the last reason (which isn't really a reason, anyway, because of the first reason) is that I'd just watched the second movie when I was trying to catch up and I couldn't make myself watch the same thing twice (that's not really a spoiler, I hope? It's an adaptation so of course there's gonna be redos and remixes. Also, I wish we could watch the drama together, too, but I don't know how many people would be up for watching the same story three times, even with variations. Plus, since it's so new, I don't know if the sub would be for it, anyway T_T.)

Anyway, I realized as I was watching the last episode, I discredited Misa too much. She's smarter than the average (semi) lolita. I guess the dumb one is me since Light and various other characters said basically the same thing in some of the many info dumps they gave . Welp.

Another note from last episode: I guess they didn't want to because most English speakers don't know what tsuki means, but calling him Moon Yagami instead of Tsuki Yagami seems silly. It's not like we know what the other names mean, right?

How do Sachiko and Sayu not hear Misa yelling at Light all the time? I actually always wonder why his family never calls him on his habit of seemingly talking to himself. Like, I know that most people do it even if they think they don't, but the degree to which Light does would have to be distressing, especially if they were to really listen and realize he was replying to someone else.

~~Who told Light how Shinigami die? I think I missed something.~~ Never mind; I'm a butt.

The writer's missed an opportunity to give me a Gargle brand search engine to go with my Klortox bleach, FaceRange, and JPPinney.

Misa's memory is impeccable. I wouldn't have remembered what he told me to say verbatim like that. And if it turns out she didn't repeat him verbatim, then I've just proved my point.

Do you think Alessandro Juliani made L's slurping noises or was there a slurping double? Like a hand model but for slurps. Ramen shops love them.

Jesus, Light, contemplating domestic abuse. What a dick.

My first day back and I have nothing of any real value to say. Seems about right (I'm so sorry T_T).

The films are adaptations of the show. You didn't say anything specific that happens. You're fine.

Some recommended that, or perhaps another version of DN. I don't know. There are so many ways to experience this story. We'll see though.

That's a good point. He really does talk to himself more than the average person. Maybe he's just really careful about it. I don't know. Someone should've heard him by now. You're right.

> The writer's missed an opportunity to give me a Gargle brand search engine to go with my Klortox bleach, FaceRange, and JPPinney.

Are those all from Death Note? I missed those. And Gargle would be a funny one though. I like it.

Ehm Light? Didn't you notice how crazy in love she is? She will never allow this.

>If I see you with another girl, I'll kill her.

And Yandere mode activated.

I like Rem, no matter how shit her taste is, she manages to show Light his place.

Interesting how he considers using the Death Note in such a way to influence someone to kill her, instantly after rule 22 is revealed that explicitly forbids that. Well Light himself doesn't know this rule but still.

Light is probably the first man who hates that he's dating a model.

I think we need to fear for poor Takadas life. Light is such an bold asshole. Have a yandere as girlfriend? No fucks were given.

And all the guys are jealous, of course.


Is it just me or does the hair of Chief Yagami look more grey?

22. **Whether the cause of the individual's death is either a suicide or accident, if the death leads to the death of more than the intended, the person will simply die of a heart attack. This is to ensure that other lives are not influenced.**

Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1. The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.
2. Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.
3. Gods of Death, the original owners of the Death Note, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note.
4. A god of death cannot be killed even if stabbed in his heart with a knife or shot in the head with a gun. However, there are ways to kill a god of death which are not generally known to the gods of death
5. The specific scope of the condition for death is not known to the gods of death, either so, you must examine and find out.

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. You can have one trait from Light, be it his looks his genius or his acting abilities or whatever else, what would you choose?

2. Who's your favourite member in the task force? Excluding L and Light.

3. What do you think? Will L manage to save his hide, even though he doesn't know that Rem is now after him?

----

Edit: /u/Neawia's questions

>Do/did you think Light should do more to keep Misa happy? Aka, keep her in check.

Well why should he, he has Misa's Death Note, so she can't do anything to him, only reason for him to be nice to her is because of Rem

>Were you one of the kids in school who knew how to do the pen spin? Can you still do it?

I can't I tried to do it, it never worked. But I was never eager enough to learn it.

Yeah. I like how she really just doesn't give a shit. Light's nothing special to her.

The shit he's been through recently, we can't blame him. Dude needs to retire after this one.

In all seriousness, the extra brain power would be nice. Dude's a legitimate genius.

> Who's your favourite member in the task force? Excluding L and Light.

Soichiro Yagami. He's badass. Matsuda's funny, but the other members are useless.

> What do you think? Will L manage to save his hide, even though he doesn't know that Rem is now after him?

Yes. I don't know how, but I think L is going to be ok. Something will happen that stops Rem from killing him.

> Well why should he, he has Misa's Death Note, so she can't do anything to him, only reason for him to be nice to her is because of Rem

I don't know. She's incredibly annoying to deal with. Might as well keep her happy so she's easier to control. Plus if Light does too many things she dislikes, she's going to lose it.

Day 14 - I'm caught up! Time to join back in with everyone! Let's do this!

---

I just want to say, I like the OP more and more. However, I think it needs to be paired with the visuals. As a song, its not the best OP Ive ever heard. With the animation though, its solid.

Ill eliminate the entire task force. Dont say that so nonchalantly, Light. For fucks sake. Your dads on the task force. Not surprised he wants to off Misa already, but shit. Im still hoping she gets to stay around a little longer so Light can have some sort of human relationship besides tutoring Sayu and having tennis matches with L.

Darling. Knight. Misas adorably obsessed.

*About L...* I saw him sleeping in that exact same position the other day. Well, I guess I shouldnt be surprised, should I?

Misa will do anything Light says, huh? [Nice.](http://i.imgur.com/H4XpAnu.jpg)

If I see you with another girl, Ill kill her. Ok. The crazy has been confirmed for me now. Whatever, shes still kind of hot though.

Look, sweetie. Stfu, and do what I say, alright? Maybe Ill let you in on my harem action if you behave yourself.

[Light *really* cant comprehend this shit.](http://puu.sh/nCsPE.webm) This is great. Ryuks still just laughing away, resting his head on his hand, like usual. Too perfect. So good.

What is the connection between Rem and Misa? Her devotion to Misa is crazy. Why would she die for her? Why is Misa so special?

[Also, numbers.](http://i.imgur.com/xXzEJK4.png) Who is going to die first? Misa's first set of numbers is smaller, but I don't know anything about Shinigami numbers.

Awww, Light has to protect her. ~~What a giant pain in the ass~~ How romantic.

A celebrity couple! Scandalous.

[Cute sayu with bread.](http://i.imgur.com/TV7ucnq.png)

[Pen spin.](http://gfycat.com/LinearFaithfulBaldeagle)

The second Kiras message was word for word. Misa was really paying attention even though she seemed more occupied with telling Light he cant see other women.

So donuts and chocolates are brain food apparently.

[Great voice work from L here.](http://puu.sh/nCteF.webm) Or rather Alessandro Juliani. Just the way he speaks is wonderful. Hed make him say something like Theres no way hed make me stop. Yes, Light? Excellent work. Also, watch his eyes follow the donut at 12 seconds.

[Donut lick.](http://gfycat.com/MisguidedFavoriteBellfrog)

Wow. Actually kind of touching. Ls making a friend. Not too surprising considering their similarities.

LOL Why I am I laughing? Lights pissed. Seriously though, kids. Don't hit women. Or anyone for that matter. Unless you're defending yourself.

I suppose if Light does get caught with Misa, he could claim that he was keeping her a secret from everyone because they didnt want people knowing they were dating. Itd be too much of a hassle for her, being a celebrity, and Light would never live it down if his friends and schoolmates found out he was dating a model. He could say he dated other girls to keep up appearances.

Fuck me. I could listen to Brian Drummond laugh all day. If I were Light, Id be bursting into laughter every time I heard Ryuk laugh. People would think Im crazy.

And is Rem and Misas relationship as simple as her having watched her from the Shinigami realm and becoming attached?

[Light up close.](http://i.imgur.com/4w5EnxO.png)

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

One day this weekend Im going to go back and sort out my predictions. Id like a cohesive list of things I think might legitimately happen.

So. What is the complication going to be? Rem is just going to kill L just like that? Its not that I believe she wont, but it cant be that easy. Were what, one-third of the way through the series? No chance L is going to die. At least not yet. Especially after he just said he and Light are friends. So whats going to happen that causes problems for Rem?

Ugh. All of these episodes have been good. I dont think Ive outright disliked any episode so far.

Also, lets just establish this early on. Make things clear. Misa is the girl you have a fling with. You regret it later on in life, but it was fun at the time. Sayu is the girl you commit to because she has the whole package.

What else.

Ha! Could you imagine if L actually has a Shinigami himself? Hes just been acting this entire time because he really enjoys the thrill of the game, and Light/Kira is his best opponent yet. I suppose this would be easily debunked by the fact that Ryuk hasnt said anything about it, and more importantly, he hasnt laughed in Ls presence, giving away the fact that something was up. Still, maybe this time he was trying his hardest to be true to what he said about not taking sides and that he wouldn't tell Light if he saw another Shinigami. Plus, he loves the entertainment, and Light vs L is the best entertainment.

Ryuk and Matsuda are really vying for the first girl and childhood friend positions.

She saw Gelus die for her, and she'd grown fond of watching her herself. She basically owes a life debt to the girl.

Awww, Light and Mira are perfect for each other, they are there own flavour of crazy. And to top it off Rem is crazy enough to threaten Light even though he just learned how to kill shinigami.

Light has reasonable concerns about being seen with someone as famous as Mira and shuns her away. Then in a huge dick move brings another student to act as his girlfriend. He has no interest in her at all and even tests his lines on her.

Wow I feel so sad for L, he seems like a very lonely person, the is so much to him I would love to know. It hit me hard when he said Light was his first friend.

Has Light found a easy way to get rid of L now that Rem will kill L for him. But can he get it done in a way where he will be free?

(again not much from me today, I'm recovering from watching Wolf Children for the first time.)
>> ARTICLE
> Wow I feel so sad for L, he seems like a very lonely person, the is so much to him I would love to know. It hit me hard when he said Light was his first friend.

You're right. I kind of felt sad for L. I wonder what he's been through. How the hell he ended up becoming a genius detective at such a young age. Possibly orphaned. Obviously no friends. Sucks.
>> ARTICLE
So Light is talking about killing the entire investigation team, does that mean he's a patricidal asshole or an idiot who plans to kill everyone EXCEPT his father and make it obvious that he's Kira?

Misa is a cutie, Light is at least smart to use Rem to his advantage, but he shouldn't have thought it was so important to be weary of her in the first place. Misa hasn't done anything that would incriminate him, yet. 
>> ARTICLE
> yet

Keyword.

She's smart, but not as smart as Light. I know she'll listen to whatever Light says, but I'm also worried she'll eventually think she *knows* Light well enough to start improvising.

With L on the case, anything could be potentially incriminating!

Whoops I am quite late today becoz friday night, I feel that this episode isn't that good, mainly because of too much Misa Amane. She can be a bit too whiny sometimes, but this episode in particular takes the cakes, her acting yandere can fall flat because she doesn't quite have the fear factor of Light or L.
>> ARTICLE
Ryuuk is so friendly. Light wanted to hit misa so bad. Omg, light could you really kill a friend? I've seen too many shonen to be OK with this


>> ARTICLE
>Omg, light could you really kill a friend?

Well Light doesn't consider L to be his friend, this is only show for him to get L's trust, he just played along.

And I believe that L only said that to provoke Light, and maybe to lower his guard. Because he still thinks that Light is Kira, but he lies about it so that so Light could make a mistake.
>> ARTICLE
That's probably true. It definitely caught light off guard
>> ARTICLE
Ryuk gets all up in her face, "Domo!"

And there comes the yandere part of her.

More rules for the Death Note. It seems only one death can result from having a name written. These are pretty fair rules.

This makes me sad. Light and L could've been such good freidns if Light wasn't Kira.

EPISODE 8 AND IM AWAKE BEFORE 2 PM. ENGAGE THE HYPE THRUSTERS!

- God I love this OP. "You better run jshsjsmzjzisiwmsnsjxksks sack a evil" pretty sure I nailed those lyrics don't even need to check trust me it's how the song goes.

- Watari you sick pervert, just sitting back watching Matsuda lick that ice cream. You should be ashamed of yourself taking advantage of innocent virgins like that.

- "Mr. Matsuda it's ok for you to turn you phone on now." Thank god, he's been itching to poke back all those cuties on Facebook.

- "It seems like you're pretty skilled with your hands, I bet you're pretty popular with the girls aren't you?" "Skill has nothing to do with it, it's your looks that count. I'm guessing you're not that popular are you?" God damn I love this duo sometimes, but Ryuk is best girl Light so you better respect his beauty. 

- L is wiring the Yagami household and putting cameras in the bathrooms... For all that is holy don't let Matsuda or Watari run surveillance. 

- "When I was his age I did strange things too." L I'm gonna have to stop you right there, I can only make so many perverted jokes in one thread.

- Jesus Light is pretty serious about his privacy, these are tell-tale signs of a chronic masturbator. Trust me I know all of the signs because... reasons.

- "My body gets all twisted I do handstands it's not pretty!" "I don't need to see that." "I know..." Seriously the Light x Ryuk OTP is stronger than ever this episode.

- Way to go L. You've created one very uncomfortable father son relationship. Nothing like thinking your son is having a wank every time he closes his door now.

- "Light I've told you, no god of the new world rants at the dinner table, and wash your hands before you touch anything. Your father told me about your new hobby."

- NOTHING FEELS QUITE AS GOOD AS SOME SECRETIVE MASS MURDER WITH YOUR FAVORITE BAG OF POTATO CHIPS. Let's Potato Chips: Take them, and eat them.

This was a more entertaining episode than I remembered. Light and Ryuk's conversations stole the show for me, but watching Chief Yagami's reaction to Light's porn stash was pretty great too. I'll see all of you wankers tomorrow, I'll pray for your filthy sins.

Potato chip eating game for death note. 

Note:Chips must be eaten in [*dramatic* fashion](https://youtu.be/eabrae0uPO8?t=1m10s) that is put the  chip in the mouth and then **tear** it off by flicking your face to the right.

1. A chip every time Light writes something dramatically.

2. A chip for every time Light or L eats junk food (duh)

3. A chip for every time L uses questionable detective methods.

4. A chip for every religious reference,  do homework if it is Light's godhood/new order, laugh maniacally it is accompanied by epic choir music

5. A chip if Matsuda needs to shut up, do homework if L shuts him up , laugh maniacally if Matsuda somehow does something epic

6. 5% or 10% of a chip whenever L uses percentages.

7. A chip for every time L freaks someone out, do homework if he is the one that is freaked out.

8. A chip for every time L and Light faceoff, do homework if they are thinking the exact same thing, laugh if it is JUSTICE!!!

9. A chip for every time Ryuk is bored or think Light is interesting.

10. Laugh evilly if one of your theories if actually proven right. 

Edit: If you don't have any homework, write down a name of someone you don't like on a piece of innocent looking paper *inside* the potato chip bag.

This is the episode where Light takes a potato chip....AND EATS IT!

You'd think with that many cameras in Lights room, they'd be able to see something like a miniature television inside of a bag, wasn't there even any light shining onto Light's shirt?
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering how a camera didn't pick up on the light from it either.

Probably because anime.
>> ARTICLE

Well L finds the right trace at the moment even without Naomi, but with Naomi he would've already solved the case. Still impressive how far his investigation have come. But he wouldn't investigate anything if Kira didn't kill those FBI agents.

Hey some kind of  Pyrrhic victory for Naomi, she still managed to get L to concentrate on Raye's observation targets

Must be hard for Mr Yagami, to have your own family being observed. Still they're now closer than ever to catching Kira. Even thought they don't know it.

Man Kira thinks about everything, his room has so many savety nets. 

Looks like Kira understood the concept of touka koukan. To have a shinigami do your bidding, give him something in exchange. Or well blackmail him with something.


I must admit the potato chip scene isn't [as over the top in the German dub](http://puu.sh/nvZtL.webm), because he doesn't play it up with smugness like the English VA, he just explains it very calm for the viewer. I mean that little chuckle the Eng VA does before "AND EAT IT!" makes it so much greater in my opinion.

so /u/cuckoodev I update the score to

1 - J-Dub, 1 - G-Dub, 1 E-Dub

Yes L sees the major flaw in Kira's potato chip plan, he choose two petty criminals, so this is all just too perfect here, it never works like that in real life so no wonder that L is wary about Light, well he also has a good nose for things like that. Light is probably on his radar now.

15. **A person can shorten his or her onw life by using the note.** (Well if you want to get life ensurance for your family with suicide this rule could help you)


Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1. The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.
2. Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.
3. Gods of Death, the original owners of the Death Note, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note.

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. What's your favourite potato chip flavour?

2. Does anybody here still watch TV? Or was it already replaced by the Internet?

3. What do you think was the type of ice cream they were eating there in the beginning?

>> ARTICLE
> What's your favourite potato chip flavour?

With cream and onions or, less so though, cheese. 

> Does anybody here still watch TV? Or was it already replaced by the Internet?

Haven't really watched TV ever since I got internet.

> What do you think was the type of ice cream they were eating there in the beginning?

It looks green, so my guess would be it was apple flavored or pineapples with something. Might be kiwifruit as well.

> What's your favourite potato chip flavour?

Sour cream and onion is the bomb but nothing is better than original.

I literally almost never turn off my TV. Probably going on close to two weeks now.

Grimy chocolate flavor. Seriously, it looked yucky :(

Just a few scatted thoughts today as I'm short on time.

That's a lot of VHS tapes, things were so bad back in 2007.

L makes a big leap in suspecting Light and his family.

I did stuff like that to my door when I was younger. 

How many bugs is too many bugs?

Would be a good alibi Light, but again you're to eager to punch back.

Watch as I eat a crisp with drama!

The episode just seem to end, no big reveal or cliffhanger just done.

A good episode and another fast paced one, I feel a slow down coming.

Poor Aizawa man. He looks beat. Oh man Matsuda too. 

Haha Watari giving everyone ice cream.

Oh I didn't know the anime itself specifically mentioned the Los Angeles case.

So even without Naomi meeting L he still basically figured out what she was worried about anyway.

I like how Ryuk apparently plays games with Light. Can you imagine walking in and seeing a controller floating beside Light?

And here we see how addicted and reliant Ryuk has gotten to Human World apples. He can't go without them!

And here Light manages to get Ryuk to help him. Ryuk'll do anything for those apples.

I love how Light just looks at bikini girl magazines in the meantime.

64 cameras for just one room. Damn.

I like how apparently Light got a portable tv in his bag of chips before even opening them.

Just watch me /r/anime! I'll watch the Death Note rewatch on my pc and watch the Jojo rewatch on my Android.

I'll take a piece of my birthday cake, and eat it!

Ice cream? What a disgusting looking flavor. And Ls still sitting weird on the couch. Get it together man. Chief Yagami is falling asleep standing up, and youre having desert.

Oh. Everyones having ice cream. Triple stacked.

I cant believe you actually caught that! For fucks sake. Slow the tape down and view it frame by frame or something. How did you not catch that? Probably the crappy tv their using.

L *really* does hold phones oddly. Loved his voice impression though.

[Close up of L.](http://i.imgur.com/5tGhs7V.png)

Fucking lol, Ryuk. Youre pretty skilled with your hands. Pretty popular with the girls. Hehehe.

OH SNAP LIGHT Its your looks that count. Im guessing youre not that popular.

Good to see Light covering his own ass. Hes learning, getting smarter. Of course, this happens at the same time that L wants to place surveillance on the Yagami house. How convenient.

Chief Yagami is pissed. He needs his sleep.

This is tense. Will Light talk to Ryuk? Will he realize the house is tapped. Looks like he does.

When I was his age, I did strange things too. Lol, Ls pretty funny. Too similar to Light as well. Im interested in seeing just how similar they really are.

NOOOO! HIS APPLES! APPLE WITHDRAWAL!!! ITS NOT PRETTY!!!

Interesting. Light is getting Ryuk to actually help him by using apples as a reward.

I should've webmed it. Well, not much point now since you've seen it, and not many others will view these comments. It's just that he says the 'and eat it' line with such fervor. He was being so completely serious about it, but I just couldn't help but find it comical.

The potato chip line is worth changing to dub.
>> ARTICLE
Idk why but when I watched this episode in English this morning, it was a lot funnier, to the point that I felt that maybe this was a kind of breather episode (as much as Death Note can achieve such a thing), but in Japanese, it seemed much more played straight.

That TV should've made a loud ass noise when it fell into the trash. A thin, plastic (???) bag isn't going to stop that. And Sachiko probably should've felt the weight of it in the trash bag. But whatever  \_()_/

So, last night I decided to give the J-drama another chance, and I have to say, I'm liking it a lot more now that I'm also watching the anime. I barely got five minutes into it when it premiered and now I'm like actual, this is pretty cool, mostly entirely because Light is an actual human being in the drama, so that's nice. L is like a young, visual kei-ish smartass. It's weird. I think my one problem with it is that Light is still making the same maneuvers that he does in the original story but he's meant to just be some guy in the drama, so it's kind weird. Still, the writers seemed to realize that too with the Raye Pender remix they pulled, so, we'll see.

The J-drama is great, especially if you've already read the manga/watched the anime. Not better, but meaningfully different enough to be worth the watch.

This episode was a lot funnier than I remember it being. Must be the English dub. Has to be!

Couple things I noticed that can only be explained " 'Cause anime". Well, most of the time:
  
* That potato chip pack must have been pretty big to have a mini TV inside of it so that the pack itself looked normal. That, or I just don't know how 'mini' are those small TVs truly are;  
* How was Light able to close off the pack? As far as I know, only machines are able to close off plastic packs thoroughly;
* 64 cameras around one small room and you only look through one. Nice one L! 
>> ARTICLE
> How was Light able to close off the pack? As far as I know, only machines are able to close off plastic packs thoroughly;

The manga confirms that Light had that packed bought and resealed ahead of time.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, ok.  
Didn't read manga, so I wouldn't know, but it seems like anime did go over some little explanations that were in manga. I remember glossing over a Death Note volume at a bookstore and caught on a moment were Light specifies what kind of flavor the potato chips were. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, what a memorable episode. Literally the only one I ever quote - and quote it often I do :D This time around it felt less intense (it had me laughing quite a bit), probably because I'm not binging it, so I wasn't coming down off of the previous heart-wrenching episode. They still do a good job of imparting to you just how immensely important every tiny action is - even eating potato chips in a natural fashion. If I had to guess, I think my more light-hearted feelings this time around are more along the lines of what's supposed to happen since this episode is chalk full of relief items from icecream to apple withdrawls to Light's porn stash and so on. 

One thing that strikes me out of left field this time around is just how prepared Light is for these kinds of things now (door setup, tv, etc); it's a strange leap from the panicked, mistake-making individual he was a couple episodes ago. That being said, it is indicative of his future activity - maybe they do a better job of the transition in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Rewatching death note is just amazing. I still feel the same suspense! 
>> ARTICLE
"If things get bad I may have to kill Sayu" Jesus, Light. I wasn't actually sure if he would cross that 
line or not. He's obviously reluctant to do so but he's basically confirming he will kill anyone, so his
father isn't safe either.

Damn, Aizawa looks like a different person, I didn't even think it was him until he was called by name.

Seriously? A missile? That was unexpected.

Light is treating Misa pretty badly, she seemed to be blindly devoted to him though so I'm not sure if that 
will cause any issues or not.

Mello is pretty damn evil, it seems him having a notebook might be worse than the actual Kira at this rate.
What does he gain by killing N's allies? I guess Mello wants to be the one to capture Kira, but did he really
do that just to beat N?

However, now Light actually has a lead, interestingly enough a lead that also brings him closer to N as well.

Also, I want to see N actually do some stuff, at this point he's basically all talk while acting like L.

Questions:

1. I'm not sure, I don't really know any of their names but I guess it would be Rem. I'm afraid to google stuff because of spoilers.

2. Jessica Jones, I really like David Tennant and the show was great. Would recommend it.

I'd say she understands that his mind is all twisted right now. Unless Light continues to treat her like garbage, I doubt she'll turn on him.

> I'm not sure, I don't really know any of their names but I guess it would be Rem. I'm afraid to google stuff because of spoilers.

Smart. I like Rem's as well. I think the ones with names are Ryuk, Rem, Gelus (Misa's admirer), Armonia Justin (the jewels), and I already forget this new guy who is going to the human world.

Yeah, I agree actually, though she might try and help him and screw something up because of it possibly.

Eh, I got hit by a pretty huge spoiler for FMA:B by Googling a character about 2 weeks ago. Avoiding it as much as I can after that, haven't finished the anime yet because of it =/

Mmm, out of them I like Rem the best anyway I'd say. Her design is cool and I liked her personality too from what we saw of it.
>> ARTICLE
> though she might try and help him and screw something up because of it possibly.

She was never that bad, looking back so I hope she's passed this. You could be right though. Maybe she'll end up sacrificing herself. Put herself in harm's way just so she can find out someone's name.

> Eh, I got hit by a pretty huge spoiler for FMA:B by Googling a character about 2 weeks ago. Avoiding it as much as I can after that, haven't finished the anime yet because of it =/

Yep. I've been spoiled multiple times by searching characters. Terrible. As long as we never do it again, right? FMA:B will probably still be worth it in the end. I've finished a couple shows where I know big spoilers, and you probably have too. Hopefully not thought, it does suck a bit.

Light screwed up pretty badly today, leading to the deaths of more minor characters."I can't do anything", is such a juicy line to hear from him. For someone named Mello he sure is ruthless about killing his own subordinates, his keikaku was badass too, involving hijacking, an underground base and a missile.        
As for N, even light lampshades the fact he acts like L,not much else we can say about him really.He sure likes twirling his hair and pplaying puzzles tho.

No, this is a hijacking. You hijacked the plane. Mellos crew is crazy.


[Mello up close.](http://i.imgur.com/tRXLXfd.png) This guy is seriously a whacko. How did they train someone like this? Why would he ever have been considered a successor to L? Or has he truly become this way in the past 4 years or so because he feels inadequate next to Near?


How many die does N have, jeez.


Heart sank when those bullets fired. Hes just putting on a show.


Lights in a bind here. He cant do anything right now. Hes yelling at Misa, and shes scared for him.


Light, dont do it. Dont.


Good Light.


YES THEYRE BOTH OK!!!!


I really hope they can catch the chopper. Hopefully they dont start killing the names of the officers they know. Like all the Yagamis.


A missle?!?! I bet thats illegal.


And boom goes the helicopter.


Light, Im proud of you. You didnt kill Sayu. Thats a good thing, buddy. Dont fret too much. Youll work through this. Youll get the notebook back.


So Mellos killing all of Nears people? Is he gonna kill Near too? Nope. He left just a few of them.


[Light and N up close.](http://i.imgur.com/2A0g9bE.png) Somewhat similar to the time it happened to [Light and L](http://i.imgur.com/19Z28ie.png) in episode 17.


Yes, jeez, work together already. Please. You both need to get rid of Mello right now.


Oooooh, some new Shinigami.


What happened at the end there? Ryuk stole this guys notebook and dropped it into the human world?


**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**


This new Shinigami guy is funny. The jewel Shinigami corrects him and gives him his proper name, but the guy doesnt care at all. Hes also has no interest in going to the human world. This sucks. I like him. This show needs more Shinigami.


Prediction time. Ryuk has been watching Light for some time from the Shinigami realm. Being bored up in the Shinigami realm and wanting to keep his own notebook, Ryuk stole this other guys notebook and dropped it into the human world so Light could pick it up. Now Ryuk gets to go down and hang out with the guy hes been watching, and also gives him the means to achieve his dreams.


Maybe I got some of the ownership rules messed up, but basically, Ryuk is putting on an act so Light doesnt realize how much he cares for him. Ryuk is going to end up sacrificing himself at some point to prolong Lights life. Light, after going through some more morally question events (like this one with Sayu) will eventually realize hes not as evil as he thought, and will be more lax with killing people. Hell strike a healthy balance, and together with Misa, will live for a long as time since they both have extended lives thanks to Shinigami deaths.

There's [Osomatsu-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9884/Osomatsu-kun) from the 60s and [Osomatsu-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9884/Osomatsu-kun) from the 80s. I'm pretty sure both of those series feature the main Osomatsu brothers as kids. The new series has them as adults. The old stuff is quite different from the new stuff.  They also have ~50 and ~80 episodes compared to the new one being 25.

If you are interested, you probably don't need to watch the originals as they're likely completely difference shows besides the character names. That being said, best of luck if you go back and watch the other shows.

You say that like it's supposed to mean anything to Mello.

> So Mellos killing all of Nears people? Is he gonna kill Near too? Nope. He left just a few of them.

Mello and Near grew up together. They might not get along very well and be rivals (and Mello might be a bit of a murderous psychopath) but so far we haven't seen anything that would imply they actually want each other dead. They're the closest thing to a friend they have. Those other two FBI agents probably just got lucky because Mello didn't know them.

> What happened at the end there? Ryuk stole this guys notebook and dropped it into the human world?

Basically. The notebook Ryuk dropped in episode 1 belonged to that other shinigami, Ryuk either stole or found it. Some of the other shinigami teased in the first or second episode that he had another one but it wasn't explained until now (honestly I completely forgot about this guy).

> Ryuk is putting on an act so Light doesnt realize how much he cares for him. Ryuk is going to end up sacrificing himself at some point to prolong Lights life.

It may be worthwhile to rewatch Light's and Ryuk's first interaction in episode 1 with this prediction in mind. Arguably that was before they got to know each other, but there are still some details that don't mesh very well... like Ryuk warning Light about his eventual death: "And when it's your time to die, it will fall on me to write your name in my Death Note." Technically that could mean he intends to wait until Light is just about to die of old age, but somehow I'm not getting that vibe.
>> ARTICLE
But wait, why would Ryuk write Light's name just before he's about to die? Would that be like a mercy killing or something. I don't remember that being a rule for the Shinigami to kill their human.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't remember that being a rule for the Shinigami to kill their human.

There's no rule according to random shinigami #4 who said in one episode (paraphrasing):

> Ryuk probably won't need long to get his Death Note back even if a human has it, he has a second one.

implying that Ryuk could kill Light whenever he wants with his second Death Note.

Well, I'm only quoting what he says. He doesn't say on what basis (or whose authority) he intends to decide when it's Light's time to die. He could mean that he's going to make sure Light doesn't take a stab at actual immortality and godhood, or maybe he's just saying that he's going to kill him off if he gets bored of him.

I guess I should disclose that I've watched the series before and I know what happens to Light. [Death Note, fate of Light spoilers](/s "I think Light's final scene is wonderfully realized and there's no one better than Ryuk to end him, especially if you consider the Ryuk = viewer angle that was discussed in the early episode threads.

Damn, Mello is worse than I remembered. Dealing with the mafia to get a death note and then killing as much of Near's team as he knows the name of. He is trying to catch Kira purely because of competition rather than because of any sense of justice, although the same could probably be said for Near.

> Of the Shinigami we've seen so far, which one has your favorite design?  

Rem. She looks really cool but is also a great character. She cared about Misa which makes here different from other Shinigami and also serves a different purpose to the story than being an exposition and explanation bot.

God, I can't even remember. There's too much anime for me to catch up on.

Just how far will Light go? Well he doesn't end up killing his own sister. Only because it would make things worse for him. Light seems to be loosing it a bit.

Speaking of loosing, he totally gets played and looses the Note. Even Near admits he wouldn't have been able to do anything but Light had been give a big wake up call, he needs his A game now.

Near and his team is hit hardest and he looses most of his team. He seems to take it well. Mello looses some men as well but he sets them up and kills them off himself.

Its a odd episode but a good one, we have come a long way from small time mental spars.

Some random thoughts:

Near seems to be left handed.

He also told Light a odd lie.

The bunker thing is cool but very unrealistic. 
>> ARTICLE
Nooooo Aizawa's fro!

You know Light has fallen far when he considers killing his little sister just to keep the Death Note safe.

Right around 17:00 Near's expression is pretty much identical to one L had a number of times. 

**Discussion Topics**

1. Ryuk is still my fav. No one could be better.

2. I honestly don't know. I don't watch television any more. Youtube gives me more than enough content. If you included movies into that though I did watch Kingsmen the Secret Service a few weeks back. I do plan on starting The Office soon though.

I'll never forgive him for considering it. He just better not think it again.

I don't watch much live tv. Just shows on Netflix. I've heard good things about Kingsmen, and the Office is quite good. US version. Not that the UK one is bad.

This was a great episode. I wasn't expecting Mello to kill all of Near's guys at all, my gut reaction was maybe he's trying to kill all the guys that know about L's death or just handicap Near.
>> ARTICLE
Would Mello know that all those people know about L's death. I guess Near probably told most of them anyway. I do think he's trying to handicap Near, but maybe also taunt him a bit. Like, "Hahahaha, I have the Death Note. I'm one step closer to killing Kira" or something like that.
>> ARTICLE
Woo! I'm so stoked for the last part of the series now. I've been dreading it for almost a month but, now that it's here, I'm actually enjoying it a lot more than expected. This episode was great in how it shows just how rusty Light has become in dealing with people as smart as he is. It reminds me of the kinds of panic he had when L first started making his moves in the beginning of the series. That being said, I wish Light would step it up a bit here, make it more of a contest. Now that I'm not so hateful of Near, I'm really enjoying his calm, collected character as well. Wonder what he's going to construct out of random objects next?

/u/Neawia's Questions

>1\. Of the Shinigami we've seen so far, which one has your favorite design?

Most likely Gelus if we're just talking aesthetically.

2\. What was the last tv show you finished watching that wasn't an anime. What did you think of it?

Huh. I can't remember...Breaking Bad maybe? It's been a long time since I've set aside the hours needed to get through a regular television series - the shorter format is one of the reasons I love anime so much. (Note: I always make time for Doctor Who and Game of Thrones, but they're technically ongoing haha)
>> ARTICLE
> That being said, I wish Light would step it up a bit here, make it more of a contest.

Agreed. I expected more of Light. I suppose there hasn't been anyone who is capable of standing up to him until now. He's rusty.

> Most likely Gelus if we're just talking aesthetically.

I did mean mostly aesthetically, yes.

> It's been a long time since I've set aside the hours needed to get through a regular television series

Huh. How did I not realize until now that anime series don't usually have 'one hour' shows. It's almost always ~24 minutes for a series.

There are some some shows that aren't 'one hour' though. Guess you don't watch much of that? The longer ones usually are a bit higher quality because of budget.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, now that we're finally up to episodes that I never watched before, that I don't even have vague memories of, I'm happy to be getting surprised again!

I didn't like the way Light got fooled, I loved it when the police got the better of him, but it's not fun when it's another evil asshole doing it, even worse is because it's not even properly outsmarting him, Light is just way off his game and making Mello work hard for it. Even Ryuk could tell that Light wasn't operating right.  The scene where most of Near's fellow investigators was powerfully depressing, which is what I think they were going for, so I have to say that was well done. 

Who is that Justin guy the Shinigami was talking to there? Why does a shinigami come to him after finding out he can't get his book back from the king? Also: WOOO new shinigami are coming into the picture?!?! I thought that things would get less exciting after L got beaten, but this is great! To answer the question, I think these two new shinigami (if the guy who seemed to call himself Justin was also a shinigami) are the best looking ones of the four, but I like all of their designs. 
>> ARTICLE
You're totally right. I thought maybe Light was just was simply screwing up, but this isn't like him. He's definitely worried about Sayu, and conflicted if he'd have to kill her.

I think Justin is an assistant of sorts to the king and the new Shinigami (Sidoh) was just doing everything he could to get his notebook back.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you, I'll wait to ask more, because the answers might be in the future episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
>I'll kill Sayu if everything else fails

I wish I could see /u/Neawia's reaction right now

NOOOO not Aizawa's stylish Afro. RIP.

And Light already is in a bad situation. Mello doesn't fuck around.

Also Near is so smug about Light not being able to do anything.

Is it just me or is Death Note currently jumping the shark? Because a fucking rocket to transport the Death Note is a bit too much isn't it?

Man Light is such an asshole to Misa... 

The new Shinigami looks a bit like [Anima](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/8/88/FFX_-_Anima_Artwork.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120109160000) from Final Fantasy X in my opinion.

Ah, only 7% certain. Sounds familiar.

Leave me alone or Ill write your names on the internet! What good would that actually do, kid? Its not like theyre criminals.

Its nice to finally see how the real world is dealing with Kira. Crime rates are down, which is to be expected. It seems people are also using Kira threateningly. Maybe some people try filing false reports about people they want to see die.

Poor Mrs. Yagami. This is fucking awful for her. Daughter is lost, husband is dead, son probably never visits (and is also a bit of a lunatic). Ugh, I feel really bad for her. She did nothing to deserve this at all. I hope she can find some happiness again.

Haha, Matsudas giving Ryuk apples now and taking them away. Ballsy.

Hahahahaha! Stupid America! Ive brought you to your knees! Interesting development though. I guess Japan isnt too cool with America or something, and thats why they chose us to fall first. Still, its progress for Kira. This is the first step he needs to become a worldwide authority.

Matsuda has always been the one to view an argument from both sides, Ill give him that. Im glad someone is considering that Kira might be doing something worthwhile.

Ok, this ones a chick for sure. But who is she?

Near has so many toys. Such a child, but it looks like fun. I used to have trains like that when I was a kid.

Ha! Near talking shit to Mello is hilarious, telling him he used him to get his way.

Actually, this woman looks like a combo of Mello and Near. I am *not* making the obvious prediction here. *My* obvious prediction, even though Im tempted because I think it could be true. Still, not saying it.

[Mello and Near up close.](http://i.imgur.com/FOQKI94.png)

That was a cool shot of Mello unwrapping and eating his chocolate and Near twirling his hair.

Lights not using the voice filter anymore when speaking with Near? Why?

So Nears putting things together, and Light is under slight investigation again.

Lol, Ryuk is laughing. Lights in a pickle once again. It makes sense that were back to Light being Kira, but Im hoping they drop this plot point quick enough. They went through it already, and Id hate for it to take up a lot of time again.

So Kiras threatening the POTUS. Its a good move, really. Cant believe the president is this weak though. Something like this just wouldnt actually happen.

This reporter guy really has a hard-on for Kira. And Kira is now inciting violence to get his way. Gotta be careful with that. More people will start to act on their own thinking theyre doing it for Kira.

And I cant help but feel like Misa should eventually come back under investigation too. They should still be considering there to be more than one Kira, and L suspected Misa as well.

Near is pissed. He broke his toy. Light, dont jump the gun just yet. Im sure something will go wrong for you seeing as the episode ended right here.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Dont know who that new woman is that Mello kidnapped. She wasnt around after that brief scene, so who knows if shell be back. I couldnt tell if she left with Mello or stayed with Near. That whole bit was honestly poorly done. They shouldve revealed something about her since they clearly know each other, and Mello used her as a hostage.

No real predictions. Im not really sure where we go from here. This episode brought up past plot points. Lights going to have to prove his innocence again. Hopefully his plan works, and the other task members will see that Light didnt kill Near and thus he cant be Kira.
>> ARTICLE
> why they chose us to fall first

America was actually one of the last to fall. They were one of the few nations willing to stand up to Kira. We've seen snippets of nations backing down leading up to this and, based on Light's forced reaction and inner happiness, we can assume it was a pretty big deal.

>Something like this just wouldnt actually happen.

He's either coming to the end of his second term, or was elected while Kira was a thing. In either case I would imagine that it would be a pretty normal thing to happen. He's either almost finished dealing with this shit and just wants to live (it's not like he can protect himself being the figurehead he is), or got his position despite massive pro-Kira sentiment. I dunno how many people would vote for someone who was going to pit their nation against an invisible force of terror that is killing people opposed to its ideology.
>> ARTICLE

Also a good point.
>> ARTICLE

It's difficult enough to clear your name in today's reality when the media or just a single person accuses you of shit. And that's without fanatic Kira worshipers breaking down your door and setting your house on fire.
>> ARTICLE
That's a good point. There are a lot of legitimate false accusations in today's reality. I wonder if Light has a system where he waits to see if someone is convicted instead of just writing down everyone's name as soon as they're accused.
>> ARTICLE
Well in one of the earlier episodes when Light lost his memories he thinks the following:
>Just as I thought.  
The Kira before I was detained and the one it surfaced afterwards; they must be two different people.  
The aim all clearly doesnt match.  
This Kira is killing criminals as soon as theyve had their crime broadcast on TV regardless of the situation.  
Hes punishing people who never intended to kill; those who sincerely regretted their crimes or people with excusable circumstances.  
The original Kira would have never punished those kinds of people.  


So he only would kill people who he thinks are undoubtly guilty in his eyes.

Light is single-handedly carrying this show now, or he will you  write your name in the INTERNET. The president of the USA sure is weak, Im sure Trump could have built a FIREWALL around Japan.

I agree with what Aizawa said this episode, "They're afraid of the carnage. It's not true peace...". I don't think many people are actually happier living under Kira but they are just afraid to speak out. (Side note, I think Aizawa is my favourite character now)


> Mello vs Near. Would you rather have an endless supply of candy/snacks or an endless supply of toys/games?

Toys/games definitely. Not a fan of chocolate and plus, Mello is always dramatically starting new bars but you never see him finish any so I have to assume he is taking one bite from it and then leaving a trail of nibbled chocolate behind him. 

>> ARTICLE
> I don't think many people are actually happier living under Kira but they are just afraid to speak out.

I feel like the show hasn't done a good job of showing off the Kira supporters. They only show the tv station guy who is also a lunatic. Otherwise we just see the bad side of the world, the violence, the threats, etc.

> so I have to assume he is taking one bite from it and then leaving a trail of nibbled chocolate behind him.

And one more character in the opening that remembers us of his sad death.

Damn seeing Mrs. Yagami tearing up almost got me in tears too, having lost her husband, directly after [Neawia you don't want to read that one](/s "Sayu being in a wheelchair and broken"). Also you can see that she is all alone with her sadness. I bet that Light used the excuse that he is too busy to visit her or shit like that, well he's not there to console her. That this stupid Kira show by Sakura TV is also running in the background also emphasises that even more. That Light should be there for his mother in this difficult time. But no he has to make a paradise where everyone is afraid to get his name known. What a paradise to live always in fear but not of criminals but of a higher entity that will kill you immediately when you anything that is not according to the rules of that entity...

to quote /u/cuckoodev

>[Accurate depiction of Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0XaSvhTYd4)

I really hate that stupid director of Sakura TV... I wouldn't mind him dying...

Ryuk and Matsuda, I would really like those as new best friends...

Matsuda always believing in the good of humans... But he's wrong like he is most of the time. Kira is evil, and if you could see what we see you would think the same.

>There's also one rule that is fake

Well Mello you didn't say the whole truth didn't you? There are two fake rules... But I think saying that there are two fake rules could spark more confusion of which rules are the wrong ones than saying there's one fake rule. 

And Near starts to sow doubts into the rest of the task force.

Man Light really is getting worse and worse, the years without competition were not kind to him...

And again Light's arrogance is causing mistakes. Taunting Near just because you think you've won is gonna bite you in the ass if Near manages to escape. Because you now really convinced Near that he was right with you being Kira.

The same with Lind L. Taylor and with Naomi. He always is too sure about winning.

Yes! How did I miss this? That was all around dumb move by Light.

> What was/is your favourite toy to play with as a kid?

Hmmm, I did have a lot train sets [like this.](http://www.ikea.com/PIAimages/65510_PE176881_S5.JPG) Countless hours mixing and matching to make different railways. Plus Thomas the Tank Engine was awesome so I had a bunch of his trains to push along the tracks.

> Who of you would've waited the 13 days to confirm if that rule is false as a member of the task force?

As in, let Near risk his life? I might've said yes. If he was willing to risk his life for the investigation, who am I to tell him no? All the members of the task force are prepared to lay down their lives. Hell, Mr. Yagami just did the very same not too long ago. Go for it, Near.

> *Safer for people who do what he wants. Can't believe that an U.S. citizen like you speaks in favor for dictatorship.

You're making me out to be a monster!!!! Haha, but I just wanted to pose the question from both sides. I know most people here are cemented in opposition to Kira, but I still wanted to ask.

I can't say I personally agree with what Light has done, but it hasn't been all bad. The world is already a messed up place with plenty of good and plenty of bad. Light's world is the same. It's just that it's different from how we know things as they are now.

> Snacks, because endless games I would never able to finish looks at his endless Steam backlog

Well your comment history shows the truth, you are a Kira supporter through and through (Well your eyes opened after the timeskip since Light is being more shit than usual)

But still kind of ironic that a German must remind you of American values....

Man when I was younger I found Boardgames kind of boring because Videogames were always more flashy and cooler and because of that I wanted to play video games instead of board games but lately I really have so much fun with those, also my Cousin comes over almost every weekend and he, my mother and I play some games together...

This is honestly a problem. I'm worried that this will grow out of control and cause a lot of harm, possibly throwing the world into a big of chaos. It'll be the exact opposite of what Light wanted. I can't believe he condoned that, and if he didn't, well, my worry just goes up.

Sorry. Only L gets to have both.
>> ARTICLE
> I can't believe he condoned that

It feels a bit out of character now that you mention it but remember that this is a guy who, all the way back in episode 1 where he wasn't even evil yet, already thought that the end will always justify all means. I wouldn't be surprised if he plans to kill that entire mob eventually, once they have outlived their usefulness.

> Sorry. Only L gets to have both.

It's just that it doesn't seem like a smart thing to do because of what the consequences could be. More people might follow the mob mentality. That being said, if he does kill the entire mob like you mentioned, it would deter people from doing it in the future.

It's probably pretty great for anyone who doesn't live in Japan and isn't a criminal. For those in Japan, it must be freakin' terrifying. I'm sure even petty petty criminals are dying in Japan while they're probably just deterred elsewhere. I suppose we've already had some video evidence to that effect with the kid who was terrified to have his name recorded for something that I assume was minor like shoplifting or something.

>2\. Mello vs Near. Would you rather have an endless supply of candy/snacks or an endless supply of toys/games?

If I can have savory snacks instead of chocolate/candy/cake, it's a tough choice but I pick snacks. If not, I choose toys and games.

Hmm, I think Light is going to lose, I'm like 80% sure.

I have a feeling it will be somebody from the police who will take him down, most likely being Aizawa. I feel like it has been foreshadowed slightly and he completely underestimates them all the time.

I also think he will ask Ryuk for help at some point but Ryuk will most likely refuse to do so.

13\. In the world of gods of death there are a few copies of what humans may call user guidebook for using the Death Note in the human world. However, the guidebook is not allowed to be delivered to humans.

14\. It is perfectly okay for gods of death to read the guidebook for him/herself and teach humans about its contents, no matter what the content may be.

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. If Mello and Near had worked together. Do you think they would've captured Kira by now?

2. What do you think: Before Mello died, who was closer at catching Kira? Mello or Near?

3. First time viewers, speculation time: Who do you think outsmarted the other Light or Near?
>> ARTICLE
>1\. If Mello and Near had worked together. Do you think they would've captured Kira by now?

Oh yes, definitely. Look at how off-guard Light was since he had what, six years to let his sharp mind stagnate. If they had come at him from multiple sides in an actual coordinated effort it would have all been over at the beginning.

>2\. What do you think: Before Mello died, who was closer at catching Kira? Mello or Near?

Ha. Haha. Mello is horrible >.> And only scores a 0.5 on the L scale of intelligence. He lost the competition he started with Near and he knew it.

[](#kurisudisappointed "Aw. I can't answer this one :(")

> If Mello and Near had worked together. Do you think they would've captured Kira by now?

I guess. If Mello could've stopped kidnapping people for two seconds.

> What do you think: Before Mello died, who was closer at catching Kira? Mello or Near?

Near, bruh. It's in his name.
>> ARTICLE
> If Mello and Near had worked together. Do you think they would've captured Kira by now?

No. They would have argued about everything and it probably would have ended with Mello murdering Near over something insignificant then Light winning because Mello would have little clue how to catch Kira.

> What do you think: Before Mello died, who was closer at catching Kira? Mello or Near?

Near. Mello did almost nothing to catch Kira. He unintentionally kidnapped Kira's sister (who he wouldn't bother to protect anyway) before blowing himself up along with the Japanese police. However, with the right information Mello would probably be more decisive than Near and would just get Light shot.


>> ARTICLE
> They would have argued about everything and it probably would have ended with Mello murdering Near over something insignificant then Light winning because Mello would have little clue how to catch Kira.

That would sound hilarious for a parody version of this show. Or as an alternate ending.

Yeah probably.

I kind of want Light to win just so I can see a perfect cadence to his grand keikaku.

Kiyomi was sort of useful. Oh well, yay for Misa.

> If Mello and Near had worked together. Do you think they would've captured Kira by now?

Possibly. I think they would've had a much better chance had they just put aside their differences. Come to think of it, this was more of a game to them.

> What do you think: Before Mello died, who was closer at catching Kira? Mello or Near?

Near. I have no idea what the hell Mello was up to. He hasn't been around the past few episodes, and they barely explained this move. He was going to try and get close to Kira by kidnapping Kiyomi? Eh. Probably wouldn't have worked. Seemed like a desperate move. Near is at least pretty sure that Light is Kira, and we'll have to see if he's successful.

> First time viewers, speculation time: Who do you think outsmarted the other Light or Near?

I'm going to tag this just in case because I do know what happens, but not how it happens. [Just in case DN](/s "I kind of hope it was Light just because I really don't want Near to be the one who gets Light. I think that'll be bullshit because he's not as good a character as L was.

What have you confirmed, Mikami? That Nears dude is following you?

Matsuda. Srsly tho. Youre jealous that Light is dating KIRAS SPOKESPERSON!!!?!? Thats unprofessional, bro.

Kiyomi is going with Mello. Why? Why is Nears girl willing to work with him? Why would Kiyomi get on the back of a fucking motorcycle of a guy she doesnt know?

What the fuck. Whyd the open fire on that guy? Crimes against Kira. Damn. DAMN. Kiras got pull. That goggle guy was cooler in the 30 seconds we knew him than Mello and Near are combined.

Does Kiyomi have the eyes?

When did she get the eyes?!?!

Light! Save me!

Shut up, and do what I say, woman.

Oh wait, why was the window in the truck busted up? Kiyomi looked like she had blood on her arm.

Light, you arrogant prick. I love it though. Just so aggressively calling Aizawa and Ide idiots.

I figured this was what Light had told her to do. She had to kill herself. Surprised she did it. Wait! No? Wow. Light did it. A truly fucked up but baller move.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Well, Kiyomi, you thought you were something special. Sorry, honey. No one is special to Light.

Honestly, I suppose it's unfair to have any predictions since I kind of know how it's going to end. Still don't know all the details, so I'm excited to find out. After tomorrow, we'll all have seen Death Note.
>> ARTICLE
>Whats going on here? Everythings coming together? Shits about to go down? Oh! Mello didnt finish his chocolate! Its on!

No he just saw that the chocolate was already bitten. AND you can't bite in it dramatically when it isn't a fresh and new piece of chocolate. He knew the viewer saw them and he didn't want to dissappoint the fans with a half ass dramatic bite.

>Who the hell is custom making Nears toys? They all look like real people.

I think he made them himself, you could see him working on them the last few episodes. Also these are [Minor spoiler next two episodes](/s "finger puppets")

>That goggle guy was cooler in the 30 seconds we knew him than Mello and Near are combined.

The only thing manga reader know more about him is that [ Death Note One-Shot Special](/s "He also was a child at Wammy's House where Near and Mello grew up"). But there's not more known about him.

>Oh wait, why was the window in the truck busted up? Kiyomi looked like she had blood on her arm.

Because driving while being dead could make run the truck into the wall of a church for example but when you are still driving with some speed into a wall than it could happen that some things break while you crash into the wall.

Atleast this is what I'm thinking, but I'm also not sure. They really should've showed us what happened after Takada wrote down the name.

I'm back on the hype train. I fell off for the last 2 or 3 episodes but but I'm excited to see the ending play out again. We get to finally see the end of Light's and Near's (and by extension, L's) plans take effect. 

A few major characters died here. I think more importantly, Light killed off one of his most loyal followers with a grin. Shows how much her argument with Misa actually mattered.

I wonder if anyone kept count of how many times Light has said "I've won" or something along those lines. He really needs to start looking at possible outcomes a bit more.

I know that. I'm not some dumb American, you know.

I just don't understand how you could not like chips.

They're chips.

They're all crispy and delicious.

And potato-y.

Potatoes are life.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I don't know. 

I used to like them but I stopped a couple years ago.

I prefer nuts like cashews and stuff!
>> ARTICLE
I've only ever really liked pistachio nuts. Not even peanuts. and Neither is a good substitute for delicious potato products.

But I have to say I prefer fries over potato chips, though. There's no competition.
>> ARTICLE
Ah opps I thought we were on episode 36 already and was prepared to watch the final two episodes tonight. Guess I've only got to watch one episode now.

Holy shit Mello refrains from eating chocolate? What's the world coming to?!

I love how Near's just playing with toys all the time.

Annnnnd Matt dies. He barely does anything in the show at all, mostly just playing video games but damn if he isn't one of my favorite characters.

"The escort team was forced to shoot one of the perpetrators."

Jesus if that's being forced to shoot I'd hate to see what an shootout would be like.

I bet Mello wasn't expected Takada to have a page from the Death Note.
>> ARTICLE
Then why did he make her strip?
>> ARTICLE
I'm....not sure actually. You'd think he would have searched her. I guess Mello's just not as clever as L, Near or Light.
>> ARTICLE
The finale of Death Note is one of the best spanning across all mediums of story-telling. New-comers, do your best to remain unspoilt and enjoy. 
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I was thinking that the finale was going to involve Near and Mello both enacting plans against Light. I guess this pretty much cements that Near wins, between himself and Mello. It seems like Mello and Takada's story's just wrapped each other up to make room for the actual final climax. 

Mikami seems to be seriously underutilized. If he's a guy who is smart enough to know everyone Light wants to kill, and figure out encoded messages without real hints, he should be a bigger player in this game of wits. It's a shame for everyone he worships the bastard.

The world where Kira rules sucks.  
>> ARTICLE
**SAKUJO**

We get to meet Mikami today. I *almost* support him purely because he looks so cool. Also, that means we're on the final stretch now. 

Aizawa continuing to be best guy.

I also completely forgot about the money scene. I got a big grin when I saw them doing that. As near said, the people in the crowd didn't actually care about Kira and are selfish people that just want some fun. The moment money is dropped you also see someone dropping their Kira banner which is such a good shot and completely backs up Near's thoughts.

> How did everyone feel about Misa after this episode?

I still think she's pretty annoying. She really needs to start thinking for herself and not just obey everything Light tells her to do. Her doing that killed Rem.

> Who was your best girl of the winter season?

From the winter season I literally only watched 5 episodes of Erased so I basically have no choice than to say Airi Katagiri (no, I'm not going to say a 10 year old). I tend to watch the first few episodes of things that interest me then leave it until the season finishes so I know what is good and don't need to wait for release of episodes.

That small scene with Aizawa and family is what the anime needs right now, even thought it doesn't advance the plot, it gives us time to breathe and also tell us a lot more about Aizawa's character.

[Ryuks legs, jeez.](http://i.imgur.com/GLdhA7W.png)

So Aizawa is going to be the challenger here? Oh, and his kid. Dont push yourself too hard Aizawa or Kira will kill you.

So whats plan 3, have Misa kill Aizawa? Or do something greater? Sounds like something more. Misas excited.

[Near up close.](http://i.imgur.com/4k4MwWw.png)

Aizawa cant give Near the names, but he just said, Come to think of it, Light did volunteer.

OH Surprise. Near just figured it out, uh, maybe not because of the name though.

Misa playing dress up. Still waiting to see what the plan was. What did Misa go and do? Something to do with the Kiras Kingdom show maybe.

[Aizawa, youre not cute anymore.](http://i.imgur.com/7rsu70Q.png)

Ryuks eyes, and some dudes eyes? What?

What? DELETE!!! Fuck, his pen stylings are, ehehe, *light* years ahead of Lights. Looks like this is a new guy. I dont remember hearing his name before.

So Light got rid of Misas eyes. Thats why she was so happy to just be Lights wife. She doesnt remember anything anymore.

Ok, so this new guy has been handpicked by Light to be the right hand of god. Pretty cool.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

[Bonus gfy of Misa yelling at a computer.](http://gfycat.com/IncredibleUnawareBear)

Can someone clarify as to which notebooks are currently in whose possession. Light has Rems, correct? Sidoh took his back, which means Lights original notebook is gone. Misa had Ryuks book, which is the one the new guy now has. Im just forgetting, but when did Ryuk hand over *his* notebook?

This episode was a little boring. Im not thrilled that theyre coming back to the whole Light is Kira thing again. Weve been down this road once and it lasted for a while back then. I really dont want Near just rehashing that plot point.

The ending of this episode was great though. Im quite interested to see what this new guy has in store. Kira picked someone to be his right hand man. Truthfully though, I wished we couldve made been shown some footage of this guy before now. He did come out of nowhere.

Too bad about Misa. She severely reduced her lifespan (thanks to Rems sacrifice its not too bad), but she barely got to put the eyes to use. Now she doesnt remember anything, not that she cares. She can finally just be a normal person, Lights girlfriend/wife. Still, more rehashing. Had to give up possession of the Death Note so shed look innocent to the investigation team.

Still no predictions since were following the same main plot again; prove Light isnt Kira. The new guy is either gonna be loyal to Kira or eventually move on his own, but hes still more capable than Misa since he thinks similarly to Light.

Also, great Ryuk episode. He had some funny lines, and was just kind of floating about the whole time.
>> ARTICLE
>Aizawa cant give Near the names, but he just said, Come to think of it, Light did volunteer.

Well I don't know how clear it was in the English dub but in the German dub I think it was pretty clear that he was thinking that line and didn't say it...

>What? DELETE!!! Fuck, his pen stylings are, ehehe, light years ahead of Lights. Looks like this is a new guy. I dont remember hearing his name before.

>> ARTICLE
I don't know. Live with my past predictions for now? I also know a spoiler or two that takes place in the remaining episodes so it's tough to make true predictions without using that info.
>> ARTICLE
We can use my prediction:

You know when **L**(ight) died, he didn't actually die. What happened was, when he stood out in the rain, his hair dye started to wash out. In a panic he faked his own death and escaped to America where he made sure everyone knew that America weren't going to chase Kira so that his team couldn't follow him. While there he had a mid-life crisis about his hair and wouldn't leave his bed, not eating for days. Because of this he ended up resting well so he didn't have bags under his eyes and because of the lack of eating, shrunk a bit and shook his eating habits. Basically, he became Near.

I put way too much effort into that.

[](#imdone)

EDIT: **L**(ight)
>> ARTICLE
> You know when Light died

Ahem. I mean we all want him brought to justice sooner or later, but are we just pretending he's dead now?

> he ended up resting well so he didn't have bags under his eyes

If only that was how it worked, then maybe my eyes could go back to looking normal.

You're right. **L**(ight) is a theory for another day.

That makes sense. Yes, I'm watching the dub. I guess I just didn't hear that fully.

> I mean, he is Kira.

Well... yeah. I guess it's just because he hasn't done much to stir up suspicion for a second time. I understood it the first time. But now Near is just coming in like, "Hey guys, was this guy ever thought to be Kira by the better version of me? He was? Let's revist that."
>> ARTICLE
The one Misa had was the one she was given by Rem. Light's is Rem's personal one (that he took when she died).

Ok, so who has which notebook currently? Mikami has Misa's? The one that Rem gave to her. And Light still has one? Rem's personal notebook.

Yep, the first one with the rules is gone.

I got 20th Century Boys vibes from the Kira TV stuff.

We get the introduction of a interesting character, someone chosen by Light to do his work. This can only end well.

Near is getting closer but the rug is pulled from under him. But he has Light in his sights. 
>> ARTICLE
Light basically confirmed to N that he is Kira. And N is not letting him go that easily. Aizawa (it _is_ Aizawa, right? Still can't recognize him without the afro) is pretty sure about it now and the other ones, excluding Matsuda of course, are probably doubting Light by now as well. The endgame starts now.

Lol. I didn't remember how they got out of this, especially not them just throwing money at the mob. They figured those lowlives (and Matsuda) out perfectly. Ryuk got some pretty good reasoning too.

> Damn, Near was prepared for this situation!

No shit Light. Who would have thought. You know who would have expected this? Every single one of your victims.

10 Million Dollars in Apples? Somebody at /r/theydidthemath better get onto this.

Aizawa got his own colour swap! We JoJo now!

Misa is actually very tolerable this episode, she hasn't been annoying a single time yet even though she had a few lines of dialogue. But who the fuck [opens files with a double middle click?](https://i.imgur.com/DgKitOm.png)

Aizawa/Near best investigation team-up.

[Yes! Crazy guy is here!](https://i.imgur.com/Qu2TZuW.png) I was waiting for him to turn up. Honestly I forgot that the 3rd and 4th Kira were different people so when RealL investigated that company and we saw their faces, I was really confused that this guy wasn't among them. I think you'll find that the 4th Kira is much more fun to watch than the 3rd.

You thought Light was able to write dramatically? Light got nothing on Teru Mikami! And he even kills of Demigawa! So he's a good guy, right?

Well Light the devotion of your follower isn't very great isn't it, money is more important to them.

Did Light really think that Demigawa wouldn't chase the money?

Being bored is only secondary for Ryuk now... Apples are more important now. 

There aren't many German voice actresses to play little girls apparently, because Aizawa's daughter has the same voice as young Sayu.

Damn Light you do mistake after mistake, also it looks like your luck has also run out. What happened to ya? L couldn't be the only reason to keep your head trained and fit...

That Kira temple Demigawa is trying to raise money for could belong into /r/shittykickstarters

And here we go guys it's Mikami. He's probably my favorite character after L.

**Discussion Topics**

1. Her eyes look empty after losing her memories of the Death note again. Feels bad yo. Still don't like her though.

2. Best girl of the winter season for me was definitely Fujinuma Sachiko from Erased. This also makes her best mom.
>> ARTICLE
A new challenger appears.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh, here's another development I never saw coming! There is also a THIRD Kira now! Since I never finished Death Note the first time I saw up to Saya's kidnapping, I had always assumed that the rest of the series was going to be about Mello and Near slowly but surely destroying Light's life (not entirely different from what's happening so far, but I thought the entire thing was going to be about saving Saya and Near also trying to catch Mello). 

Near is doing great, I don't like him as much as Ryuzaki yet, but he's pretty cool. Aizawa's daughter is almost all grown up now too, I wonder if she and Saya are friends. Misa looks too good in that skirt she had on, I wonder if she is oblivious, doesn't care, or is happy about what people must think when they come in and see her like that. 

Mikami looks pretty cool right off the bat, and his catchphrase is cool too, but being a Kira worshipper is bad, imo. 

I've been thinking for a couple of days now, and with the introduction of Kira 3 it is reinforcing my idea, that Death Note could potentially have become a long-running series where even after Light inevitably dies or gets caught or both, someone like him will find another Death Note (or the current ones just change hands) and the murders will continue, and the current L will always be smart enough to have a successor. So the manga could have kept going for as long as the author wanted to keep making up more mental death-matches between magical serial killers and quirky detectives. 
>> ARTICLE
>1\. How did everyone feel about Misa after this episode?

Eh, not really any different then before.

>2\. Who was your best girl of the winter season?

>> ARTICLE
What up haters todays episode is called Matsuda, does your favourite character in this show have an episode named after him? NO HE DOESN'T SO SUCK IT UP!

Today is Matsuda-day. His time to shine.


Why did anyone cast Misa? She can't even do a correct love scene, because she can't seperate work and personal.

>Ill give you this strawberry if you keep it a secret, OK?

I too would keep secrets if I'd get a strawberry in exchange.

LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE HAVE SECRET MEETINGS, JUST SO SOMEONE EAVESDROPPING CAN HEAR US.

YEAH IT WOULD TOTALLY SUCK I SOMEONE WOULD LISTEN WHAT WE SAY HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR.

Well Matsuda is atleast good in one thing, improvising to be Misa's manager and trying to change the suspect to her.

I always find this episode so funny. Even though Matsuda is in a bad situation he still manages to make the best out of it. While still being funny.

The stunt that Matsuda is pulling off requires a lot of trust in L and also a lot of guts. But it's to save his life so, any danger is better than doing nothing.

Interesting that nobody is doubting the lack of blood there.

This white haired guy is already dead to all of them because everyone is ignoring him.

>But if they supposed to be eight, why are there only seven?

You would've known if you had installed the cameras earlier.

New Rules:

31. **If the Death Note is stolen and the owner is killed by the thief, its ownership will automatically be transferred to the thief.**
32. **When the Same name is written on more than two Death Notes, the Note which was filled in will take effect, regardless of the time of death**

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. On a scale from Matsuda to Matsuda how Matsuda are you?

2. Who of you is missing Ryuk? (inbound everyone)

3. What is your favourite romance story?


Also as a goodbye to the first opening I post a bonus into the next comments. Today you have a lot of reading to do. Yes /u/Neawia it's that thing I teased months back when you were planning the rewatch

I tend to think I lean a little more toward Matsuda, but I also know that there's at least a hint of Matsuda in me too. I dunno, it's really hard to say...Matsuda I guess?

>2\. Who of you is missing Ryuk? (inbound everyone)

I have only recently entered the world of "Comment Faces" - but I find none that seem to express general assent. Like a nod or something - but if such a face exists, that's my response XD

So first I wanna start with saying that I'm a huge fan of the series "What's in an OP" by /u/G-0ff (aka [Mother's Basement on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBs2Y3i14e1NWQxOGliatmg)). So for this rewatch I plan to do something of that sort with the first opening of Death Note. First I want to say I'm not a writer, and I'm really not used to do these kind of analyses and interpretations, I even hated to do these things in school, but I had fun doing it for something I'm interested in. Also I'm not a native English speaker so if you find major errors in either grammar or spelling, please point them out to me politely. Also everything I will talk about is about past events, so when I say "he never does X or that", I'm just talking about things we've seen so far, I will try to not spoil anything about future events in here. So without further ado my analysis or "What's in an OP?" for Death Notes first opening "the WORLD " by Nightmare.

So some things I want to adress first, I will differentiate between Kira and Light here, whenever I think what site of Light is showing in the moment, because we know that Kira is a corrupted Light more or less. We see that when Light lost all his memories of the Death Note that he is actually a sincere and just person with a good heart instead of a manipulating mastermind who wants to eradicate everything that opposes him.

The first we see in this opening is [Kiras face and opening his eye](http://i.imgur.com/0ws01j4.png) in a black background, I assume it is Kira, because everytime Light is doing something evil or when he's influenced by the Death Note his eyes get red. So Kiras face dominates the picture (not like there's something else there), and the whole picture reminds me a lot of the [Spoiler Warning I guess][End of Evangelion movie poster](http://i.imgur.com/soGNBPJ.jpg), just that everything except the face is the opposite, Kiras face is looking down and it's in the foreground, and there are no people except him. But I digress... So I interpret this opening moment of the opening as the awakening of the god Kira looking down on earth/humanity with his ever watching eye, but he is born in darkness, because either him or the world (I'm not sure) is evil and tainted.  
After that we cut to [Kira lying in front of what looks like stained glass](http://i.imgur.com/m8JCFPQ.png), and the design of the glass looks like it's from a church window, also there's so much light coming through these windows that the front of Kiras body is full of shadows, we can't even see his face, so I can't be sure if it is still Kira or Light who is lying down there. The church symbolism is there to confirm the picture of holiness that Kira thinks of himself, but the shadows on his body tell a different story, he is a creature of the darkness that only pretends that it is something good and bright. The opening likes to show the site that Kira sees in himself and the site that L and the others who oppose Kira see in him, and it let's us decide what site we're on.  
The next picture is [Kira looking directly into the camera](http://i.imgur.com/bAlp08y.png), this just shows again what the first picture told us, only that it also involves the viewer, it means that even the viewer can't escape Kiras judgement, he sees everything.  
The last of the four fast cut opening pictures is [Kira being in front of very bright lights](http://i.imgur.com/pZc7rdM.png), that look like spotlights, only his arm and his head are visible, almost like he tries to escape the picture. These spotlights could represent the police that is chasing him, and L who's suspecting Light of being Kira but he just doesn't has enough evidence to convict him. Also it could be that these are the lights that shined through the stained glass earlier making the light source an artificial one instead of the sun, revealing that he is nothing more that a fake god who only uses powers borrowed from a real god.

So now we're seeing [Ryuk with a big smile and red glowing eyes in front a yellow cloudy sky and a city skyline with skyscrapers](http://i.imgur.com/Qvh9dIY.png), we see Ryuk and that background from a low angle shot (little fun fact that perspective is called frog perspective in German). Not much to talk about here for me here... Because I can't see anything in this shot except Ryuk enjoying the show he get's to see. Maybe the yellow cloudy sky is representing how sick the world and humanity (represented by the skyscrapers) has become (because let's be real yellow clouds especially with such green tint really look not natural and almost like a fallout)

The next shot is more interesting though [Kira looking away from the camera, almost ashamed and his hair is blue](http://i.imgur.com/I4yqQoG.png).
This is interesting because the opening likes to change the hair color in some of the more stylised scenes. I originally thought that blue colours in the OP are the opposing colours of Kira, because of his eyes and everything else with associated with the Shinigami powers is represented with the colour red. So I initially interpreted it with that this means that Light has regrets for his actions and that he thinks that killing is wrong, so it's opposing everything Kira stands for, but never in this show we see Kira/Light having any sort of regrets and that's why I'm not sure what to say about this picture.

The next shot is a bit clearer to me, [Light inside the red shadow of Ryuk lying on the ground](http://i.imgur.com/QHxoGfl.png). I think it just means that Light is more and more absorbed by the power the Death Note and Ryuk is giving him. Almost being some sort of god but never truly, only a shadow of a god.

And now onto my favourite picture in this opening, [Death Notes version of Michelangelos famous fresco "The Creation of Adam"](http://i.imgur.com/d6fSU0O.png). Here is a [link to the original picture for comparision](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Creaci%C3%B3n_de_Ad%C3%A1n_\(Miguel_%C3%81ngel\).jpg). One of the biggest differences there's an apple in the center of the picture instead of two fingers trying to touch each other. Also Light is giving the apple away while Adam is getting the spark of life from god. The apple in my opinion is a metaphor for the powers of the Death Note, because the apple is often considered the fruit of temptation. Also the powers of the Death Note are the exact opposite of the spark of life. What is also interesting Light wears the long handcuffs he's wearing at the moment in the series. This whole picture is just showing the whole part of the show where Kira is giving away his powers and goes into imprisonment to prove his innocence. He is giving away his powers to Ryuk represented by the apple, he is losing what looks like his wings, so he also loses his divineness and he gets chained down on earth again after being very close to the heavens. Also light and darkness are fighting each other in this picture from the left hand side bright sunrays while on the right hand side, Ryuks side, only darkness and death. With giving away his powers Kira becomes literally Light again.

The next scene in this opening is the camera zooming out from Kiras eye and doing a 180 spin and zooming back into Ls eye. They both stand one two different plattforms, of same height. The height of the plattforms is showing that both are one the same intellectual level. They're looking each other in the eye because they know about each other L knows that Light is Kira and Light knows Ls face. But the gap between those two plattforms is too big to reach each other meaning that they just don't have enough information or evidence to reach the other and put each other down.

Next we get to see the title card and damn this thing looks gothic as fuck, I always love the way anime are overdesigning their title cards.

While the titlecard is fading we see an apple falling down into Lights hand. Again my theory of the apple representing the powers of the Death Note gets supported, because the apple is delivered the same way as the Death Note, by falling from the sky. Also I love how Light is catching the apple in the rhythm of the drum.


Moving onto the next scene, [we see Light walking on a narrow plank, the plank is above the skyline of the city, he still holds the apple in his hand](http://i.imgur.com/0vI5xni.png) (even though we can't see it because of the camera perspective). This whole scene shows how Light is doing a balancing act of hiding his powers (=the apple) from his family and the police, and if he should fail his fall will be deep and deadly.

For the next scenes I have nothing, really totally nothing... Don't know how to connect anything here with what is happening in the show, or the character. So enjoy some moments of birds and zooming out of apples

After all that we see Misa with blue hair and yellow eyes lying on the ground, looking up into the camera also in my opinion she looks a bit scared, but of what? Also she is wearing a necklace with a cross. Well she likes to look very gothic, so that isn't very unusual of her. But the cross is lying aside from her and it could mean that her old beliefs are tossed aside because she just saw the powers of a shinigami, but I'm really unsure about that one. Also I think she's blue (the Kira opposing colour) in the opening because she really is useless to Kira until now, because of her L managed to have both Kira and her confined. Only because of Lights ridiculous plan to give away their Death Notes and losing their memories managed to save them, but this was more of an emergency plan.

The next scene is a pan shot to the top of a scyscraper, on the roof there's Light with the apple in front of a big yellow glowing moon, and he takes a bite from the apple, so he gets a taste of the power of the Death Note figuratively and literally by biting into the apple.

Continued next comment....
>> ARTICLE
This is followed by a line up of the members of the Task force from left to right:

* Hideki Ide: who left the team when L revealed himself. He looks rather pale and has empty eyes, this makes him appear dead. But he never died so I'm a bit unsure here how to understand that. I think it is that because he left the task force early, he's represented as dead because he's not a real part of the team anymore. Only occasionally helping out. For example when saving Chief Yagami from Kira 2's Shinigami eyes in episode 11.

* Kanzo Mogi: He's looking to the left hand top corner. It seems he's looking around and not in front of him like the rest of the team. Maybe this represents his ability of intelligence gathering. He does not only concentrate on the target but also gathers all the information about everything around the target so seeing the big picture.

* Soichiro Yagami: Just looking forward eager to capture Kira, also he has a very serious look on his face, showing that he's always being professional.

* Touda Matsuda:  Also looking forward at the same thing as Mr. Yagami. Also being quite serious, showing his determination to catch Kira.

* Shuichi Aizawa: Also is looking in front of him but he's looking a bit of distracted. Showing how he has problems with the few time he has with his family because of the case.

* Hirokazu Ukita: Really far in the background almost out of focus, also looking determined at catching Kira, but not enough is shown about him, because he gets killed by Kira 2 before being characterised more.


Then a cut to Watari fully disguised in front of a Spotlight with L's icon on it, quite obviously showing the similarities of Batman and L. Both have a very loyal butler, he has a icon where you easily can get his name just by looking at it. And both are amazing detectives.  
Also this picture shows how Watari is the bridge between L and the outside world by being the only one who can contact L. 


We get a quick shot of Naomi holding her dead fianc Raye Penber in her arms, while crying. Very straight forward, and not much to explain here. Also I never noticed that she was holding Raye in her arms in this scene until now, even though I watched this opening so many times. Also this is one of the moments where the opening could spoil the show but probably only a few people will pick it up before they rewatch it.

Next scene is a nice line up of the Shinigamis, a bit like a character introduction, but we never see enough of them so that I can't say anything about that.

This is followed by a zoom into Kiras eye, followed again by fast overly dramatic drawn lines on paper, so Kira is using the Death Note, the lines from the pen are even red for a short moment. Probably representing the blood of the victims. Not much to interpret because it is really obvious what is happening here. In the next shot we see that Kira kills yet another two criminals, both were already captured, the first one died during the photoshooting for the prison photo. The other one died behind railings, So I assume he was in prison.

After all that we see a zoom into Kiras face followed by [an image, or reflection of Light getting shattered on the ground.](http://imgur.com/a/Vb3zr) That was probably the Light before he used the Death Note, all good in him is now shattered and only Kira remains.

This is followed by Ryuk who flies away from a heap of gravestones, this could show that how Ryuk is also responsible for the deaths that Kira caused, so he basically is doing his job as a shinigami without being a "nerd", by letting someone else do the work.

The next two shots don't make any sense for me, first we see Kira going towards something bright and windy, it looks like he is in a building and somewhere a door opened where a strong breeze is coming from. Next we see another confrontation of Kira/Light and L, but this time Lights eyes are grey and lifeless, and Ls eyes are still blue like in the similiar scene earlier. Maybe it should show that Light left all humanity behind him, but I'm not very sure here.

The last scene of this opening is a very sad Misa stumbeling through the rain, she looks broken until she notices Light standing beneath a light post, being all misterious and stretching out his hand like "follow me to a better world" and Misa agrees and attempts to reach for Lights hand, Light than stretches out his arm further and it blends into another painting of what is probably god from another fresko or painting by Michelangelo (he looks similiar to god from the fresco "The creation of Adam") showing how Light appears like a god for Misa (and for himself) cause we all know how much Misa is adoring Light (The German word for "to adore sb." is "vergttern" a literal translated could "to godify" what I seem fitting with how Kira sees himself), and after that we see the bitten apple again and it turns into the Death Note, proving in my opinion the point that the apple was a metaphor for the powers of the Death Note the whole time.

Here I am, finally getting around to posting a response again! I just want to say, this was awesome. Definitely well done, and it obviously took a lot of effort to properly analyze everything. Im assuming this was the big, fancy thing you had planned. The one you told me about before the rewatch started, right?

Ok, I also dont usually do analysis type stuff, so everything I say could technically be a load of crap. Fair warning. And if I dont respond to all of it, its because I simply agree with your analysis and dont really have anything else to add.

- - -

> So I interpret this opening moment of the opening as the awakening of the god Kira looking down on earth/humanity with his ever watching eye

I think thats a good way of looking at it. Kiras being awakened and looking down on everyone. Maybe from a similar perspective of the the Shinigami. They always look down on the human realm (literally). Theyre technically gods, and Light wants to be a god.

> The next picture is Kira looking directly into the camera

This is a very Lelouch type picture. The comparisons personality-wise definitely exist, but their designs are a little similar. At least in the sinister moments.

> So I initially interpreted it with that this means that Light has regrets for his actions and that he thinks that killing is wrong, so it's opposing everything Kira stands for

I think this makes sense. The just side of Light, the good side, is definitely someone who is in opposition to what Kira stands for. Hes technically an enemy of Kira just like L is (and to an extent, Misa, who is more of helpful annoyance).

> With giving away his powers Kira becomes literally Light again.

I agree with your paragraph about The Creation of Adam picture. The fruit is temptation. He is tempted by the Death Note, tempted by Ryuk. Light also gives away the apples in order to indulge in his temptation. Its almost like a trade. Ryuk gets apples, and Light gets the Death Note.

> Also I think she's blue (the Kira opposing colour) in the opening because she really is useless to Kira until now, because of her L managed to have both Kira and her confined.

Yes, fully agree. While Light/Kira has been able to use Misa to his advantage, she has caused more problems than shes helped solve at this point in the series.

> he takes a bite from the apple, so he gets a taste of the power of the Death Note figuratively and literally by biting into the apple.

If my crazy theory of Light become a Shinigami comes true at the end of the series, this will make even more sense considering Shinigami love apples. Kind of like a foreshadowing snack. I agree with the rest of what you said as well.

> Also this is one of the moments where the opening could spoil the show but probably only a few people will pick it up before they rewatch it.

I honestly did not notice what it was until after it happened. Once Noami and Raye were dead, then you really notice it. Im pretty sure theres a name for this phenomenon, when you only notice something after youve experienced it for yourself. Something like that.

> This is followed by Ryuk who flies away from a heap of gravestones, this could show that how Ryuk is also responsible for the deaths that Kira caused, so he basically is doing his job as a shinigami without being a "nerd", by letting someone else do the work.

Lol, nerd. So basically Ryuk is a lazy bum whos getting the smart kid in class to do his homework for him. Definitely makes sense.

> The German word for "to adore sb." is "vergttern" a literal translated could "to godify" what I seem fitting with how Kira sees himself

Thats really interesting, and its entirely appropriate for this situation. Misa definitely thinks of Kira as a savior who is doing the right thing.

Once more, awesome analysis. I agree with pretty much everything you wrote. I only wish I hadnt been banned that day so I couldve responded on time. You definitely deserved a bit more attention on this.

Ryuk clearly must represent all Shinigamis, just because one Shinigami likes apples doesn't mean that every Shinigami does.

But I get what you mean.

>Lol, nerd. So basically Ryuk is a lazy bum whos getting the smart kid in class to do his homework for him. Definitely makes sense.

I mean Ryuk said in the first episode (atleast in the German Dub) if you're killing humans as a shinigami without the reason of prolonging your life your getting called nerd by the other shinigamis.

>Once more, awesome analysis. I agree with pretty much everything you wrote. I only wish I hadnt been banned that day so I couldve responded on time. You definitely deserved a bit more attention on this.

Yeah it was really unfortunate, but atleast I got atleast one person to answer to it, maybe I get a response months later by someone stumbling into this thread and seeing the analysis.

Oh. I thought Ryuk had mentioned that it was a Shinigami thing that they all like apples. That's my bad then. I guess it still makes a little sense since Light is paired with Ryuk.

> I mean Ryuk said in the first episode (atleast in the German Dub) if you're killing humans as a shinigami without the reason of prolonging your life your getting called nerd by the other shinigamis.

Well, Saikimo, not everyone has seen this series 5-6 times and can remember all the little things. Lol, I'm just messing around. I didn't remember that. Pretty funny though.

> Yeah it was really unfortunate, but atleast I got atleast one person to answer to it, maybe I get a response months later by someone stumbling into this thread and seeing the analysis.

If not thing else, it was good practice. Just shows that you do have the ability to analyze something a bit more in depth than usual. Plus you love Death Note so it was probably a really fun thing to do regardless. Always positives.
>> ARTICLE

That was just Light who said that in his message to L with the suicide letter of one of his victims.

Day 19 - Yesterday was a little messy for me. I was busy after I posted my comment so I came back an hour later to check for responses only to find my comment was auto-removed. Fixed a couple things (using 'ay' with too many Ys in the exaggerated word, dayum... and mentioning the abbreviated show name as well as a character from a popular anime-like show).

Still busy, I leave for another hour only to find my second comment was auto-removed. Thanks to /u/rascorpia, I was finally able to post my full comment. I typed out the sound from the SpongeBob 'Stepping on the Beach' song, as well as just making up a word for the comedic sound Light would've made after being kicked in the face.

Just for a little clarification, and maybe if you have a comment removed in the future you'll have an idea why.

Hey! Matsudas finally gonna do something or die maybe.

[The actor love interest looks like Light. I also love that Misa is dressed up as an angel.](http://i.imgur.com/rKHWlgr.png)

WOW!!! L was going to share his cake with Light.

Hahaha! Wtf? Ill give you this strawberry if you keep it a secret, ok? And then the guy (Mogi?) just puts the strawberry in his pocket. What? Who does that?

[Matsuda up close.](http://i.imgur.com/9auPmI3.png)

What is Matsuda even thinking going up there by himself? This is pure stupidity. Are you telling me that the Yotsuba group has no security cameras in their building? Matsudas just pressing his face up against the door of their secret meeting room. And now with Ls warning about not giving themselves away, Matsudas going to get caught, right?

Surprise! He was caught!

[Uggghhh, what did Matsuda do this time?](http://i.imgur.com/pAOqx7w.png)

[You said it, L.](http://puu.sh/nIPNP.webm)

Hey, listen, his phone is playing the OP, OH WAIT, NO IT ISNT!!!

I love when L acts on the phone. This is hilarious.

Damnit, Matsuda, dont drag Misa into this bullshit.

No nudes, huh? Give it a few years. Theyll leak.

[Nice slippers, fellas. Youre a regular buncha murderers.](http://i.imgur.com/37aK3A8.png)

Faking a death. This should be fun.

[Real convincing there, Matsui.](http://puu.sh/nIRqE.webm)

Hahah! This faking Matsuda's death scenario is great. [This guy!](http://puu.sh/nIRwH.webm)

[Seriously, just give me a mystery/comedy/SOL with these two already.](http://i.imgur.com/iP8eX2V.png) Basically an anime buddy cop show. Dressing up in costumes to investigate and get different jobs done.

Ooooooohh, sexy thief lady. Whats her name, again? And the con man too while were at it.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

I don't know. Things have been slow. Not much new. Basically same thoughts, L and Light need to find 'Kira' and once that happens Light and Misa will get their 'powers' back.

On the plus side, I have some extra free time in the upcoming days, so I *actually* plan on going back and organizing my predictions. I swear this time, guys.

Yea, that would actually be amazing, maybe just set in a universe where the Death Note doesn't exist, or Light never picked it up. Would watch.

Today Matsuda proves once and for all that he is useless, at the season finale no less! Fortunately he did manage to redeem himself through  saving himself by killing himself.

All the credit goes to L's quick thinking tho, another trait of the great detective is working on the fly since most of the time the police will be useless; unlike those armchair detective like us who just spend too much time reading mystery novels.

We learned two things today : Kira must be  one the of the eight Yotsuba guys and he does not have shinigami eyes atm (matsuda would have been killed otherwise). Time to place your bets,who do you think is Kira? Long-haired polite dude seems pretty suspicious already.

I'm not sure at the moment, but there's 3 of them that look the most suspicious to me or rather I just don't think it is any of the others. I don't know their names though so I'm not sure what's the best way to say who I mean. The brown haired guy with glasses, the long haired guy and the other guy who has brown hair shaped almost like a V. Wow those descriptions were bad, but hopefully you get who I mean :x
>> ARTICLE
> Today Matsuda proves once and for all that he is useless, at the season finale no less! Fortunately he did manage to redeem himself through saving himself by killing himself.

Question, is there are a reason that one season is considered 19 episodes? Is it because that's basically half of the show's length? Typically anime seasons are 12-13 right? Or 24-26?

> Kira must be one the of the eight Yotsuba guys and he does not have shinigami eyes atm (matsuda would have been killed otherwise).

Interesting. I hadn't even considered that the Yotsuba Kira would ever get Shinigami eyes. I figured Light told Rem not to mention the deal at all. That would just make things way too dangerous.

> Time to place your bets,who do you think is Kira?

[My bet's on this guy.](http://i.imgur.com/pPq5fjo.png) Is he the polite guy you referred to? I don't know. He just looks like anime-villain material.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, pretty much because it's half the show's length.

Long haired polite dude is the  one with the most characterisation  so he's the most suspicious.Pretty much all we can do now is speculate based on character design alone.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, lets just talk about our "secret meeting" in the middle of a hallway instead of just saying meeting.

That and a few other things really show how the Yotsuba group are a bunch of amateurs, at least compared to Light. I don't 
think it will take long at all for them to be dealt with. Or from what happened towards the end of the episode the group
could just end up destroying themselves from the inside at this rate.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone seems like an amateur compared to Light and L. I agree though. The Yotsuba group can't last very long. They're in over their heads. I can't wait to see why exactly Light choose the specific person he did.

New opening next episode! First time watchers will probably be pretty surprised by it, looking forward to the reactions.

As somebody who already knows what's going to happen, it's pretty interesting to see this episode sneakily set up some important stuff for the second movie.

The first ost track that plays this episode is one of my favorites. It just sounds so chill. For anyone who doesn't know it's called "Shinigami Kai B."

Notice that when Light is wondering if he could or would become a killer with Kira's power (While not even realizing that he was Kira) the light disappears from his eyes again, just like when he first became Kira.

Haha Eraldo Coil is just another one of L's aliases.

When L gives Mogi the strawberry he puts it in his pocket. **In his pocket.** Who does that? Why not just eat it?

So the color Matsuda's hair turns when in super serious mode is yellow.

So after this careful planning L is doing Matsuda is actually causing trouble by doing this. Typical Matsuda.

Oh shiiiiit! They've discovered Matsuda! But L's on the job with a brilliant plan! For how quiet L usually is he sure can act. 

"Hey, don't you think this is heading in a weird direction?"

The poor Yotsuba guys. They're so confused.

Oh I remember this plan L has for Matsuda.

Oh god Wedy's acting!

Despite some of the silly moments that happened in this episode it was still pretty serious.

**Discussion Topics**

1. Honestly my favorite thing about Matsuda was that he was considered the idiot of the group. Him being the silly guy made him really like able for me.

2. I don't own a company but I can't help but feel that a popular model can't possibly hurt your business unless it's a super serious one.
>> ARTICLE
[Wedy's role this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9J5tYShNY8)

Also, I just realised that L "Sherlocked" Matsuda this episode. The setup is almost identical even down to obscuring the view and using an ambulance to take the "body".

Man, Matsu you fucked up hard but you redeemed yourself. Though not as hard as the dumbfuck at the end saying he wants out at a meeting for killing people.

I love this episode :D 

>1\. What is your favorite thing about Matsuda?

That he never gives up, no matter what - that unwavering optimism is infectious. And that he's actually quite clever in the moment, even if he lacks the ability of foresight and long-form thinking.

>2\. Would you consider hiring Misa Amane as a spokesperson for your company?

Matsuda is so funny.  He is the clown of this series and he plays the part perfectly.  It's not so much that he is incompetent, it's just that he is so over eager to help that he almost always winds up saying or doing something stupid.  

I cant help but love him.  He's bound to make himself useful eventually right?


And concerning Misa, there's literally nothing I wouldn't hire her to do.  ;)

Damn, I keep skipping an episode for a day or two. It was rather nice being sick for a week and have all the time available.

Anyways. Matsuda. While, yes, he does stupid things, I think in this episode he truly showed that he can be useful....  
IN MESSING WITH L PLANS!!!

In anyone plans now that I think about it. Good thing that L can improvise quickly otherwise Matsuda would've been dead.

Hello. I'm Isai579 and this is my third time watching Death Note. I am also joined by my mother, being this her first anime after years of refusing to watch anime because she "didn't like the style".

***

**Mother Comments:**

* *I'm not sure if I like the direction the series is taking. This isn't a  series about Kira and L anymore. It is about the Death Note*. One of the parts she has enjoyed the most is the constant strategy battles between L and Kira, so she probably was disappointed when that came to a sudden stop.

* She now completely believes that Light lost his memories as Kira. Before this chapter, she suspected he somehow was faking everything.

**My Comments:**

* Even though I have watched this a lot, I keep forgetting who has the Death Note in this part.

I only know the end result of the whole plan Light is having right now, but not the specific steps.

[Ohh my god is is Aizawa thinking?](http://i.imgur.com/GmTa8OR.jpg) Holy shit, someone else than Kira or L is capable of doing investigation work without being ordered to do so?

Aww how cute Takada thinks she something special for Light. HAHAHA it's almost sad.

Man Aizawa found something out on his own, but nobody cares because Near already is so much further.

Ehm I think I found a typo in those rule cards

>[bictims](http://i.imgur.com/MIndRLA.png)

This poor SPK agent scared for his life.

New (Shinigami) rules:

48\. The Death Note will not take effect if you write a specific victims name using several different pages.  
49\. But the front and back of a page is considered as one page. For example the Death Note will still take effect even if you write the victims surname on the front page and given name on the back.

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:


1. Does anyone of you try to stay fit like Mikami?

2. Did you ever wrote secret messages like Takada and Light while the ~~Aizawa~~ the teacher wasn't looking?

/u/Neawia's questions:



>What was your favorite anime of the winter 2016 season?

I'd say Durarara. As a series that is not a sequel to an already aired show from past seasons, I would say Konosuba.

>> ARTICLE
>1\. Does anyone of you try to stay fit like Mikami?

Ah...no. But I used to, so I should probably take it up again. I just don't like doing the whole gym thing, that's not how I used to stay fit, so I should find a sport or something to take up.

>2\. Did you ever wrote secret messages like Takada and Light while the Aizawa the teacher wasn't looking?

Nope. You don't achieve top marks by slacking off gosh-darnit. Although, in actuality, I was never really in a class where we either A) Weren't allowed to talk softly for the entire class every day or B) Had any cute girls to pass notes to nearby

If only they would do their job more often but instead they need to listen to Light an Takada talking the whole time

No but seriously I had so much fun watching both shows. Also the latest opening of Durarara became one of my favourites

[What is that, a PSP ornament?](http://i.imgur.com/PNiiEkT.png)

At least Aizawa is making sense. They had to remove all bugs in the room because Kira called. Wat. Lights super careful about there being wire taps. Kira allows Kiyomi to meet with Light. Suspicious af.

Matsuda loves him some drama.

Why are women like this? Lol, Light is frustrated.

Hahahaha! Well, he could keep two timing them. Are you serious? You dont see any problem with that. Matsudas a pretty funny guy. Why would he suggest something like that?

Ok, things are moving a little too fast between Light and Kiyomi. This has to seem suspicious to everyone. Do they really think Kiyomi is this dumb to fall for Lights act?

Enhance! Read his lips. Wonder if this is Mikami playing along with Lights plan or if hes genuinely confused as to why Ryuk isnt around.

Aizawa doing actual detective work. Nice. He confirmed Lights passing notes with Kiyomi.

[Near up close.](http://i.imgur.com/l2IRflf.png)

Nears pretty confident. He wants Aizawa to be a witness to the end of Kira. Well, good luck, I guess.

Guess Matsuda doesnt get to see MisaMisa perform.

[Mogi up close.](http://i.imgur.com/rPO0vyG.png)

So another member of the Task force has accepted that Light is Kira.

Oh no, Gevanni touched it. Nothing happened. Tooooooo bad.

So they think Gevanni could be under control. Is this coming back to the whole Kira could be controlled thing like back when Light was in lock up?

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Slow episode, but it seems to be building up towards the end. Im a little bummed that a lot of the same plot points are coming up again (suspecting Light, notebook owners under control). It was interesting the first time, but weve already seen it. Near is an alright character, but we already had L who was much better. Theyre basically the same thing. I think they needed to come up with something different to keep things fresh rather than have more detectives to replace L. Mello has barely been around anyway.

I dont know what Lights planning. Light is going to continue killing people. He will always be killing people. Im not sure how having Mikami get caught will work out or how dating Kiras spokeswoman will help. He needs a way to kill everyone that suspects him or knows who he is. You know what, basically just kill a member or two of your task force and also yourself. If Light can convincingly fake his death, no one can suspect him anymore, right?
>> ARTICLE
>What is that, a PSP ornament?

Also noticed that but I forgot to mention it in my comment.

>Matsudas a pretty funny guy. Why would he suggest something like that?

I bet he watches harem shows with bland MCs to self insert. Like he does with the conversations between Light and Takada.

Nice predictions. But I won't say more about them.

It's like he was just hanging his toys on the tree instead of actual ornaments. So... the ornaments go under the tree?

Oh well. We're almost done with the show. I can wait and see what happens.
>> ARTICLE
> Suspicious af.

I suppose Light is just arrogant enough at this point to forget about covering his tracks with the task force at all since he feels that he can outsmart them no matter what happens. He's more interested in getting what he needs to fight Near.

Probably true, but at this stage, Light should be doing everything he can think of to avoid being suspected.

That's such a sloppy thing to do, and it's the most basic thing ever. He was just like 'no cameras pls thx' and only one guy thought that was weird. He didn't even give a reason, I don't think. Light, your hubris is showing.

Oh wow only 3 episodes left!

It was nice to see Near not just guessing everything correctly and considering possibilities, instead
of just assuming like he did with Mikami being X-Kira in the first place. 

I really have no clue how Light can win this anymore though. Every single person apart from Matsuda
is convinced it is him. If he manages to stop one of the groups after him (Mello/Near/Aizawa) I think
the others will take action instantly. Will be interesting to see what he does from here.

More Mello next episode, was wondering what he was doing.

As for the question I think if anyone is going to it will be Aizawa, not sure why, I just have a feeling after this episode..
>> ARTICLE
> As for the question I think if anyone is going to it will be Aizawa, not sure why, I just have a feeling after this episode..

About combining the two last episodes into one day: I can't remember it well but I am in favour of combining them into one day, mostly because I know I'm going to want to watch the last episode straight away. There hasn't been a series where I have willingly not binged on the end.

____

We do get a bit of story progression this time. Near commits to a plan of testing to see if Mikami has a Shinigami with him. Also, Aizawa confirms to himself that Light is Kira but then is shot down by Near (who is now demoted to worst guy). 

> At this point in the show, if Light was going to be caught, who did you think was going to be the one to actually do it?

I'm not going to answer this because I don't trust myself to give a spoiler-free answer.

> What was your favorite anime of the winter 2016 season?

As with last time, I don't have much choice out of what I watched but I bet Erased would take the top spot for me anyway. I finished it today because it finally unlocked on crunchyroll for non-premium users and I really enjoyed it, giving it a 9/10. I don't really get the anti-hype train that took over for the last half.

Light making the decision to kill Raye Penber is actually a major mistake:

Things he stands to gain by **killing** Raye:

* Increased suspicion of L, L now knows that Kira is one of people that he personally tasked to investigate

* Risks being captured from the act of killing Raye.

* Increased Blueray/Dvd sales of Deathnote.

* Epic choir music playing in the background

Things he stands to gain by **not killing** Raye:
 
* Raye notes that Light has a very cute date, then proceeds to investigate another suspect

Thus, regardless of what outcome the killing is, not only is the act 100% morally wrong,it will also  only help L narrow his suspects.

Also L does not want the detail of death to be devealed, he shouldn't have recorded it in the the police database since he already suspects that Kira has access to them.

Fun fact: The name of the date is Yuri, don't you know that's forbidden love?

Maybe use Raye to get closer to L. Raye would still die in the end, but if he can make Raye do stuff like talk to L or investigate his real name, that would be helpful. Raye still didn't do anything to deserve death, but the DN appears to, in essence, make someone your slave, no?

Day 4 - I forgot to put the word Thread at the end of yesterdays posts title. Im a monster.

---

I like the OP a little more. Its quite good, but I dont think Ill ever call it a favorite.

Ryuk has two Death Notes! Ooooohhhhh! Thanks for the info, [Shinigami with gems and jewels in your skull.](http://i.imgur.com/4hS1bal.png) Supports my minor theory of other people using a Shinigami 'device.' Just didnt think the Shinigami could own more than one Death Note.

If I keep bargaining for eyes and wings and whatever else, next thing you know Im gonna end up becoming a real Shinigami. Though who knows. I bet that could be pretty interesting.

YES! Continue to support my little theories this early on. YES!

The Shinigami dont feel like they even have a purpose anymore. Sounds like a struggle a lot of humans go through at one point or another.

[Close up Light face.](http://i.imgur.com/4Hm6TyA.png)

Light telling Ryuk to go one day go home and change his own world, just like he plans on doing to his. Love it. Fate really picked a good duo here. I like these two.

Look, L is good. Hes covering all possibilities of how these six men were killed. Still though, he gets his guesses right on the first try. I really hope theres a reason for this. A reason for him being this good, and its not just the way the story is written.

Im glad Light did these tests. I had been wondering how crazy the deaths could get. Like, a bus flies in through the roof of the prison and crushes his body. How would that be possible? Could the Death Note make things like that happen? Obviously not. Also interesting to hear that Light *can* control people, making them do anything he wants, within reason.

He could just have inmates get in fights and not stop until one of them is dead. I wonder then what would happen if guards intervened. Could they restrain the inmates, halting the Death Notes order? Or would the inmates continue fighting back? Maybe even waiting and going back to finish the job later when they werent restrained.

[How is this comfortable?](http://i.imgur.com/YNbo7X1.png) This is how he is all the time. Get a desk and a chair. If not, get a floor chair or a back rest or something. He wears no shoes or socks, and rests by placing one knee on the ground. Weirdo.

Cmon, Ryuk. Stop asking questions and just watch him work.

Lights walking to this girl, talking to himself (technically) like some strange-o.

This whole situation is fucking genius. Lights amazing. Accomplice in the back. His date would also believe him because hes top of his class, and now this man has to actually prove who he is. Great set up.

[A quick celebration.](http://gfycat.com/BelovedBossyArieltoucan)

However, if Light doesnt kill Raye Penber in a believable way (ideally waiting a bit to do it), then L can still surmise Light might be Kira. L will know the people Raye has been following so it would make sense to investigate those people if Raye dies. Shouldnt matter if the reports say Light is not Kira.

*pause*

HOLY SHIT! Is this why Light didnt tell Ryuk the plan? Light wrote it so that after going under that tunnel (bridge?), this criminal would be able to see Ryuk. Light wanted Ryuk to be surprised at that?!?

*unpause*

OMFG THIS IS EVEN BETTER! Light tricked the criminal. He touched some paper from the DN. The bullets pass right through Ryuk. [Wonderfully creepy.](http://i.imgur.com/UKkzp9I.png) Raye also passes through him.

Damn. Dude gets hit by a car. That sfx of the blood-squish was great. Everyones shocked. This. This was a fantastic scenario to kill a criminal. Kudos, Light. Everything went your way today.

Kill the criminals, fine. Im interested to see Lights reasoning for killing Raye Penber. He hasnt actually done anything deserving of death... aside from being a nuisance for Light.

This ED though is quite fantastic.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Great episode. Honestly, these have all held my interest for every second.

Ive actually received a little bit of early clues to support some random theories I already had. First being that Ryuk likely has **two** Death Notes. Second being Light saying turning into a Shinigami would be interesting.

So, Ill stick with these theories for now

* Someone else currently living (possibility of more than one) has access to a Shinigami device. Its possible that Ryuk still holds his second Death Note. Also, maybe the Death Note is the only kind of  device meaning someone else could have a Death Note and/or has the ability to see Ryuk.

* By the end of the series, Light will physically turn into a Shinigami.

Now, we know things like bullets pass through Ryuk. And apparently other people pass through him as well. However, we didn't get to see the criminal touch Ryuk, and I don't think we've seen Light touch him yet either. So it seems that Ryuk might not be able to touch people who can't see/hear him. However, we don't yet know if he can touch/kill people who have touched the Death Note.

Light doesn't even need to take the deal to kill L. Like I said a day or two ago, he can trick L into touching the Death Note. Hell, he can just throw the Death Note at him or slap him with it. That could allow Ryuk to kill L, thus prolonging Light's life and Ryuk's entertainment.
>> ARTICLE
>He could just have inmates get in fights and not stop until one of them is dead.

nevermind your idea doesn't break the rule I talked about.
[Death Note rule spoiler](/s "One rule of the Death Note is that you can only kill one person per name with the Death Note, if the cause of death would involve another human that person simply dies of a heart attack")

>First being that Ryuk likely has two Death Notes.

this is known since episode one I believe, on of the Shinigamis says something like: "Don't you have 2 Death Notes" before Ryuk goes to the human world.

>we know things like bullets pass through Ryuk.

Still he is able to grab things of the human world, like apples if he wants.

>That could allow Ryuk to kill L, thus prolonging Light's life and Ryuk's entertainment.

But why should Ryuk do this? First he is in the neutral camp, second this would take away a major factor of the entertainment for him, because watching Kira vs L is just so entertaining.

>> ARTICLE
> this is known since episode one I believe, on of the Shinigamis says something like: "Don't you have 2 Death Notes" before Ryuk goes to the human world.

Didn't catch that. Nice.

> Still he is able to grab things of the human world, like apples if he wants.

So maybe if *he* is the one to touch something, it's ok. He has to consciously acknowledge he's about to touch something. But if random objects connect with him that he isn't aware of, they'll pass through him.

> But why should Ryuk do this? First he is in the neutral camp, second this would take away a major factor of the entertainment for him, because watching Kira vs L is just so entertaining.

Yeah, you're right. What if Light was going to die though? Does Ryuk still obtain his remaining years if he's not the one to kill Light (or strike that deal)? I don't know. Plus I still think it's possible that Ryuk might eventually come to be on Light's side, but that's pure baseless speculation at this point.

> Does Ryuk still obtain his remaining years if he's not the one to kill Light (or strike that deal)?

He only gets the years added when he writes down Lights name into the Death Note.

To quote what we learned the episode:

>The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.

---
>Plus I still think it's possible that Ryuk might eventually come to be on Light's side

Well it's still possible, Ryuk said last episode that he likes Light. But the question is if he will like him enough to change his neutral stand, or maybe he manages to trick Ryuk into doing it.

>> ARTICLE
> He only gets the years added when he writes down Lights name into the Death Note.

Yeah. I read through the rules in your post to check first. So yeah, Ryuk has to write it down then. Maybe he's interested in having Light's life added to his own. He can't do that if Light dies otherwise.

> Well it's still possible, Ryuk said last episode that he likes Light. But the question is if he will like him enough to change his neutral stand, or maybe he manages to trick Ryuk into doing it.

Keeping Light alive doesn't have to mean being on his side. Ryuk might realize that Light is literally the best entertainment he is ever going to get. Who could possibly live up to Light's antics? If Light dies, Ryuk goes back to being bored as crap.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, there is going to be a reason for L's skills.

> Ryuk has two Death Notes! Ooooohhhhh!

Pretty sure you misinterpreted that scene. Ryuk *had* two Death Notes. The second one is currently in Light's possession.

> Still though, he gets his guesses right on the first try. I really hope theres a reason for this. A reason for him being this good, and its not just the way the story is written.

We've already established he's Batman. What more reason do you need?

You ever wonder if you Ryuk needs to constantly apply eye drops to keep them moist?

Speaking of which, good thing that when the guy who died threw the paper back at Light, it didn't bounce and hit his date or anyone else.
>> ARTICLE

Possibly not as misinterpreted as you think. I just meant it like, hey, there are two Death Notes out there somewhere (one is Light's) that are Ryuk's.

> /r/slavs_squatting

Ok.

> Speaking of which, good thing that when the guy who died threw the paper back at Light, it didn't bounce and hit his date or anyone else.

Or begin to describe what he was looking at. I'm sure if Raye gets the chance to report back to L, he's going to tell him the criminal was hallucinating. That's curious enough, but if L had a description I'm sure he'd dig through his Batman library for myths and lore similar to the description.

Oh, in that case, how did you miss that entire thing in episode one where the other Shinigami specifically mention it while talking to Ryuk, and they showed a close up of Ryuk's second book *while he was talking to Light about it?*

L's to do list

- Stop Kira

- Steal a chair from the FBI office

- Buy some sneakers

- Ask Watari if he has a pair of socks he can spare

He just enjoys being like that, I guess. And if he never leaves for fear of people learning anything about who he is, how can he ever buy new things? Well, delivery, I suppose. But then he'd have to sign and the delivery man would see his face.

I gotta say it's pretty hard to just watch one episode of this series a day, but it definitely builds the tension. I've never watched it without just binging it like a maniac so this is a nice change of pace. Also I finished Tokyo Ghoul yesterday and holy fuck those last couple episodes were brutal. Anyways let's watch some more of The Notebook.

- Light says the eye deal is out of the question. I saw that coming from the first time I watched the show honestly since lord Yagami is having too much fun being a serial killer to take some years off of his life.

- Ryuk has the derpiest face I've ever seen, he always just looks so happy no matter what's going on.

- Light x Ryuk OTP <3

- Enough chit chat, let's get back to Light's super happy fun time with mass murder!

- Jesus Christ L, get your ass down to Ikea and buy a chair or something has he been kneeling on a hardwood floor this whole time? At least get some kneepads or something you damn masochist.

- Aww Light you're getting so creative with your killings! Mom and dad would be so proud.

- Hell ya Light's getting laid tonight and Ryuk is gonna get to watch! Aww stalker guy is so jealous I feel bad now. Damn she can't keep her hands off him and he's barely even trying.

- Alright Stalker guy the bus is being highjacked, time to show Light what you can do and finally win him over. 

- "Are you sure you're not his accomplice or something?" Light is such a cheeky bastard and I love it.

- Oh shit stalker guy is with the FBI and his name is Raye Pember. Whatever I'm still shipping them, sorry Ryuk. Light x Raye OTP <3

- What the hell man Ryuk is a cutie don't call him a freak asshole :(

- Lmao when the criminal gets wasted and there's dead silence I was cracking up. Raye's face just says "oh fuck this is gonna be a lot of paper work isn't it?"

- "You will be next, Raye Pember." Guys he's obviously making plans for his next date he's left all that murder stuff behind him.

Pretty solid episode, mostly just a lot of experimenting with the Death Note for Light. The bus scene was really tense the first time I saw it since I figured Light would have Raye get murdered by the criminal. Also it was nice to see that Light actually talks to people that aren't himself or Ryuk. Well I gotta go fail a math test, but I'll see you all tomorrow.

Thank you! And typing on his computer would be so annoying, having to angle your wrist down at the keyboard.

> What the hell man Ryuk is a cutie don't call him a freak asshole :(

He just doesn't know him as well as we do. Death Note rewatchers x Ryuk OTP

> "You will be next, Raye Pember." Guys he's obviously making plans for his next date he's left all that murder stuff behind him.

For some reason, this made me wonder if Light can write things on pieces of paper torn from the Death Note. Not that he could've done it without his date seeing him, but Light could've written Raye's death right after learning his name. He could've written that the busjacker would shoot Raye or something. FBI agent dies trying to protect hostages. Legit.

> the first time I saw it since I figured Light would have Raye get murdered by the criminal.

Oh, shit. See you kind of had a similar thought.

You could always ask Light for help.

A bit over the top from Light? It was a lot of trouble to go to just to get a name. Some nice planning though and the testing methods of death was well thought out, but why so late. His big problem was not varying up the deaths from the bigging. 

The bus is one of my favourite set pieces, he uses his tools well and shows how good at predicting peoples responses will be.

I find the world of the shinigami very interesting and the creatures odd. Light choice not to take the eyes is expected and well in character.

And here we get definitive proof that Light is evil! He put the poor girl through so much and she was just another of his tools.

Based off of her reaction of that crash (in the manga) I don't feel to bad for her. It was actually kinda funny.

He was having some fun though. I do feel a little bad for that girl. She just wanted to go on a date with the smartest, sexiest guy in class. Hopefully she's not too traumatized.
>> ARTICLE
> His big problem was not varying up the deaths from the bigging. 

Light wanted people to know that one person was behind the deaths of the criminals. To tell them that someone was watching and judging over them like a god. So the deaths being similar was on purpose so people could connect the dots. 
>> ARTICLE
Light, you lack patience. Penber was going to stop following you, of course he couldn't have known that
>> ARTICLE
And Kira says no, of course. Like he would ever waste half of his lifetime for such a little peasent.

Ryuk sounds a bit disappointed, he probably hoped for a good deal. "Just wanted you to know that, b-baka!"

It's not the appearance that makes you a shinigami, it's the will in your heart that makes you a real shinigami Light. But still I the design of these guys is just great, they just look something that could only come out of the fantasy of a edgy goth teenager. And I love it.

>The ~~Shinigami~~ world is slowly rotting, we live meaningless and empty lives and the only reason we keep ~~taking human lives~~ making dank memes is because we're afraid to die ourselves. The truth of the matter is we no longer know the reason why we exist, in fact, I doubt theres any reason for our existence.

Wow Ryuk almost described (with minor changes) the live of a user over at /r/anime_irl.

Uhh looks like Kira has a keikaku. 

And Kira knows of his impact on the ladies, like I said he's only social if he profits from it. At this point I think that Kira just doesn't feel any sort of emotions towards any human, except for hate and disgust.

So Kira is killing two birds with one stone, he found a plan to find out the name of his observer, with that experiment, and he gives L a wrong trail to follow, and making him waste time.

And the FBI agent already considers Light as innocent, well pack it up boys no reason to kill him anymore. (There wasn't even a reason to begin with)

Keikaku doori.

Damn this was a very roundabout way to get the name, but ingenious. Who needs those stupid shinigami eyes? You just need a naive FBI agent as a pursuer. I mean L probably told the FBI that Kira needs name and face to kill the person, so why don't they have fake IDs here, they could work undercover. But probably they're not allowed to do that.

Wait what? The episode is already over? Damnit, even though I know what happens next I want to just watch the next episode.

I forgot it last time but here are the revealed rules until now:

Rules for humans:

1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.
9. The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.
10. **The person in possession of the Death Note is possessed by a god of death, its original owner, until they die.**
11. **If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.**
12. **The cause of death must still be in realm of possibility for the victim.**

Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1. **The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.**
2. **Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.**

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. Now we know some more possibilities of the Death Note. Write your most creative cause of death you can think of. But be sure to follow the rules Kira discovered today.

2. Where would you go with someone on your first date?

3. Since Light is waking up that poor girl early in the morning on probably a weekend: Are you more a nocturnal or a morning person?

>Without spoiling anything, did you think there was a good chance that Light would actually become a Shinigami one day the first time you watched this episode?

When watching this for the first time I never gave much thought of this, but I also was like 12 or 13 at that time, and I just watched it without thinking too much just enjoying L and Kira being all clever.

>It doesn't have to be up to Light's standards, but when was the last time you did something remarkably clever? Or even just sort of clever.

> And the FBI agent already considers Light as innocent, well pack it up boys no reason to kill him anymore. (There wasn't even a reason to begin with)

The original reason would be, I guess, to make sure no one is ever following Light. Less chance of being caught if no one is investigating you. Light doesn't know that the investigator has crossed him off his list so I can see why he'd still want to kill him. But Raye still hasn't actually done anything deserving of death. So will this be Light's first killing of an innocent? We'll have to wait.

> Now we know some more possibilities of the Death Note. Write your most creative cause of death you can think of. But be sure to follow the rules Kira discovered today.

Try to steal our ideas and set us up, are you? "Officer, I swear it wasn't me. Look at Neawia's comment! It was him!"

I might come back to this though. I'd need more time to think it through.

> Where would you go with someone on your first date?

Obviously to a space center or wherever and only if some lunatic hijacked our bus there. She'd be so impressed that I ~~cowered in fear~~ told to her stay calm while I go for his gun. She'd be all over me.

> Since Light is waking up that poor girl early in the morning on probably a weekend: Are you more a nocturnal or a morning person?

Probably nocturnal. Though I don't really have any problems waking up in the morning. Nighttime is just more fun, I guess.

I meant with no reason to kill him, is that a FBI agent shouldn't be on his hitlist to begin with if he really claims to kill only bad people, I mean writing down something into a fucking notebook is not a bit suspicious and they will stop investigate him because of lack of evidence, even when he doesn't stop to kill criminals. And Kira is smart he should know that they won't find out anything this way. Damn it even already worked without him doing anything, but no everyone who investigates against him must be evil. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, yes. You make a good point.

I suppose Light is just being extra careful here and is assuming the worst. I agree though that he should just wait it out. He's not doing anything incriminating. Like you said, writing in a notebook isn't suspicious. It really does seem like a better plan to just let the FBI agent think you aren't a threat.

I don't know. Maybe Light has a reason. We'll have to wait and see what happens with Raye Penber.

This episode is definitely one of the weaker ones this second time watching. Not because the episode itself is weak, I think it's probably the best one so far; something about it is just so much better when you're still trying to wrap your head around the concept and rules of the Death Note and are trying to puzzle out what Light is going to do with it based on what's been mentioned off hand in the previous episodes. The reveal for the whole plan is great, because they don't introduce anything new - it's all built on things you already know if your head isn't busy working down the wrong trail of breadcrumbs. 

On a semi-related note, watching one at a time is so hard! 0.0

As soon as he picked up the phone I remembered what happened this episode and all I could think was "that poor girl"
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, they went to town with their bullshit logics and tons of plotholes this episode.

Everyone knows that the best way to trail someone without alerting them is to take the seat right behind them on the bus and park your face inches apart from theirs.

Then, lo and behold, with a single sentence, the suspect has magically turned the tables, and the investigator is now scrambling to prove their identity to someone they were investigating seconds ago. So what do they do? They don't display their FBI badge, no way. Because logic is so overrated. They hand over their official ID card to this person.

This bag of rocks is an undercover FBI agent.

Now let's talk about the note written on a piece of paper from Death Note. Was that necessary to make the criminal hallucinate? Nope, not at all, as shown in the past with the Note's ability to make criminals go insane, writing in their blood and breaking out of confinement, as if being chased, before collapsing. So why did Mr. Iamverysmart go to such big lengths, not to mention take the huge risk of someone else picking up the note where the criminal tossed it away? Hell, it could have landed onto someone's lap in the bus for all he knew. Once again, all common sense out the door.

This is my first time watching the show and, I don't know man. I trying not to judge it prior to watching all the episodes, but right now, I have a hard time believing people consider this to be a masterpiece. Let's just say no other show has made me want to pull my hair out so much at all their illogical ramblings and the stupidity of all the characters. And it's only the fourth episode. Oh well, I have a feeling this one is going to be a long ride.
>> ARTICLE
Most of the early episodes are just a big rush to get the plot moving as fast as possible, so they skimmed over some parts. Light specifically wrote in the Death Note that only the criminal would see Ryuk, so he subconsciously threw it in such a way that only Light would touch it. He actually had him touch the paper just because he thought it'd be funny, not to mention he wanted to impress Ryuk.

As for Penber, yeah he's just stupid. Hear he cheated on entrance exams.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is, it's not just Penber. It's like for Light to be considered a genius, they had to make everyone else dumber than a doorknob. And even then they fail miserably because most of his logics are flawed and his plans are full of holes, which would be apparent to anyone with a fuctinonary brain. In that way, it's like they're making fun of us.
>> ARTICLE
Things start to really pick up once L gets introduced proper. Right now it's just Light chessmastering everything and being smug.

Is this info coming from the manga or are you just interpreting the scene?

I also didn't see the problem with the guy touching the paper. I thought Light did that just for funsies. I think earlier on in the episode he wouldn't tell Ryuk his plan, and Ryuk was disappointed and in for a surprise.
>> ARTICLE
> Is this info coming from the manga or are you just interpreting the scene?

Little of A, little of B.

Interesting how that all went down. To be honest, I feel like L or Light should have been able to make the jump
to it being the note from what they saw. L especially has made much bigger jumps with his logic before.

Wasn't expecting to see Aizawa again, comes in and saves the day that's awesome.

Without Misa to intefere, the only chance for them to not know about the deathnote is if Higuchi releases
the note and then Rem can take it away right? Otherwise they're in for a big shock once they pick up the death
note. I do want them to pick it up though, I think it would be really interesting to see how they react
and then if Rem can trick them into thinking she is Kira and is the one controlling them all or something.

Also, since the police is there, wouldn't the police be the ones who would take the evidence?
>> ARTICLE
> To be honest, I feel like L or Light should have been able to make the jump to it being the note from what they saw

Right. Especially L. I thought he would've said something once Higuchi reached into his bag and then the traffic cop died.

> Without Misa to intefere, the only chance for them to not know about the deathnote is if Higuchi releases the note and then Rem can take it away right?

I think so. That's what it seems.

> I think it would be really interesting to see how they react and then if Rem can trick them into thinking she is Kira and is the one controlling them all or something.

Oh! That'd be really cool, actually. Especially since they really can't do anything to kill or apprehend her. Although, hmmm, then they wouldn't be able to 'catch Kira', and they'd have to continue the investigation. I'm still waiting on Light to get his memories back already.

> Also, since the police is there, wouldn't the police be the ones who would take the evidence?

Excellent point. Didn't think about that. It's a strong possibility, but maybe because L is L, he can overrule them and take the evidence himself seeing as the police did say they weren't working on the Kira case anymore.
>> ARTICLE
The whole talk about needing to know face and name of the target just made me think. What happens if you had plastic surgery to make you look totally different? Would that also protect you from the DN? Because nobody knows your real face?

How cute Rem trying her best to protect Misa and making everything work to L's and Light's keikaku.

Man love how they don't get that Higuchi already did the kill.

Oh shit he want's to do the deal. He is now brought to the edge.

Matsuda is in trouble now.

And he kills a police officer now.

This is so intense, they guess and guess but don't get the full picture of how Kira kills or why he suddenly has the powers of Kira 2.

Also how they exaggerate Higuchi's face into a more and more creepy one.

Is there something L can't do? 

I just love how both Yagami's say no to taking the guns because they are civilians, like father like son.


AIZAWA!!! He's back!

Watari is such a badass.

/u/Neawia's questions:

>Name your top three badasses in the show (so far, no spoilers).

Chief Yagami, Watari and ~~L~~ I correct myself: Matsuda is a true badass.

>Do you think you could learn how to pilot a helicopter? Bonus points if you think you could do it with bare feet like L probably can.

I think I could if I had the money and the time, but I doubt I'll ever do it. About the whole foot thing I just say: NOPE. 
>> ARTICLE
> What happens if you had plastic surgery to make you look totally different? Would that also protect you from the DN? Because nobody knows your real face?

My thinking is if you see the person for the first time after their surgery, and you picture their new face and name when writing, I'd assume it would kill them since that is their face.

But if you knew what someone looked like, and they had gotten surgery to drastically change their appearance from the time you last saw them, it might not work. It wouldn't be until you saw their new face that you could kill them. 

Or maybe it would kill them if you thought of either their old face or new face. 

And like OP's comment, I would assume the same would be if they changed their name legally. 
>> ARTICLE
>I would assume the same would be if they changed their name legally.

I answered to /u/Neawia above that I don't believe that something else as the birth name matters to the Death Note.

Because why should the Shinigamis care for a human institution to rely on the name? And what really defines changing your name "legally" because I don't think that institutions to officially change your name existed for the entire existence of the Shinigamis and the Shinigami world.

Also I found this rule in the full rule list:

[Death Note rule. Spoiler just to be sure ](/n "The names you will see with the eye power of a god of death are the names needed to kill that person. You will be able to see the names even if that person isn't registered in the family registration.")


[Also this comment makes some good points](http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/12978)

I believe that the name that makes him killable is decided someday in his life, and can't be changed. 

But to both of your theories about the face I think yes it is plausible. But I believe that it still could work if you know one of the two faces of your victim thanks to this rule:

[Death Note rule not sure if it was revealed yet](/s "If above conditions are met, names and life spans can be seen through photos and pictures, no matter how old they are. But this is sometimes influenced by the vividness and size. Also, names and life spans cannot be seen by face drawings, however realistic they may be.")

So that means any human with shinigami eyes can use any photo of you to kill to find out your name.

>> ARTICLE
> What happens if you had plastic surgery to make you look totally different? Would that also protect you from the DN? Because nobody knows your real face?

Interesting question. I have no idea how the Death Note actually works. I'd like to imagine your new face is now your real face. Same would go for if you legally changed your name.

> This is so intense, they guess and guess but don't get the full picture of how Kira kills or why he suddenly has the powers of Kira 2.

I'm hoping they can put this together in the next episode. L's made predictions with less evidence. They know he wrote down a name so they can guess he also wrote another one with his hand in his bag (the cop). And Higuchi said let's make the deal. It should be obvious the deal gave him Kira 2's powers.

> Is there something L can't do? 

Catch Kira.

> Watari is such a badass.

Seriously. Was not expecting that. Oh, tinfoil time. L asked Light about becoming the next L if he dies. What if the previous L didn't die, but was just too old to keep working at peak performance. What if Watari was the previous L?

> What if the source of Shinigami power wouldn't be a Note but something else, what could it be? Kira was using the Death ____ to kill his victims.

The Death Album. Photos not music. Light has to take pictures of his victims. He can take pictures of them in person or take pictures of pictures. He can use a polaroid and put the picture into his album immediately (dies of heart attack in 40 seconds) or he can use a digital camera and use photoshop to edit the picture to contain the means of death.

[I've always loved the Super Smash Bros. for N64 commercial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u589Li2o-zA&list=FLoFMF7PJauRg3zJVx5ymftA&index=53) Mario just takes out Yoshi's legs, and at the end he just punches Donkey Kong right in the gut. It's hilarious.

>Same would go for if you legally changed your name.

Why should Shinigamis care for a human institution that changes your name?

Also I found this rule that is (I believe) not shown in the anime:

[Death Note rule. Spoiler just to be sure ](/n "The names you will see with the eye power of a god of death are the names needed to kill that person. You will be able to see the names even if that person isn't registered in the family registration.")

[Also this answer makes some good points why only the birth name matters](http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/12978)

>> ARTICLE
> Also this answer makes some good points why only the birth name matters

This makes sense, I suppose. I can get behind that.

I'll only say that if you change your name, you're legally changing it, right? But when you're born, you're legally given a name.

So why is one legal registration more important the other? Well, I guess it's just because it's when you're born, and it's the first name you're given, but still.

There are really no rules for answering questions like this unfortunately, the only thing we could do is speculate

But this answer also made some good points to the whole name given at birth.

Damn he would be much slower at killing victims. But man he would be a god in photoshop after a while.

Well atleast Nintendo themself noticed how fucked up the premise of Smash Bros. is, mostly kid friendly mascots jammed together in an arena to fight to the death.

Ohp, yep. Fixed that, thanks. Stupid similar names.

Both true. It would take longer to kill, but... well, I don't know. It's what I came up with.

That's one of the main reasons why I used Kira instead of Light in the earlier episodes. But this doesn't work anymore because nobody would know which Kira I mean.

Day 23 - This is gonna be a long one. A bit more to talk about than usual.

I think /u/Saikimo has explained it, but just so you can hear it from me: I was banned for 7 days for 'ban-dodging'. The-Sublimer-One was banned earlier that day, but wanted to join in on the discussion. I copy-pasted a PM he sent me and posted it in the thread. I didn't know that was a rule, but in hindsight, it makes sense.

Anyway, I apologized and spoke with one of the mods about the whole thing. They were pretty understanding and reduced the ban down to 3 days. /u/Saikimo, being an all around awesome person, stepped in on short notice and posted the threads for us. So thanks a bunch, Saikimo. You rock.

Was there a bit more drama than this? Surely. If you're curious you can PM, but I didn't want to bring it all up in here. I have no intentions of breaking any more rules, so unless something unexpected happens again, I will be the one to post the threads from here on out.

I'd say check out [reddit's site rules](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) if you're curious.

**Pre-Post**

So just in case I haven't mentioned this before, I have been spoiled on one thing. I just felt I should put it out there. It's in the tag below.

[actual death note spoilers](/s "I feel like I shouldve said by now, but I do know that L dies. I've done my best to not allow it to influence my predictions.")

I'll also put my thoughts on the new OP here even though it's been around for a few episodes now. ^^but ^^I ^^haven't ^^been

New OP what. I like the visuals to an extent. Ryuk with the apples is hilarious. But this song, not a good choice. Not at all.

I mean seriously though, [this is fucking amazing.](http://gfycat.com/IllustriousOrneryHare)

[New girl? Possible Shinigami user.](http://i.imgur.com/bVeSFyt.png) Or is that supposed to be Wedy? I haven't really seen her face enough to be sure. It did look like there was at least one other new female character though.

Im not the only one, right. ["Heyinga *suck it*. Anayaniga *faggot*."](http://puu.sh/nMWOM.webm)

Those two blue roses make me think L and Misa are going to die.

Also, here are my posts for the three episodes I missed. Like last time, feel free to reply to them if you want. I will answer. [Episode 20](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4auuid/spoilers_death_note_rewatch_episode_20_discussion/d170ken) -- [Episode 21](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4azyms/spoilers_death_note_rewatch_episode_21_discussion/d170jon) -- [Episode 22](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4b4j3a/spoilers_death_note_rewatch_episode_22_discussion/d170j47)

**Main episode post**

Heeeheeeheee, L lickin those lips. And now Misa is playing a devil. Love it.

Live tv in your car! In 2007-2008. Damn.

See, good. At least Higuchi realizes the production company letting him go into their files alone makes no sense. Hes calming down.

Watching Light be confused about Rem is just its odd. Give me back the real Kira!

[Banana yum.](http://i.imgur.com/8x5qWLM.png)

[L up close.](http://i.imgur.com/7sehXYE.png)

Uh oh, Ls gonna see how Kira kills. But he doesnt realize the book is how Kira kills. Interesting.

Wow. Higuchi went back down to his car in 40 seconds? Dude was walking pretty slow.

Fuck. Hes taking the deal. I still dont understand why Rem told him about that. Unless its just standard Shinigami procedure. Like a rule, she *had* to tell him.

Ls still confused, and doesnt want to believe in otherworldly stuff if he doesnt have to.

This is so enjoyable. I love knowing everything and watching L trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

Fuck yes this is great. They have this whole thing planned out so well. Hell yes. Lets get Higuchi.

You can figure it out with intuition. O-fucking-kay. I guess Ill try piloting a helicopter this weekend, guys. Thats all it takes. And at least this time if I miss anymore rewatch I'll actually be dead.

Watari gonna snipe someone?!?!?!

Please dont die, Soichiro. I cant say you're the best dad ever, but youre still good. Youre also a major badass. Get this fucker.

Damnit!!!!! He got shot!!!!!!

Howd they fuck this up? There were five of them in a circle around him. How the hell did Higuchi run away?!?!?!

Okay, Soichiro is fine for now.

Watari, fuck yes. Snipe this asshole.

Soichiro only got shot in the arm. Ok, hes fine.

Youre done. Its a blockade. Youre done, Higuchi. Suck it.

Please no cliffhanger.

FUCK YEAH AIZAWA!!!

WATARI WITH PERFECT AIM!!!!

Yes.

WATARI AGAIN!!!! THIS GUYS THE BEST! [Badass.](http://i.imgur.com/CGM4XBR.png)

Oh. That Death Note being there is bad. So many people are going to have the opportunity to touch it.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

> *from thread 19 where I got banned*
>> On the plus side, I have some extra free time in the upcoming days, so I actually plan on going back and organizing my predictions. I swear this time, guys.

I really dont think I can ever top this prediction seeing as it came perfectly true just after predicting it. I guess it's time to retire. Well, I'll stick around a little longer. Maybe if I can correctly predict who someones mother is, thatll be my crowning achievement.

But for real, I actually did go back and check out my theories this time.

These are basically my predictions that Id come up with after watching each episode. I had some predictions I made mid-episode that came true by the end of the same episode, but those dont count too much.

This was fun to go back and check though. I shouldve learned this by now, but from here on out Ill be keeping track of predictions as I go to avoid spending time reading through my old posts.

**Correct**

> *from episode 1*
>> so another human will probably end up using the Death Note besides Light. Maybe a love interest, if there is one. That way they can spend forever together. How romantic.

Pretty close, but as of now, Light isnt interested in Misa like that. Ill have to wait and see if that changes.

> *from episode 6*
>> Alternatively, it would be interesting to have Lights father bring him in as an addition to the task force. Light and L are going to have to meet somehow. I think Light could lie his way around Ls one-on-one talks, but hed still have trouble finding out what Ls real name is.

Again, pretty close, but that wasnt how they met for the first time.

> *from episode 13*
>> If Misa is his girlfriend now, why cant Light just bring her to school and have her meet L that way? Hey, see that guy that I hang out with at school? Whats his name? Done. Show over. Maybe L isnt hanging around school anymore if hes not investigating Light though.

Once more, just pretty close. Its tough though to predict something to the teeth.

**Yet to happen ~ killing L**

> *from episode 2*
>> Maybe Light will be tied up, but coerce L to touch the Death Note. Then Ryuk would be able to kill L and save Light. Something like that, I dont know.

> *from episode 3*
>> I think that Light wont take Ryuks deal just yet. Hell probably wait until he gets closer to finding L. Perhaps even going so far as to begin talking to Ryuk in front of L. L will have no idea whats going on and Light will just say, Ryuk, Ill take the deal now. Light gets Shinigami eyes, kills L, and surprisingly goes on to live for a long time.

> *from episode 4*
>> Like I said a day or two ago, he can trick L into touching the Death Note. Hell, he can just throw the Death Note at him or slap him with it.

> *from episode 13*
>> Plus, if it turns out hes truly heartless, he could convince Misa to sacrifice herself in order to kill L Maybe Misa confronts L. She calls Light on the phone, taunts L by saying, *Light*, his name is. Forty seconds later, L is dead. Eh, too easy.

**Yet to happen ~ general**

> *from episode 4*
>> By the end of the series, Light will physically turn into a Shinigami.

> *from episode 16, as early as episode 15*
>> I still think that Light is going to end up with Misa's disowned Death Note and Rem while Misa will end up with Light's disowned Death Note and Ryuk. Light will still hold on to both Death Notes, and they'll each touch each others (   ) so they can see and speak to their old Shinigami partner.

This could still happen. I cant remember if the rules state if you can regain ownership of a Death Note, but I feel like you cant. So if Light wants to continue things, hes going to need MIsas old Death Note. Hell also need Misas eyes so hell give her his old Death Note. And its still up in the air whether or not theyll both regain their memories.

Expanded here

> *from episode 17*
>> Both Misa and Light have no recollection of their time as Kira. This is going to work to their benefit because Light can now fully devote himself to the task force. He told Rem to give the Death Note to a high level businessman. So now that businessman is Kira. Light will work with L to hunt down the businessman Kira. Once hes captured, Light and Misa will be cleared and theyll be able to meet back up with Rem and Ryuk and continue their plan.

Hhaha. Misheard lyric videos can really ruin a song depending on how alike it sounds.

The 'MAJOR SPOILERS' one is curious. You used it after quoting me talking about a mom prediction. Someone is possibly someone's mom in this show? Maybe. 

Then there's the 'FOR CG WATCHERS (NOT NEAWIA)' spoilers being in there. The main thing *you* make fun of me for about CG is [code geass](/s "predicting Li Xingke as Lelouch's mom") so your spoiler here might be in reference to that. It was also after you quoted me talking about a new girl shinigami user.

So the new girl is possibly someone's mother. Going by hair color, she'd be Misa's mother. Going by her baggy black eyes, she's L's mother. She does look rather young. Could just be a super attractive young mom. Maybe it's L's sister instead.

I don't know, rascorpia. Maybe all you're doing is fucking with me and making fun of me. I don't know.

>Name your top three badasses in the show (so far, no spoilers).

My thoughts on this show tie in with this question, I feel that everyone a given a fair share of the badass pie. No one gets left behind and everyone has their moment to shine. Unfortunately, this combined with the anyone can die nature means very little characterisation is given to them. That being said - Light,L and Ryuk

Chekhov's afroman - Afrocop returns by bringing out the entire police force to catch Kira, not bad for someone who got Mad at L just a couple of episodes ago.

Watari - Being L's faithful servant isn't enough, age is never the issue when it comes to sniping a tire on a moving helicopter.

SO much action today yet so little time for resolution, while L says it's over (for Kyosuke Kira), what are your predictions for the remaining 12 episodes? 
>> ARTICLE
> Chekhov's afroman

I guess he just felt that there was still something he could do. He didn't want to abandon the investigation, he just hated L. And if it's Kira, how could the police force not respond, especially if it was something easy like a blockade.

> SO much action today yet so little time for resolution, while L says it's over (for Kyosuke Kira), what are your predictions for the remaining 12 episodes? 

Light and Misa get each other's Death Note. Light continues killing people. Eventually becomes a Shinigami somehow. I don't know.
>> ARTICLE
Oh snap I forgot Higuchi's car was was wired. He's revealed he's talking to someone.

Can you imagine how confusing it is for everyone with L to watch Higuchi simply write a guy's name down in a notebook then suddenly freak out that this person isn't dying?

Ooooh snap Higuchi has the eyes now! Matsuda is doomed.

Haha L chains Misa up. She still is kinda under suspicion after all.

Oh no Higuchi shot Soichiro! Ah looks like he'll be okay though.

It's Aizawa and that guy who first left the team!

Watari shot the gun out of Higuchi's hand like a boss.

First time chiming in and doing a rewatch, but I'm finally caught up! Binged 5 episodes last night and after today's I just want to watch the next few episodes and not wait another day. The next few episodes are my favorite and I'm ready to dig in!

Also I love the contrasting that Light shows with his morality pre memory wipe vs now. The scene comparing him to his father and how they would never touch a gun is a conversation that Keira would laugh at.

Oh no! I'm falling behind since I refuse to watch without my roomate :P I may or may not come back with more once I actually get to the end of this episode >.> If I remember correctly, this is where we see Watari be a badass of legend. And Aizawa makes his triumphant return...I think haha Man, my memory of all this has been so spotty it's crazy. It does an excellent job of building the suspense and action levels as it progresses though eh?

Answers to /u/Neawia questions:

>1\. Name your top three badasses in the show (so far, no spoilers).

Chief and Matsuda for sure. Next is probably Watari.

>2\. Do you think you could learn how to pilot a helicopter? Bonus points if you think you could do it with bare feet like L probably can.

Yes - but no to the feet. I don't think I'm coordinated enough haha Maybe with enough practice, but you generally don't have much practice before you screw up, crash and die XD
>> ARTICLE
Pretty spot on with what happens this episode.

Also, you could practice with simulations before hand.

"Hey Jim, why is that guy practicing without any socks or shoes?"

"I have no idea."

"What? Who the hell does this guy thinks he is, L?"

The next couple episodes are some of my favorites. Can't wait! 
>> ARTICLE
Holy cow, I completely forgot that Watari was a god behind a sniper rifle, now I remember why I liked him so much. 

I also forgot about the triumphant return of Aizawa! Is this anime secretly a recruitment ad for the Japanese police force? Because in that scene where the blockade showed up and Ryuzaki and Light knew who it was who was responsible for setting it up, and someone paused the show to tell me I could do things like that if I promised to uphold the law, I would sign up right away. 
>> ARTICLE
#I'm L!

One of my favourite lines in the show,a glorious way for L to say Fuck you, Light. This scene alone is worth just under 3.05 potato chips, made even better by Ryuk's response "If this guy is L like he says, then consider me impressed." as Ryuk already knows the identity of L.The first time we actually see Light this frustated and helpless over L, what an awesome way to declare a war of wits. The best form of defense is offence, sometimes the best way to win is just to put everything on the line.

Edit:Also, the line L says is supposed to be just "I'm L" , but the english dub had to improvise the mouth flapping of "Watashi wa L desu" so it changed to "I want to tell you I'm L"
>> ARTICLE
> Also, the line L says is supposed to be just "I'm L" , but the english dub had to improvise the mouth flapping of "Watashi wa L desu" so it changed to "I want to tell you I'm L"

Man poor Ryuk, just give him a damn apple, Kira. 


Too funny how Ryuk [leaps after the apple](http://i.imgur.com/NNQrglC.png)

And Ryuzaki stands out already. Never able to sit probably. 

That girl with glasses has [good taste](http://i.imgur.com/nzUeHuL.png)


Wait there's nothing [written on the paper...](http://i.imgur.com/nEHkC4i.png)

>I want to tell you I'm L.


And Light is totally flustered, best way to confront Kira and see if he reacts somehow. L you're the best. 

Just a thought, what if Hideki Ryuga is L's real name? But he just used it to taunt Kira, because he knew that nobody would believe that this would be his name. Still just a stupid thought, but it would be just too funny.

Man the jealousy that L get's is too good. But really he is  smart and rich as fuck, who wouldn't be jealous?

I believe we never saw Kira being that angry.

But he regained his smugness again very fast.

That's what you call an opening shot \^__^

Light has positioned himself in such a way that now he has to go after small time crooks. That's got to add to his work load.

Chief yagami is starting to look a bit rough, it could just be from the heavy work load. Or is the weight of the suspicion placed upon his family is affecting him. What would you think If your son was suspected of being a mass murder?

And time moves on and school is in, with Light aceing the entrance test along with... L. 
He is very clever in choosing a famous name as a alias and his ploy puts Light into a bit of a  corner. Its a big jump for L on two fronts; first is he is still suspicious of Lights and he could put  himself further into kira's sights.

Lights outburst was great and may just be the first true anger he has shown. What L thinks seems to be true Kira is not a god but a brat. Light now has a visible target he just need to find a way to kill him. Oh and in a way where he wont get caught.

Final thought: Under normal circumstances would Light and L be friends?

> Final thought: Under normal circumstances would Light and L be friends?

The mangaka confirmed that if Light had never found the Death Note, he and L would have gone on to become good friends and work together on multiple cases.

Why the heck is L allowed to take his test and give talk to the university up on stage without any shoes on?!

That Kyoko girl is right, dont listen to her friend, L is definitely the better one!

I really like this episode too, just like episode 2, because I fucking love it whenever Light has a big loss like this. And the way he takes losing too was perfect, he gets so mad that he even scares Ryuk! Thats badass, and L is a badass too, I bet he knew that this would be humiliating to Kira. Light got so mad that he more than lost his cool in terms of emotion, you know, if there was just one wire tap in his room or if his mom or sister were near the door, his cover would have blown! Light being pushed past his level of preparedness is wonderful. 
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for my lateness, I've been going for dark matter on Black Ops 3 and if you know what that is you know why I'm starting to hate myself. Anyways let's get going with Light's super happy fun time with heart attacks and porno mags.

- Hahaha Ryuk's walking around all twisted up he's too much for me.

- Doesn't feeding Ryuk an apple in public look super suspicious since to everyone else it looks like Light is holding an apple that is slowly disappearing on its own?

- "There's a 5 percent chance." Ya we better keep running the servailance then. I like those numbers. Seriously I love you L, but you might have missed one too many math classes.

- No more cameras in the room? I feel better for Mr. Yagami than I do for Light even. He seems so upset about Light being a chronic wanker, I can't imagine what he'd do if he found out what really gets Light going.

- "Sit properly in your chair" Lmao L is in the building and he's looking even creepier than normal. Seriously I don't mind the way he's sitting but he needs to get some socks ASAP.

- None of the other Shinigami look nearly as cool as best girl Ryuk. Oh and they're assholes too I bet they can't even handle their apples.

- Why would L use the name of a popular idol? Oh and glasses girl wants a piece of that. Jesus the whole crowd is just roasting the shit out of him, poor little weirdo he just wants cake and a hug.

- "I want to tell you I'm L." Light you're honestly being suspicious as fuck right now you haven't responded for like a whole minute and you look pissed off too.

- If I was Light I would just try acting like a mongoloid until L finally thought I was too stupid to be Kira. Just tell him you're going out with the bros for hella bitches and Mary Jane fam.

- You can kill as many no-name people as you want, but when Sayu says welcome home you drop your bullshit and say hello ya little shithead.

- Well Light seems to be handling his run in with L very calmly and collected. Light just write in your special diary until you forget about all of this... Oh or just laugh like a fucking maniac I'm sure your family is used to it now anyways. "Honey is Light laughing like a psycho again?" "Yes dear that's the sound he makes when he climaxes... I've seen video footage."

Well sorry for all of these meaningless comments, I'll try to say something of value tomorrow but I'll probably continue to dick around some more. See you all tomorrow!
>> ARTICLE
> If I was Light I would just try acting like a mongoloid until L finally thought I was too stupid to be Kira.

I think this won't work because A: he was first place in the test. B: Mr Yagami probably can tell him that Light is smart, I mean he even helped solving cases with the police

>"Honey is Light laughing like a psycho again?" "Yes dear that's the sound he makes when he climaxes... I've seen video footage."

Love your version of the dialogue, could work in an abridged series...

I'm sure he cased the area to make sure no one was watching him.

Calikarcha prefers blueberries, you fucking racist.

> Light you're honestly being suspicious as fuck right now you haven't responded for like a whole minute and you look pissed off too.

Yeah, but that was a minute in Kira Mode time, which is even slower than Bomb Ticking Its Last Seconds in an Action Movie time.

> "Honey is Light laughing like a psycho again?" "Yes dear that's the sound he makes when he climaxes... I've seen video footage."

I'm fucking dying.

Not sure which scene is better: ryuuk going thru withdrawal or light throwing a tantrum in his room
>> ARTICLE
And the episode starts out with Ryuk all tangled up. Dem withdrawal symptoms man.

Haha the dive Ryuk makes for the next apple.

"Watashi wa L desu."

The way his voice echoes after he says it too. You know this is a big moment.

I think this is the first time Light has really lost his cool. He's felt challenged before when L first showed up on tv but this is the first time we see Light freak out. 
>> ARTICLE
Just for the record, I love the shot in the OP of [Naomi holding Rayes body.](http://i.imgur.com/Xsmo9OK.png) Wish there was a nice, creditless, HD version.

I love Ryuk. He is amazing. All twisted up. Legitimately going through apple withdrawal.

[That chocolate looks good right now.](http://i.imgur.com/oIdSwbn.png)

Get the fuck out. L is in the test taking room! Theyre just staring each other down! Awesome moment. Wouldn't have happened if L could sit properly.

Hey, neat. L put shoes on. Still has his eyes wide open, and isnt dressed nicely. Cant he just act normal when going out in public. You'd think this could be the one time, but no.

Lol. Man, these two are total opposites.

L kills me. Holding the paper weird and theres nothing even written on it.

Too cool. He just admitted he was L. Badass move.

[L up close.](http://i.imgur.com/GkJBV9F.png)

Oh thats the guy whose name L is using. That suave mofo from the soap opera or romance movie.

At least Light was able to hold in his anger until he was alone. Still, I thought he was suspicious that there might still be microphones in his house. Now hes just yelling to Ryuk about this stuff.

[Ryuks face.](http://i.imgur.com/SixtrM4.png)

Light admitted hes been bested, for now. Cool to think theyre actually going to attend college together. Will see to what extent that happens. And Lights ready to get his own hands dirty if need be. Love it. Gonna be fun watching him try to best L. I wonder if L will ever be in a position where hell snap like Light just did.

This second opening is just so great. It just doesn't fit at all with the tone of the series or the first opening, but on the other hand it's so unfitting that it is fitting again...

MATSUDA Its Ooi!

HA Matsuda you are way off again... leave the thinking to L and Light.

>And you thought of it quicker than I did.

Well does this mean that Light is better than L? Or was this just a lucky moment?

>If I should die, would you take over for me as L?

OK no he is testing Light again, real Kira would say yes in this situation, or he would say no because he would suspect this being a trap...

>LIGHT Do you think that Im actually capable of becoming a murderer, Kira?
Even after I help you catch him?
Do I seem like that kind of person to you?

>L Yes, you do.
Ive always thought so.

Dayum... But he is just so right with all of that.

>Misa: promise I wont say anything even if they torture me!

>L I can attest that.

/u/cuckoodev L himself just confirmed that he tortured Misa.

>I would never dream about living in the world without Light.

>L Yes, that would be dark.

Man the English dub made a pun and the German dub only gets:

> Excellent choice.

And I already miss the first ending.

The second one is also great but it just hasn't the same feeling to it.


[All Rules](http://pastebin.com/Vr9Jz0k0)

New Rules:

1. **If written the same name on more than two Death Notes is completed within a 0.06-second difference, it is regarded as simultaneous; the Death note will not take effect and the individual written will not die**
2. **The god of death must at least own one Death Note that Death Note must never be lent to or written on by a human.**

The first one at the moment, though I did go back and listen to the second one again and I liked it more the second time through.

I quite like the second ending, I would say the first one is slightly more to my taste.

I was like this too at first but over time the opening grew on me. But for some reason I think it's fitting the bit of insanity in every character of this show, and just exaggerating it.

1. 2nd OP all the way. I actually imported that whole Maximum the Hormone album. I don't really listen to this kind of music anymore (I did when I first watched the series) but it's still a nice change every now and then. [I find that this is the best song from the album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk20ZmPHL64) (excuse the random AMV, it's the best version of the song I could find on youtube).
2. 2nd one again, I actually perfer it over the second OP because that kind of falls apart toward the end.
3. I don't drink any coffee but I recently started drinking lots of green and white tea. Would recommend.

All in all the German dub is really good for a German one.

List of Possible Kira candidates:       

*   ~~Hatori Arayoshi~~ ; dead       
* ~~Namikawa Reiji~~ ; working with L    
* Shimura Suguru ; Frazzled brown haired guy      
* Takanashi Eiichi ; Blonde
* Higuichi Kyosuke ; 'M' shaped hairstyle guy
* Mido Shingo ; Spectacled Brown haired guy
* Masahiko Kida ; Spectacled Black haired guy
* Ooi Takshi ;Baldy
   
**L is critically obsessed with the search for the truth** is the highlight of this episode. To him this isn't about justice but about the detective artform, all he wants is a Kira's absolute and certain defeat. He also has boundless wealth , a loyal butler, and an ex-police chief working with him.


Light even though he is currently on the side of good, shows that his ideals are very close to Kira, to him it is all about withholding "justice", never willing to manipulate anyone.
>> ARTICLE
the thing about this series is that I like the main antagonist infinitely more than L, who is suppose to be the main character.  
>> ARTICLE
The antagonist *is* L , Light plays the role of the villian protaganist, our point of view is almost always from Light and we see his development the most. However, L and Light are equally important, this show can't live without either one of them as most of it is the cat and mouse chase between the two.
>> ARTICLE
Very true.
>> ARTICLE
so the ending is already set in stone because light is considered a "villain"?  that sucks even more.  
>> ARTICLE
I would say that assessment is pretty subjective. And even if you consider Light a villain that doesn't mean anything as far as the ending is concerned. Villains win/lose, and so do heroes. So I wouldn't take that to mean anything, lol
>> ARTICLE
And just like that we start the second half of this show. I'd like to take this moment and ask every one to please buckle up. We are in for a bumpy ride.
>> ARTICLE
The ending is perfect for such a masterpiece of an anime. I am thankful that we didn't get a bad ending. For any one who's watching this for the very first time you better buckle up. 
>> ARTICLE
The episode everyone gets to meet the... unique... second opening. I can understand why a lot of people don't like it but it's about equal to the first for me. In the first, the guitars are mixed so far back into the track that you can barely hear them but they are nice and clear (clear probably isn't the best way to describe them) here. The visuals are also quite exciting and result in [this](http://i.imgur.com/OFHw8hv.webm) GIF

[So the OP spoiled something perhaps.](http://i.imgur.com/6OpU3wg.png) That guy looks an awful lot like [this Yotsuba member.](http://i.imgur.com/xtNYeAS.png)

Light and his dad are horrified at how easily the Yotsuba are choosing killings. Meanwhile, L is just eating an ice cream sundae.

L is also starting to become more like Light, thought not as bad. He wants to allow the Yotsuba to keep killing people so they can find Kira even though they now have evidence to put them all in prison. Not that Ls wrong though.

Maybe that wasnt a sundae. I dont know what it was.

That was a sexy phone call. Nailed that guy. I dont think hes Kira anymore though, and hell probably end up fully cooperating with L.

[L up close.](http://i.imgur.com/Q81IpGm.png)

Wow, L would consider Light as his successor. This just got interesting. L is more of a character than I thought. Its possible that there was an L before Riyuzaki, and its clear that Riyuzaki wants L to continue on after he dies.

To pass on the power and have it go back to Light once hes clear of suspicion. Yep. Thats exactly what I think is going to happen. I hadnt considered Light taking over Ls position and have control over the worlds police.

Actually laughed out loud when the both hit each other at the same time!

[L up close.](http://i.imgur.com/UOeorfY.png)

So theyll just throw Misa out into the fray like that? She could die.

If its Light, then its ok.

Hahahahaha! Ohhhhh L. I would never dream about living in a world without Light. Yes, that would be dark.

[Smooch!](http://gfycat.com/IllustriousIdolizedGavial) L could actually fall for Misa. Awww, more friends for L.

New ED too. I dont understand the choice of songs this time around. Why did they make both of them metal/scream music. At least the ED isnt fully like that, but the first ED was still much better.

Never made a mistery out of that I don't like Misa.... (only at the beginning to not influence the first time watcher with my negativity) But well maybe I'm over it because I've seen the show so often or because of some people pointing out her brighter moments but I don't think that she is one of the worst characters in anime anymore, still don't like her though...

I'm way behind you guys on this rewatch, but I have seen the show before.

My Dad, however, is going through for the first time with me. We've just finished Episode 7, where Naomi dies.

Dad figures that since Afro-cop (is it Aizawa?) was walking past maybe he'll realise when Naomi goes missing that Light was the last to see her.

We're gonna watch a few more episodes tonight and hopefully catch up to you guys in the future.

To talk about this episode a bit...
I hate the second OP. The screamo just isn't right.

There's many pendulums there's many pendulums there's many pendulums IN ENGLAND! 

I just realized how much I missed Ryuk. I do enjoy that this current arc is mixing things up, with how it is relying more on just investigative tactics and keeps us guessing as to what will happen with Light's notebook and everything, but there being no Ryuk at all has it missing an important element. Best part of this episode was when Ryuzaki, Misa, and Light all joined hands, and L even let out a little 'yay'. I'm not sure I understand Ryuzaki's plan for this. Either way, the evil corporation might figure out that they can use Misa to figure out who L is, so he wants them to figure it own on his own terms by telling them as the fake investigator. But what is going on that he is in less danger of having a Kira control Misa's actions to reveal his identity when he tells them they should use Misa than when they have yet to make the connection that Misa has already come into contact with L? And what happened to get Misa to agree that he and Light are safer if they intentionally use her as bait?

WAVVY MOLE!

New opening! Done by Maximum The Hormone. Here are some popular misheard lyrics.

"We always pet a nest to free all this pain. We always pet a nest to free all this pain. Balls! Say balls!"

Ooh my subs actually subbed the opening. I don't recall if the dub subbed the openings and endings. I think this is the first time I've seen the real lyrics.

Good guy Light really has become a goody two shoes. L plans on letting a few more people die so that he can gather more clues but Light won't be having any of that.

And here we go. Ryuzaki asks if Light could take over as L in the event of his death.

"I think so. You look it."

L's quite blunt isn't he.

Annnnnd they fight again.

Hehe the look on L's face when Misa kisses him. And then the little dance with L's "Yay."

New ending too. Also done by Maximum. Quite nice.

Rule XXXI: 
The number of pages of the Death Note will never run out

Also, George writes with a DOS word processor

All these later rules are just the author making shit up as he wrote lol 
>> ARTICLE
how did he flip to the back page then? oooohhhhhhh *speed racer style*
>> ARTICLE
How does that rule actually manifest? I don't think the manga.anime ever actually had any situations where that rule became relevant.  
  
If Light had ripped every page out of his notebook, the next time he opened it again, would it be "repaired?" What if he filled every page he could "perceive" with handwriting? Would the Death note become "thicker?" Would "spent" pages be banished to some sort of Death Note limbo and be replaced with blank pages, thus keeping the Note's dimensions consistent?  
  
Would extra pages simply fall into some kind of extra-dimensional portal where you could just keep turning the "last" page over and over but keep finding new content beneath it?

The Death Note's physical size doesn't change, i think it's shown when the task force is flipping through the one they get from that corporate guy.

Is that a contradiction, though? Technically "The human who uses this note can go to neither Heaven nor Hell" would be true if all humans go to MU after death and the Note hadn't altered that in any way to begin with.  
  
MU means "nothingness," but it's not *literally* nothingness, as we see the Shinigami interacting there in a physical world.  
  
I always figured the way those rules reconciled with each other was that either 1) The Death Note doesn't alter your "Death Destination" and *all* human beings simply return to "Mu," in this case, being the shinigami world. Or, 2) Humans that have used a Death Note go to "True Mu" and simply cease to exist in any possible way, and the rule is still technically correct in any case because there was never a "Heaven" or a "Hell" to begin with - only the human constructs of what those would be that psychologically restrict and define their movements.
>> ARTICLE
It's not so much that it's a contradiction, it's just proof that the rules can be written in a way that is misleading, possibly intentionally. The first rule reads like a warning--By using the note, you're forfeiting your chance to go to heaven or hell. However, the truth is that, even if you don't use the note, you're still not going to heaven or hell, because nobody does.

 
>> ARTICLE
Right, that's exactly what I was thinking. These specific rules are written in a way to make humans that read them consider their values and to weigh what they're doing on their conscience, but, regardless of what they decide to do, their outcome upon death is still the same.  
  
The "Fear and anguish that only those that have used a Death Note can comprehend" that Ryuk mentions isn't a threat of anything that actually happens upon/after death. It's the psychological weight of having to live the rest of your life with humanity's fear of death compounded by the fact that some spectre of death has told you that you, specifically, will have some sort of "special" judgement upon expiring.

Yeah guys really clever of you, reveal your names to him, it's not like Kira just killed 12 FBI agents or something like that...

Really sometimes I ask myself how they managed to get their job.

Ohh L you're just so quirky, love him so much. Also what a glutton.

And L perfectly summarized Kira's personality, he just sees right through him.

One detail he missed and Kira is dead, well that detail is wandering around in the city and is looking for you Kira. And she is very eager to find you.

[Spoiler Next episode](/s "Fuck yes Naomi you rock, finally someone with common sense, she didn't say her name. She really is the biggest danger for Kira in this moment. Also I think I fucked up with revealing her name to early yesterday in one comment")

She basically solved the whole case, she only needs to connect the person on the bus with Light, and bam case solved. 

IT WAS FORBIDDEN FOR RAYE TO REVEAL HIS IDENTITY? WHAT? OK Raye Penber worst FBI agent in history confirmed right here. They should've switched the roles Raye should've stayed home and his fiance should've continue working for the FBI. Sorry for your loss girl but you were in love with an airhead. 


Ryuk has so much fun here, quick get some popcorn for him. Dis gun be gud.

---

After Episode thoughts:


Ok this one and the next episode are probably my two favourite episodes in the series. This episode we finally get the reveal of L and his quirkiness. Also Kira is very close to be revealed, and he now needs to be very careful what to do here or else he's gonna get arrested and executed. Man I really want to watch the next episode right now. 

Still a bit bummed to probably not getting /u/Neawia's fresh reactions to those two episodes. 


Rules for humans:

1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.
9. The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.
10. The person in possession of the Death Note is possessed by a god of death, its original owner, until they die.
11. If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.
12. The cause of death must still be in realm of possibility for the victim.
13. It's possible to write down the cause of death first and add the name later.
14. **If a human uses the note, a god of death usually appears in front of him/her within 39 days after he/she uses the note.**

Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1. The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.
2. Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.
3. **Gods of Death, the original owners of the Death Note, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note.**

---

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

1. So a bit of rule discussion, I want to discuss if the Death Note only works for the birth name, or do you think that a name change after for example a marriage would affect it?

2. L puts his thumb on his lips when he explains his theories, what are your habits when you're in deep thoughts or when you concentrate on something, or when you simply just bored?

3. You're part of the anti-Kira investigation team, and you need to decide on a fake name to hide your identity, how would you call yourself?
>> ARTICLE
1. It would probably work for both original name and changed name, because the deathnote needs two points of identification, name and face.

2. When I'm in deep thought I would just stare blankly into space.

3. Botakzhen, it is Baldyzhen in Malay.

Shoko Maki basically did a classic error in a mystery show, knowing too much means the universe arranges itself to kill you.
>> ARTICLE
>It would probably work for both original name and changed name, because the deathnote needs two points of identification, name and face.

But when would the name change be "official" for the Death Note? If I would go around and say that my name is Torben from now on for example, would this already be enough? 

[Or for example this here](http://i.imgur.com/bihTWY3.jpg) do you think that both names would work considering that everyone is gonna call him Bob?

>When I'm in deep thought I would just stare blankly into space.

A classic.


>> ARTICLE
[Deathnote](/s "The case for nicknames and assumed aliases don't work, otherwise Shoko Maki would be dead immediately,  I guess it would depending on the name change law of the country, now I'll just invoke the suspension of disbelief/rule of drama before my headcannon explodes.")
>> ARTICLE
It just seems strange to me that the Death Note would consider rules of human society, I believe that the name everyone is calling you, or is knowing you would work. 

[Death Note](/s "I mean L or Ryuzaki could work maybe, Kira probably just never tried the names.")
>> ARTICLE
All names are just societal conventions. You should just stop thinking about this too hard

I started this with the whole intention to "think about it too hard" but nobody else wants to do it apparently...

I know that in the end it doesn't matter but still I just wanted to know what others think about some of the unknown rules of the Death Note 
>> ARTICLE
Keep thinking hard! I think that's half the fun, especially with a re-watch of a show that's built around people thinking hard :P
>> ARTICLE
It said at one time in the series in one of the commercial break notes, that it was only your given name at birth that would work, it said something like;  New names wont work even if they are registered in the family services.   or something like that.
>> ARTICLE
Well now that you mention it I remember something along those lines....

Well thanks, also this means that you're a bit safer from the Death Note after you marry but only if you're the person who changed the surname. 
>> ARTICLE
No worries.  Yeah I think regardless of the semantics the point is, the Death Note will only accept one name to kill each person, so it's the owners job to figure out what that name is.  It's part of the protections built into the death note to keep the owner from killing at random, or atleast slow them down.

> you were in love with an airhead

Raye's like a Ken doll. Beautiful to look at, but ultimately without much substance and with a bit of a sexist streak.
>> ARTICLE
Bang!

And there we go guys. L's odd sitting posture. A surefire way to cause back pain!

Ah I forgot about the odd way he holds things as well.
>> ARTICLE
Today we finally meet L , and discover he is in fact [not blue](http://i.imgur.com/Ze6Ptr3.png), squats like a slav and likes drinking his coffee extra sugar extra sugar. He sums up Light's mistakes thus far and pretty much acknowledges that both of them are not so different. This deduction is in fact very simple, all L needs to do is put himself in *Lights* shoe, and imagines how he himself proceeds to things . L just happens to be in the right side of justice through chance alone. Edit :Light not L

**L is in fact very much blue**, everytime he needs to think and monologue, the world grinds to a halt and enters "Reasoning" mode. [L's thinking theme tune](https://youtu.be/Ye84_weWf_8?t=31m28s) starts playing, he turns blue and exposition is revealed.Kira's colour is red btw.[Deathnote minor spoilers](/s "Prepare a bag of potato chips to be eaten in epic fashion in two days time")

Shoko Maki must be the unluckiest person in the world to conveniently meet Light at the police headqueaters the one time L decides it is correct to turn off cell phone.

Question: If you would have your own reasoning mode, what would be your colour and thinking theme tune?

>> ARTICLE

You probably mean Light here

And here we start with the greatest mystery of the show! Why are all five there when last episode they were in two groups half a hour apart?

Oh how I love L and his mannerisms. He is a extreme stereotype of someone with aspergers or some where else on the autism spectrum. The is no question that he is a very logical and clever just a bit odd. And I love him for it.

We also get a massive coincidence, Light meeting up the the only person who could tie him to the deaths of the agents. Its a nice little moment they have together almost like they are feeling each other out with their probing questions. It's odd to me that Light mentions how to spell his name, yes it would make her more likely to do the same. Maybe it's just me but I find it odd and suspicious. 

Love the weird artsy ending, I'm glad they are making use of the medium and not just flatly telling the story.
>> ARTICLE
> yes it would make her more likely to do the same. Maybe it's just me but I find it odd and suspicious.

Probably not so much in Japanese considering there are so many variations on the same name in terms of spelling.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this episode was quieter, and less dramatic than some of its previous ones so far but it did move the plot forward in many respects. L is very cute and those mannerisms of his are as well.

Raye's Fiancee seems like the key to everything but I'm pretty sure Light will manage to kill her here, though she did make a point with Raye that he shouldn't have given his ID out so I hope she remembers that(I don't want her to die).

The best thing is he already felt that he overlooked something, he was pondering about it the whole episode, but he just didn't know it. Well lucky for him to run into her.
>> ARTICLE
RIP Neawia, gone but never forgotten. Anyways this is one of my favorite episode so let's fucking go!

- And the first time L and Matsuda laid eyes on each other they knew it was love at first sight.

- L honestly looks like a villain with his creepy postures and the dark circles under his eyes as well as the dead eyes that Kiritsugu and Kirei from Fate have. He's one of the weirdest characters I've ever seen, but he's also one of my favorites.

- Oh my god L learned how to use a chair (kinda) you're learning buddy! 

- "Well I'm also childish and I also hate to lose, that's how I know." Not sure why but his delivery and the way he looks at the ground when he says this is hilarious to me every time.

- Chief Yagami is the only one taking this completely serious, the rest of the team is just fighting down the boners that L gave them.

- Sayu is such a cutie honestly [Spoilers] (/s "The most I've ever hated Light is when he was willing to let her die in order to keep the Death Note away from Mello.")

- Naomi is coming for your ass Light. I feel so bad for her, she just looks so broken now that Raye is dead.

- OH FUCK YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO LIGHT, GET READY TO FEEL THE PAIN OF AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN MOTHERFUCKER

- Light you're such a sociopath and I kinda love it even if you do deserve to die.

- Using a fake name, best girl is one sharp cookie. She is honestly so much more intelligent than her fianc was, I mean seriously the fucking guy had Kira standing right behind him and didn't try to fight back at all.

- Oh fuck Light is starting to realize who she really is. Ya that's right you smug asshole start sweating.

- Light suddenly looks super creepy since he knows he's in danger here. 

- "I think whoever saw his ID that day was the one who killed him and all the agents." Dude if she checks who he was tailing that day you're fucked lord Yagami.

Well things are looking pretty tense for the next episode. Will she figure out who Light is? Is Light going to be able to find a way to kill her? Will L and Matsuda finally get that beach house they've been talking about for years? So many unanswered questions.
>> ARTICLE

Oh Naomi, you are the most underrated character in this series.  She is such an incredible detective and she's smart enough to not make the same mistakes as her foolish (late) husband.

There are so many Light fanboys who claim he is so brilliant, but this just goes to remind us all at how many mistakes Light made early on that almost got him caught.  The only reason he didn't get caught is having the unfair advantage of the supreme power of the Death Note.

Naomi had Light beat, he basically lucked into running into her.

I like Ls introduction. Im L Bang. Those baggy eyes though. L never sleeps, huh? Or is that supposed to be make up?

This is fun. L always has everything figured out. At least this time I can agree that hes logically deducing all of this.

[What a weirdo.](http://i.imgur.com/gZGVFck.png)

Good to see Light being the one on the defensive here. Hes definitely made a few stupid decisions.

[First sign of potato chips that everyones talking about.](http://i.imgur.com/42zm5gM.png) And they had to, right? That had to put darling Sayu in such a slightly suggestive pose.

Oh no. Im screwed if people realize I can kill in ways other than a heart attack. - Light

Kira can kill in other ways. - Penbers wife.

Is this her real name or maybe her maiden name? Shes probably just using a fake to stay safe.

Heehahahahaha! Ls just pouring coffee in a helicopter while yelling at Higuchi to spill the beans on how he kills people.

That was super easy. Higuchi confessed just like that.

Soichiro touched it! And he can see Rem! Mogi too!

Thank you, Soichiro. Figured it out right away. Only those who touch the notebook. L wants to touch the notebook.

Why will Lights memories return? Is it just because he touches the notebook? Misa only touched a piece of paper, but touching the entire notebook restores your memories?

[Holy shit, its actually real.](http://i.imgur.com/LkTxtXX.png)

What the hell?!?! Lights freaking out. Getting his memories back. Wild. L didnt want him to touch that just yet, I bet.

I think this is the all according to keikaku moment, right?

[Light up close.](http://i.imgur.com/ngdHlQD.png)

Not much to say right now. Absorbed in the plan.

The red in his eyes is back! Praise Kira! Time for things to get interesting again.

So Rem is just gonna hang out with them.

Is L going to suspect Light again? He could make a connection and assume that Light once owned the Death Note but lost possession of it. Touching it again would give his memories back. Doesnt seem too farfetched for L.

An apple for writing fake rules. Good trade.

Yeah, full blown Kira mode. New god, making new rules, killing for disobeyed said rules.

So, was I right? They switched notebooks? Cha-ching!

I wonder if Lights plan somehow includes disposing of Misa in the process.

Ryuk! Juicy apples. And dried gross apples from the Shinigami realm.

The first thing Ryuk says to Light is just a laugh. I love it. Glad you're back, buddy.

[L up close.](http://i.imgur.com/Jsq7vEH.png)

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Kira's back. Praise be.

I am surprised that Lights plan wasnt more involved. I wouldve thought that hed want control over every little detail like picking out who got the Death Note and making sure Rem doesnt tell the new owner too much about it.

How is Light going to erase everyone's memories of Rem? Kill them? Kill his dad?

Could Light do this, theoretically: write everyone's names from the task force in the Death Note (I guess using Misa). They could write that each person dies in x number of years, however it take for them to reach old age, or even that they go on living until their 'death date'. They could write the stipulation that they all give up on the investigation, but otherwise go on living their lives as normal. This way, no one is investigating Kira, everyone gets to live out their lives

While the ending of the episode mad it seem like Light doesn't care much for Misa (what with that evil smile of his), I still think he'll put up with her. They'll probably stay together until one of them dies. If Light doesn't treat her well, Rem will get pissed off.

I am worried for Misa though since she just cut her lifespan in half again, but still, she probably has a long enough life considering Gelus transferred his lifespan to her.

To answer one of your questions, I'm not sure this rule is revealed but it doesn't affect the plot anyways, one of the rules is that [unrevealed rule](/s "the cause of death must take place within 23 days.  So you can't write a death that'll take place in years.")

EDIT: corrected rule.  Actually, just read the response to me.  He has the full rule:

You got it slightly wrong

[Said rule not yet revealed](/s "If you write, die of disease for the cause of death, but only write a specific time of death without the actual name of disease, the human will die from an adequate disease. But the Death Note can only operate within 23 days (in the human calendar). This is called the 23 day rule.")
>> ARTICLE
You can tell this is eating L alive he just can't shake this feeling of something being too perfect. And Light knowing Misa would take the eye deal again fit right into his plans.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how interested L is going to get in the Shinigami stuff. They know how Kira kills now, but they also know there can be more than one Death Note. L won't be able to stop knowing this could happen again.

And Light, hahaha, what a little bastard. Misa taking the eyes deal again just gets him one step closer to being rid of her.
>> ARTICLE
And Chief Yagami is seeing Shinigamis right now.

Light getting his memories back is one of my favourite moments in this show.

First time watching I even said: "He's finally back" out loud. It is such a great moment with this [Keikaku smile](http://new2.fjcdn.com/comments/It+pisses+me+off+_95cb73096d25601f28c5858954eddacf.jpg) and the music.

And Light's eyes turned back to red when he killed Higuchi, he is now back to being Kira.

> Hey Rem? That's your name isn't it? You chalk bar over there.

Damn L you are really mean...

And Misa is useless, surprise surprise.

BEST BOY IS BACK. And I hear the fangirl cries of everyone in this rewatch.

MATSUDA STOP CALLING HER MisaMisa!

----
[All rules](http://pastebin.com/vKXmUpej)

New rule:

10. It is very difficult to consider that a god of death who has possessed a human could die, but if he should die the Death Note that he brought into the human world will not lose its power.

----

1. Who of you has a bad memory for names?

2. You're getting permission to add or remove a rule from the death Note, what rule would you add or which one would you like to remove.

3. What is the  funniest fansub moment or mistake you know?

>> ARTICLE
>1.\ Who of you has a bad memory for names?

Me :/

[My Deathnote **Experience**](#imdone)

>2\. You're getting permission to add or remove a rule from the death Note, what rule would you add or which one would you like to remove.

That you need to write the person's full name. Picturing the face with whatever you want to call them would be enough. I mean, how else am I supposed to use it? Although, now that I'm thinking about this more...maybe that it cannot affect those who are pure of heart? Yeah...yeah, I like that better. I don't need to use it if people like Light can't use the notebook for evil no matter how twisted their vision gets.

> What is the funniest fansub moment or mistake you know?

I dunno if I've ever even looked at a fansub before :P
>> ARTICLE
> Hey Rem? That's your name isn't it? You chalk bar over there.

The English dub was, "Rem, was it? That's your name, isn't it? The white thing over there?" 'Chalk bar' is much funnier.

Also, [the thing L was building](http://i.imgur.com/5Y3qaRM.png) looks eerily like Rem. Kind of like bones.

> BEST BOY IS BACK. And I hear the fangirl cries of everyone in this rewatch.

Ryuk *and* Light/Kira are back. In the same episode.

[](#schwing)

> Who of you has a bad memory for names?

I like to think I'm pretty good at remembering names. Both first *and* last might be difficult though.

> You're getting permission to add or remove a rule from the death Note, what rule would you add or which one would you like to remove.

"The cause of death must still be in realm of possibility for the victim." Cause why not? Let's just make things so absurdly ridiculous.

Also, adding a rule to the Death Note was a question I was saving for the final thread. I'll probably still ask it, but I'll also post it before the series discussion because it seems like a difficult question to answer. Might need some time to properly think it through.

> What is the funniest fansub moment or mistake you know?

Egh, I don't know. The keikaku one, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Just noticed that I didn't answer your questions, I will do it here:

>Do you think Higuchi should've stayed quiet about his method for killing?

I personally say no, but only because that gave away Kira's biggest advantage. Nobody knowing how Kira kills. It spices thinks up when Kira and L are fighting on the same playing field.

> Would you have taken a taste of the Shinigami apple?

Well no because it looked disgusting, also not a big fan of the taste of sand.

>Both first and last might be difficult though.

Phew, this means I don't need to fear your Death Note anymore after all.

>Egh, I don't know. The keikaku one, I guess.

Yeah the ones that start a meme are the bests.

Hahahaha! That's hilarious. You know, perhaps I just haven't really watched enough fansubs to really pick a favorite.

Light's Keikaku finally rounded itself off. I was a bit confused earlier about why Misa didn't regain her memories when touched with the scrap of Death Note but luckily this episode reminded me that all the rules on possession and memories are much more complicated than I remembered. 

I also love the fact that they end up sort of accepting that Rem exists and that they now have a god of death just chilling in their headquarters. I'm also not sure if they know the rules about possession of the notebook and the fact that it must have a definite owner, which would point more fingers at Light.  
>> ARTICLE
> I'm also not sure if they know the rules about possession of the notebook and the fact that it must have a definite owner, which would point more fingers at Light. 

This is a big point. I'm going to assume this is going to come up soon. How could L not take a guess that Light could still have some connections to the Death Note and Rem.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't you see him look at Light after he regained his memories/killed Higuchi? He absolutely suspects Light, but he's being pressured by everyone to let him go. L is completely alone right now.
>> ARTICLE
It's not nice to call Rem a monster guys. Yes!!! He's back. Not sure how L didn't see Light kill Higuchi. Anyways Light is back in full effect
>> ARTICLE
Can you imagine if Light had never been Kira and Higuchi had been Kira for the entirety of the show up until now? This probably would've been the final episode. 

I can only imagine Soichiro's surprise and fear at seeing Rem after holding the Death Note.

Even L is pretty shocked to see that Shinigami really do exist.

I love how L looks down and the Death Note is missing from his fingers.

"Kata. Keikaku Doori."

Oh how I've been waiting for that, dramatic music and all.

More rules. Apparently if I'm reading this right if a Death Note lands in someone's possession then the Shinigami must make sure the human uses it.

Aizawa's engrish saying "How to use" sounds surprisingly nice.

I love how Misa hugs Ryuk. She's missed him as much as we have.

Misa's not going to live that long at all now. Even if she would've lived to be over 100 thanks to Gelus/Jealous the first eyes deal with Rem would've cut that to maybe over 60 or 70 depending on how much life she received from Gelus, maybe more.

Doing the deal with Ryuk now she'll have even less than that.

The True Kira is back people. Best Kira is back. And all is going according to plan.  

**Discussion Topics**

1. I can't help but feel that Higuchi thought maybe things would've been easier for him if he revealed how he killed. Doesn't really matter now though. Light wasted no time getting back to work.

2. They look shriveled so nah not really interested in eating a shinigami apple. I don't even eat regular apples all that often. Bananas are where it's at.

I wonder though if Gelus had a crapton of years stacked up. How crazy would it be if Misa was supposed to live for hundreds of years. Cutting her lifespan by 1/4 could still leave her at over 100 years old. I do think your numbers are more likely though.

> I can't help but feel that Higuchi thought maybe things would've been easier for him if he revealed how he killed. Doesn't really matter now though. Light wasted no time getting back to work.

I suppose he'd be going to jail either way, but if he gave up ownership of the notebook, a huge piece of evidence against him would literally vanish.

> Bananas are where it's at. 

You... disgust me. Ryuk would be disappointed in you, hahaha.

Poor Light would never get away from her.

This game could go on forever if someone gave up ownership of the notebook whenever they got caught.

Ryuk would actually love this. More for him!

> This game could go on forever if someone gave up ownership of the notebook whenever they got caught.

Yeah, but even if each new Kira didn't know, they would still fall into the 'controlled by Kira' theory. Technically they should be innocent to an extent.

Yeah, that's true.
>> ARTICLE
Man, if I was L I would have had that notebook out of Light's hands so fast...probably had Watari with a gun to his back and a sack over his head too. I mean, that scream (while stylized for our viewing pleasure) was still a dead giveaway for L. He should really be more than just a little suspicious again. Probably just trying to believe in his friend :'(

Answers to /u/Neawia's Discussion topics

1.\ Do you think Higuchi should've stayed quiet about his method for killing?

Nah. He didn't have any reason to hide it. 

>2\. Would you have taken a taste of the Shinigami apple?

Yup! I like trying all sorts of things at least once. I probably would have finished it honestly, especially if it was just some measly sand or something.
>> ARTICLE
> Man, if I was L I would have had that notebook out of Light's hands so fast...probably had Watari with a gun to his back and a sack over his head too.

Right? Especially because L still has his suspicions. I'm a little surprised that he was so willing to let Light take the notebook.

> Probably just trying to believe in his friend :'(

T_T

> Nah. He didn't have any reason to hide it.

Hide a big piece of evidence by basically removing it from existence? Lose all memories of the Death Note which *might* help his case (like it did with Light and Kira). He could act like he was being controlled.

> Yup! I like trying all sorts of things at least once. I probably would have finished it honestly, especially if it was just some measly sand or something.

That's good to hear. I probably would've tried it too out of curiosity, and maybe out of respect for Ryuk. But yeah, not gonna finish it if it tastes like sand.
>> ARTICLE
> Lose all memories of the Death Note which might help his case

haha, I actually had a bit written up about this, and then thought about it and erased it. I mean, at the very least he knows he shot someone and fled authorities at this point, so there's no getting out of it. He's also expressed an unwillingness to give up the Death Note when it would have actually done him some good because he's too greedy. And I don't know if I would want to be hauled away without any memories of what I did and how at this point. I think I would feel like losing that knowledge would only put me at a disadvantage. Of course, in the heat of the moment I may not think this through and would get Rem to take the note in a moment of panic, thereby ending the series since Light would never come in contact with a Death Note again...well...unless Ryuk got hungry and dropped one in front of him.
>> ARTICLE
You do make a lot of good points.

And I suppose within the story, it needed to happen like this so Light could get the book back.

> unless Ryuk got hungry and dropped one in front of him.

"Oh, whoops. How clumsy of me."

That's a really good question. I'd also like an answer to this. They really should have a plan. Maybe a recall feature. Then again, maybe they just don't care.

Here we go Ladies

Well he's back, the guy we love to hate. I've actually missed his evil grins and such, good guy light was pretty boring.

So at the end all Misa has to do is come up and see his name and they win? No way will it be that easy. L looked very suspicious of it all at the end there.

Hope we get to see some Light/Ryuk moments again

Predictions:

I was totally wrong with my last one, Rem seems to be doing basically nothing. I would've liked to see her trick L or at least attempt to.

Anyway I don't think Misa will be allowed back in and won't be able to see L. I also think that Light wants to totally win. By that I mean he doesn't want to live with Rem/ Misa he has way too much pride to be "controlled" by Rem like that. The only way to solve this is to make Rem kill for Misa, I'm not sure how he could do that though. Especially with them all being able to see Rem. The only thing is it would leave him in such an unbeatable position, which is why it probably wont be so easy.  

L is always such a wildcard too and I think he is still completely suspicious of them, so he and Watari might make a move first.

Who knows? There's still time.

> The only way to solve this is to make Rem kill for Misa, I'm not sure how he could do that though.

Agreed, but then, I'm sure something more thought out will end up taking place. Also, it's not like anyone could do anything to stop Rem if she just took out her Death Note and began writing in it. Of course, it would be incredibly suspicious if L died.

> L is always such a wildcard too and I think he is still completely suspicious of them, so he and Watari might make a move first.

Strong possibility. Can't wait to see what they come up with if this is the case.

Awesome! When the talk of this rewatch was going on I had only seen about 10 anime or so and Death Note was in my top 5. I've seen about 30 series or so now and it's still in my top 10 because it's amazing.

What a shame :( I actually finished this series recently for the first time and I enjoyed it a lot. Too bad I'll be missing out on seeing other people's opinions and POV as the show progresses live. 

My experience with the show was that episode 1 to the very end of episode 7 was when the show was at its peak (for me). And I enjoyed the show slightly less (but still great) when a certain character got introduced past episode 10. The show got formulaic for me around episode 17ish to 22ish. Then finally, I found the time-skip arc as well as the ending to be quite disappointing IMO.

So a bit late today, because I started the episode after the thread was posted. So no questions today.

Kira is already annoyed with Kira 2 

Damn Kira:

>And in the worst case, I may end up having to kill everyone there.

He stops at nothing.

>Matsuda: I guess he's so prone to investigate Light to the probability that he is Kira, which is zero.

In the German dub he says something a bit different

> Everything over 0% preys on his mind.

Lucky how the lie with the girlfriend becomes almost immediately true for him.

I just love the interactions between Light and Ryuk, they're just a dream team.


Man Light can be so charming if he wants to.

>Oh yeah, he also told me he's looking for a girlfriend.
So, does anyone wanna volunteer?

All this planning for nothing Light she can still see that you an owner of the Death Note, baka Ryuk forgot to tell you that.

>Well I can't go up to him and say "Hi, Kira! Nice to meet you. I'm the one who sent you the messages" 

Well she has atleast a tiny bit of common sense.

Hey Misa listens to the opening in her free time.


One reason why I hate Misa: She is superficial.

> I'm happy to say that I have found Kira to all the people of television station and the police department.
I'd like to thank you very much.


Another reason why I hate Misa: She is too gullible and impatient and ruins Light's plans. I hate this, I want this to be just a battle of minds between Kira and L but Misa just ruines so much and gives L too much hints. I want Kira to fail because of his own mistakes but not because someone dumber is sabotaging everything. Nobody needed to know that Kira 2 found Kira. 

>Ryuk(Ger Dub): Looks like you're in deep shit right now.

Well Ryuk didn't even know about the eye rule.

I can say atleast one thing, sometimes Misa is able to think before she acts.


Rem thoughts when she wants to hand over her Death Note: 

> Gelus died for that? And I even bothered to bring the Death Note to her...

---

>And if I become a burden to you, then you can just kill me, OK

>I already told you. I don't care even if all you do was to use me.

And here is the prime reason why she is my least liked anime character, nobody should throw away their pride and rights as a human, not even for the person you love. Sorry how can I respect or even like her if she doesn't respect herself?

But the smugness Kira shows at the end is still too satisfying.


Rules for humans:

1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.
9. The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.
10. The person in possession of the Death Note is possessed by a god of death, its original owner, until they die.
11. If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.
12. The cause of death must still be in realm of possibility for the victim.
13. **You may also write the cause and/or details of death prior to filling in the name of the individual. Be sure to insert the name in front of the written cause of death. You have about 19 days (according to the human calendar) in order to fill in a name.**
14. If a human uses the note, a god of death usually appears in front of him/her within 39 days after he/she uses the note.
15. A person can shorten his or her onw life by using the note.
16. One page taken from the Death Note or even  a fragment of the page contains the full effects of the note.
17. The instrument to write with can be anything, (e.g cosmetics, blood, etc.) as long as it can write directly onto the note and remains as legible letters.
18. Even if you do not actually possess the Death Note, the effect will be the same if you can recognize the person and his/her name to place in  the blank.
19. **The owner of a Death Note with Shinigami eyes can't see the remaining life time of another Shinigami owner**
20. **The Death Note will not affect those under 780 days old.**
21. **The Death Note will be rendered useless if the victim's name is misspelled four times**

Rules and abilities of Shinigamis: 

1. The Death Note can increase the lifespan of the writer if they are a Shinigami, making them immortal until they reach the end of their lifespan.
2. Shinigamis have the natural ability to know a person's name and lifespan by looking at them. But the human that has a Death Note can gain the eyes of a Shinigami from the one they are possessed by, only if they give half of their remaining lifespan to that god of death.
3. Gods of Death, the original owners of the Death Note, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note.
4. A god of death cannot be killed even if stabbed in his heart with a knife or shot in the head with a gun. However, there are ways to kill a god of death which are not generally known to the gods of death
5. The specific scope of the condition for death is not known to the gods of death, either so, you must examine and find out.

Stuff happens...

What happened? Did I blink and miss it? 

I literally have nothing to say about the first part of the episode.

And then we get the first meeting of Mira and Light and oh boy are things about to get interesting. The way she is willing to be so subservient is odd. 

Anyway as far as Light is concerned he has a new tool.

That's all I've got. Not a bad episode its just I've got nothing much to say.
>> ARTICLE
I like how everyone is underestimating the hell out of Misa, but in reality she was several steps ahead of everyone. Light: "I am going to take all these measures to avoid being caught by L or the second Kira and his Shinigami" Misa: "lol I found you and now I know everything about you." And in addition, the police thought they've been tricking her with their Kira messages, but she really was talking to Light anyway! And she has a much better cover as a Deathnote user as well. 

And Light was an idiot this episode too, for that statement about "he's only interested in Kira" for talking about why he should go with Matsuda. L prescribing to due process is unfortunate for him, he's 100% right that Misa having found him on the 22nd is exactly why she didn't wait until the 24th to send her message, that should be all he needs to give almost all of his attention to Light from now on, but because it isn't totally incriminating he doesn't take it as solid proof. 

But the biggest reason Light was an idiot this episode was for not making Misa his girlfriend for real. If he's going to be pretending like he's her boyfriend, then it's just as suspicious as if he really was! So why insist that it would be pretend?! You even went out of your way to tell your mom and sister that she was your girlfriend before you even knew that is what she wanted! It's not like you don't like her, you moron! 

Final funny note; Light said to Sayu "you should do the same" when he was talking about having a girlfriend. Light wants his little sister to have a girlfriend. Also, when he was talking about being at a hotel with his girlfriend, he was talking about Ryuzaki. L is Kira's girlfriend. 
>> ARTICLE
This is easily my least favourite episode of the series so far, but hey - at least we've been properly introduced to worst girl and know that she's actually pretty smart by normal standards...sigh, maybe I'd like her more if I didn't find her voice so grating.

So Misa would be able to see Lights name, but not his lifespan. Humans cant see other humans lifespans. Only Shinigami can see that.

So Misas note contains evidence of a third Death Note user. Im glad that I was right about there being other people with Shinigami objects (guess there isnt much else besides Death Notes), even if it was a simple enough prediction to make.

Now I just wonder how many active people have Death Notes. Im surprised Light has yet to do research on human history and see if he could find evidence of deaths caused by Death Notes. It might be hard to find, but Im sure there are a couple of instances of increased heart attacks in certain areas of the world. A time when new users were testing out their new power.

How many messages can Ls team send out pretending to be the real Kira. Shouldnt the real Kira make his own message at some point saying he wasnt the one sending these messages?

ANOTHER SHINIGAMI USER!!!! She looks similar to that girl who has a crush on L. Snap! Light doesnt know about humans not being able to see others lifespans.

Oh wait. Its just Misa in a get-up. Still kind of hot. PS Rems design is fucking sick. Shes like a skeleton warrior. Plus the bandage over her eye.

Also, the way that scene played out was curious. It seemed like Rem maybe knew who she was looking at. Either Light or Ryuk.

OP insert? Not exactly, but Misas still listening to it. And shes totally going to fall for Light, but I dont know if Light will feel the same about her.

Seriously, Chief. Why jump to the conclusion theyre working together? It wouldnt be so simple.

Ooooooo! Is Misa going to show up at Lights house? Light will improvise and say shes his girlfriend!

OH! Shes already going there!

This is such a great moment. The music. Staring at each other.

I already told you about her! YES! BINGO!

He never knows all the rules. You know nothing, Shinigami Ryuk.

Misas completely smitten with Light already. She basically wants to submit to him. I cant tell if she has ulterior motives (crazy ones, no doubt) or if she simply thinks the same way Light does and truly wants to be his girlfriend/work with him.

Jeez, why is she so willing? Oh. Kira killed her parents killer. Justice. She might truly just be grateful to Light. I hope so.

That hug. Kind of sweet in a really deranged way.

[Light up close.](http://i.imgur.com/gW3H3qk.png)

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

I really like Misa. Im hoping she doesnt end up being too annoying or someone who just fucks up and gets in Lights way, but I think she has a lot of potential to add an extra layer to the story. Light seems adamant about not actually being her girlfriend, but its still possible hell end up falling for her. Especially because she herself seems adamant about continually trying to make Light fall for her.

Cant wait for the awkward conversion with Lights family about why hes dating such a *unique* girl.

More Shinigami users? Will we met them? Will more Shinigami come to Earth just to mess around because Light and Misa are screwing up the natural order of things?

If it turns out that Misa is legitimately committed to Light, it would be great. Light would never have to take the Shinigami eyes deal. Plus, if it turns out hes truly heartless, he could convince Misa to sacrifice herself in order to kill L. Then again, Id like it more if the two come to work together, even if Light is just giving out orders.

Maybe Misa confronts L. She calls Light on the phone, taunts L by saying, *Light*, his name is. Forty seconds later, L is dead. Eh, too easy. Actually, if Misa is his girlfriend now, why cant Light just bring her to school and have her meet L that way? Hey, see that guy that I hang out with at school? Whats his name? Done. Show over. Maybe L isnt hanging around school anymore if hes not investigating Light though.

Today we find the horrible truth, Misa Amane bleaches her hair.Also her taking the deal of shinigami eyes isn't actually bad because she has the life span of a god. And yes she probably is a yandere hell bent of killing. Fun fact: This is the second time Aya Hirano played a god, the first time was Haruhi Suzumiya (Best God), coincidentally both shows came out the same year

We also get to see L freaked out for once. Being Madhouse, they even managed to freaking out dramatic, was falling out of the chair really that necessary? I have to admit that it was very awesome and funny. The banter between Light and L was very cheeky too, " You can omit the part of killing L", the only person getting carried away there was L.

[L is such a drama queen.](https://a.pomf.cat/bposbz.mp4)
>> ARTICLE
A tale of two halves this episode and in two ways. It is split between L and Lights little spar and the communication between the kira's. Then we get a nice bit of Background to Mira and her shinigami (and the race as a whole).

Both L and light agree that not only is it a new Kira but one that is not as smart (by a long way) and they idolise the first.

Its a good plan to act as Kira to stop the killings and perhaps set a trap for the new Kira. 

Oh boy dose Mira screw up, giving away far too much away about Kiras ability's and even going as far to reveal the shinigami. She is dumb enough to run in blindly and not give the situation much thought, almost the opposite of Light. It could prove disastrous long term.

Its a shame they didn't commit fully to a noir telling of the death of the shinigami that saved miras life. It could have been so cool.

Hmm, its logical that saving life would reverse the flow of 'life-force' killing the shinigami. Now just how do you get one to save you???

The is a nice theme of one sided love running through the episode. The stranger towards Mira, the shinigami towards Mira and lastly Mira towards Kira. :- As a side note I don't believe this love to be real as such. I see it more as the adoration of a idol, a juvenile sort of love.
>> ARTICLE
Today on Death Note: My magical serial cant be this cute! 

Dang Misa, why do you have to be adorable but also a terrible murderer? At least its good that shes making Light mad, that makes me happy. Ls reaction to the Shinigami was great, its sad that making the deduction that they are real is too fantastical for him to believe, so now hes working with that lie Light told about Shinigami being a metaphor, still, I bet he can use that too. 
>> ARTICLE

This whole situation at the beginning of this episode is again rather tense. Light needs to be careful to not reveal anything here, but I believe he is really tempted to play dumb just to get L killed on T.V.

These jabs they against each other are great:

>I would like you to play the part of the real Kira.

>You are free to kill L


Aaand Misa is ruining everything, she falls for L's trick, she mentions the eyes. And overall she is not a very smart cookie. Almost sabotaging everything.

Also Kiras joke with: "L the shinigamis only eat apples" also just backfired.

Hmmm looks like L is suspecting Light again. [Atleast he looks like he thinking about something](http://i.imgur.com/F1N0H3Q.png), when Light talks.

You really can see that L is suspecting Light again with all the things he says:

>For one, he might reveal more information that he knows Kira wants to keep secret to pressure him into a meeting. 

He probably wouldn't say that if he doesn't think that Kira is listening.

Gelus looks kinda cute for a shinigami.

[character Spoiler](/s "Wow Gelus taste is as shit as /r/anime's, to die for such a trash waifu, not worth it.")

But atleast we know how to kill a Shinigami.


>At least now I have something interesting to tell Kira.

Misa you don't listen don't you?

just some moments ago:

>Rem: Never repeat this to anyone.

[character spoiler](/s "She really never says anything productive."")

[character spoiler](/s "I believe the reason why I don't like her is the combination of how she's just so stereotypical girly, dumb, and how she's only there to stir up the plot here but becomes just utterly useless later on")

I still try to hide what I think about Misa for the first time watcher, but expect me to reveal it tomorrow until then.

Rules for humans:

1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
6. This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
7. The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.
8. The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, i.e. a god of death.
9. The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.
10. The person in possession of the Death Note is possessed by a god of death, its original owner, until they die.
11. If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.

Some (semi)-related and sometimes weirdly specific questions for first timers and rewatcher alike:

Reasons why Misa sucks numero uno: She revealed that there are shinigami and their eyes.

i love how they've set up this freakout reaction from L a few times since the beginning of the show - well done, well done indeed. And yeah, maybe it was a little over the top, the eyes were probably enough, but L isn't exactly normal and it was awesome to watch :D

One thing I don't like though is that this opens up a potential universe problem where shinigami accidentally die because they happen to kill someone who, at some point in their lifetime, would end up shortening the life of someone else somehow. The butterfly effect implications are huge...how the hell do you roll dice that are stacked that high against you? I mean, you could kill someone closer to the end of their life (like hours, or days away may keep you fairly safe since the odds of them shortening someone else's life at that point is fairly low), but then you're busting your ass off all the time just to stay alive - and those guys clearly aren't busting anything haha Maybe that's why the shinigami world looks so under-populated, who knows.

My head-cannon is that the magic of intent is factored into the equation, so that if you happened to take the life of a serial killer on the way to his next victim, that innocent person's life clock is re-calculated, and you don't die; nor do you provide them with your few hundred or whatever stored lifespan years.

While I'm rambling...so what happens if you have the eyes, and you see that someone has like 5 years left (not that you could translate the number unless you were a shinigami), and then you just whip out a knife and stab them? Are you fated to screw up killing them unless you use the Death Note? Or is this like a Minority Report kinda thing where just knowing the outcome can end up making it inaccurate? Questions, questions, questions...
>> ARTICLE

It's explicitly stated that a Shinigami will only die if they kill someone out of love. Otherwise, they'd all be dead.
>> ARTICLE
>It's explicitly stated that a Shinigami will only die if they kill someone out of love

I don't think they ever say that outright though. I know that Rem poeticizes that falling in love with a human is what kills a Shinigami, but as far as we're told, the actual reason for their death is that a Shinigami extends the natural lifespan of a human. I imagine that she mentions love because only a shinigami who loved a human would sacrifice themselves for them. If a shinigami loved a human and allowed that human to select their victims, I don't think the shinigami would die, even though they were killing out of love. I think it has more to do with the fact that their nature is to take life, not extend it. Maybe this is something that's fleshed out more in the Manga, but even my quick Google-fu didn't leave me with a totally satisfactory answer. Thus, I stand by my "intent matters" headcannon that they're not supposed to extend a human's life on purpose.

Kind of a slow episode, but tons of reveals. Aside from the obvious new information, there is an interesting reveal about what kind of person L is. He doesn't seem to be a person who believes in supernatural occurrences, and drives himself on pure facts and deduction skills. That said, he also is genuinely scared of supernatural things, probably because those occurrences defy everything his mind thinks is real.

Also, I want to tell about the beautiful OST that appears in this episode, [Rem's Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs44JRQhWeE). Don't know what instrument it is (a pipe organ?), but the sound is just way to soothing and just the right amount of sad. The debut for this OST fits all the right spots for me.

So I just started watching Black Butler and I'm already regretting it because the servants at the house are all annoying as fuck. But back to a show that makes me happy.

- "I want to catch Kira as much as you do Ryouga." "I'll have to ask that you call me daddy here."

- "Then perhaps I should call myself swag daddy Kira. No relation to the real Kira I swear."

- So Light has met the co-workers. We've got dad, L, always pissed off about something Afro guy, and a young retarded boy.

- "This Kira is such a disgrace, he's not even laughing like a jackass or talking about being god. Fucking casual."

- Light and L are such an amazing combo together. They're both geniuses and you never know when they're working together or when L is testing Light to see if he's Kira.

- Lmao Light wrote "you're free to kill L." Wow he's such a bold prick it's amazing sometimes.

- This definitely doesn't seem like a typical girl's room. Shit takes me back to middle school all that she's missing is a My Chemical Romance poster.

- Holy shit L seems terrified after hearing about the eyes and Shinigami. Ok wait what.... You're not on a roller coaster bud snap out of it. Oh for fucks sake now he's on the floor, one of these days he'll figure out how to use a chair correctly.

- Hahaha I forgot Ryuk has been in the room the entire time, when they finally showed his face he looked so happy. Ryuk for best girl and lead detective.

- Honestly I think Ryuk has it the best out of everyone, he gets to watch all of the mind games unfold in front of him without having to worry about catching Kira, or being caught.

- Misa already knows about Ryuk huh? Rem must know him I kinda forgot all about Rem as a character just never been a fan. 

- Damn I feel so bad for Jealous even with his super small amount of screen time. He just cares so much about Misa that he would kill himself to keep her alive. 

And the episode is over. They're both in the same diner right now which sets up the next episode nicely. Or you could get a curveball you never know with Death Note. See you tomorrow.

Everyone needs aliases. Ill just call you Light.

[Light up close.](http://i.imgur.com/0oSXu5f.png)

Theyre going to make a fake Kira message they move too quick for me to type out my thoughts. Light plays Kira. Hows this going to play out. Well, rather quickly.

Misa has some weird dolls and stuff. I I dont know. She seems kind of hot in a creepy kind of way. A little crazy maybe. A little dumb too. Shes really just going to respond to Kiras message just like that.

See, Lights pissed. He doesnt like the way new Kira thinks. And wtf! Lets just give away a random clue about the eyes. Cmon, Misa. WTF She says Shinigami too!

What the heck is going on with L? He knows something more about the Shinigami. Doesnt look like he was a believer though.

Rem. Dangerous bitch. Oh, apparently Ryuk might be a badass too. Shinigami killer. Maybe Ryuk killed a bunch and thats how Rem obtained a second Death Note. For real though, Rem and Misa are close. I mean, shes going to tell Misa how to kill a Shinigami. Im quite interested in the backstory of these two. Howd they meet? Why are they friends? What caused Misa to take the Shinigami eye deal?

To make a Shinigami fall in love with a human. Well thats just interesting. Love as in, romantic love, Im assuming. Not the way you love family or friends.

Thats a pretty sad love story. Made me feel rather sad for ~~Jealous~~ Gelus. Never able to meet a girl he loves, and then going against Shinigami rules, sacrificing his own life to save her.

I guess Rem couldve picked up his Death Note.

How did ~~Jealous~~ Gelus' life span get added to the girls life?

Mother fucking twists. Misa was the girl. She now owns his Death Note.

I LOVE this track playing when the two are in the diner/cafe.

This was a good episode. From start to finish, just incredibly well done. Im pumped to see what Light and Misa do together.

**Brief Post Episode Thoughts**

Well, we know its possible to literally rewrite fate. Thats interesting. Might come up again in the future.

I wonder how long Misas lifespan still is. She took the Shinigami eyes, but her lifespan may have been exponentially increased depending on how long ~~Jealous~~ Gelus had left on his own lifespan. Still curious as to how he was able to transfer it over in the first place. Possibly just another rule.

Anyway, if its possible that Misa has, lets just say, 100 years left in her life, I wonder how shell age. Would she retain youthfulness or grow old regardless. Maybe shell age proportionally to her new lifespan. But what if she somehow gained more years to her lifespan, lets say, a year before she was supposed to die. Shed look really old, but then live another 50 years, for example.

I dont even know if this will come up, but its interesting to think about.

Ah, so Mikami might be a little messed up in the head. I guess you need to be like that for this line of work, huh? Dudes like Superman putting on those glasses. I like his sense of justice though. Oh, but its easier when theyre kids.

Ok, full asshole. He called his mother dying a miracle. Fuck this guy. Your mom wasnt evil. Im wondering if this guy is going to turn out to be a good choice by Kira.

God recognized me!! At least Mikami seems like he is devoted to Kira and hopefully shouldnt strike out on his own.

Ha, no way. Its Lights old girlfriend. So why did she agreed to this? Ok, it seems that she is also one with similarities to Kira. Interesting.

Light, why do you know her current cellphone number. Its been years. She mightve changed it.

Lights turning on the charm, and Kiyomi is biting. Whats Misa gonna think about this?

What? How did Mello get the camera/microphone in Misas room?

Are they in Paris?

[Light up close.](http://i.imgur.com/WMjCmjr.png)

Lights about to play this girl so hard. Well, interrupted by a phone call.

Wait, why did they have no choice but to remove the bugs?

Hehehe, I love that Mikami calls Light God.

Oh, so Kiyomi only ever loved Light. How nice that shes also a Kira fan.

**Post Episode Thoughts on the Future**

Ryuk looked suspicious at the end of the episode. I cant tell if hes happy that hes being entertained so thoroughly or if he and Light have another plan or maybe he just has a plan of his own. I still think Ryuk cares for Light more than we think. Perhaps hell have to be ready to kill Mikami if he strays from the path of God.

That or Lights going to ask something ridiculous of of Ryuk, and Ryuks gonna be pissed off and refuse, leading to Lights capture.

I like the reintroduction of Kyomi even though it is kind of convenient for Light that after all these years she only ever cared for him. She also has a strong Kira-like sense of justice, oh and shes the new spokesperson for Kira. Oh, and Misa lost all of her memories so even if she gets jealous she cant blab about Light being Kira. Seriously, that whole situation worked out a little too well for Light.

Man I really like Mikami, the best character in the second part in my opinion...

You really can see why he did become who he is right now.

Man what a coincidence the girl almost everybody probably forgot existed gets relevant again.

>I know her current cell phone number.

Ok the English dub again makes more sense. In  the German dub he said:

> I still have her cell phone number

Sounded to me like he had the same number for five years, I mean there could be the slight chance that she has a new phone and a new phone number.

Light that womanizer damn, one after another fall for him, and even more after they find out that he's Kira.

Looks like Light finally picked himself up, finally he's able to deceive everyone again. Well it's easy when nobody of them is L or Near...

Also it looks like his luck is back again.

3. You're Kiras new substitute, what new rule would you like to impose on humanity?

>> ARTICLE
>1\. After hearing his backstory what is your opinion on Mikami?

More screwed up than I thought. Like when it comes to his mom...wut? I was with him until he was happy that the woman who cared for him and wanted to see his suffering end died. I see why he would have developed a worship for Kira though since he happened to be judging people the same way Light did and they would all of a sudden die.

>2\. Suddenly a minor character from the first half became important again. What other minor character would you like to have a more major role in this show?

Light's family members I think. Most everyone else I can think of ends up becoming major in this third of the show.

>3\. You're Kiras new substitute, what new rule would you like to impose on humanity?

Stop ~~judging~~ treating people differently based on race, religion, or personal choices that don't affect wider society (i.e. sexual preferences or how they take their coffee). I changed my mind about the judging bit since I like to judge people based on how they drink coffee and many other factors while still treating them the same as anyone else.


>> ARTICLE
> I know I know they're either S or M right?

Lol, wtf.

> Man I really like Mikami, the best character in the second part in my opinion...

I like him, he's interesting, but he's a total dick. He seems to be even a bit more extreme than Light in wanting to kill 'lazy' people who aren't contributing to society. Dude was happy his mom died because she didn't agree with his views.

> Sounded to me like he had the same number for five years, I mean there could be the slight chance that she has a new phone and a new phone number.

Yeah, but why would Light have her current number? Saying it like that makes it sound like she has changed her number. How did Light get it if it changed?

> After hearing his backstory what is your opinion on Mikami?

I understand his point of view, but he's a dick. Didn't care about his mom dying, and if you kill everyone who doesn't contribute to society in a meaningful manner, there won't be many people left. I think that will lead to more chaos than Light's world would.

> Suddenly a minor character from the first half became important again. What other minor character would you like to have a more major role in this show?

Sayu, though I'm not sure how she'd fit in. Maybe she also would've followed in her father's footsteps and become a detective. I also can't remember many of the other minor characters.

> You're Kiras new substitute, what new rule would you like to impose on humanity?

What an evil question. You looking for ideas for when you take over the world?

Maybe I'd go with something less severe than Mikami. How about if you publicly speak out against Kira then you die. That should work in my... I.. I mean, *Kira's* favor. 

> I never intend to use the Death Note and I don't know what benefit I would get from seeing the life span and names of other strangers... So I would take the money.

That's what I figured was the case. They never really say in the show so I couldn't tell if they knew or not. Like when Mr. Yagami took the eyes deal, I couldn't tell if everyone knew his eyes were red and that's why they weren't saying or if they couldn't see the red at all.

It's same to assume though that people can't see the eyes.
>> ARTICLE
A good episode. I give it a thumbs up. We get to see Mikami's backstory and, even though I think he is evil, it is definitely interesting and he would have been a great person if he didn't go insane and be glad his mum died. Also, I'm pretty sure he is the only character we get a proper backstory for which is unusual considering he only appears in the last few episodes. 

I'm also actually relieved that Light is finally working with people that know what they are doing. Misa meant well but she ended up hurting Light.

 > Kira has had quite a few supporters over the years. Who is your favorite Kira super-fan?

I need to go with Mikami. He is smart, looks great and is a very interesting character.

> Would you rather receive five million dollars, no questions asked, or have Shinigami eyes (without the reduced lifespan, and you see numbers in human years)?

Tough one. With the Shinigami eyes, I wouldn't actually want to see anyone's lifespan because that was almost make life seem trivial to me, making it almost a curse. However, the bonus on not forgetting people's names would be a big bonus. I would probably go for the money, not because I particularly want the money, I just don't want to be constantly reminded of death (that was a bit darker than I expected).
>> ARTICLE
> even though I think he is evil, it is definitely interesting and he would have been a great person if he didn't go insane and be glad his mum died.

I think he could've been just like Light, except he kind of snapped. Once he went full crazy and was glad his mother died, that was the final straw. He wants to kill anyone who isn't a positive contribution to the world whereas Light just wants to kill criminals.

> I'm also actually relieved that Light is finally working with people that know what they are doing. Misa meant well but she ended up hurting Light.

Too bad we're...hehehe *NEAR*ing the end of the show. Mikami and Kiyomi are good additions to the cast.

Episode starts with Mikami, which is great. Episode also starts with very unfitting music, which is weird.

> He was able to distinguish right from wrong better than any of his peers

I'm really worried about the state of mind of his peers now.

Don't do it Teru! Don't kill the ~7 year old bullies!

If there's anything these flashbacks show, it's that instead of "being able to distinguish right from wrong", Teru is just unable to tell that there are things between black and white. Which is consistent with his introduction as a fanatic believer last episode, but inconsistent with stupid narrator from this episode.

[Deletion note](http://img13.deviantart.net/c4bb/i/2015/120/9/a/cybermen__quot_delete_quot__campaign_by_degaspiv-d33hjoa.png) feels more natural this episode.

Last episode made it sound like Light found some stupid fanatic to do his deeds. This episode reveals that while Teru Mikami is clearly a misguided fanatic, he totally played Light and arranged for himself to become the 4th Kira. Mikami would have made a good protagonist.

L would have seen Kira choosing that girl as a spokesperson as another confirmation that Light is Kira. L isn't around anymore, but I am glad that (is that Mogi?) came to the same conclusion. Teru's reasoning for choosing her is okay, though we all know the true reason is that the authors didn't want to bother to introduce a new character.

TFW Light doesn't see anything wrong with the concept of killing non-productive people, just with killing non-productive people while he hasn't eliminated his enemies yet.

Aizawa is now definitely >7% certain that Light is Kira. And we all know that 7% is basically 100%.

Kyomi is so far easily the worst written character, and I honestly don't remember if her character improves in the remaining episodes. This show has its fair share of named female characters (Misa, Rem, Kyomi, Naomi, Sayu, Light's mother, the girl he goes on a date with to lure out Raye Penber, Aizawa's wife and daughter, that criminal working with L, that agent working with N, ~~Mello~~) but with the exception of Misa and Naomi, none of them have both a personality and story relevance. Bit of a shame.

> If there's anything these flashbacks show, it's that instead of "being able to distinguish right from wrong", Teru is just unable to tell that there are things between black and white.

True. Light is definitely more in the middle and seems less extreme than Mikami. If Mikami had this power from the beginning, I think the world be in a much worse state than it is now, assuming he didn't get caught.

> Real world version:

Yeah, but Kiyomi conveniently has always admired and cared about Light.

> TFW Light doesn't see anything wrong with the concept of killing non-productive people, just with killing non-productive people while he hasn't eliminated his enemies yet.

Oh shit, that's right. He did make that comment. I wonder if he just doesn't mind that Mikami is doing that or if he planned on eventually doing it himself.

> Aizawa is now definitely >7% certain that Light is Kira. And we all know that 7% is basically 100%.

Too bad for Aizawa that they *had* to remove the bugs from the room.

> none of them have both a personality and story relevance. Bit of a shame.

How dare you. Sayu has plenty of personality. I'd also argue Rem and Misa have story importance.

> I just realized that the ED shows a dead L lying on the floor. That's horrible. I hope they only put that image in after he actually died.

"So listen, Light, we need you to lie down on the floor and act dead."

"But, I'm alive. The show isn't over. No one knows what happens to me yet."

"Awww, c'mon now. Who's a good boy? Want me to scratch your belly? Good boy. Play dead, Light. Play dead."

Light really looks like L in that picture though.
>> ARTICLE
> Sayu has plenty of personality. I'd also argue Rem and Misa have story importance.

Yes, but not both a personality and story relevance which in my opinion kind of is what makes a character (especially in such a plot-driven show like this one). Sayu, Misa, Naomi, and perhaps the criminal that helped L catch the 3rd Kira had a personality. Rem, Misa, Naomi (and you could argue Sayu, though I think that role could have been anyone else) have story relevance. Misa and Naomi (and Sayu, perhaps) are the only ones that have both.

> Light really looks like L in that picture though.

Damn you're right. I didn't notice that was Light.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that Sayu didn't have much story relevance. I do think though that Rem had both personality and relevance while she lasted. The other names I agree with you.

Light allays want to use people, its his major trait and its very creepy. L did use people for his own ends allot as well but Light is so evil in his intentions.

Light is collecting some of his fanatics about him, where he had kept them at a distance before. They will be easer to use but could be a bit too eager.

She was in character, Misa only has eyes for Light. So unless you were Light, it wouldn't work.

Nice cosplay! To bad I hate her character to oblivion.

How could one hate Misa Misa?

Like Light himself, her intelligence seem to oscillate quite widely based on the demands of the plot (or maybe just whether or not she currently possesses a Death Note - do death notes make people smarter?)

Well without the Death Note shes completely out of the loop on what's going on. Also I thought her intelligence was pretty consistent. She's not dumb but very ditsy

Some mindgames anime, where intellect matters:

* Code Geass

* No Game No Life

* Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor

* Akagi
>> ARTICLE
Try future diary, its amazing
>> ARTICLE
Bait detected.

Seriously, don't try future diary if you're looking for something decent: it's a trainwreck, it's full of plotholes and the characters are stupid.
>> ARTICLE
I remember going from reading the death note manga to watching the future diary anime. I thought it was amazing at the time i watched it. Maybe op won't see the plot holes/ not care about them like i didnt
>> ARTICLE
Something similar happened to me tbh. He might like it, but there are far better shows recommended in this thread. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you read the manga? I just finished it, and was wondering if the anime was any better than it or if it followed it exactly because i thought the manga was pretty underwhelming. Even Yuno, who many praises as the redeeming part of the show, wasn't very prominent in the manga to me.
>> ARTICLE
The anime is a very faithful adaption of the manga. Basically all of the scenes - including the finale - are exactly like the manga. 

It is a good adaption, though, since you get to see the batshit fights with full movement, color, and voice acting. The OP song is really good too. 
>> ARTICLE
I would add psycho pass and monster. Those are the most logically driven shows IMO. 
>> ARTICLE
I honestly can't recommend Akagi. I love Mahjong to death, but to someone that knows absolutely nothing about it.... Just... no.

Now if you still want to watch Akagi even after what I said, ease yourself into Mahjong with a session of Moejong by watching Saki (preferably the first season), and then go watch Akagi.

Also, Akagi OP makes you feel like old man. You won't like it. I like it. I'm not old man.
>> ARTICLE
I know nothing of Mahjong, but still really enjoyed Akagi for the tension and the characters. I guess people differ.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Akagi as well not knowing an ounce of Mahjong as well, but it honestly more fun if you know what is actually happening.
>> ARTICLE
Can confirm, also anime noob who loved deathnote and felt similar to OP about AoT. I'm almost done with Code Geass now and it. Is. AWESOME!
>> ARTICLE
>  intellect matters

>NGNL

What? Not saying it's a bad show. It's just Deus Ex Machina everywhere though.
>> ARTICLE
it's a bad show tho. i can't believe people recommend NGNL to someone new to anime, incest and pedophilia are heavily suggested, forced fan service and the most absurd deus ex machina since SAO, also the plot is very bad. 3/10 only recommended for perverted 14 yeas olds. Sorry if you liked it, your taste is shit.

Edit: so salty, atleast try to defend the shitty anime if you dissagree
>> ARTICLE
All of the solutions were either within the established capabilities of the two main characters or were explained how the characters were able to pull off the solution that they did.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't make it any less Deus ex machina. Their capabilities were pretty much [NGNL spoilers](/s "never lose"). And just because they explain it doesn't make it any less DEM. Sora [spoilers](/s "making the queen betray her side and come with him (or something close, I don't remember") was "explained" if I remember correctly and it was bullshit..

Anyway, it's *really* different from Death Note in almost every way so it's a pretty odd recommendation.
>> ARTICLE
[NGNL Spoilers](/s "Their capabilities are that of two super geniuses who can perform feats that regular humans can't. The first half of episode one went over what they had accomplished in the gaming world and even showed us examples of what they can do (Sora controlling four different characters with a mouse in both his hands and both his feet). So, for example, when Sora was able to make the coin land on its side during the coin flip it wasn't an asspull nor was it Deus ex Machina since the characters have already been established to be geniuses beyond human capabilities.")

[NGNL Spoilers](/s "Before the chess game started Kurumi stated that it wasn't a regular game of chess; the pieces had a will of their own (which is the reason they wouldn't move into danger when Shiro commanded them) and would move based on the commanding power and nature of who commanded them. Sora later figures out that it basically wasn't a chess game to begin with but more like a game of Civ and since the pieces had their own will he was able to use that knowledge and make the pieces switch sides in a different manner than Kurumi. Was it over the top? Of course but it was justified as it served a very important purpose in the show which was establishing the differences between Sora and Shiro (how Sora is the manipulative people reader and how Shiro is the logical/analytical side of Blank.)")

I agree that Death Note is thematically vastly different from NGNL. One is a crime mystery that focuses on ethical dilemmas while the other is an over the top fantasy world with Otaku elements. They are similar though in how Light and Sora are both super geniuses who manipulate others (and who both have great smug/evil grinning faces), how everything goes "all according to plan" for the MC, and how both shows lay out vastly complicated plans that are meant to surprise/stun the viewer once it's revealed what the MC was trying to do (and IMO they both succeed in this). I think they are similar in why people want to watch both shows, to see an overpowered super genius pull off super genius plans.

>> ARTICLE
I believe the queen thing was [NGNL Spoiler](/s "because he was a master of dating sims.") Atleast that's how they spun it. Too call it all deus ex machina though isn't entirely fair because if I remember correctly, there were several times where they had already setup winning conditions at the start. [example:](/s "Jibril's game & the final game.")
>> ARTICLE
I second Kaiji. Also Liar Game is awesome if you are willing to read the manga. Sadly no anime.
>> ARTICLE
Code geass, psycho pass

Also, Monster & Ergo Proxy (for the ambiance), 

wich both are slow to start but worth it.

My friend recommended me this show so badly I watched it. 

Sadly didn't really enjoy it. The fact that  he's always gonna win doesn't give it any tension or excitement. Also the mind games aren't that great and there is no character development.

Code Geass and Monster.

Seen as you're drowning in Code Geass suggestions... I'll say Monster, it's a slow burner and has some pacing issues but it's all logically driven and has a very strong supporting cast. Check it out if you want a more real take on a cat and mouse detective drama.

Code Geass, Mirai Nikki, Psycho Pass, Monster, Zankyou no Terror, Death Parade, Darker than Black 1st season

Psycho Pass. I thought it was a lot like death note just wrapped up in a totally different package.  It's on Netflix too which is awesome
>> ARTICLE
The first few episodes of Zankyou no Terror are quite similar to Death Note. Police investigator guy and terrorists trying to figure out the other's next move/trying to outsmart.

Aldnoah Zero the main character is very logical in problem solving. The second season gets a lot of hate but I liked it all

Code Geass was my second anime, right after Death Note. Code Geass to me is a much better Death Note with a better main character. I've watched a ton of anime since Code Geass, but Code Geass is still my second favorite.

I highly recommend fixing not seeing Death Note. Though I will recommend seeing where people recommend you stop because a lot of people (including myself) were less thrilled about the second half-ish than the first

Aoi Bungaku. It's not a mindgames anime, but it can be plenty intellectual. And pitch dark. Humanly dark.

Eden of the East. 12 random strangers are selected for a high stakes competition, they each are given 10 billion yen to spend in any way they want in order to "Save Japan".

I second this. The main characters are not as morally ambiguous as Light and L, but it has that high-stakes potentially-deadly competition aspect to it which is similar. 

Plus, everyone else seems to be recommending the same three series over and over.

The right side of the subreddit shows you how to make proper spoiler tags. Just an FYI.

And why did the ending ruin your life?
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I noticed that after. I'll try it now haha.

[Death Note] (/s "L was my favorite character. It would've been one thing if he sacrificed himself to help the case against Light, or something along those lines, but in the end his death was completely meaningless. It basically invalidated the whole series up until that point, since Light erased all his research. I think that objectively it was a poor choice for the story direction, especially since they introduced another character in the very next episode that was basically another L." )

Add quotes next time to make it easier to read.

I'm curious. [Spoilers:](/s "Why is L's death meaningless? And what does it invalidate exactly?")
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I'm on mobile haha. One of these days I'll get the hang of this reddit thing. 

[Spoilers] (/s "It was meaningless and invalidated the first ~20 episodes because the episodes were all about L building a case against Light, and even a relationship. As his friend, he can get into Light's head like no one else, and that was what made the show great for me. The back and forth between Light and L was some of the best writing I've ever seen, honestly. Such a classic matchup, like Sherlock and Moriarty, or Batman and The Joker. L's death took that away, and didn't bring them any closer to finding Kira. Since the first episodes were all about L building this repoire with Light, his death put them back to square one. As far as I can tell, after he died they're no closer to Kira than they were on the first episode." )
>> ARTICLE
I can kind of understand where you're coming from, but what else could've happened? [Death Note] (/s "One of them was going to win anyways, so by your logic if L had won that would've meant the series was back to square one right? Since the world would go back to how it was before the series started. Their rivalry was set up from early on in a way that you knew one or the other would die. I think Light triumphing and getting rid of L's work made it seem like it was all over for the good guys and that Light would now take over the world. But then we find out L had a back-up plan. Though I can agree that the second half isn't as great as the first one and it could've been handled better (e.g. Near shouldn't have been able to basically guess his way through many of the clues that L deduced from data he had gathered), I still think that one of the two dying was inevitable")


>> ARTICLE
That's what most people say when I tell them how frustrated I was with it haha. You're right, it was the only real way for the story to conclude the way it was intended to; I guess what I want is a completely different ending.

[DeathNote] (/s "Whether it was the intention of the creator or not, my whole perception of the show was based on the relationship between L and Light. The show played them up to be equal to only each other. I figured one/both of them would die, but I expected it to be in a grand climax on the final episode. For example, maybe L would sacrifice himself, but in a way that revealed to everyone that Light was Kira. That's just an example scenario, and I feel like it could have been handled in a lot of different ways, but the way it actually ended was just very dissatisfying to me. Going back to the comparison to Sherlock and Moriarty: it would be like Moriarty had Sherlock killed, and then another random detective stumbled onto the answer to the case. It doesn't do either character justice." )
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I get what you mean. I think I'll keep this in mind while rewatching the show, probably during the holidays.

And though you had some dissapointments, you really seemed to like the show. What rating did/would you give it?
>> ARTICLE
I did like it a lot, and I definitely feel it was worth watching. And, though in my opinion there were some missteps, objectively speaking it was a great show. Some of the imagery was phenomenal. I loved the stylized look the characters took on when they were having an inner monologue, and the scene where Light wrote a woman's name in the Death Note and it showed her symbolically walking to the hangman's noose still sticks with me. 

Despite the latter part of the show, I'd give it an 8.5/10. The fact that I loved it so much was what made the disappointment so crushing haha.
>> ARTICLE
I see we're on the same page when it comes to a numerical score. 

It's also really nice to see that you're good at articulating your opinion about stuff and not sticking to one or two simple sentences, it really helps the one reading your text understand what you're saying and it's really useful in subreddits like these where opinions and analyzes are thrown left and right.

Oh, and since you're an anime newbie, you probably don't know about MyAnimeList or MAL, I recommend you sign up on there to keep track of all the anime you've watched and explore other anime to watch. Have fun

Liar Game. It didn't get an anime, but was a really good manga which got a Korean Drama adaption. 

It's about a sweet an innocent girl who gets blackmailed into entering a contest with millions of dollars on the line. To win: you need to outwit the other contestants in a variety of games to steal their money. Winner keeps all, losers are forced to pay the money they now owe... By any means necessary. 

She teams up with a morally ambiguous con-artist to win the game. 

The drama is up on Crunchyroll. If you like Death Note, you should love this series too!

Monster is great, Psycho Pass is good too. Also, what kind if phone do you have (random question but there's a lot more ways than Netflix to watch shows)
>> ARTICLE
Monster. I love this show! It's pacing is a little slower than most people would like but I still think it's fantastic. Monster and Death Note are the highest rated Psychological Thrillers on my list. 

I prefer DN over Code Geass but it's very debatable amongst this community so I can't help but recommend it as well. 

Psycho Pass is like Minority Report plus some more psychological stuff. 

Mirai (aka Future Diary) is dark but i found the main characters to be a bit... I don't know, just not my taste. However, it's a psychological thriller so it's also valid. 

Death Parade is very good. I was not expecting how impact full each episode is in its own way. Very good show. 

Darker than Black is like Psycho Pass - Minority Report + X-men kinda. A little less psychological than Psycho Pass but still a good watch
>> ARTICLE
Not exactly what you asked for, but if you liked the **Death Note** art style then **Hikaru no Go** and **Bakuman** are worth checking out as they all have the same lead illustrator,  *Takeshi Obata*.  **Bakuman** also has the same author as **Death Note**, *Tsugumi Ohba*.
>> ARTICLE
In terms of logic and reasoning, I'd say go with Steins; Gate, there are some times where it's just stupid but for the most part there's a lot of mindfuckery going on.
>> ARTICLE
Animes that r/anime WILL recommend to you but you probably shouldnt watch:

Code Geass: The MC might be smart but the show quickly turns into a who has stronger superpowers/ mechas show more than actual smart war tactics.

NGNL: Absolutely horrible. Great visuals and kinda fun but it's heavily filled with incest, pedophilia and useless fanservice. There is also more bullshitting than actual outsmarting.

I recommend Psycho Pass over these 2 any time of the day.

One Piece-14%

*Thats really low*

Number of episodes-96  I forgot it had 670 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Instead of actual filler episodes One Piece just uses tons of scene padding at every oppertunity it can get, so it's just filler in a slightly different and more intrusive form really. They could easily cut another fifth of the show, ignoring intro and outro, and people wouldn't miss a single thing, tbh it would actually increase the quality of the show by a whole lot if they actually did that.  
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. I was almost offended One Piece wasn't in the title.
>> ARTICLE
[670 episodes =/= 670 upvotes.](http://puu.sh/fvKNr/8a47755353.png)
>> ARTICLE
I call bullshit One piece is like 5 minutes of an episode of recap and intro then the last 4 minutes build up for the next were you get to see it again next episode. 
>> ARTICLE
This is why I dropped the anime, the pacing started good, but after Enis Lobby it slowed to a crawl. Fishman island seemed to take forever, especially for what was essentially a "hey, look what we can do now!" arc. Manga only for me... One of the rare series that I would welcome more filler, or just a hiatus.
>> ARTICLE
One piece puts a lot into one manga chapter 
>> ARTICLE
That's because the arcs are so long. I love One Piece but damn it's hard to watching as it airs. It moves at a fairly slow pace.
>> ARTICLE
14% but some of these "non filler arcs" feel like fillers to me, and I have frankly forgotten about them. And while they are not exactly fillers, they contribute very little to the main story or felt so stretched out it felt like a filler. 
>> ARTICLE
I really like One Piece.  Even the fillers are very enjoyable.

>> ARTICLE
I started my first full run of One Piece literally yesterday. I'm on episode 33.
>> ARTICLE
Yea I started at the end of September and I am on 661 now. You've a long road of you and you'll hit some rough patches (Skypiea) but overall it's great show with solid characters and some really powerful moments.
>> ARTICLE
Skypiea was one of my favourite arcs.
>> ARTICLE
Had the most Episode in Big 3 but with the least Filler. I really do love One Piece 
>> ARTICLE
padded episodes are just as bad
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so, I think it's a hell of a lot worse to interrupt a fight that had been hyped for years to introduce a 30+ filler arc like Bleach did with Ulquiorra vs Ichigo.
>> ARTICLE
No they're not. They're far worse. At least with Bleach, in the long run, all the canon arcs are mostly properly paced without unnecessary padding and if you weren't watching when it was airing, you can just ignore the fillers entirely.
>> ARTICLE
Padded episodes *are* filler though. About 25% of each episode of One Piece is actually manga content, and the rest (not including the extended opening and flashback) is all filler (extra dialogue, background shots, unimportant nobodies giving commentary on every part of every fight, etc.).
>> ARTICLE
Besides stretching the episodes, One Piece also spends like 4-5 minutes on the opening and recap.
>> ARTICLE
But, they don't have an ending also. So it uses about the same time a normal anime would use on a opening and ending.
>> ARTICLE
I... I admit I never noticed that they didnt lose time from an ending. Wow haha
>> ARTICLE
So I guess all of us skip the first 5 minutes every week
>> ARTICLE
It's literally 5 minutes.  2 minutes on credits and 'next week'. leaves 13 minutes of show.  Take another 5-10 minutes on secondary characters we will never see again after this arc, and there you have your content. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll usually watch the recap, but that sunken ship is getting *real* old.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, change the opening already. You did it all the time before, just change it now. 
>> ARTICLE
One piece pacing is stretched just like dbz. Almost one episode for a manga chapter, while naruto and others adapt 2 or 3 manga chapters in each episode.
>> ARTICLE
honestly i prefer slow pacing to having a random arc about the backstory of a character in the middle of a big fight.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the random arcs between the Aizen arc in Bleach was a bit well....annoying.


>> ARTICLE
I prefer seasons. Gives us 24 high quality one piece episodes each year and stop. Next year do the same. This is the way almost the whole anime industry works, except for one piece because it's such a huge cash cow that stopping it is unacceptable for the profits. Sadly, we will never get One Piece with the quality level of Attack on Titan or Fate/Stay Night.
>> ARTICLE
If they did 24 episodes a year the show would take like 30 years to finish..
>> ARTICLE
Not at all, because they would adapt the whole past year of One Piece chapters in this year's season. They would, indeed, be one year late, but as soon as the manga ends they can make a "series speciall last season" and make 48 episodes or more, for example. The episodes would have a better pacing instead of "Staring and screaming intensifies" like it is now and the quality would be much better like Fate/Stay Night does.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, staring and screaming still are a problem, but I think Toei is doing OK introducing filler comedic scenes. Yes, the episodes are dragged out, although they never do like, for example Evangelion did, where multiple times they had a single frame for a whole minute.

Each of both anime had its difficulties, EVA's was the Budget, and One Piece doesn't have enough source material.

Also, it would be imposible to have a One Piece series with FSN UBW quality. Even if we suppose that One Piece manga ends, and we have some kind of One Piece Kai, the quality will never match FSN's. First, because its Toei, and second, because image quality is not important for the One Piece anime.

That being said, I think that, so far, One Piece has delivered in terms of image quality when it comes to important moments, specially when the important fights end.
>> ARTICLE
> Sadly, we will never get One Piece with the quality level of Attack on Titan or Fate/Stay Night.

Please think about what you're saying.

NOBODY would be able to pull off a One Piece adaptation with the quality of Fate/Stay Night. 

Ufotable has been producing Fate/Stay Night for likely a couple of years already, and they still need to take a 3 month break in between 12 episode seasons.

To cover a series of One Piece with that level of production, you'd need to wait around 3 years per 24 episodes. You know how long it would take to see the end of One Piece with that type of quality? Decades upon decades. 

I understand people want to see a more ''beautiful'' One Piece, but please be realistic with your expectations. Your expectations are anything but realistic. 

>> ARTICLE
True, bur they could still increase quality a lot if they use CG a lot.
>> ARTICLE
yeah they could easily increase the quality by compromising the quality
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to remind people that the light novels has been out for quite some time before they made an adaptation for animation. And after adaptation for the anime, they still take their time releasing it. One PIece, Naruto, and all these crap mainstream animes probably could have been better had they not been mainstream and forced to comply by weekly deadlines. It's almost like our media failing to properly inform the public because they are too busy manipulating our emotions/interests for hits + money.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, good point, they aren't but a man can dream. Please, suggest me other anime with a middle ground, because I don't know enough animes to choose a better one, seriously. But yeah, I'd love something better than what we have, with a better pacing as well.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece as an adaptation is a little bit cursed. No matter what you do, it will always have an issue. That's the curse of following a ridiculously long and on-going manga. Either you add in fillers which people will complain about, you take breaks which people will be annoyed by, or you slow down the pacing which is what they've been doing. Also, producing an episode every single week for decades makes it hard to perfect the animation at all times.

No matter what, there's going to be complaints. They've decided to go with the slower pacing route, and I don't really blame them for that, especially from a business perspective. I do agree that they could put more effort to ensure that their animation is more consistent (sometimes its beautiful, sometimes not so much). But that's about it. It's really hard to compare it to other anime simply because it is in an extremely unique situation.

Or you could be like Hunter x Hunter and have virtually no filler in either adaptation, but have Togashi as your author who constantly goes on extended hiatuses, forcing the adaptations to have to stop. They didn't stretch the anime into a billion episodes and focused on quality.

But good fucking god, Hunter x Hunter a fantastic anime. Only anime of it's type I'd give a solid 10/10. 

>> ARTICLE
Stopping fits in the category of taking breaks, but it's the worst form of that. We are left with an unfinished story. I agree that HxH 2011 was absolutely incredible, but that's in part due to the fact that it began 13 years after the manga. Nobody can deny that the fact that it s finished while the story is still incomplete is a bit annoying, though. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, it didn't really begin 13 years after the manga, he's just been writing it for 13 years, but w/e. 

I think both versions (1999 and 2011) both stopped at really solid points though. You get a sense of closure with where it's at. Sure, there are plenty of things left unanswered, but I wasn't unsatisfied. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it also improves ratings and profits, because people even skip fillers entirely, and since there are news and reports about when filler starts and when it ends they have periods with a much smaller rating, which is bad for the sponsors.
>> ARTICLE
The movies they have made for One Piece recently have been absolutely gorgeous. My favorites are the Nami Arc adaptation, Film Z and most recently the 3D2Y special that covers content that wasn't even in the manga but is definitely canon.
>> ARTICLE
Don't want to be a dick... but the 3D2Y special is not cannon, it was an original story by the anime crew, with Oda character designs, IIRC.
>> ARTICLE
I was under the impression that it was considered canon since we had not previously known what exactly happened, but I think you're right and I confused myself since I remember Oda was on the team, but I don't think he wrote the story itself.

It's cool, my mistake.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, it could be considered cannon, same with Strong World and Film Z, I think Toei has really "grabbed" One Piece spirit and they know how to make the characters work in a very similar way to how Oda does it. So, even if they are not cannon, they are still awesome and every One Piece fan should definetely watch them :D
>> ARTICLE
The only major complaint I have about the series is the pacing and drawn-out pan shots in each episode. They could remedy this by releasing an episode every other week with two chapters (or even 1.5) per episode. 

I doubt they'll ever do this though. It could potentially affect the audience / cash flow.
>> ARTICLE
I love the 2 week idea actually. However, you need it for manga productions, not anime. If you release anime bi-weekly but the manga is still weekly release, it's the story line that suffers while less views per week on animation means less money so it's kind of a lose-lose in that scenario.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's actually a really great idea. 2 weeks isn't *that* much worse than 1 week, and 1.5-2 chapters per episode would be pretty ideal pacing. You're right though, I'm sure it'd have too much of an effect on other things.
>> ARTICLE
That's what gintama does, they go on for 24-50 episodes, then stop once they caught up (it's going to start again in spring, and they have 116 chapters to cover). Any filler they do is usually hillarious, they even had an episode making fun of the fact that it's a filler episode, and went on to explain the different ways shows could avoid catching up to the source material. 
>> ARTICLE
One of the reasons they do that is because Oda has a page limit per chapter in Shonen Jump that forces him to cut things he really wants to show, like character interactions or fight moments that don't the drive the plot forward but justify later scenes. He passes that sort of thing to the anime writers as extra script fodder. That combined with the pacing of the average One Piece chapter makes it pretty feasible to get an episode from a chapter: It's not like Bleach, where 3 chapters can comfortably fit in 22 minutes.

The other difference is that One Piece is ongoing and on a massive scale. F/SN is a completed visual novel, all 3 routes can be looked at as 3 wholes and edited to fit whatever media. AoT was adapted from the chapters that were out and fit as a complete story that could continue on if it did well. One Piece has a ton of small details and ongoing plots: you can't cut 50 chapters into 24 episodes without dropping a few things that might be rather important later on. Imagine if Laboon was only half an episode!

Thank fuck JoJo got this treatment.

Well at the rate its going we might hit part 8 before Araki finishes it because jesus christ this part is slow. But Beetle Tendency made up for that.

Even though Jojo is long as hell, the 24+ ep season just feels so right.

Let's not forget about RedLine arc where they spent over 20 episodes recalling the past, literally re-using previous episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I plan on watching One Piece soonish, so can I just skip Red Line, or should I watch it? 
>> ARTICLE
Skip all filler except G-8 arc.
>> ARTICLE
Well, that really doesn't explain much when I don't know what's filler and what's not. 
>> ARTICLE
Go to that site and you'll find the list of fillers. G8 is from episode 196 to episode 206. Skip every red thing on that list except 196-206.
>> ARTICLE
You'll understand once you get to that point.
>> ARTICLE
watch it all!
>> ARTICLE
Go to the one piece wikia skip all yellow (if i remember correctly) although there were some funny ones (filler so idk if spoiler that zoro is using no-sword style)

And if you can find the *movie* Red Line - the anime about racing - *watch that shit ASAP*.
>> ARTICLE
Oh Lord, that movie...so good.  As soon as I get a Blu-ray player, that's the first movie I'm getting for it. 
>> ARTICLE
take my word for it, watch everything.
>> ARTICLE
Everything!

Isn't that... alot?

Speaking as someone who's never seen a show that big.

>> ARTICLE
Roger roger.  I don't ever really skip stuff, but recap episodes drive me nuts. 
>> ARTICLE
Watching the One Piece Movie 9th instead of the Drum Island Arc will save you maybe 5-10 episodes and is really well done with better graphics... but is spoilery for crew members if you dont have know anything about One Piece.

I always tell ppl to start at the beginning of the Grand Line, with Laboon. Then latergo back and check out East Blue (made 15 years ago).
>> ARTICLE
Well let me explain it this way. The recaps happen at the right time in that you actually get teary eyed watching them. Also some times the recaps further the plot of the current event. Trying not to spoil everything lol.
>> ARTICLE
Well, recap episodes make sense when it's a long show and you're watching it week by week... But when you're gunning through, unless the recap episode uses a unique perspective or recontextualization, it's preferable to skip. I'm not sure where Red Line sits on that scale, so I'd watch at least an episode or two before deciding whether to skip the rest. 
>> ARTICLE
When an anime does a 4 minute "flashback" to the previous episode, I stop watching.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece doesn't start with new content until about 4:30 - 5:30. The ONLY plus side to that is they don't have an Outro. Just a "To Be Continued" splash and a 15 sec teaser. 
>> ARTICLE
When did that happen? The only "recap arc" I remember was between Ennies Lobby Parts 1 and 2 where they made about 7-8 episodes of Flashbacks to show each of the main characters backstories again. It was a bit nasty having that filler there, but as far as I know they were only like 20 episodes behind the manga at that time.
>> ARTICLE
From my memory of nearly 10 years ago, it's at episode 130.  
About 10 episodes of pure recap. One for each character.  

It's almost comparable to "Endless Eight".
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely *nothing* compares to Endless Eight. What a fucky one.
>> ARTICLE
Whenever they do it, I feel like it's justified. It would have been years at that point in releases, you know? Sometimes new fans need a recap.
>> ARTICLE
Oh!! You mean the post alabasta arc, that was, IIRC, even smaller than the inbetween arc of Ennies Lobby, like 5 episodes or so.

Don't get me wrong, I don't usually like fillers, but One Piece doesn't have long filler arcs, I remember that Bleach had some fillers that took like a whole year to complete. In One Piece most of them don't ever go over 10 episodes. And they never interrupt an arc, except in Ennies Lobby.
>> ARTICLE
Why are Cowboy Bebop and Dennou Coil in there?
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop is listed at 0%. Which is odd since, given that Cowboy Bebop wasn't adapted from a manga, you would think Cowboy Bebop is 100% filler under their rules. Every single storyline wasn't in the manga. =P
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure filler episodes are just side-stories. Stuff that isn't related to the main plot and such. Don't think it actually refers to episodes that have stuff that wasn't in a manga.
>> ARTICLE
Well Cowboy Bebop had a lot of that. 
>> ARTICLE
By that logic, the first like...14 episodes of Bebop are filler, cuz the main plot doesn't really kick in til pretty late in the show..
>> ARTICLE
Which is.. completely true.

Most of Cowboy Bebop is filler, you can literally skip plenty of episodes and get the full jist down the the little details of what is going on in the main plot.

Fillers are episodes that are skippable and that by skipping them you don't miss anything crucial to the main plot.

TL;DR - Yes, Bebop had lots of filler.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop is an episodic show.  Episodic series don't have the same constraints for "filler" as serials.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, they may not move the plot along, but they help develop the characters which is equally important. If those episodes weren't there we wouldn't have been as interested in the individual characters and we would not hold it to such a high credit as we do now. 
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop has no filler episodes, no matter how you define the word.  Each episode provides background, context, and information to the main characters.
>> ARTICLE
> By that logic. 

That's...sorta how it's defined, at least by TVtropes and Urban Dic.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why I'm a little surprised that someone would mess up a TVtropes entry to that extent.
>> ARTICLE
Filler is not a well defined term. Most people I know define filler as being anything that was added to an adaptation that was not in the source material.  
The definition you are using is a broader definition to refer to anything designed to fill space in a show, whether to just make it longer or to allow more of the source material to come or whatever the reason may be, that deviates from the main plot. You are honestly the first person I have seen use that definition when talking about anime filler.

edit: A better description of how I define filler would actually be anything that is inserted into an adaptation that is not from the source material. I wouldn't describe additional material added to the end of an adaptation as filler. Often this definition will match up with the other when evaluating if something is or is not filler, it's just easier to categorically say "This arc wasn't in the original story" than, "This arc deviates from the main plot". 
>> ARTICLE
"Most people I know" is never an effective sample.  Most people I know, that watch anime, define filler the way TVtropes and Urban Dic do, as episodes that distract from the main plot of the show.  So whose "most people" is the right most people?

In fact, and I do not say this to mock you but rather out of 100% sincerity, this thread is the first I've ever heard of filler being used to describe things that don't come from the source material.
>> ARTICLE
You're talking about story filler, whereas the top-level list is talking about adaptational filler, and a lot of people in this thread are therefore also talking about adaptational filler.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't saying that the TVtropes and Urban Dic definition were wrong, or that my definition was the only correct one. What I was saying is that different people define filler differently. The reason I brought up the fact that people I know use the same definition of filler that I do is to make the point that it's not just ignorance of the definition on my part.
>> ARTICLE
I agree.  I've never heard of this description of filler before.  To me it's 100% anything unrelated to the main plot.

This weird definition that's being used here implies that FMA is almost all filler, the new season of Tokyo Ghoul is filler, and that 18 and on in AgK were filler.  Which frankly, they weren't.
>> ARTICLE
I think of filler episodes can take on one of two different meanings depending on if there is source material. The first one being if there is source material then a story not provided by the source. The second being if there is no source a story not directly related to the main plot.
>> ARTICLE
I always like adding the extra clause that basically filler is not only not from the source material, but pretty much everyone pretends it never happened in the story from there on out.
>> ARTICLE
I think Cowboy Bebop is a special case. It's a very character driven show. Almost every episode (with the possible exception of Mushroom Samba) is central to character development. The story episodes wouldn't be what they are without the "filler" episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Probably aren't, because they aren't filling anything between anything. It was just this kind of show, until there came a plot.

Even if we're to expand the "wasn't in the manga" definition, it should probably be "filler is a side story which only aired to fill time between something more solid". E.g. if there's a source material then between source material. Or unrelated episode inserted between two story-heavy ones. But if we have unrelated episode done just because it's the kind of show with many one-shots AND there's no grand story going atm, then it isn't a filler.
>> ARTICLE
39% in Sailor Moon can't be, can it? That anime is like half Monster of the week that wasn't in the manga in half plot. And half of the plot was completely changed.
>> ARTICLE
It's hard to do this with Sailor Moon.  Most anime have episodes 100% adapted from the manga and then do arcs of 100% anime original filler to stretch out time.  Sailor Moon would take bits of pieces of the manga plot and intersperse them into episodes that were otherwise just monster of the day filler, or would take manga plot points and change them to fit the feel of the anime better.
>> ARTICLE
Would it though? Season 1 was made up almost exclusively of filler episodes. There were maybe 10 episodes that had anything important in them.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget the entire sub-season of Alan and Ann, the Aliens - entirely filler there.

That's why I'm liking Sailormoon Crystal.  It's much more of a cohesive anime with a story rather than monster-of-the-week story.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly expected DBZ to be higher. That's amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Also, unlike other series, DBZ's filler episodes were fuckin' hilarious. I think I could watch a whole series of Goku and Piccolo adapting to normal life like when they took their driving exams.
>> ARTICLE
Must've missed that episode. Which arc was that in? 
>> ARTICLE
The Android arc. It's episode 125.
>> ARTICLE
It was before the Cell tournament.
>> ARTICLE
That episode was hilarious.

Same with Gohan in high school and Goten cockblocking him when teaching Videl how to fly.  A Shonen romance that isnt all unrequited bullshit and develops in a timely manner!
>> ARTICLE
It's because instead of making actual filler episodes, DBZ stretched out many episodes to adapt like 2 pages of the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
And the filler we got, like Goku and Piccolo driving, was hilarious. 
>> ARTICLE
Also, IIRC there were some filler subplots, which probably wouldn't be counted in that sort of measurement since I'd imagine it doesn't bother with episodes that are partially filler and partially manga adapted.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...


TEN EPISODES LATER

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...
>> ARTICLE
Weren't they on Namek for like, 20 fucking episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Namek saga uncut was 27 episode, 15 in kai. Then was the Captain Ginyu Saga (7 ep both), and Finally the Frieza saga which was 33 episodes (19 in kai). It was the longest fight in the series, even without filler. The "5 minutes" was 9 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Imagine if episodes released weekly...5 mins = over 2 months
I'd be both pissed and intrigued to find out what happens
>> ARTICLE
still better than 2 months of the same episode happening over and over again
>> ARTICLE
Huh? Haruhi? Wha?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I remember when I was watching after school. Goku arrived on Namek and kicked ass. Vegeta was going "is he a super-saiyajin?!" And then... They apparently ran out of episodes so it was back to episode one and the Raddizz saga. It was "Fuuuuuuuuu-" 
>> ARTICLE
Lol I know exactly what you're talking about. I remember this exact day is if it were yesterday.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, right. That makes sense. They didn't inject it with a creamy filling, they just took what was there and streeetched it out like taffy. That's a sneaky way to get around filler, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
It's exactly what One Piece is doing too (it's sitting at 14% filler now). Less than 3 days have passed in the last ~175 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, and two massive arcs...
>> ARTICLE
I hope they're doing it in real time a la 24. 175 episodes at  say, 23 minutes an ep is not far off 72 hours... 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair that's the same amount of time that's passed in the manga. One Piece has been doing 1 episode = 1 chapter for a while now. It's fairly drawn out but nowhere near as bad as DBZ.
>> ARTICLE
> It's fairly drawn out but nowhere near as bad as DBZ.

I'd say it's pretty similar, saying "nowhere near" is such an overstatement.
>> ARTICLE
You keep spewing lies. You aren't even watching it.
>> ARTICLE
stop necro'ing my comments
>> ARTICLE
DBZ would stretch out pages to make an episode. At least One Piece is ever so slightly better than that.

>> ARTICLE
Perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Would that make you recommend not watching it, or does it not really matter that much?
>> ARTICLE
I'd still say to watch it if you've got the time. Although it's slow at times some parts are so amazingly well done that it makes up for it.
>> ARTICLE
If you're down to watch 650 episodes, go for it. I really enjoy it, but if you don't have time to commit to it, I wouldn't recommend it. Good writing, nice pacing within most arcs, fun movies, over the top powers/action. Okay, I actually fucking love it. 
>> ARTICLE
Well I definitely do have time, so thanks, I'll at the very least give it a shot.
>> ARTICLE
>Less than 3 days have passed in the last ~175 episodes.

That's not due to slow pacing or anything, that's just the nature of the series. These 3 days are the most event-filled days in the history of the world. Each arc is pretty much 1 day, instead of lasting days/weeks. I hate when people throw complaints that don't even make sense.

Humg has done you a disservice. It is one of the world's greatest anime.

It still is one of the greatest anime in its category, long-running battle shounen. Sure, if you compare it to anime like FMA or Death Note it pales in comparison, but compared to, let's say, Bleach or Naruto it's classes above. Then again, it all comes down to personal taste.

So a shitty shonen that is better than the other shitty shonen, big deal.

Wow that was such a well thought out reply. How could I ever dispute that. You know some people don't like SoL I for one am ones of thoes people. I mean sure some are okay but for the most part anything not shonen based is boring as hell. 
>> ARTICLE
That definitely would not be me.

One Piece touches on so many themes and creates loveable characters effortlessly, in a colorful and refreshing world that we don't see every day. There are plenty of excellent, high quality anime that I've enjoyed immensely, but One Piece is certainly not one to be skipped, especially if the decision is based on an arbitrary percentage or number of episodes.
>> ARTICLE
> based on an arbitrary percentage or number of episodes.

I think most people avoid it for a number of reasons, which include the terrible pacing, disgusting artwork, the annoying fanbase, or the misleading [4kidz dub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw1u7YvGmYQ&x-yt-cl=85114404&x-yt-ts=1422579428)
>> ARTICLE
Disgusting artwork?
>> ARTICLE
I have seen so much anime, and One Piece still has some of the best Characters and Story in anime. Just because its long, I feel like lots of people excuse it.

Fairy Tail is an example of a popular anime that shouldn't, One Piece actually has amazing tear jerking scenes and kick ass fights.
>> ARTICLE
You just convinced me to never watch Fairy Tail.
>> ARTICLE
Good.
>> ARTICLE
> One Piece actually has amazing tear jerking scenes and kick ass fights.

Yeah ... ^^^^like ^^^^every ^^^^100 ^^^^episodes ^^^^or ^^^^so
>> ARTICLE
In the most recent arc alone, there has been several. So take your tiny text and get some real numbers.
>> ARTICLE
It's the same in the manga, One Piece has really long arcs where it takes over 50-100 chapters to finish and it takes place over a couple of hours in One Piece time. Don't not watch it because of that comment.

Please don't take this as "because its 100 chapters it must be boring and slow" Each and every chapter is high class.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how that many pages of nothing happening can be seriously considered "high class". When you look at anime that develop characters in a significant and compelling fashion in virtually every episode, and wrap in under 24 episodes, the idea that something can be good after being stretched out so thin to sell more volumes is absurd.
>> ARTICLE
There is a crap ton of stuff happening, you don't even know what is on each chapter yet you say nothing is happening. Go read/ watch it before you make a decision.
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious to hear how the main characters barely developing and nobody important ever dying in battles that go on for chapters and chapters "a crap ton of stuff happening". I'll admit that Oda's art tends to be quite good, and as far as drawn-out battles I don't care about go, the fights are quite pretty to look at, but none of that really elevates it to anything praiseworthy.
>> ARTICLE
Like I said watch/read it before you say anything. I am not saying you will like it and what not, just don't have an opinion on something you don't know.
>> ARTICLE
Mm it's closer to DBZ in the story arcs. DBZ had arcs that were grouped into Sagas. One Piece has multiple arcs per saga and each arc is connected by a common thread for said saga. At the end of the saga, they (typically) defeat the main boss and they continue to the next saga. Right now, Dressrosa is putting in mad work and is currently the longest "arc" (70+ chapters, arcs usually have about 40-50), and the Pirate Alliance "saga" currently has over 120 chapters. 
>> ARTICLE
I need to catch up reading One Piece. I left off somewhere around them entering the toy town (or wherever that was) for the fighting competition. 

**Yes, I realize how far behind I am. Life's been rough on me for a while.**
>> ARTICLE
You've just convinced me never to read it.
>> ARTICLE
Your missing out on one of the greatest stories in Manga/anime but that's for the individual. As long as you don't criticize it everything is k. Also why does it matter how much time passes in the show compared to the number of chapters? 

In my opinion, as long as it's good everything else doesn't matter.
>> ARTICLE
You just convinced me to never go into a One Piece thread.

its the same as the manga, there are at least 8 fights happening at the same time in different parts of the island and also where did you get the 175 episodes, 175 episodes ago we were in the middle of the fishman island arc and that was not 3 days ago. the dressrosa arc started 50 episodes ago
>> ARTICLE
The left Fishman Island the day after the big fight, IIRC, that same day they arrive at Punk Hazard, and the next day Dresrossa starts. That's 3 days, 4 at most.
>> ARTICLE
did they ever say it was 1 day of travel between the islands because i was always under the impression it was at least a few days
>> ARTICLE
Just when they left Fishman Island they arrived at Punk Hazard, like, just after they got back to the surface, they were in front of the island. Once they end in Punk Hazard, Law says that Dresrossa is close and they will arrive the next day if they sail during the night.

Also, remember that Pekoms said that Big Mom's Tea Party would take place in 4 days, and, as far as we know, they are still near Dresrossa.
>> ARTICLE
It has been 3 days since Fishman Island started. Dressrosa is all one day, Punkhazard was one day, same with Fishman.
>> ARTICLE
It felt thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.

I'm fairly sure the Toei didn't have some weird legal dispute with Toriyama.

i bet if they played out the book word by word it would have filled a trilogy anyway.

Bleach anime started off amazing, for the first 60 episodes they zipped through the manga, and it had an awesome pace, but then it got so slow and a fight would last like 5 episodes and half of an episode was always recap. Kinda killed it for me :(
>> ARTICLE
Yes.  Bleach was fantastic way back when I was watching it in my university anime club.  Then we hit the Filler wall and dropped it like a rock.
>> ARTICLE
FMA brotherhood had filler episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Episode 1 - It was an original episode that didn't take place in the manga, was completely made up and didn't serve any purpose.

Episode 27 - Was a recap episode.

So yeah, 2 episodes of fillers.
>> ARTICLE
That first episode seemed like a pilot episode from Western TV. It grabbed your attention and gave the viewer and look into what the series is like without waiting on build-up. Kind of jarring to anime fans, but it made sense for Western audiences with little anime exposure. 
>> ARTICLE
Also great foreshadowing.
>> ARTICLE
Jarring? I wish other anime pilot episodes weren't so fucking boring.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of animes usually have complex backgrounds with their own fantasy setting. Hence why the convention for the pilot is to explore the setting and give an intro about the world and its fundamentals. FMA:B's pilot did not follow this convention, hence why it was so confusing for people (including myself) to watch.

I think the episode was made to grab the attention of people who were already familiar with either the manga or the previous anime, so they could see how the new visuals looked, and to check out other artistic and technical improvements.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe jarring isn't the right word. It's not something we're used to seeing in anime, so it's unusual when we do see it. 
>> ARTICLE
The starter episode with ice alchemist was original to the anime.  Unless it was based on a bonus story I don't know about.  
>> ARTICLE
I have all the volumes from the manga. There was no bonus ice alchemist story, so you're correct.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x hunter is one of the most impressive, out of 144 episodes there are 2 fillers
>> ARTICLE
Madhouse did such an amazing job with hxh.  For anyone who hasnt seen it, I would say it is, pound for pound,  the best anime. It, at its least, has the best single arc in any anime, and completely transcends the medium.
>> ARTICLE
which arc is that?
>> ARTICLE
The chimera ant arc.
>> ARTICLE
He's probably talking about the Chimera Ant arc.
>> ARTICLE
Which isn't the best single arc in any anime, it's too drawn out, I know it's a bit of nitpicking, but you can't just outright call it the best.
>> ARTICLE
I would say that the arc was a massive undertaking. The exposition was not only necessary, but enriched the outcomes.  The "slow" half was a necessity. My statement, was of course,  subjective.  Be that as it may, no other anime that I have seen has set such a precedent. Not even code geass, which was my favorite anime before I finished HxH.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still in what I suppose would be the first half of the arc (ep 101 currently), it is definitely not the best arc. It may redeem itself when the action really starts but based on what I've seen so far it does not live up the hype at all.
>> ARTICLE
oh no, don't get me wrong, it lives up to it's hype, specially after it picks up and ends masterfully, but it's that first dragged on half that kinda drags the whole thing down, people mostly praise it as pure gold for those glorious moments later on, but forget how long they'd been watching that same arc for.
>> ARTICLE
At episode 101 I'm very curious, what is your opinion on the king?  I mean aside from the fact that he's a genocidal maniac.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sort of disappointed that he's not giving off the vibe of being totally evil, I mean this is supposed to be the nemesis of the arc and he just doesn't seem all that important. For me this comes down to his character design and his activities thus far. His character design doesn't really fit him. His helmet thing just reminds me of a penis so I find it hard to take him seriously. Compare this with Chrollo Lucifer, that was excellent villain character design.

Mereum just seems self-occupied/narcissistic at best, he takes note that if he defeats the current reigning champion of the board game Gungi, then that'll mean he'll be the best in the world at it. I was hoping for an actual villain in this arc, not someone who derives self-esteem from beating others in board games. If you're familiar with DBZ, even Super Buu, a character who was maddened with a lust for chocolate, was actually intimidating despite the ridiculousness of the premise.

Overall I think he's mediocre as a character.
>> ARTICLE
Cool, it'll be interesting to see what you think of him as time progresses.  Part of the fun I find is seeing how expectations are challenged.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty suspicious that all is not as it seems judging from what you're saying, plus the foreboding line "how will this girl influence his fate?" at the end of ep 102. If things are about to get strange or unpredictable then I'm hyped. The way the arc was going so far was really boring me.

When I finish the arc I'll PM you with my thoughts since I figure you'll be interested to see how my thoughts on the king changes.
>> ARTICLE
I like to split up the Chimera Ant arc into two parts, the prep part and the action part, kinda like the splitting of the final Harry Potter movie.  While the prep half was good and also necessary, the half where they finally do stuff against the Chimera Ants is the one that takes the cake for me.
>> ARTICLE
I caught up with it as it was airing at the absolute worst time: just before [not really that spoilery](/s "they invaded the King's palace"). I binged up to that point and then had to wait for each episode at the most dramatic and most slow-paced part.

If you liked Hunter x Hunter, you should try JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.  It really is quite amazing, and the pacing is on par with HxH, and I feel that the storytelling is even better, and the action is at least as good as HxH's action.

Hunter x Hunter is one of those rare gems in anime in that it is one of the best *TV shows*, period.  It is by far the best television series ever to exceed 100 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I agree 100 percent. I've only ever heard complaints about the first two arcs, and even then, the complaints are minor. I've never been more impressed with an anime in my life. I'm not a Manga reader, but I want to read HxH just to relive it in a different medium. 
>> ARTICLE
I finished the series today, and while i agree its brilliant, chimaera arc went on forever, and after waiting for 60 episodes, i didn't get a proper fight from MCs where i could gauge how much stronger they got
>> ARTICLE
> i didn't get a proper fight from MCs where i could gauge how much stronger they got

I understand that complaint but given where we are in the manga, I've gotta say I don't think our happy go lucky protagonist will ever be able to achieve the power he did in the climax of that arc.  Not least of which because [spoiler](/s "Gon can't even use nen anymore, and is more or less a secondary character at this point.")

Given what he did in the ant arc, that... kinda makes a lot of sense.
>> ARTICLE
HxH was "done" when Madhouse started animating it, so they didn't have to wait the manga get ahead, which, most the times, is the reason they do fillers. Same reason something like Parasyte won't have fillers.

wait so HxH manga is done? i dropped it at the chimera arc because it started to look like scribbles someone had done on a napkin. But if the anime has an acctuall ending i might have to watch it.

Madhouse did an impressive job adapting Hunter x Hunter but the only reason why they only had to use recap episodes is because they started a lot latter than any of the other big three adaptations and had tons of chapters to adapt before they catch up to the manga.

[Ugh...](http://imgur.com/YVKghAl)this website has some problems. [The main page] (http://www.animefillerlist.com/) gives us this:

>Anime is usually based on Manga, a type of Japanese comic popular with people of all ages. "Filler" refers to story in an Anime that was not in the Manga. These are created because Anime production usually outpaces the Manga. Fillers do not further the story and usually are of a lower quality both visually and narratively.

This is the closest we get to any sort of methodology; which is especially problematic since all the data is compiled by volunteer contributors. Could some of the contributors be only counting arcs in the middle, and not anime original endings (I checked FMA, Blue Exorcist and Soul Eater, and it original endings counted for those shows, but I don't know if that's a rule, trend, or coincidence)?

Also, the percentages given are only a percentage of episodes that contain **only non-manga content** over episodes that contain**any manga content.** In plain english, an episode doesn't count towards the percentage even if it is listed as containing "mostly filler" on the series page. This can be seen [here](http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/magic-knight-rayearth).

Oh, and the page for [Tokyo Ghoul](http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/tokyo-ghoul) only has one episode. It's a fourteen episode show, they only made a datapoint for one of those episodes, but still made the unfinished page visible from the main index.

My site is for people to find out what anime episodes are not in the manga, thats it. There are many definitions of filler but that is the definition of filler the site goes by. The site is a wiki and is 100% community controlled. Feel free to contribute to the site, there is lots of space to elaborate on the individual episode pages.

p.s. Thanks for pointing out the "mostly filler" bug, i'll be fixing that soon.

Honestly, Anime News Network usually does a good job of listing what episodes are/are not fillers. Some of the wiki sites for animes sometimes do nice canon/filler lists too. This site here is just... not that great. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't it community filled? if something is incomplete it's probably coz it was auto-generated and no one ever bothered updating the list to completion(an almost impossible task for community-curated sites with the amount of anime that comes out nowadays)  
Maybe you should contribute instead of complaining...but that's just my opinion
>> ARTICLE
Gintama has only 9% fillers with 265 episodes, not bad. And thanks to its episodic nature you don't even notice it. Also it's mostly the end-of-the-season episodes (25, 50, 75, etc.) that break the fourth wall like crazy, so it's kinda obvious that they're not in the manga. And some of the regular filler episodes are really funny, like 114, "They Say Soy Sauce On Pudding Tastes Like Sea Urchin, But Soy Sauce On Pudding Only Tastes Like Pudding And Soy Sauce", with Hijikata turning into the Mayo Prince. 

By the way, just look at those great episode titles: 

* "Definitely Do Not Let Your Girlfriend See The Things You Use For Cross-Dressing"

* "Freedom Means To Live True To Yourself, Not Without Law!"

* "Japanese Restaurants Abroad Taste Pretty Much Like School Cafeteria Lunches"

* "The Other Side Of The Other Side Of The Other Side Would Be The Other Side"

* "Hometowns And Boobs Are Best Thought From Afar"

* "Stress Makes You Bald, But It's Stressful To Avoid Stress, So You End Up Stressed Out, So In The End There's Nothing You Can Do"

* "So in the Second Season of Prison Break, They've Already Broken out of Prison, but the Name Works Once You Realize That Society Is a Prison"

Question, I know there are like two Gintama series right? Which one is first? Or are they the same so you can skip one? I have a lot of time on my hands right now for tv shows and would like to find a good anime like this. 
>> ARTICLE
Lookup on the subs wiki:
http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/watch_order#wiki_gintama

The early 20+ episodes or so is introduction to the characters. While marathoning it can be fun, it is highly suggestible to watch it like how you would watch the Family Guy/Simpsons/SpongeBob daily episodes. Spread it over or add it as weekly watch in the season.

I finished the series long ago and after the recent Yorozuya forever movie, I realized how much I missed Gintama so bad.
>> ARTICLE
When would you say the anime gets really good? I hear a lot of praise for this series but I've watched a few episodes and haven't really seen much.

I know personally that Hunter X Hunter was pretty good until the Yorknew auction arc. Then it becomes amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Depends what are you looking for. Gintama have everything. From feels, comedy, romance, serious, battles, harem, fantasy, politics, historical... you name it. Some people finally get clicked on it after 100+ episode. Some were earlier at 20+. Some prefer the serious arcs because they are actually serious. Some prefer the feels because they are well made. Some people like me prefer the parody arcs (StarWars x Gundam thanks to Sunrise). Some prefer the mature arcs as its very mature if we consider the genre its in.

They parody lots of stuffs so the more invested you are in Anime/ Japanese culture, the more you gets from Gintama. Not really a requirement though.

Its a show that is very aware of what it's doing. The episodes/arcs are fairly episodic. Hence why I advised a more relaxed approach to watching Gintama. You can't really pigeonhole Gintama into something really. There's a reason it is known as *anime, the anime*.

Throwing Death Note in there is a bit silly, it's not even a long series. Drop Fairy Tail or Gintama or something in. It's like you're trying to make Death Note look better when it's a fraction of the length of everything else in that list, which is even sillier given how many people think the series dropped off with the Near and Mello arc. 
>> ARTICLE
Part of the reason it dropped off is the Near/Mello arc not having anywhere near enough episodes. It is also just weaker than the first half, but the incredibly rushed adaptation only made things worse.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps OP mentioned Death Note because it didn't adapt *enough* of the source material, then?
>> ARTICLE
Death Note's manga was infinitely better than the anime, the anime had really silly direction and terrible pacing. The second arc was good in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
The first arc was an even battle of wits between the two main characters. It wasn't clear who would win out until near its end. 

The second arc was doomed to be inferior to the first arc from the moment they decided to continue the story after L's death. Everyone knew that M+N were going to win this round. Reading the second arc was simply going through the process of their inevitable victory. With the result in mind, nothing in the story surprises you. And no surprises in a manga like Death Note make it a poor reading experience.

>> ARTICLE
The problem was Near and Mello were both inferior to L, and it was immediately obvious they would have to somehow work together to take down Light. It turned a thrilling story into an inevitable conclusion. That being said the end was still awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
>The second arc was good in the manga

I know it's an unpopular opinion... but in my opinion, the second arc, even in the manga, was bad.  For me Deathnote ended with the first arch. 
>> ARTICLE
I would say the first arc was adapted pretty well and had solid pacing. I agree the second arc was way better in the manga, but it was still a little weaker than the first. It was much less of a drop off though.
>> ARTICLE
The good thing about Bleach's fillers is that they are full story arcs you can just skip, because they are not acknowledged later (minus elements from Bount arc, but after that one they went with stories that had no effect at the manga storyline whatsoever).

Also Zanpaktuo Unknown Tales (not Beast Swords abomination) and the copycat arcs were better than most of the things which were happening in the manga after Soul Society arc.

Currently, one piece stands as the only series where I liked the filler.

Interesting, I thought Naruto has more filler than Bleach. I remember bleach has one whole big arc (Bount Arc (and it's quite good)) that turns out to be filler. Yet that still lose to Season 4 of Naruto (pre-shippuden) which filled with filler so much that I drop it and switch to manga.

But I heard some of the filler in the Shippuden were quite good. Expanding Tobi's character to make her believable clown of the enemy team or stuff.
>> ARTICLE
I feel Naruto's filler was a lot worst than bleach, and that Naruto Fillers dragged on a little too much.
>> ARTICLE
I think Naruto is benefiting from the series going on longer and having more episodes than Bleach.

Quick example... let's say we said two series had exactly 50% filler.

Series 1 is 100 episodes so it has 50 filler episodes.

Series 2 is 200 episode so it has 100 filler episodes.

Naruto probably just felt like more filler since you've been exposed to a bit more of it compared to Bleach.

Filler might not be the best way to describe it, probably anime original content, if you look at it it describes episodes as either cannon i.e. follow the source material or to some degree not, now there can be filler in the source material to pad out it's length but if it was adapted in the anime according to this list it wouldn't be counted as filler because it's part of the source material.

How can Death Note even be included here? It's only 35 episodes from memory. One Piece has the best in-line with manga efficiency, around 15% after 670 episodes I believe.

That is most definitely not a good thing, since they pad their episodes to death.

I couldn't care less if it's in the manga or not.  I define filler as 5 episodes of Naruto to do a fight that takes 5 seconds.  Most of the manga itself is filler.

I consider extending a fight to be padding. It's more entertaining to watch a fight that goes for half an episode rather than a five second bitch slapping before it's done.

Indeed. Padding is stretching out content, filler is content "filling in." Filler is extraneous material, not something having to do with existing material.

I was always in two minds about Bleach filler. Some of it was good(the extremely funny episodes with kon's life in the real world), most of it was unwatchable(the rainbow colored chakra dude vs kenpatchi for eg).    
Got to the point where i used to consult sites which told me which episodes weren't filler and only watch them(had to ignore the extra characters that suddenly popped up though)
>> ARTICLE
This is a weird site, it seems to imply that having fillers is necessarily a bad thing.  

>> ARTICLE
Example of good filler: Rin's episode in Fate/Zero.  It showed a protective and just side of Kariya, while displaying Rin's early bravery in her life. 

Example of bad/regular filler: Almost anything that stretches on for more than an episode.  Like seriously, filler is completely what the name implies: it's not necessary at all and does nothing but "fill" up the time allot for an episode.  Characters are not developed in a significant way at all.  For example, a filler arc with a certain character would start off and end off with that character being the exact same person.  The world is not developed in any way at all during a filler arc.  

If you would like to argue that some fillers (such as Naruto's filler arc of introducing *new* Mist Swordsmen) do show off the world more, then that isn't filler anymore.  It's direct alteration of the plot and strays further away from the canon story, creating a new one instead.  Take Tokyo Ghoul Root A, for instance; none of its newly added content can be considered canon to the original story at all.  It's a direct branch-off from the original story and thus, it's not filler.    
>> ARTICLE
I'd say filler is rarely good. Especially if it isn't canon so it can never be acknowledged again, which often happens. Was a post yesterday in bestof/pokemon about how Ash is still 10. What about that movie with the 1 year celebration? Oh that didn't actually happen. That kind of shit occurring is out right infuriating. 

And the current filler arc of Fairy Tail makes me want to slam my head into a wall. The character list is locked, the move sets locked, relationships locked, no deaths or scars can occur, nobody can really interact with each other outside of their status quo. Complete waste of time.
>> ARTICLE
>Was a post yesterday in bestof/pokemon about how Ash is still 10.

...Wait, what? They quite clearly stated in the very first Kanto arc that an entire year had passed as they were on their way to the Indigo Plateau. How are they now saying he's still 10?

I was under the impression he was in puberty in one of the arcs because the dub gave him a more cracky voice lol.

Having some filler isn't a bad thing, but by definition filler episodes do not advance the plot or significantly develop the characters. Because of this, it is almost always a bad thing for a show to have a lot of filler.

That's no surprise for Death Note, since Kira will write the names of those planning to make filler episodes.

That's a pretty stupid definition of filler, imo. Being different from the manga doesn't necessarily make it bad. Being inconsequential and of little interest, on the other hand, sucks. And being unique to the anime does not necessarily mean it's inconsequential or of little interest.
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul = 0%
um
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how this scale works, since most of DBZ is technically filler, as they were caught up with the Manga and thus is why the Frieza fight goes on for 25 episodes, where in the manga it is like 5 chapters.  They couldn't finish the fight until the manga finished the fight.
>> ARTICLE
You know what? I will actually stand up for fillers. I know a lot of purists hate it, I know people think it's just purely dismissable content and just holds up the canonical plot (or it seems to). 

But a show that's there on a weekly basis to come home to is very comforting. Plus, a lot of fillers can keep animators working without losing a step once they are tasked to work on canonical material.  And thirdly (and arguably most importantly), a lot of fillers can actually be pretty fun. Despite Bleach being that filler-filled, at least it had a lot of actual original story arcs that had a beginning, middle and an end. Some arcs even had some pretty good battles too. DBZ has some pretty infamous and hilarious fillers as well (such as the driver's license episode. Legendary for a filler episode).

Sailor Moon also wouldn't be what it is if it didn't have all those filler episodes that expanded on the lives of all the girls pretty masterfully and it was a great learning experience for the director, writer and animation staff of the show, and they have done great shows since then because they had a lot of show to get done thanks to the fillers.

I know 'filler' practically a slur to some anime fans. But I would like to just stand up for it. I think it has a place in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Deathnote does have filler. Misa is filler. Near is filler.

I feel like everyone has a different definition for the word filler.
>> ARTICLE
What I hate is that the filer percentage is what many people will base the 'quality' of a series on but in reality it can be what restores its quality. Dragon Ball and One Piece way have low filler content but in reality are frustrating to watch due to their stretched content. You can skip filler but you can't skip slow episodes or you may miss what little progression happens in the episode.

Death Note ending was different(worse)
>> ARTICLE
I actually liked it. Light had spent all this time building himself up to God status, and then was torn down to a pathetic worm in a matter of seconds. A false God was destroyed by men, and stripped of any dignity by his own actions. It reminded me of being caught in a big lie as a teen and all the pain that came with it. The frigid, sinking"oh shit" moment of being caught, and the struggle to evade blame or punishment, no matter the cost. 

I hadn't read the manga, so I had no knowledge or expectations of the ending which left me open to other endings.

Well, thousands, if not hundreds of people thought as Light as God Incarnate, he wasn't crazy by their standards. You see a man who has the power to kill with a pen at a huge distance, any person. This person claims to be the God that came to save the good people from the evil in the world. It's quite easy to believe it, given how many people believe in historical messiah figures and saints that doesn't show this kind of feat. Then when the image of his God is broken by what Light does, he just stops believing. How he acts is realistic in both endings, but I prefer the manga's one.

The rest of the adaptation was very close to the manga. I'm not sure why they chose to deviate at the last minute.

Filler does not mean what I thought it meant.
>> ARTICLE
I think the problem is more with pacing than whether or not it's a filler episode. Attack on titan does not have many filler episodes but the series does have bad pacing in the last half of the season
>> ARTICLE
So Death Note is 0% filler, because it's pure and dense awesomeness.
>> ARTICLE
Death Note better have 0%...
>> ARTICLE
I think that statistic is pretty stupid imo. The 'BIG 3' handle filler pretty different. Naruto has mostly filler arcs while Bleach and OP stretch the episodes REALLY hard. Im also pretty sure that One Piece has the biggest percentual filler screentime.  I personally prefer the way  the Naruto makers do it because you can always chose to skip the filler arcs. (I watch pretty much every filler in any Anime tho)
>> ARTICLE
most of the Bleach filler are pretty good, i'm really sad that they are not continuing like the manga :(, i hope they do a adaptation of the last arc
>> ARTICLE
Right now the manga is fricking slow. The anime would be only around 20 episodes if it continous to go at that rate.
>> ARTICLE
Yu Yu Hakusho has no filler.
>> ARTICLE
But you can skip the entire Yotsuba subplot in Death Note and it changes nothing of the rest of the story. It's silly.
>> ARTICLE
I think that should be filler then.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you could say the Bleach manga itself was a lot of filler after Aizen's defeat...
>> ARTICLE
I'm legitimately surprised "Naruto" isn't higher.

Although, "Bleach" had season after season after season that was nothing but bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
My girlfriend is currently watching no filler bleach, it's funny how she can go from episode 45 -112 in a day xD 
>> ARTICLE
That's the weirdest fucking definition of filler I've ever heard.
>> ARTICLE
Really? It's the most common meaning I've seen when talking about anime.
>> ARTICLE
The most common I've seen, and the only one that makes sense to me, at least, is:

>Filler episodes are entries in a generally continuous serial that are unrelated to the main plot, don't significantly alter the relations between the characters, and generally serve only to take up space. 

>Filler is usually something entirely original for the anime, but not always; many manga - particularly weekly manga - employ filler just as ruthlessly due to the extreme deadlines.

-From tvtropes

A lot of the percentages on that site are going to be skewed because they don't consider manga filler as filler.
>> ARTICLE
I'm impressed that only 16% of Inuyasha episodes are fillers. Thought it might be higher
>> ARTICLE
Yes but it also says the Death Note ran from 2006 to 1969?
>> ARTICLE
This kind of explains why Bleach went downhill during the Fullbring arc. Which is sad. I really miss my Bleach anime goodness.
>> ARTICLE
I call BS on DBZ's number.

If you're only counting "story that wasn't in the manga", then all you had was Gohan's Forest Adventures, Fake Namek, the (ugh) Garlic Jr Saga, Goku and Piccolo learning to drive and Gohan in High School. But every scene was dragged waaaaaaay the hell out.

Compared to DBZ Kai, 50% of DBZ is filler. Literally half that show is unnecessary.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't Garlic Jr a movie? rather than "filler".
>> ARTICLE
What is the point of fillers honestly? I can understand a few here and there to explore a characters backstory or have a casual, humorous episode where the characters are just goofing off or having fun.... but sometimes fillers will go on for months. 

Wouldn't it just be easier to wait for more of the manga or source material to be done and pick up the story then spend resources making filler episodes? It seems like some anime just HAVE to keep making new episodes, regardless of whether it follows the main story or not. 
>> ARTICLE
The way I understand it is this. 

If a show stops airing a few things happen, the show-runners stop making money off of it. The manga looses it's advertisement in the for of the anime. Shows often go down in popularity after hiatus, and networks aren't willing to take that risk. 

It's basically just for the sake of maintaining popularity and making a steady profit, this is a commercial medium. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably cause the studio or tv channel or whoever ordered the shows end up making money still. So might as well full it with crap and rake in the cash. 
>> ARTICLE
naruto had filler for 3 years untill they just ended it and made the  new show
>> ARTICLE
I literally quit Bleach(Even though at the time i absolutely loved it) because of a whole fucking arc/season that was JUST filler
>> ARTICLE
The Zanpakto arc was hell. A whole year's worth of filler. And I watched it all. Such a waste of time.
>> ARTICLE
Bleach was way more filler than 45 percent.  It literally felt like 80 % filler, and I watched every single episode.  I still miss it... It was how I burned 30 minutes every Tuesday for a few years...
>> ARTICLE
Both Bleach and Naruto went the same way for me. Since the manga was so far ahead it seemed pointless to watch the anime unless it was to see a cool moment get animated.
>> ARTICLE
>Death Note 0%

Ya-durr, the series is only what, 37 episodes? Where would there have been room to put filler?
>> ARTICLE
i honestly try to read the manga instead of watching the animes simply because most filler arc are complete garbage
>> ARTICLE
Filler is one of my problems with 300+ series. I want to get into them and get caught up, but I don't want Filler episodes filled with flashbacks or stupid ass side plots. I wish someone who's already caught up would post a "must see episodes" listed or something similar. 
>> ARTICLE
It was *so* difficult to remain a fan through the Bounto arc.
>> ARTICLE
Hunterxhunter (2011) 2 episodes 1% after 140 episodes. That's one of the lowest number of fillers in an anime with more than 100 episodes
>> ARTICLE
That's actually very interesting.
>> ARTICLE
why wouldn't death note be at zero? its only 37 eps.
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes filler is good though.

Look at the first season of Hayate no Gotoku. Half of it was "filler", but it was in the style of the first half, and it was amazingly outstanding.

Then season 2 comes along and it's awful, because it follows too close to the manga, and the manga changes genres to a bad romantic comedy.
>> ARTICLE
Not very surprised. Sometimes I'd finish an episode and just stare at the monitor in disbelief at the amount of time that was just raped out of my life.
>> ARTICLE
So if I watched Deathnote then buying the manga collection would be the pretty much the same exact thing as the show?
>> ARTICLE
Well death note is a shorter run show meant o tell a story with a definitive ending.

Shows like bleach and naruto were long running and aired while the manga was still being written, two of the main causes of filler.
>> ARTICLE
They're not kidding about Bleach. I skipped a full season once. I lost *nothing*.
>> ARTICLE
And every single moment of that filler in Classic Sailor Moon is gorgeous, character-building and emotionally relevant for the climaxes, which directly draw on the weight of the bonds established during their peaceful times, and which are all the more tangible to the viewer for having witnessed them.

My support: Sailor Moon Crystal.
>> ARTICLE
Was bleach the first anime to do whole seasons of filler?
>> ARTICLE
I like bleach but stop watching it because the episode is dragged so long with fillers. 

I don't know if fillers on bleach is like naruto. Naruto fillers is usually takes a full episode, making skipping episode possible.  Are Bleach fillers takes up the whole episode or is it partial? 
>> ARTICLE
Dragonball Z is kind of misleading. Very few episodes drifted off of the plot line into its own anime only story but there was for sure a lot of filler in the sense that entire episodes would be dedicated to nothing, training or other random stuff. They made it longer than it had to be for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte so far: 0%
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind that it's a percentage, the more total episodes the lower the percent and vice versa
>> ARTICLE
God, I finished Sailor Moon in 2013 and I remember vividly how much filler was in it. 


Hate on Crystal all you want, at least it's to the point. 
>> ARTICLE
So according to this, Death Note only has 13 episodes?
>> ARTICLE
The only thing I remember from Death Note (about fillers) was not filler but it had a mildly different ending. [Ending spoilers obviously](/s "It tried to humanize Light in that last attempt at running away when in the manga, he died showing his true nature in that very same warehouse and died never accepting his loss.").
>> ARTICLE
Death Note has 2 seasons, why should it contain filler episodes? 
>> ARTICLE
Detective Conan should've like 80% haha 
>> ARTICLE
Thats my only gripe with Bleach. Love the Manga but for the love of god the amount of filler in the anime is beyond acceptable. I skimmed over the episodes skipping the openings and in between banter. Finished the Aizen arcs in a weekend...One Piece is something that I'm stuck on. Its so good and yet way out of what I like to watch. Chopper and the doctor had top be the most emotional I have ever been and its very early on considering the episodes...
>> ARTICLE
What about Cory in the House and Toy Story?
>> ARTICLE
A few weeks late, but you seem to be saying that death note is all killer no filler.

That's a slightly flawed way of measuring things, the last 23 episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist are listed as filler.

>death note 0%

But that's not true at all. That makes me doubt if this list is true at all
>> ARTICLE
It actually is true. It follows the manga completely with no extra stories.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, this site claims that 61% of FMA 2003 is filler. Credibility is shot down the drain just like that.

Yes, it went a different direction than the manga did, but it clearly formed its own storyline and focused on it, so to discount the episodes where it actually pursues said original storyline (the entire second half included) as "filler" is hypocritical bullshit, especially when that material *does* further the storyline, thereby negating what they define filler to be in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. I'm on mobile and was curious what the site would say about that. They defined filler as anything not in the manga, hence FMA's score, but proceeded to score shows like Cowboy Beepbop as 0% filler despite never being a manga. Very weird scoring process. 
>> ARTICLE
It's like wikipedia and anybody can contribute. Cowboy Bepop is in there for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
That's why you never trust people.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, no. Anime which deviate from the manga (like FMA) shouldn't be on this list because it's not "filler". It's its own separate canon, but it's not filler.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah they should, because people might now want to watch them.
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't make it "filler". It makes it a deviated story. It happens all the time with adaptations, not just anime. They should *say* that it's deviated, though.
>> ARTICLE
So Nisekoi should be like what? 98%?

Filler =/= no plot progression. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ePir0iN.gif)'s an explanation of what filler is.

>> ARTICLE
Unless it's like Slayers, where there wasn't enough content to make a full season without using padding and the creators decided to make little side episodes instead.
>> ARTICLE
Pardon me. I based my overstatement from the manga. And I could count the number of instances the plot progressed with my own fingers. **I know what a filler is**
>> ARTICLE
Bleach - crap
Naruto - meh not as bad but still crap
Sailor Moon - meh... I'm a dude so I dunno but apparently it was one of the biggest movement in anime for the LBGT community. (although dubbed version censored most of that out).
Dragon Ball Z - manga is better; I hated watching Vegeta and Cell talk in the anime for 5 episodes before fighting (which the fight ended in like 2 seconds). Also hated how they screamed for 10 episodes to turn into Super Saiyan when in the manga it's pretty quick even at the first transformation.

Death Note - genius.

All in all, manga is always better but whatever. Everyone has preferences.
>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of glad that a lot of anime is getting greenlit with seasons in mind rather than continuous episodes that eventually lead into filler episodes/arcs. 

Even though Bleach started out decently, it ultimately became a filler fest until the very end. You can say the same about any shonen anime that have it's high points but then drag out so many episodes and filler arcs. The staff are restricted about what they can/cannot write which often results in predictable stories and poorly written filler characters. I think the worst kind of it all is anime that forces itself to end but ultimately makes up an ending so bad that it prevents me from recommending it to anyone (Soul Eater/Blue Exorcist I'm looking at you). 

I finished Bleach because all you really had to do was skip the filler arcs.
I dropped One Piece about 3 years ago.
I dropped Naruto about 4 years ago.
I recently dropped Fairy Tail although I suspect after the upcoming canon arc airs, the series will probably go off air again or be in more filler. 

Shonen Jump anime in particular is being done better now (Jojo is a great example) but it was seriously a long, long time coming. Knowing how a DBZ Kai had to exist because of all of the filler makes it known that even Japan knows filler is BS. 
>> ARTICLE
I wish they had this for Pokemon
>> ARTICLE
This defines filler as something not in the source material though. Since Pokemon is technically an original work(If we consider it a sort of spin off and not adaptation of the games), it has 0% filler in this context.  
>> ARTICLE
Most of it would just be Johto.
>> ARTICLE
The use of filler in this context is a bit loose, since things don't have to be adapted from existing material to have a ton of filler. And something something that might follow the source material exactly, and still have a ton of filler because they just mosey about for long periods of time. 
>> ARTICLE
Bleach's filler was at least bearable to me
>> ARTICLE
Now I know why I gave up on bleach after 200...
>> ARTICLE
Why is Death Note in there? One of those things is not like the other...

Hxh 2011 is probably at  0%. Best shounen imo.
>> ARTICLE
Death Note was a popular shounen series that ran in Shounen jump, just like Dragon Ball, Naruto, and Bleach. If anything is not like the other it's Sailor Moon. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe 2 percent if you include the recap episodes.
>> ARTICLE
should have just titled thread "reconfirming that bleach and naruto are trash"

edit: downvotes confirmed butthurts who know its true

Maybe it's just me, but after a certain point 100% of Bleach is filler.
>> ARTICLE
Just you. The show isn't bad, it just has some filler. Gonna have to stop the jerk here
>> ARTICLE
The show is not good either. The fillers were abominations to the story, the regular episodes are just...well, average. That is, after the hueco mundo saga, before it was good. The ichigo became all the races of his universe at the same time and all the captains became kinda useless.
>> ARTICLE
the quality of the fillers varies WILDLY though
>> ARTICLE
It's just you, because by definition.. you're incorrect. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually, I would argue that Bleach is much higher then 45%. I would argue that every in Karakura after the rescue art is filler. Where he uses the kids and Don Kanoiji. Those moments don't have anything to do with the story.
>> ARTICLE
No fucking way DBZ is only 15% filler
>> ARTICLE
bleah, disgusting fillers, they fit shitruto and bleahch perfectly
>> ARTICLE
No Evangelion?
>> ARTICLE
Eva is an anime original. All of it is filler, or nothing of it.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of hate the idea of this site. I hate that people can't just accept a show for what it is and they constantly have to hold the source material next to it and biasedly hate on parts just because they weren't in the manga. If you don't want filler than just read the manga but if you truly like a series you would want more and there are series where fillers make top moments for me.
>> ARTICLE
Rem is actually doing work, seems she has fallen for Light's trap as well though and trusts him now, she seemed more reluctant before. That's not
a good sign for Misa if/when Light becomes Kira again.

Misa getting that confession was pretty clever but so dangerous, especially with how little she knew of Rem. I really think this will backfire in some
way for Light/Misa though as her actions usually do.

L and Light's interactions are still great, I really want that anime focused around them without the death note!

Episode was good, seems it's picking up again after a few slow episodes, looking forward to the next one!

Man this made me feel sorry for Rem, to be forced to hang out with this disgusting bastard Higuchi. I really think she has the worst role to play in this whole plan...

>Everything I could ever want: money, power, and a beautiful wife.

Well someone is overestimating himself

German dub:
>Take this serious or else I'll kick you in the arse.

Damn L that's not how you talk with friends, only best friends are aloud to say something like that.

Man Matsui was a better Manager actor than Mogi. Poor Matsuda isn't able to do that what he did best in this case.

>Hes punishing people who never intended to kill; those who sincerely regretted their crimes or people with excusable circumstances.
The original Kira would have never punished those kinds of people.

Wow I totally forgot that, makes me respect Light-Kira more. Well bad that we only got to see the kills that in my opinion didn't deserve it. Like Raye and Naomi.

I already said it in the earlier episodes but I really like Rem.

>Would you believe three out of the seven guys already message me asking for a private date

[Chief's Yagamis face when](http://i.imgur.com/IuKC6zg.png)

And L noticed that Misa changed, when she followed Light's advise.

Urgh Higuchi is just such a slimy guy it's really disgusting.

Damn Misa has her bright moments sometimes, I just wish they weren't so far between.

New Rules:

35. Exchanging and writing on the Death Note between the gods of death is no problem.

36. If the god of death decides to use the Death Note to kill the assassin of an individual he favors, the idividual's life will be extended but the god of death will die.

We get another Misa-centric episode with her doing awesome detective work on her own this time,so that just leaves Matsuda as the only useless character. Even Mogi managed to see through that disguise almost immediately.

/u/treons almost got it right,So it was Kyosuke after all, the Kyosukes I know from anime are terrible people (Madoka's in particular). One thing death note does well is that it never shys away from giving the audience answers quickly but still leaving enough questions for episodes to remain suspenseful.
>> ARTICLE
Matsuda still helped somewhat I think, even though he had to be bailed out. He confirmed it was them and got Misa in contact with them. Not exactly helpful, but somewhat.

Also, I only put him in the 3 because I thought he looked slimy and we barely had anything to go off. He was the least likely of the 3 I put back then.
>> ARTICLE

Well, fuck me I was wrong. Long haired guy that Light called is Kira. Wait, no. Its crazy spikey haired guy.

[Misa pout - multiple Misa faces.](http://imgur.com/a/m3UQm)

REM!!!! Ok, so touching the scrap of paper cant restore her memories, but its implied that she can regain them!!! Yes!

Also confirmed a theory I had way back about the Shinigami being able to touch the Death Note owner.

Lights almost suspecting himself now. So he still has some of those original ideals. The Death Note simply gave him the means to act them out.

I guess Rem doesnt know that Misa is working with Light and L. Why risk telling Misa all of this? The more she knows, the better chance she has of spilling it.

Rems basically in full support of Light now. She calls the Kira vile, and tells Misa to listen to everything Light says.

Im really worried as to whats gonna happen now. Misa knows too much. How the heck will she explain that Higuchi is Kira? Shell have to tell Light. Shell probably tell Light about everything Rem just said which will throw him off balance since hes now suspecting himself to a small degree. Then hell have to make some shit up in order to catch Kira using conventional methods.

[Dont get a boner. Don't get a boner. Don't get a boner. Don't get a boner.](http://i.imgur.com/553CV7W.png)

Oh, crap. Misas taking things into her own hands.

Joking about sleeping together in front of his dad. Damn, Misa. And youre a perv too. L is attached to Light by the chain. Hed be there. Watching.

[Mogis face!](http://i.imgur.com/IFH9KId.png) Mogis a good cop. Notices immediately that its not Misa.

Lol, Rem hunched in the back seat.

Im surprised with how much information Rem gave Higuchi about the Death Note. I cant remember, but maybe its just part of the deal that the Shinigami has to tell the owner everything.

Why would they have even bothered answering the phone when their President just collapsed? But ok, using Rem to kill the guy is a good move.

Did Misa just swipe something of his?

Oh snap! She recorded it. [L is surprised as fuck.](http://i.imgur.com/102anTE.png) Did Misa just solve the case?

Well you appreciate something so much more when you find out that it could be much worse, don't blame her must be shitty to hang out with Higuchi the whole time.

>Dont get a boner. Don't get a boner. Don't get a boner. Don't get a boner.

That reminds me of a fan parody cartoon where L accused Light of being gay because he didn't get a boner when Misa was sitting on his lap and while Light is trying to defend himself he somehow reveals that he's Kira, and that was L's plan all along... Can't find it anymore though because it looks like the channel has taken down this episode...

* Misa, how are you so dumb yet so smart. I don't know how to feel about her anymore. This was easier when I was a kid who didn't understand nuance.

Man I wish I could do that with some shows, watch them like the first time even when rewatching them.

So here it's revealed that Higuchi (I believe his name was) is the current Kira.

I was wondering for a second why Mogi was with Misa now but that's right Matsuda supposed to be dead.

Poor Mogi. He's not used to being so animated.

You've done a naughty thing Rem. You're not supposed to do that.

You can't trick Mogi's eyes. He knows you're not Misa, Nori.

But how does Higuchi now hear Rem scribbling in her Death Note? Pencil to paper isn't exactly silent you know.

This was actually a pretty awesome plan Misa and Rem concocted. I kinda don't like how Rem contacted Misa though. I wish she had waited until Light had gotten his memories back.

Seriously this is death Note in a nutshell, of course before the horrendous second part. The first part of Death Note shall always be the best. I wish it actually ended at the first part after [L dies](/spoiler), it would have made the series much better if it ended there.

It's been a while since I watched/read it, but I recall the second arch being much better in the manga. The anime seemed to rush through the remainder of the manga (5 books in 11 episodes, I think.)
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed the second season.  People act like it was terrible, but I think it's the best they could've done without L.
>> ARTICLE
For me thats where the series ended. I actually stopped watching it after that because it was a perfect ending. i did get around to watching it eventually but i just treated it like filler.

I stopped watching after L died. Made me so sad.

Don't forget: "You are probably kira, but since I'm not sure I will let you keep working with me, lulz"

The second half ruins me from suggesting this anime to people. (That are New to anime)
>> ARTICLE
I still think it's a great intro for people to anime, it's got a really interesting set up in the first ep for getting you hooked and it's largely free of the usual creepy tropes that scare most people off anime. I mean the second half is weaker but I would hardly call it unwatchable. I personally would still recommend something shorter that's also amazing like Cowboy Bebop. With the episodic format being even better for someone new.  
>> ARTICLE
It was the first anime I ever watched (well, apart from bits of dbz and such on cartoon network), and I thought it was a great intro. It just wasn't like anything I'd seen before.

Though ymmv depending on age - I was 12/13 at the time.
>> ARTICLE
Right after drawing Deathnote, the mangaka actually made a manga about young Mangakas, of which they talked about ending a manga before the manga gets too stale. 

I think it was a passive form of a protest against his editors.

Bakuman, have a read. Also, try Hikaru no Goy 
>> ARTICLE
Judging by [the final arc](/spoiler) of Bakuman [where they decided to end "Reversi" instead of having it drag on for a second run with a new enemy](/spoiler) the creators probably thought that too.
>> ARTICLE
Is Bakuman worth finishing? I read and liked the manga a while ago, but kind of forgot about it.
>> ARTICLE
It is. It is pretty light hearted and fun. That said, somewhere towards the middle of the final season I felt that the show needed to end. It was basically the same issues from the past two seasons with different mangas they were working on. The romance was a little too mellow for me as well. All in all it was a good show to watch, I just wish I didn't binge watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
I think its good and it ends on a satisfactory note with little to no loose ends. Not particularly memorable but its innovative in the sense that it shows you can make a good shounen-esque manga series without resorting to unrealistic op battles, and in a sense i thought it indicated the true potential of the SoL genre. So basically, yeah, its worth finishing.
>> ARTICLE
> before the horrendous second part


So am I the only one who actually liked the Near-arc? The way this sub talks about sure makes me feel like I am. I mean, it's definitely not *quite* as good as the first half, but it's still pretty damn good. The way people talk about it, it's almost like they're comparing the first Jaws movie to Jaws: The Revenge. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a reddit thing. Clearly we the fans are smarter and more capable than the creators.
>> ARTICLE
Are you implying that the fans are *wrong* about the quality of something?
>> ARTICLE
Did I? I don't remember saying anything like that.
>> ARTICLE
It seemed like they didn't even get the characters anymore. L loses? Seriously? And Light somehow keeps up his charade relationship with Misa for fucking years despite the fact we all know he's as gay as the day is long? Oh and Lights Dad is just abruptly dead and written out of the show despite being a major character?
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think Light is gay. He came across to me as pretty much asexual. The only real homoeroticism originated from L (chaining them together, washing feet scene).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, you're probably right, actually.
>> ARTICLE
And that was only really added in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is, Light is by far the least interesting character in Death Note.
>> ARTICLE
To me L is the most boring. I don't know why everyone likes L so much. He is a deux ex machina. It doesn't matter what happens, he always thinks it's Light.
>> ARTICLE
Who else could it be? He narrows it down pretty effectively in the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
I don`t know, any of the millions of people without an alibi from L himself?
>> ARTICLE
Been awhile since I read, but doesn't L narrow down where Kira is pretty quickly with that decoy broadcast, and then later on get all sorts of clues about how Kira has to be relatively close to the police department?
>> ARTICLE
He does but how many people live in Light's district and have relations to the police department? Maybe not millions, but thousands isn't a huge leap of faith. His entire investigation also seems to always proceed with Light being Kira. It seems more like he's trying to prove his hunch rather then follow any sort of investigative approach.

Besides, he has a mountain of evidence to the contrary of Light being Kira. We know that this evidence is mostly fabricated by Light, but L shouldn`t.

For example, when they set up the surveillance. Light acts like a completely normal kid, but L sees that as more proof he's Kira. Confirmation bias much?

It kind of bugs me that it seems like no matter what Light did, he would always be the suspect. Like L could have seen his own butler being Kira and he would have pondered for a moment on how Light is actually the guilty one.
>> ARTICLE
First of all: Light first gets into the spotlight when Ray Penber's fianc commits suicide.

L knew her and was aware that she isn't a person to commit suicide. 

Penber had two subjects to observe. Since this was their only lead they had to act on it till something better came along 

Also: L even admits that he is an asshole and that he is unhappy about Light seemingly not being Kira. He has his flaws as well, which makes the whole duel between them so good to watch.

Edit: about the cameras: it's the first day and everything is like a 110% normal. He has to assume that Kira is quite intelligent and realise that he'd most likely not fall for such an obvious trap. And since he doesn't have anything else to build on he gets kinda forced into those conclusions. Because of his intuition as well as because of his pride and him being unable to accept that he might have been wrong.

>> ARTICLE
Well over half the people who commit suicide are people who others don't think will commit suicide. That shouldn't really be proof for the world's most intelligent detective, who should know this.

Everything in your last paragraph is still confirmation bias. He assumes Light is some paranoid person who would know cameras are there, so that's what he sees.

99/100 children in Light's situation would have had no idea their room had been broken into.

Your also ignoring that there is a lot more evidence that Light isn't Kira then there is evidence he is.  
>> ARTICLE
Then he traps Light in that double-negative situation at school with "I am L"

lol he gets so riled up right there.
>> ARTICLE

I get that, but how would you have it? People will always have different taste. Some people will hate things you didn't even pick up on, or flaws you didn't care about. To some people those things are ruining the show, while you still loved it and ignored or didn't care about the flaws. 

If we can't have different tastes we can't have this sub. This sub would also be quite boring if we couldn't discuss various aspects of different series, the pros and cons, etc. 

I get what you mean though. I hate to have things that I loved demolished by people who didn't like it. It's hard not to be affected.

>> ARTICLE
Ehh... bad comparison. The first arc of SAO was undoubtedly better than the second, but lets not pretend it was some kind of masterpiece. The Aincrad arc had serious pacing issues, shitty romance, lacking characters, and the ending was dumb as hell.

I did enjoy it, but I don't overlook its shortcomings.
>> ARTICLE
Look, SAO as a whole isn't that good. I know that. And yes the second arc wasn't as good. But people act like the first part was AMAZING and the second was UTTER SHIT. That's all I was comparing it to. 
>> ARTICLE
It works a lot better in the novels. The main arc is done in one novel and like 50% of season 1 are in two novels, in form of shorts/anectodes. They expand on the world and characters setting up the later arcs. 
>> ARTICLE
First part was good, not amazing but entertaining and enjoyable. Second part was, actually, utter shit.

 - Asuna, a strong and likeable character, destroyed and mushed into a cliche damsel-in-distress role. She was quite the badass in the first half, then trapped in a fucking bird cage for the second.

 -  Crappy, cliche villain with a crappy, cliche plot.

 - Random incesty-romance shoehorned in that completely shit on this amazing relationship they had built with Kirito and Asuna. It's like to completely forgot that Asuna and Kirito were together and she felt like an afterthought (Oh yeah, I gotta save this girl). Fuck, the last episode pissed me off the most. Instead of focusing on a Asuna and Kirito reuinion, they focus on his stupid whiney sister/cousin/whatever coming to terms with the fact that he doesn't return her feelings and their reconciliation.

He just went full retard.  He became less of a good guy doing things differently into a villain.  I don't like that transition at all and it made for a bland  ending.

Light isn't "the good guy" though.  The point of the story is for the viewer to decide between L & Light as who's doing the right thing.

For me, Light.  And he died like a bitch.

That was the only good part about the second half.

For me, L. And likewise.

>> ARTICLE
Seriously! I feel bad for the show! A few years ago it seemed like most people had that opinion where it wasn't as good but still was not bad at all. Now it seems like every one despises the second season! 
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed the Near-arc when I first saw it too. It's not as horrible as people describe it as. But it is a huge drop off in quality compared to the the first part of the show. If it was not part of the show, Death Note would objectively be a better show. A lot of people recognize this and then blame the 2nd arc for holding the show back.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I thought the Near arc was.... ok. Not great. But ok. The main thing is that Near especially out of the two new characters that were introduced just didn't have nearly the same impact as the rest of the cast.

My main problem was with Near though. While a lot of the show is kinda like the comic, it feels genuinely well thought out. Like that is how those characters actually think, always taking into account their rival's next step and possible action. While with Near, it felt a lot more like he just had the script with him, wearing plot armor more than being actually smart. This to me made him end up being a way less captivating L and really dragged down the second arc for me. Mellow was much more interesting but I had so much looser of an understanding of his character and motivations that I personally couldn't connect with him at all. He was more of a plot point that just kinda did things instead of being a character to me, even if he did have that, "betcha didn't think of *THIS*!!!!" aspect to him that Near was missing.

However, watching Light's god complex slowly corrupt him more and more as he takes bigger risks and he starts to lose control leading up to his timeless conclusion, along with how the characters he surrounded himself with worked with him while it was all happening was very interesting and fun to watch so I still say it isn't that bad.

But it just could have been so.... so much better. It set a standard for itself that the second arc just couldn't match and while I think people hyperbolize how bad it is, I have to admit that I myself was at least somewhat disappointed.

The final was annoying. They just started making shit up at the end. Not artistic making shit up either.

HUGCRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHEGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Some people just like to hate on things.

Aside from the prevalence of Xanatos Gambit Roulette, the first half is a masterpiece and its ending is a big part of that. 

But after that ending, there were only two ways to go forward:

1) Completely crap on the first half by trying to outdo it [](/s "as in, introduce a new Super-Detective 'S' who is totally better than lame L and will succeed where he failed. Which would've only been stupid and have made the whole show look bad.")

2) Try and do something different and just accept that the first half will always be the height of the show.

I think they made the right choice. [](/s "The battle between L and Light was the height of the story, and they didn't try and undo that awesome by bringing in a new 'rival' for Light. The idea of having Near and Mello, being individually less than L, but together just good enough to defeat him, worked out well enough to bring the story to its natural conclusion.") If the second half had been its own show people would've been perfectly happy with it as an average quality anime, but it being the conclusion to such a great first half provokes all the haters to dish it way more than is justified.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, you nailed it.
That was exactly the problem.
>> ARTICLE
I think Death Note partially suffers from hype backlash. It was so big and expectations were set so high that people were going to be disappointed, especially due to the second half.

Personally, I believe that Death Note's first half was indeed good. The author of the manga should not have been forced to extend the series. It didn't work. I like to believe that there's good reason why the live action films only go through the first half.

But taken as a whole, the series just comes out as almost adequate. They couldn't outdo how good the first half of the series, and my overall opinion of the series suffers because it seemed like they were just milking it. I could compartmentalize it and say, "Yeah, Death Note is great if you ignore the rest," but couldn't we do that about so many other things? "Yeah, X series is great if you look only at episodes 15-25. Ignore the rest."
>> ARTICLE
I agree on hype backlash, but I disagree on the second half. It wasn't bad, it was just average, and there were threads in the first half that needed to be resolved. A second half was needed. Death Note's story is the story of Light, and if it ended after the first half it would've been a simple and shallow story, seeing Light's tale through is what gives the whole actual depth and realism.

People, and no offence but that seems to include you, imo grossly over-exaggerate how bad the second half was. All it was is not as great as the first half. And so what? A lot of people think The Empire Strikes Back is better than Return of the Jedi, that doesn't mean they should never have made RotJ.

Equally there's nothing wrong with Death Note having a weaker second half. The second half does not ruin the series, nor stops it from being a great series, it just stops it from being a perfect series, but there are very few of those any ways (if any). Some people just like to hate, and these kinds of things are easy targets. As I said if the second half was its own unrelated show people would just accept it as average, or even recognise that it's a lot better than the schlock of truly bad series. It's just the proximity and contrast to the first half of Death Note that invites people to treat it a lot worse than it deserves.
>> ARTICLE
My opinion of the second half may seem like an over exaggerated to you, but for me it was far less enjoyable. My opinion of Death Note as a whole, because it is a whole (not even Death Note Part 1 and Part 2), is brought down because of it. You can call me a "hater" if you like, but I think that's not a great way of expressing, "You think negatively of something I like." People can and should be allowed to have different opinions.

Also, I don't believe the second half was necessarily even needed. I imagine that when the author was informed that the publisher, and the company that would be animating the television series, would like material beyond what was planned, the author could have either delayed some conclusions or planted additional seeds to be resolved later.

But I see that we're not going to see eye to eye on this. I appreciate your opinion and respect it. You're truly passionate about it (especially since you see it as a "target"). I also want to clarify my comments about how the second half should not have been made. I merely meant that I don't appreciate when authors are forced to add more content onto a work that clearly works as it is. Similarly, despite the fun derived out of it, DBZ's Majin Buu arc wasn't necessary and deflated the emotional ending that would have come from the end of the Cell Saga.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I wrote things a bit poorly, but I didn't mean to include you into the 'haters'. That was just aimed at the people who talk big while having nothing to back it up. You have your opinion and there's nothing wrong with that. If you didn't enjoy the second half it doesn't even matter why, no one can tell other people what to do or not enjoy.

But I am a bit passionate about it indeed, because I think it's unfair to Death Note's second half, and the show as a whole, when people treat the second half as if it's trash. When if you look at it objectively then imo it just isn't *that* different. (There are plenty of shows that have actual trash second seasons.) But I've explained that already, so no need to rehash our points, I'm fine agreeing to disagree.
>> ARTICLE
Just wanted to chime in and say I loved the second half. The series was completed for me because of how it ended. Maybe it wasn't as strong as the first half as you stated but it was still very enjoyable. DeathNote was my first anime and I've watched all the way through over 8 times. Even during my last watch I still enjoyed the 2nd half. Everyone is different however and many people seem to believe the 2nd half ruined the anime but I never thought that once in all the times I've watched it.

I thought the Near-arc was fine, and helped further show Light's descent into insanity. That last episode of the show is one of my favorites in the series.

It's has been a while so I might be misremembering here but here's how I see it:

 [L won when Light killed him. I don't remember the details, but Light had lost sight of his real goal and overreached to snuff out L. L was aware that he might die, but that was simply one of his traps to get Light to reveal himself. Light was pretty far gone in his 'greater good' 'I am God' megalomania and had started to see L as the only thing standing in the way of him becoming God. So, thinking he was beyond everyone else and that killing L would leave him without peer, he revealed himself for the chance to kill L. The Near arc is essential to show the audience Lights eventual downfall, both physically and spiritually. Near isn't nearly as brilliant as L, but he doesn't have to be because L already caught Light by using the ultimate bait. The Near arc is simply there to show you that L really won.](/spoiler)

Pulls off a self-sacrifice arc and worked really well.")

Anime = Japanese cartoons

No. Anime is a very specific type of animation in the same way that manga aren't simply "comic books."
>> ARTICLE
But they are comic books? It's like getting mad because someone said bird instead of owl. Yeah, they could have been more specific, but they're not wrong.

No, it's like calling a motorcycle a car and bitching because while they're different, and they're wrong, they're both means of conveyance.

Cartoon is just another word for animation, though...And anime branches off from animation, so... Cartoon=animation^anime, therefore cartoon^anime
>> ARTICLE
That's a false equivalency. It's more like calling a motorcycle a vehicle.  
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it's more like calling [this](http://www.rc-trucks.org/motorcycle-trike.jpg) a tricycle. Correct, but the word carries certain connotations that aren't exactly accurate to what someone's referring to. In the US, animation in general is seen as entertainment for children and some shows that aren't for children only use that medium for comedic effect since it jives with the audience's expectations by featuring explicit material.

Exactly what they did in the show. They [spoilers](/s "killed other important business people from other companies so that their own company can get richer").

Simply make them clean their bank accounts, go to park...drop 3/4 behind for you to pick up. Go to tall building and drop last 1/4th and then they expire. Also I just randomly thought this up in like 2 min

Edit: the reason they drop the last 1/4 is so the cops think they just dumped their entire fortune away and people randomly picked it up
>> ARTICLE
How would cops know where he dropped his money if there's no money left as evidence? Just order him to drop all of it in one spot... you take it.

Then order him to go die off somewhere hidden where he won't be found for years/decades.

In that case, people seeing he emptied bank accounts and him missing would assume he skipped town or something.
>> ARTICLE
Yet if you do it to a rich guy people would question where all his money went at the time he is found. People talk about that stuff I guess. By dropping some if it people would assume he just dropped everything and few would question the amount
>> ARTICLE
If they really have loads of money you won't be able to pick it up all at once, large amounts of money (millions+) are fucking HEAVY. I don't remember the exact weight of amounts of paper money but it weighs more than one person could handle.

2 briefcases with 2-3 million dollars should do you just fine for a couple of years (at least)

It's not like you have to take billions at a time, because you couldn't even spend it, or else the state would realize you've had an unexplainable huge influx of money and start investigating you.

But fine, if you're that desperate for money immediately, then I guess you could ask your dad about those cash transport armored cars, then write the names of the drivers in the DN and have them deliver the money.
>> ARTICLE
I may have overestimated the weight of paper money. Well, different currencies bills have different weights, naturally. A million in 100 dollar bills is ~10 kilos, since officially a 100 dollar bill is approx 1 gram in weight. You'd need a bag for this, not a briefcase.

Fun fact: in pennies it's ~25 tonnes.

> You cannot make them transfer you any money or something like that because their death would be investigated.Unless there's some indication of foul play, the police aren't going to be involved.  Since you can control the exact manner of death, you simply assign causes that won't raise suspicion.  As long as you're smart about it, and vary the causes of death within a set common among the age of person you're targeting, police won't have anything to investigate.To answer your question, though, gambling is the answer.  Pick an extreme underdog in a boxing / MMA bout, bet on him, then use the Death Note to have that person kill his opponent in the ring.

probably, through a series of marriages and insurance fraud.

if attractive female,

* marry average wealthy guy, guy dies in heart attack and you claim his belongings. "death: car accident"
* use belongings to meet up with a richer man, and enter higher social standing to meet older rich guy, kill him off with a heart attack.
* use estate to then either grow wealth and leave a set of managers to control wealth, or get into a market and have competitor group leaders die suddenly through a series of accidents (e.g. plane crash, ODed on drugs, suicide over sex scandal, Stabbed in Prison time dated 1 year later, strangulation in incestuous sexual asphyxiation) over time to devalue-stock with changing management so that your company can move in on acquiring stock, talent, etc.
* live the life, of an investment banker. give your shinigami enough coke filled apples

if male,

* build your self up until point 3
* point 3

if prosecutor:

* give yourself high profile cases
* build reputation on these cases
* become DA representing the state/crown in high profile cases
* kill a judge
* take judge position
* kill all the members of the supreme court within 1 year
* lobby for supreme court
* pass citizens united when bribed

Politician:

* Kill a lot of politicians/prominent figures in a period of 3 years, due to varying circumstances often due to suicide, killed by shanking, assassination, cardiac arrest, asphyxiation by chicken wing. much of the killing should be on the basis of crime
* run for politican solving crime issue hard stance
* slowly get rid of criminal world same way as politicians
* build repertoire until high enough in government
* don't ever become prime minister, accept the occasional bribe. live on tax payer money.

other:

* bang the war drum and get on the military industrial complex racket
* attack US president, cause of death, blood loss caused by stabbing by Vladimir Putin

Kira kept on killing people using the usual heart attack route. IIRC you can dictate time and type of death. if he wasn't such a narcissist with a God Complex he could have changed his style of kills and framed other people. Kira should have played the long game, Game of Thrones style.

A person that uses the death note cannot go to heaven or hell. As the death note is pretty much evidence of the supernatural, I wouldn't want to touch it with a 10 meter stick.

How so? Starting from that premise, that heaven and hell exists and so does limbo, unless you are absolutely certain that you will go to heaven, limbo is better than hell, which is by definition the WORST place imaginable.

Unless you're one of those who think residing in hell as punishment is only a temporary thing, then you will go to heaven after serving the sentence.

was it implied you went to limbo in the series? Its been a while since I saw Death Note.

Also depending on which religion one is to believe, limbo is a pretty horrible place too.

> you will go neither to heaven or hell

Isn't THAT limbo? 

Anyway, whatever it's called, one would think it's better to end up between heaven and hell, than to end up in hell itself.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, and if you're using the death note to get rich, I think this is pretty obviously a win-win for you.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed. Which kind of puts to question why they made "not going to either heaven or hell" a bad thing...

Unless they were thinking of that one particular ideology that presumes that suffering in hell is just a way to atone for your sins, and after suffering "X amount of units of time", you will raise to heaven.

In which case not going to hell it's a bad thing (not a win)

Like a comment below said, and I did a bit of math, if you were to write as fast as 1 name per second , at 18 hours a day, you'd kill ~26000 people/day.

Now, at a population of 7 billion people , you'd need 300000 days, which is more than 750 years.

And that doesn't take into consideration that you'd spend time killing old people (that would die anyway), but you'd have a hard time keeping track of newborns, since the DN has limitation on killing infants.

You can't do that. Death Note rules prohibit that.

If you were to make someone kill someone else, your target would simply die of heart attack.

The only way that worked for Light in the series/movie was that he wrote BOTH of the victim's name in the Death Note, with one marked as being 'murdered' and it just happened that one killed the other.

Is there a better game to act as a symbol for the fight Between Light and L? Tiddlywinks?

Chief Yagami is getting pressure from all sides and is looking worse. His falling ill is kind of good for Light in a twisted way. Not only dose he get confirmation that it is L, he gets to show L how much he cares and lowers the suspicion upon himself.

I like how they show L's idiosyncrasys off in small ways, we don't see him playing with the things often just the aftermath. It adds a lot to L as a person. The whole thing is kind of a switcharoo, in most shows the weird one would be a bad guy.

I'm finding the cheerful Light to be very creepy, its the calm way that he speaks is very unnerving. Is that how he has all ways been, or is that just his face to the world.

Love how Ryuk dodges even if the ball wouldn't hurt or even hit him, shows how fast it was.

>He's risking his live at this very moment to solve this case...

By playing some serious tennis!

How are they still able to play while not thinking about this game at all, whenever I played some sort of sport I really needed to have my head in the game and not think about something else.

Well this whole episode is just an up and down, suddenly he has 1% rising to overwhelming 7% only to go back to being maybe not Kira. 

Also how Mr Yagami said that not the person but the power is evil. And I agree partially, I fully believe that Light is a good person at heart, but the power of the Death Note, combined with the boredom earlier and the hate towards the criminals he saw on the news, drove him into this. He even said at the beginning, "You can't play with live like that, nobody should've this kind of power" only to be taken over by Kira and trying to justify his first two killings. But now that he turned into Kira he is really an evil person.

I finally got dark matter so I can go back to having a life (or just watching even more anime) 

- I'm gonna be really sad when this OP is gone even though I like the other one this one is so nostalgic for me. SACK A EVIIIIIL.

- Most tense episode of the series right here, this is where Death Note stops being a thriller and becomes a sports anime. Can't wait for regionals!

- "Since I wanted to play Tennis you'll think I'm trying to trick you, but I'm tricking you about how I'm tricking you while I'm tricking you Light Yagami." "I'll take this tennis racket... AND SWING IT (insert maniacal laughter here)."

- "I'm one percent certain that you're Kira so I'm going to devote my entire day to hanging out with you because the numbers are on my side."

- Even though some of it is just complex for the sake of being complex I'm always so intrigued when Light and L get talking about these kinds of things.

- Fuuuuuck Chief Yagami had a heart attack... WHY COULDN'T IT BE MATSUDA INSTEAD?!

- Even though Light's a smug little prick sometimes I feel kinda bad that his own father has been investigating him this whole time.

- "No true happiness can be gained by killing people." Sorry Mr. Yagami, but I'm pretty sure that Light is calling bullshit on that one.

- Haha I love how Light tries to sound all epic about his happiness with the power, and Ryuk is just like I could give a shit less if you're happy kid.

- God dammit I forgot about this sunglass wearing fat fuck... I haven't wanted a side character to die this much for a while he's just so annoying.

There wasn't that much to talk about today we had the tennis mind games, the heart attack Light's dad has and Light is going to work with the task force. See you all tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
>WHY COULDN'T IT BE MATSUDA INSTEAD?!
I mean, if you want an honest answer, it's because Chief Yagami is too uptight. If he would just loosen up and have a little fun here and there like Matsuda instead of telling him to smarten up he wouldn't have had a heart attack.

> WHY COULDN'T IT BE MATSUDA INSTEAD?!

I just feel bad for Mr. Yagami here, if he'd find out he probably would die from a heart attack, but not because of the Death Note.

Ls gonna kick ass at tennis, isnt he?

Lol, Ryuk dodges the ball like a scaredy cat. It wouldve just went through him anyway.

He who strikes first, wins.

Im laughing and loving it. These two are playing a friendly game of tennis, and theyre going all out with their mind games. This is great.

[Her face!](http://i.imgur.com/byHDWvR.png) Shes totally right! Shes like, What the *hell*? You seriously like this guy?

Seriously. This is a tennis match. This is wild. Im a little confused though because I didnt realize L was this certain that Light could be Kira. Hes really going out of his way to test this.

L is just I dont know. He just comes straight out and tells Light he suspects him of being Kira. The dub is great with this line too. Then he just hurriedly rushes out the rest of his sentence, If you still have something to ask me, then go ahead.

If L doesnt sit like that, his deductive skills are reduced by 40%!!! What?!?! Why?

I dont even have much to say during this exchange at the coffee shop or wherever they are. This is just fascinating to watch. Lights up to 7% now.

NO!! His dad. Did Light actually no. Guess not. He was surprised enough, and his dads alive.

Mr. Yagami. Kira isnt *pure* evil. I can agree that hes cursed though.

It was one of the worst feelings ever. Wait. What is L referencing here? Something in his past that draws a parallel to Lights current situation maybe?

Light doesnt feel cursed, naturally. Why would he. It doesnt mean that he actually isnt though. Its a good curse, I guess.

>> ARTICLE
I find anime brings out a lot of story's that you wouldn't see in America or in live action. There are definitely some childish ones but some like "Monster" are very mature and adult oriented.

Some other suggestions I could make for you. Psycho Pass, Knights of Sidonia,  Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. 
>> ARTICLE
One thing that always get's me - in lot of anime, creators are not feared to show dark side of life, characters have a lot of backstory, and it's brutal, dark, and depressing. Characters often die, but not in the flashiest of the possible ways - they just die. They don't have time for anything to say, boom - you're gone, no one cares if you were MC or whatever. Even in comedies there are a lot of people from disfunctional families, or having "not very happy" life.  
You don't see that in western productions, but this is part of life too, you can't just turn your head other way and pretend nothing like this happens.  
All of this makes characters really strong and likeable, because they feel real.

Good examples of similar approach in the west are Game of Thrones and Casino Royale, and just look at people's reaction. Because that's the way you do it.

Especially not Nise.

I was surprised how much they ramped up the sexual innuendo in that one.

Definitely not. But I'm just talking about the OP.

If you like death note I gotta recommend code geass.

The list of suggestions goes on forever, really.

Despite how expensive it is to produce anime, compared to live action it is very inexpensive. As a result, it's less risky to make original IP's, cater to niche audiences, and to spend more money on writing, and less on super-famous faces and special effects. 

Another way to put it; "special effects" when drawn cost pretty much the same as animating people. In some cases, animating people is actually more expensive. So you get a lot more good science fiction and original work than in American live action.

The Hollywood effect is killing American movies and TV; budgets are so large that producers can't afford to take any risks, and prefer low-risk sequels and adaptations rather than face the possibility of a multi-hundred-million-dollar flop.
>> ARTICLE
actually, anime suffers more from those points then american TV does
>> ARTICLE
Care to elaborate a little?
>> ARTICLE
From what I can tell (I've got no numbers, just pieces of things people mentioned) American TV has a larger return anyhow where as even the most successful anime series cannot possibly rake in as much money as American TV shows. Viewer counts, ads, exposure, and DVD sales all contribute as factors, not to mention high quality anime is not cheap to make either.

There a also a series of originals doing horrible in the early 2000s IIRC. From then on studios started relying on light novel and visual novel adaptations.
>> ARTICLE
Nowadays most anime studios don't make orignal IP's because they never sell if you don't cater the series specifically to the Otaku fanbase. 90% of original IP's are specifically fanservice, moe, ecchi shows that have almost non-existent writing and focus entirely on tits and panty shots. 

Sometimes we get good IP's like Zankyou no Terror and now its selling like shit, so they lost thousands of dollars for making a series that doesn't appeal specifically to the otaku fanbase.

Most of the time the only successful anime series are the ones made as advertisements for their adapted material and usually have "go read the manga for more" endings.

For anime, it is more like "The Otaku effect" where its too expensive/risky to make original, creative anime so the studios just continuously churn out poorly made ecchi/moe shows, and prefor low-risk adaptations(advertisements) rather than face the possibility of losing tons of money
>> ARTICLE
How the fuck did they sell the good shit before everything went moe?
>> ARTICLE
It's not like the years before were some glorious paradise of anime. You remember Cowboy Bebop, FMA, Black Lagoon, Trigun, and a couple others... and that's it. You don't remember the dozens of absolute garbage series latching on to whatever trend was popular then (magical girl, vampire, weird bastardization of Christian myth, anything with "Buster" in its name.)

Nowadays, it's much better, because there's enough money for all this interesting anime *as well as* the pandering otaku crap.
>> ARTICLE
> Anything with "Buster" in its name.

 You hating on gunbuster right now? I will fight you. That is some quality mecha right there. 

>> ARTICLE
Shit anime still sells a lot. Case in point, Highschool DxD, Infiinte Stratos, etc.

Animes that take risks dont sell nearly as much. Such as Nichijou, Zankyou, Watamote, etc.

Miyazaki was right. Otakus ruined anime.

>> ARTICLE
Watamote really only became an anime because of that big push /a/ and 2ch did, right? And Nichijou was an adaptation of a manga.
>> ARTICLE
Producers are afraid to take risks with original ideas with potential to flop, so they stick to low budget adaptions. Most anime at the moment are adaptions of light novels, visual novels and manga. There are very few original series.
>> ARTICLE
One difference with anime being that Western audiences will have no experience at all with the original Japanese media, so it makes little difference to them.
>> ARTICLE
19 times out of 20 series are made without western audiences in mind.
>> ARTICLE
Which is exactly why I think anime in general is becoming exceedingly popular over here.
>> ARTICLE
This is the most important aspect of anime. It's slowly changing; there have been Kickstarter programs to try and get foreign funding.

The truth is that a lot of Japanese media is made by Japanese people for Japanese people. This is both a good and a bad thing, since the Japanese are probably not known for their sensitivity regarding other cultures, but then you get something that isn't trying to market itself *to you*. It's marketing itself to Japanese teenagers or otaku or whatever.

That's an important mindset to have when your stuff can be delivered wirelessly on the Internet to foreign markets for nearly-free. I dislike plenty of anime, but there is stuff that I watch that no Western nation would want to bother creating, like Log Horizon or Nobunaga Concerto.

Samurai Champloo.  Everyone should watch it.  And if they don't legitimately love anime after that, fine.  Move along.

You can even see it in /r/anime,  we all speak the same language at its base.  But there are the moe's and the harems, the ecchi's and the dramas. The Shojo and the Shonin.

Also the Old and the New anime and the remakes of old anime with better animation and computers helping.

And the movies vs tv shows.

Wow dude that was pretty rad. I love how they draw food. I got so hungry when the characters were eating.

It wasnt just Death Note, the landscapes in Samurai Champloo were breathtaking. I cant believe the amount of work that must have went into it.

And the soundtrack... Oh man, the soundtrack.

After you watch Garden of Words, watch 5 Centimeters per Second. They're both made by the same director, Makoto Shinkai, who is known for the absolutely gorgeous and super-detailed art in his films. 5 Centimeters per Second, my personal favorite animated film of all time, is also known as 5 HD Wallpapers per Second, for example. I feel like you'd like them.

This!   If Death Note blew his mind, I was getting ready to recommend Code Geass!

Same mind bending, different emotions at play....

Oh and if he wants to cry without watching something incredibly dramatic like 'Clannad' he should watch 'Angel Beats'
>> ARTICLE
Add Cowboy Bebop, because he said that he had liked Samurai Champloo which is very similar with exception of the setting. 

Welcome to the club OP!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks mate, Samurai Champloo was badass.  I'm still getting over Death Note though. Kira was a dick but you gotta respect his intelligence
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass is Death Note with mechs.  Very clever writing and well worth your time. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude, if you liked Champloo and Death Note, the obvious follow ups are Cowboy Bebop (predecessor to Champloo, and quintessential intro to good anime), and Code Grass (similar plot to Death Note, but the scale is grander).
>> ARTICLE
> Code Grass

I feel like that would have made for a very different show...

Yeah Cowboy Bebop is by the same guy that made Samurai Champloo.

If he made it I'm down to watch it.

You can't just watch monogatari and really appreciate it as a newbie anime fan. Or most LN adaptations in general tbh. It's more "advanced".

You need to get through a couple more series before you can handle the large amount of "plot"

Let's be honest, Monogatari has a great mix of plot and "plot"

Nah DxD is the Cinemax (or "Skinemax" as my parents like to call it)

Yeah, uhh...I recommend that OP holds off on this one.
>> ARTICLE
It's possible.

I had a friend who had only watched Mirai Nikki and Shingeki no Kyojin, and I told him to watch this.

Granted, he initially didn't like it, but then he binged watched the whole series just in time for Second Series.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with anime is the stigma it carries.  Just like you said, you thought it was a cheesy kids show with a lot of fanservice with little to zero compelling plot.  That's the stigma that anime carries and it's quite sad.  People tend to forget that **anime** is a **medium** in which art and story can be delivered.  Just how movies can have shows that are targeted towards children, movies can also target adults and audiences that have more mature tastes.  The same goes for anime as well.  There are shows for children and teens, as well as shows for adolescents and young adults.

In any case, I'm glad you gave anime a chance and I do hope you to continue to watch more anime.
>> ARTICLE
Although it may be an unfair stigma, I do believe that it is an *understandable* stigma. The fact remains that a very large portion of anime are made to appeal to Otaku. 

As much as it is irritating to see people who unfairly dismiss all anime as either fanservice and kids' shows, I am also frustrated with people who attempt to hide these stereotypes completely when trying to promote anime (the medium as a whole, not a few select shows). The fact is that fanservice is dominant in anime, and is prevalent even in shows the general public enjoys, such as Naruto, One Piece, etc. While it may not be in *all* anime, it is certainly something that inevitably will be met. To deny its existence is not doing anyone favors.

Not that I disagree with your statement. I agree with you that such close-minded dismissal is unfair, since anime is a diverse medium with many different genres, demographics, etc.. I merely saw an opportunity to argue my own point.
>> ARTICLE
It definitely is an understandable stigma and also something that's not just limited to anime in general.  I'd say in anime the stigma is even more pronounced compared to other mediums.  Take a look at action movies.  One could argue that all action movies have some ridiculously handsome or badass male protagonist with a ridiculously beautiful female counterpart where there's also either a romantic subplot or just a sexual subplot.  All media mediums are subject to the same amount of criticism as anime, but I feel as if anime gets the short end of the stick most of the time.

I don't think that people who promote anime are trying to hide the stereotypes completely by not acknowledging it, but that they don't have an adequate explanation as to why things such as fanservice and the "kiddy stuff" is so "prevalent" in the medium.  Just like you said, the reason why there is a stereotype in anime is because a large portion of anime is made to appeal to the "otaku" crowd.  However this doesn't only apply to anime.  The same can be said for movies with huge summer blockbusters.  These movies might not be considered "great films" just like how popular animes might not be considered "great animes", but the trend is still the same.

I don't disagree with you at all.  I'd just like to point out that anime is probably receiving the short end of the stick because there is a huge lack of awareness of the medium despite other mediums falling into the same stereotypical attitudes.

That was me too. Well I didn't legitimately tease my friends or think it was bad. I just thought it wasn't for me....like at all. Even after I saw Bebop and loved it, I was aware anime could be great but I still didn't get hooked for some unknown reason. I think I still was convinced that it was mostly weird subject matter and tropes. It wasn't until I saw Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood, that I just got completely hooked and started watching any anime I could find. That seems to be how it happens. And I second Psycho Pass, like /u/zechsterror said.

I'd recommend code geass if you really liked death note

There's shit anime, and there's good anime. The shit can be worse than American reality TV, but the good stuff can be better than pretty much anything on American television (Firefly is the one western show that I would rank above my favorite anime, after that there is very little that comes close). 
>> ARTICLE
You should watch Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad then. 
>> ARTICLE
I have seen Breaking Bad and am reading Game of Thrones. Breaking Bad was good, but not as good as the anime that I like best IMO. I don't know how the quality of the GoT show relates to the books so I can't really comment on that.
>> ARTICLE
I'll marathon through every harem in existence before I ever press play on American reality tv, haha
>> ARTICLE
Im still new so I have no idea what harem is. Is that a show?

>> ARTICLE
It's a genre of anime where you have one male lead surrounded by a cast of females ;usually all attracted to him in some way. You can also find a reverse harem, which is gender switched.

It's also a genre with a pretty low [Hit - Miss] ratio when it comes to quality. Though usually reasonably funny, even if it's in spite of itself.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with *most* harems is that they are carbon copies of each other.  The idea and characters worked the first time, so they change the artwork and backdrop and basically put the characters in the exact same situations over and over again.

There are a few real gems in the Harem genre though.
>> ARTICLE
[Tvtropes probably explains it well. Do be careful not to get stuck in its gravity well though.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremGenre) It's a pretty common format, which means a lot of them are kinda subpar, but some harem anime are really great (such as the Monogatari Series). Then again, there needs to be more going on in the show than just the presence of a harem for it to be much good.
>> ARTICLE
It's a genre. 

I must warn you OP that the western anime community has some problems with accepting/acknowledging different opinions, so take any good/bad dicussions with a grain of salt.

Game of Thrones, Sherlock, Firefly, and Carnivle are my favorite TV shows and they definitely rank up there with my favorite animes.

Kind of can't believe it hasn't been mentioned yet, but please watch Cowboy Bebop.

I just bought the Blu-ray of it and hadn't seen or heard anything about it. I marathoned it and while it was a neat one. I don't see how it has attained this title of "Absolutely Amazing"
>> ARTICLE
It does annoy me how it is lauded as AOTD by many. It does everything very well animation, story, music. All are good.

That in itself is very rare which is why is stands out so much. However none of them are EXCELLENT status. It is rare to see a anime that is above average in all aspects, especially nowadays when everything plays it safe for the most part. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they handled time travel very well. Also, and I'm no expert, but I think the character development was really good and shows; especially at pivotal moments. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy... Well i have to say you started with 2 shows that simply amazing. 

Shows you watch after Death Note and Samurai Champloo might seem really bad.

The animation in SC is really good and the music combines really well with that style of anime.  Death Note simply has a insanely good story.

 I watched Death Note and the first season of Dexter (serial killer one) and i spend one month without watching shows or movies, because everything seemed like crap.

Having said that, ill have to bother you with my all time favorite list:

Cowboy Bebop

Trigun

[Samurai X - Trust and Betrayal](http://www.animeget.com/samurai-x-trust-betrayal-anime) breath taking animation and music.

Full Metal Alchemist  - Brotherhood

One Piece - Animation style is diferent, and characters are really funny and interesting.


Movies

Ghost in the Shell - To me, is the number one anime movie of all time.

Akira

Sword of the Stranger - best fighting scenes ever made on anime.

I have a lot more to put here, but im sure you will be bombarded by other redditors with excellent choices.

Oh one last thing. [Welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43GChXc6RVY&oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D43GChXc6RVY&has_verified=1)

Glad you gave it a chance. Do recommend angelbeats though will strengthen your liking for story and animation. Plus it'll make another grown man cry

I can actually say, that to this day, Angel beats is the only anime to make me shed even a single manly tear.. I've seen... well, let's just say a LOT of anime. Definitely not over 200 different anime or anything, I totally have a life...

I wish every person was *this* human.

It makes me happy when people actually give anime a chance. There are wayyy to many preconceptions about it.

You should watch Steins;Gate next, it is the greatest anime i've ever seen and you will not know what to do with your life after you've finished it.
>> ARTICLE
So far that's the most recommenced anime. I need to see it.
>> ARTICLE
Ha, if you thought Death Note was intelligently written and unique then you are really going to enjoy anime. When I started watching anime years ago, I thought Death Note was the best, but now it wouldn't even make my top 10.
>> ARTICLE
What would your top 5/10 be?
>> ARTICLE
I would still rate Death Note as one of the smartest shows I've watched, what do you think is better?
>> ARTICLE
I think many people just don't understand that anime is similar to movies/tv series. It's just the generic idea people usually get like fan service/hentai/echi, childish shows, rejection(?) to Japanese language, nerdiness, etc about anime and people who watch anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you liked Death Note and want to see more anime that gives you that "Holy shit. Who's going to die!?" feeling (That's about as far as i can explain it) then i suggest watching Code Geass (Kinda similar, supernatural powers but with added mecha!) or  
Attack on Titan (Similar feeling, dark moments, good story, interesting twists.) those anime are among my favorites along with the entire Ghost in the Shell franchise.    

If you haven't already watch the first film "Ghost in the Shell", It's an anime classic and really damn good, also very cyberpunk.    

Sword Art Online (SAO) is also regarded as pretty good and is one of my favourites though the second arc is a tad... mediocre.     

  
Kill la Kill is also pretty damn great though it's full of semi-ironic fan service.      

I also recommend watching Fullmetal Achemist: Brotherhood, that anime. Really awesome, some mildly dark parts and an interesting story (for anime).  
Welcome to anime!  

>> ARTICLE
Here's a tip:

Never watch School Days.

This one anime will ruin your life in just a couple episodes.

Also: Clannad and Clannad After Story are two of the most emotional stories I have ever seen in anime. The first one is mostly humor with the slice of life genre mixed in, but the second one is where the heavy stuff comes in. If Clannad: After Story does not make you cry, you are missing a piece of your soul.

I like you.  Welcome to the club :) I used to be close to the same way, I wouldn't actually tease people but in the back of my mind I would always hold it against them, hahaha.  Once I started, though, I was hooked.  It's sad that anime gets such a bad rep due to all of the fringe elements - weaboos and the childish or perverted shows are basically the face of the genre for far too many people, but there's _so_ much more that's _**so**_ much better.

"I've watched what is frankly a shameful amount of anime. Here's a list of top-tier anime that I think you'd like. They're mostly seinen (target audience 17-40). They are in order of recommendation.

Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex & sequel - Action, scifi, police

Set in the 2030's in a world where cybernetics have advanced to the point where you can replace all of your body, and most of your brain with machines. It follows the exploits of an anti-terrorist squad as they defend Japan from various cyberterrorists. Good, fairly deep dialogue, good action scenes, great animation, and the music is done by the same composer who did Cowboy Bebop's music.

Psycho Pass - Psychological, action, scifi, police

Follows a squad of detectives in a dystopian future of 2113. They live in a big-brother city, where almost everything is monitored. Citizens of the city regularly have their mental status scanned, and if it's judged that you may possibly commit a crime, you are put in rehab-jail. The squad mainly chases a terrorist that is trying to dismantle the big brother-esque system.

Steins;Gate - Modern day comedy/drama, timetravel

A young group of friends headed by a wannabe mad scientist accidentally creates a time travel device that can send information to the past. Everything soon goes pear shaped and the luckless group is forced to fight off various organizations who want the tech, in addition to trying to fix the changes they've made to the timeline by sending messages to the past.

Monster - Drama, Mystery, Horror, Thriller

An up and coming young doctor is framed for the murder of several people by a patient of his. He is forced to go on the run for over a decade while he attempts to prove that the real murderer is loose and perpetrating ever greater atrocities.

Black Lagoon & sequels - Action, underworld mercenaries

A Japanese salaryman is caught up by a group of Thailand mercenaries, and is abandoned by his bosses as a hostage. When the mercs no longer need him, he decides to abandon his previous life and convinces them to let him join their group. He attempts to find his place in the underworld without succumbing to the darkness and losing his morality.

Gungrave - Mob, Action

In the first half of Gungrave, the protagonist starts as a member of a low-level gang. He works his way into the mafia, where he works his way up the ranks. It is mostly a drama with a bit of action. The second half of gungraves goes batshit insane and becomes a sci-fi bloodbath. Do not watch the second half.

Death Note - Mystery, psychological thriller, drama

A young genius comes into the possession of a notebook that can kills anyone simply by writing their name in it. All he needs is to know their name, and what their face looks like. Within limits, he can control the time and manner of death of the target. The show follows his ascent from regular high-schooler to full fledged super-villain, as well as the games of wit and strategy he plays with the ace detective that's after him.

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - Semi-fantasy, action, adventure, drama, military

Science and magic blend in the art known as alchemy. The ability to change the shape and substance of materials using a combination of runes and energy from the alchemist. When two young brothers lose their mother, they vow to become master alchemists and find the philosopher's stone. The philosophers stone is an energy source that allows one to transcend the laws of alchemy such that it's said to be able to resurrect the dead. They join the military's alchemist squadron as they pursue their goal. 

Attack on Titan

Humanity has been decimated. The last refuges of humanity live in a giant walled city. The wall keeps out the beasts known as the titans. The titans are mindless humanoids 15-150 feet tall whose only purpose is to consume people. They can only be killed by a blow to the back of the spine, any other damage will regenerate in minutes. The titans breach the outer walls of the city. The story follows a group of orphans that join the military with the goal of beating back the titans so that humans can expand once more.

Watch Steins;Gate!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Watch Puella Magi Madoka Magica, It will deceive you in the first three episodes. and if you want to get into a deeper and more feels genre watch Clannad and Clannad After Story. Boring at first, but it's worth it.
>> ARTICLE
Recommending Madoka for someone who's never seen a magical girl show is almost mean. It's like watching Evangelion without knowing any giant-robot tropes. You need a little hope and beauty before it can be properly ~~extinguished~~ deconstructed.

Start with Cardcaptor Sakura, or Sailor Moon Crystal, or hell, Korean Zombie Desk Car. 
>> ARTICLE
I had the same thing until one of my friends almost beat me up(figurativly, not literraly) for calling something american anime. Since then, I love it and watch far too much of it.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate

Puella Magi Madoka Magica.

PM me when you're done.

I'll be honest, 90% of anime IS cheesy kids shows and fan service. Samurai Champloo and Death Note are the exceptions, not the rules. 
Since there is so much anime, there is quite a large margin of good anime. 
They have a habit of putting the most pathetic excuse for a human as the protagonist and give him several very attractive women who for some reason all want to be his boyfriend. And the guy is normally short, like he comes to chest level on the girls. Also, in some of the better animes that are really good if you stick with them can have some of the WORST protagonist. The most famous example is Guilty Crown, it's a good story if you can avoid putting your fist through the screen because the main character is a fucking tool.

If you are looking for really good anime, these are all rather long but with amazing stories that get off to a slow start but after they pick up steam they will keep you glued to your monitor.

*Last Exile-In an almost steampunk world, lives two Orphans Claus and Lavi. They are have followed in their late father's footsteps and become courier pilots in what is known as a Vanship(plane). However, when they are tasked to deliver a small girl to an infamous mercenary ship, they find out there is more to this mission, and their fathers' death, than they know about.

*Gungrave-Following the death of their friends, two young men who have been best friends since childhood, join the underworld of organized crime. While best friends their personalities, and their reasons, could not be different. One, an outgoing and motivated Harry McDowell seeks fame and fortune, while a quiet and reserved Brandon Heat seeks to protect the ones he loves and the girl he adores. As the two opposing personalities begin to present themselves, the divide between the two best friends grows until one of them winds up dead.

*Psycho Pass-The series takes place in the near future, when it is possible to instantaneously measure and quantify a person's state of mind and personality. This information is recorded and processed, and sometimes used to lock away would-be criminals before they can commit a crime; and the term "Psycho-Pass" refers to a standard used to measure an individual's being. The story centers around the enforcement officer Shinya Kougami, who is tasked with managing crime in such a world, and the growing danger of the darker side of "justice" in such a world.

*Requiem for the Phantom-Two brainwashed assassins, Ein and Zwei, struggle to regain their memories while employed by an organized crime syndicate who would prefer they didn't.

---These start off really good and only get better.---

*Black Lagoon- A white collar Japanese businessman is kidnapped by a group of outlaw bandits. When he is left for dead by his employers, he finds himself in the employ of a rather shady courier company known as the Lagoon company

*Code:geass-In a world where a large empire has defeated Japan and for it's resistance, renamed it to simply "Area 11," a young aristocrat named LeLouch seeks revenge on the man who murdered his mother, and crippled and blinded his sister. His dream begins to become a reality when he meets a young girl who gives him the power to bend others to his will, the power of Geass. Under the guise of "Zero" and with the aid of a resistance group seeking freedom for Japan, he seeks vengeance on the man who killed his mother: his father, the emperor, along with the downfall of of his mighty empire. 

*Gunslinger Girl- In italy a project is started to turn young girls into cyborg assassins, brainwashed and trained by their fratello(siblings) they do the bidding of the Italian government while struggling with their own feelings of where they fit in this world of violence.

*Darker than Black- In Tokyo, an impenetrable field known as "Hell's Gate" appeared ten years ago. At the same time, psychics who wield paranormal powers at the cost of their conscience also emerged. Hei is one of the most powerful of these psychic agents, and along with his blind associate, Yin, works for one of the many rival agencies vying to unlock the mysteries of Hell's Gate.


All of these have english dubs which are rather good, that way you don't have to read the bottom of the screen the entire time as the boys talk like girls and the girls talk like toddlers.

Damn right you're sorry. Once you start, you can't stop.

i hope this doesn't mean you are going stop stuffing eric rovitzski in the locker because you like anime now.

if you liked death note, try code geass straight up.

Death Note and Samurai Champloo are both exceptional anime.  Really high bar to start with.  Unfortunately, as some other people have said, they're the exception.  There's hundreds of anime out there on websites that list them in alphabetical order, and an experienced eye will scroll down the list going: "Shit shit shit shit harem shit shit shit ninjas shit shit shit good shit shit shit more ninjas shit shit shit cliche shit shit shit harem harem harem shit shit good shit shit shit harem shit shit ninjas shit shit mechas shit shit shit..."
>> ARTICLE
I never realized it but you're right, there's so much different anime out there. Every anime has a unique story. There's just so much different stories out there compared to american TV (don't get me wrong though, there are some amazing TV shows out there and I watch TV all the time, but yeah). Those are definitely very good anime to get people into anime, if you want another fantastic story, PLEASE watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. If you're new to anime, you NEED to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
It's np brah, if you have netflix watch Fate/zero, the devil is a part-timer, and hunter x hunter (2011), wellll worth your time
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to anime! Be sure to check out Steins;Gate, Fullmetal Alchemist (the 2003 adaptation first, and then Brotherhood afterwards), Cowboy Bebop, and Monster.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the Dark Side!
>> ARTICLE
Death Note and Champloo stand out as 2 shows with great english dubs. Most aren't so great. I hope you can enjoy shows with subtitles.

If you can get past the anime stereotypes, fan service, and general cheese of it, Kill La Kill is non-stop bad-ass funny-funny.

If you like the "how the hell am I hooked on this like something's happening even though nothing's happening (by American standards)" feeling you might get from Mushi-Shi then I strongly suggest the series "Nagi No Asukara" and the film "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time".

[Gargantia](http://www.crunchyroll.com/gargantia-on-the-verdurous-planet) was really good. Only 13 episodes. It's more like a long movie with a great opening, great middle, and great ending.

Attack on Titan seemed overrated to me at first but it quickly grew on me and I desperately want to see season 2 more than anything else. 

If you haven't seen the classics you should check out Akira, Ninja Scroll, Ghost In the Shell (the movies and the 2 season show). OK...I don't really know what the classics are, those are classic to me. ... Vampire Hunter D also, maybe?

Sword of the Stranger. Go watch that for more spectacular animation.
>> ARTICLE
Congratulations! I'm sure the people you messed around with are glad to have you in the fold now. Always god to see when someone can confront their mistakes and apologize. Have fun with the fandom man the is a lot of Brilliant, beautiful, tense, action packed, sad, scary, thought provoking, and sometimes downright weird media in your future. Have fun
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend Ghost in the Shell for smart writing. There are episodes where characters *not* commenting on things says just as much as when they actually talk about it.

For instance, in the new Arise series, one of the big things is this virus that changes the way people behave. The vaccine? It changes your behavior "back" to the way it "should be". Nobody says a word. I think it says just as much about the world the series is set in when things that change the way your personality works aren't really commented upon. It's just "yup, some hacker screwed with someone's brain again".

Like, *holy shit*, can you imagine if we became that apathetic about someone's behavior? I'm actually kind of disappointed in Arise, but the series is pretty consistent in that there are viruses that can fundamentally change who you are as a person and they can be man-made and installed in your brain chemistry any time you connect to the internet.

Anyway, I'm drunk so I'm done but other suggestions are Mobile Suit Gundam (the original series) and Ashita no Joe. There are some wonky moments but both series as a whole seem like a genuine portrait of how shitty war can be, through the eyes of Japanese people who grew up during the period where Japan was still rebuilding after the end of World War II. Japan was in *very* bad shape. There were fire bombings to raze cities like Tokyo because a lot of old homes were still constructed of nothing but wood, a lot of men had died because of imperial Japan's tendency to prefer honorable death over capture, and then we dropped two nukes on them. I don't think you can fully understand what that country went through until you see some of the media that was produced either immediately after the war or by people who grew up in the 60s/70s and saw the aftermath firsthand.

Japan really is a different country now and that time period is a cool window for their media.

Get this guy the full box set of Hokuto No Ken

duuuuude check out 2011 hunter x hunter , thank melater

As others have suggested, you should watch Cowboy Bebop. Champloo is okay, Bebop is the best.

Everyone who gives people shit for watching anime should be required to watch Samurai Champloo.

check out Gurren Lagann if you are in need of some super crazy action / complete over the top awesomeness

And now watch K-on.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for giving it a try.  I worry about telling people I'm into anime, a lot of the time I am ridiculed for it, or people just don't understand.  Anime covers a huge, massive range of subjects... it's not just hikikomori that are into it.

I just watched 'Golden Time' the other day and it brought back loads and loads of memories about my past relationships, it felt good to remember something that I had blocked out for so long.  I sympathized with Tada Banri, and cried when his world changed.

I just finished 'K-ON!' last night, and I teared up at the finish of that as well.  I play in a band, it's not a light music club, but it's amazing and fun and everything I've ever wanted with my close friends.  Watching animes like 'Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad', 'K-ON!', and 'Nana' help me, personally, to keep my objectives in mind.  I watch them all over and over and over again and it inspires me again, and again, and again.

I will always watch anime, even when I am an old, old man.  The beautiful stories, the great characters and the realization of their unreachable goals, the emotional weight to the heavy amines and the light-hearted carefree feeling of the cuter ones, I love them all.  I'm going to keep watching even if someone thinks I'm weird for it.

And you should, too.

I always thought anime was the dumbest thing ever, and my boyfriend was always trying to get me into it.  Finally, about three years into our relationship, I finally watched Soul Eater and loved it.  I'm glad you've taken an interest.  :) 

PS, just finished Death Note the other day.  Fucking loved it.  ^_^

Now that you've found your mind is a bit more open, I suggest you try a bunch of different genres within anime. Many people I know, myself included never really thought they'd like slice of life or romantic comedy anime but then specific series caught us off guard and were amazing.

My story is a little different, not something i admit usually, but i started watching anime, a year and half ago i think, after my sister convinced me to watch fairy tail, of course since then ive seen plenty of shows that are way better, but i started watching with shows like fairy tail, naruto, bleach, and rave master, and eventually decided to watch death note and Attack on titan, after that point i watched just about anything that got highly recommended(except i have yet to watch anything made before 2000), Its to the point where my sister that got me into anime asks me for recommendations, since she hasnt watched a whole lot.

If you think Death Note and Samurai Champloo are amazing, you'll definitely enjoy the better anime series as you continue watching anime.


I'm not saying Death Note and Samurai Champloo are bad (they are both great series), I personally find it surprising that these two shows are the shows that changed your opinion on anime as a whole.
>> ARTICLE
Samurai Champloo is only regarded as one of the best series of all time. 

I might not be the biggest fan of Death Note, but it's one of the most accessible animes for non-fans. 

If you think neither of these shows have the ability to sway non-fans, you may need to repeat Anime History 101.
>> ARTICLE
Well, glad that you decide to give anime a chance after all. It's just a simple ingroup/outgroup phenomenon (e.g. the entirely idiotic business of #gamergate).

That said though, not all anime shows are good, just like any medium. There is a lot of trash, some mediocre (but enjoyable) time-killers, and a few genre-defining gems. But finding those gems are part of the fun in itself 
>> ARTICLE
Dont be completely fooled though. There are still shows out there that are fanservicey/childish that you have to look out for.
>> ARTICLE
I accept your apology haha either way it's cool that you gave anime a chance
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you have to apologize at all. A little teasing between friends is hardly the end of the world, and you were afterall willing to give Anime a chance and see the error of your ways. Keeping an open mind to a degree where you are willing to try it is more laudable than having some understandable prejudices is bad.

Also, I know you are beeing swamped with suggestions, but watch Sora no Woto, it's seriously great.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop after you're done with Mushi-shi.  If you liked Champloo, I am almost 95% sure that you'll like Bebop. 

Welcome to our world; we're glad to have you.
>> ARTICLE
Glad you liked it!! You should make a MyAnimeList and keep up with what you watch. It will help you in the long run as you request recommendations.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome, you have just but scratched the surface... Death Note is Ok-ish compared to a lot of stuff out there, soooo... ENJOY! ;)

Also, obligatory "ONE OF US! ONE OF US!"
>> ARTICLE
Glad there's one less ignorant judgmental person out there. We need more of you.
>> ARTICLE
May I recommend Yu Yu Hakusho and Outlaw Star, some of my favorite classics.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat. My friend use to watch Gundam in high school and I would give him shit every time he tried to make me watch it. My girlfriend sat me down and made me watch Jin Roh and now here I am six months later watching Sabagebu! on my one day off. 
>> ARTICLE
Made fun of my ex & her friends for years...then, two years after we split, I rented Spirited Away. It literally changed my life. I realized that anime did not mean Pokemon & Inuyasha any more than film meant The Room or Uwe Boll.

Some other great anime for those just getting started:

* Cowboy Bebop
* Trigun
* Black Lagoon
* Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood
>> ARTICLE
Man, I'm glad you saw the light!  Samurai Champloo is probably my 3rd favourite anime of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
welcome, spread the love
>> ARTICLE
Hey. Watch Stiens; Gate. That shit is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Steins Gate is a must watch if you want to fit in to /r/anime. Otherwise, I will refrain form suggesting too many at once so they don't get lost in the thread. I'd also suggest looking up some reviewers like Glass Reflections Arkada, Bakashift, and the holy podcast Podtaku to get an idea of the general mainstream anime opinion. Welcome to the community!
>> ARTICLE
Ooh nice choices of animes! May I recommend you take a look and consider watching Clannad, One Piece, and Full Metal Alchemist, Steins;Gate, and Hunter x Hunter in the future?
>> ARTICLE
Well first off let me say that you were kinda right before, as most anime is shit. But you're also right now, finding out that there are real quality works out there to be discovered. Just don't expect every anime you watch to be as good as Death Note and Samurai Champloo, just as not every movie you seen in a theater is going to be Citizen Kane. 
>> ARTICLE
You should make a [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net) account to keep track of everything.  It makes keeping track of what you want to watch and what you've already watched a whole lot easier.  

Also I'd kinda wanna see what your list ends up looking like 6 months from now.
>> ARTICLE
You chose well. Samurai Champloo and Deathnote are my 2 favourites. I would reccomend fullmetal alchemist next.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I think people fail to realize that anime is just like any other medium.

There's some amazing stuff, there's some crappy stuff.  There's some stuff that will fits your tastes, there's some stuff that simply won't be for you.  The types of anime out there are so varied that I honestly think it's impossible for someone to not be able to find *something* that they enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure the majority of us made fun of our friends for Years before taking the plunge, and regretting our former doubt

>The story telling is definitely unique compared to the typical American crap that's over done and predictable

There it is right there. Besides the  certain drama shows and some cartoons, American television is basically shit. Filled with cheap, manufactured, staged, reality tv shows that have been trending to making everyone on the show naked. Thats the big progress over the past 4 years.

Anime doesn't believe in the western story, the monomyth, the crime drama, the very atypical shows that all seem the same. You get something unique and different yet well told.
>> ARTICLE
>The story telling is definitely unique compared to the typical American crap that's over done and predictable. 
            
Wow, you're almost a weeb after only two anime.       
        
In all seriousness though, you should watch Code Geass if you liked Death Note. As for Samurai Champloo, I have no idea what to fill the void with. :(

Welcome to our world. There is no turning back. There will be no light at the end of the tunnel. Engulfed in darkness till there is no dawn except the blue glow in front of you.
>> ARTICLE
If you're looking for a show with good writing, check out Steins;Gate. It's a show having to do with time travel and other science fictioney tropes. I watched the whole series, then the OVA, then the movie, and then since I wanted more, I rewatched the first episode, and holy crap, there was so much that made sense, so much prior planning, and it wasn't just, "oh, huh, I missed that the first time." It's as if you just completed the last half of a 5000 piece puzzle in 24 minutes.

TL;DR Steins;Gate is good, watch the series then the OVA, then the movie, and then the first episode again, and you're golden.

EDIT: You can find the series easily, but the OVA will take some looking, and the movie is actually on youtube in good quality.
>> ARTICLE
Watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It's long, but one of the best shows ever made.  I'm sure other people here will agree.
>> ARTICLE
I find that as you get older, you care less and less about what people think of you, and what you feel you have to think about other people (a lot of it has to do with the mentality of elementary/high school where people feel like they have to put others down in order to feel better about themselves).  It's like correcting people's grammar or spelling on facebook (especially as an adult) - you just look like a petty asshole.  That said, I'm somewhat guilty of something similar, as I don't understand adults who still watch wrestling (while considering a legitimate athletic venture/sport - it's *theater*) - I don't feel the need to say to those people "you're a child" or "grow up! jesus christ!" because I don't feel the need to put people down, and I don't consider myself an asshole (even if I might think watching it is a waste of time).

PS fan-service can be good and bad I find; sometimes it's funny when it's not overdone in an otherwise serious anime, and then you've got something like Highschool of the Dead which I liked *despite* the fanservice (the jiggly boobs complete with sound effects was a little much - and I haven't even watched the special/OVA which I hear is set on a beach and even worse).
>> ARTICLE
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood! Watch it now!
>> ARTICLE
Now go watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and proceed to pierce through every anime in your path for pure enjoyment and enlightenment!
>> ARTICLE
For mushi-shi the first season is on Netflix but there is a newly released second season on sites like crunchyroll.Also some personal recommends are Magi(starting isn't super good but it gets alot better and is a better cooler version of Arabian nights),kotoura-san(mini series but still really good)you already got mushishi(also the second season isn't finished) and full metal alchemist(both original and brotherhood they start similar but the original gets a different story later as the manga stopped for s bit and it kept going so they made their own one and brotherhood was created after the end).Some other ones that I kinda liked are Non non biyori,watamote as well as space dandy and log horizon.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was just shows that the weird kids watched. Then I got to college and was forced to watch Code Geass. And I could not be more happy that I now watch shows weekly. Anime is a fantastic thing. 
>> ARTICLE
(Stuff you've already been told by I want to say it) If you search for the good ones you'll be blown away. I always love to see people get into the medium because it really is great when given a chance. Just don't get bogged down by some of the really crappy stuff. Don't be discouraged by fanservice because some shows are hilarious with it (eg. To Love Ru) and others do it for perspective reasons (eg. The Monogatari Series). The universe of anime is so vast that you almost never run out of shows to watch. I have a backlog list of about seventy shows I plan to watch (Also it's growing). I'm excited to see a new face in the community. Have a great time and enjoy yourself. 
>> ARTICLE
Anime is one of the most creative mediums out there. Over time you'll probably notice a lot more similarities and some just pretty much copy each other. So it's bound to happen that there will be some predictable ones. But when you do see an original, mind is always blown. This isn't to fear though, a new anime watcher has A LOT to catch up before you probably encounter such situation.

If there's a recommendation based on what you've just watched, I'd suggest Code Geass. I noticed that most people who've liked Death Note have also liked Code Geass and vice versa.
>> ARTICLE
Hey it happens. I was the same way until I gave it a chance as well. It's good that you at least gave it a chance to make up your mind, rather than stubbornly saying no without actually trying.

ONE OF US, ONE OF US, ONE OF US

I'm really happy you discovered the good anime. :D 
It's best to enjoy without worrying about what people think, since there are many that don't understand anime, and tend to generalize it negativity as a whole due to the more perverted titles existing out there. 

 Just a warning though, even the really good ones sometimes slip in weird fan-service, however, like Code Geass(That table scene o_o), and some incidents in Psycho Pass. But other anime avoid it entirely as Death Note did, like Monster, Durarara, and Natsume Yuujinchou.

Neon Genesis Evangelion, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop

Enjoy

I don't really like anime but I like coming to the subreddit. There are funny pictures and gifs that happen to be drawn and the comment section is always full of nice people.

1) Anime isn't a genre.  "I hate anime" is synonymous with "I hate movies" or "I hate fish."  I like some anime.  I like action, blood, and tits.  The more tits and the more people who get brutally murdered in anime, the better it is.  I hate anime comedies.  Is all anime awesome?  Fuck no.  But the really hardcore brutal ones are really really cool.

2) I watch anime regularly and I still make fun of anime nerds.  Not all of them, but the ones who are really really socially inept.  Seriously, if you use the word "Kawaii" in regular conversation, you're a fucking Otaku 'Tard.  Claiming to have a Waifu?  It honestly brings out the high school bully in me.  I will give you a fucking wedgie and stuff your goofy ass in a locker.  Collect anime toys?  That's cool.  You can bring your toys over and we can play Anime and Hulk.  Your anime guys and my Hulk guys have to team up against Megatron.  I think I still have my Megatron figure.  He turns into a race car.  And a jet.

You should see the animation quality of fate/zero it's fucking amazing.

First time I ever read something like this where someone actually gives anime a chance and ends up really liking it. This makes me extremely happy! Welcome to the sub... And now anime has sucked you in and you'll never be able to stop. ;) In all seriousness, welcome and if you ever need a recommendation or just want to talk about anime, pm me and I'll happily answer. Have a good one.

Death Note is one of my all time favorite anime. I try all the time to get my non-anime friends to watch it with no effect. Other animes to put on your list is Vampire Hunter D and Ghost in the Shell.
>> ARTICLE
Watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Cowboy Bebop and since you're new Attack On Titan.
>> ARTICLE
When I saw the title of this thread I instantly thought, "He's watched Death Note".

Death Note seems to be the #1 title for converting anime haterz.

I love how whenever someone says they just discovered anime everyone floods them with lists of their favorite 20 shows xD

Glad you're in the club, dude!

For two of the longest running series, here's how I explain them (if you ever really want to get into a long, LONG series):

Naruto is mature animation with childish themes and story writing

One Piece is childish animation with mature themes and story writing

I know I'm probably going to get a lot of flak for this, so I'm sorry in advance!  I've been a One Piece fan since the Nami episode (fans know the one early on).  I've tried several times, but never got into Naruto.
>> ARTICLE
If you like intelligently written anime, I highly suggest looking up the writer "Gen Urobuchi." Especially Fate/Zero and Psycho Pass. Fate/Zero is kinda hard to get into since it's based on an already established world and the first episode is an info dump. Not only are the stories and dialogue enthralling, the directors he usually works with have so much attention to detail on the animation, it's mind boggling. 

ie seamless real time lighting change from sunset to dusk. 

Also, none of his characters have plot armor, he will kill off any of his characters if it makes the show better. ANY. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch fullmetal alchemist brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
I was the same. Oh boy did I do a complete 180

I know you are getting tons of suggestions but il suggest one of my favourite shows that have not been suggested yet.

Whenever you have time try Kokoro Connect it's really good!

if you want to dive deep down a rabbit hole watch deadman wonderland(on netflix)

Wlecome bro.I actualy was like you. Not nessesery teesed anime peaple but was sceptical for sure. Everything changed after couple's episodes of 'Death Note' my eye's was like opend.

I'd recommend Cowboy Bebop and Trigun, older animes but still in my top 5 of all time.

Baseball episode - enough said. 

Perfect culmination of perfect show.

Death Note was pretty entrancing.

Mushi shi is great, I would also recommend kino's journey, it is clever and there aren't that many episodes 
>> ARTICLE
There is a stereotype that anime fans are considered socially awkward outcast. This is another contributing factor why Anime isn't as popular in the West. If there were more people who would give just one of the top Animes a shot, it would definitely grow. 

Also the only Western television exposure to anime is Toonami from 12-5 on Saturdays nights.

If you liked champloo you should check out cowboy bebop or space dandy. For movies besides studio gibli you should see akira its one of the best movies of all time

This shouldn't really be about anime. Good, bad, it's a subjective thing to enjoy or not. 

What you should really feel bad about is being a jerk to people for liking different things than you, and maybe try not to do that anymore, rather than only changing your mind when you start to like the thing in question. Good luck. :)
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the endless ride, where every time you finish watching a series your plan-to-watch list becomes even longer.

Try watching Madoka Magica. Yes, it's a show about cute girls fighting evil witches, but there's a reason it's so popular. Just give it three episodes.  
And for the love of god don't go search stuff about it before you watch it, spoilers are everywhere and will ruin everything*

*this applies for every anime

So glad u feel this way

P.S. When u get to an anime thats super emotional, then will it feel awesome as f**k xD

While reading this, all I could think of was how my younger brother used to hate anime with a passion, but now spends most of his free time watching it. This also reminded me of one of my friends that doesn't necessarily hate anime or tease people for liking it (excluding the ones who have a freaky obsession with it), but doesn't really understand it either. I'm hoping I can one day get him into it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised that I'm not seeing a lot of people suggesting Hunter x Hunter (2011). It is one of those that seem to be misleadingly childish at first glance, but it is one of the best anime I've ever seen.
Also Steins;Gate is freaking fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Tis a good day my friend! We shall toast your conversion, and drink till the dawn! Welcome to the cult.

I come from the same position. Used to make fun of it untill just a couple of years ago, and now I can't even find people who can even compete with how much I've seen. It also lead to me getting passionate about music and now I play acoustic guitar and piano. Hopefully you'll continue to be amazed by the big world of anime.

Space Dandy, baby.

>> ARTICLE
If you liked Samurai Champloo, I'd definitely recommend a very recently made anime [Terror in Resonance/Zankyou no Terror](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23283/Zankyou_no_Terror/). It is made by the creaters of Samurai Champloo, and a FANTASTIC watch. Most likely the best anime of 2014 so far.
>> ARTICLE
Congrats and welcome to the world of anime sir. I have literally over a hundred anime I want to suggest to you but I'll start with three.

Code Geass, Steins;Gate, and Durarara. All relatively short (except maybe Geass) and easy to get into.
>> ARTICLE
I was the same way until I watched Samurai Champloo a few years back and now I've seen it all the way through several times and am so attached to those damn characters I cry at the end!  I haven't seen Death Note but that is next on my list.
>> ARTICLE
Check out Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit. Its great.

>> ARTICLE
I suggest you watch the big 5:
-Akira
-Trigun
-Full Metal Alchemist (2003 version)
-Cowboy Bebop
-Neon Genesis Evangelion (you may not like this one cause of its ending)
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the anime community!
Another person whose views on anime has changed !! Enjoy as much anime content it has to offer and don't be skeptical of the different genres it has. Anyways, have a good day.  
>> ARTICLE
Don't know what's been suggested already, but may I recommend Baccano, Fantastic Children, and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex?
>> ARTICLE
WELCOME to the world of anime ! haha i wish everyone could realize how mind blowing a good anime can be. I see you posted this 5 months ago. hopefully you've had the chance to watch some of my favourites . "Attack on Titan", "Sword Art Online", "Bleach", "Naruto" and "Naruto Shippuden", "Steins Gate". Just a few great animes in my books.
>> ARTICLE
Most people say it sucks and have never watched any anime at all. Try before you judge. 
>> ARTICLE
Check out Death Parade if you get a chance.  Its about purgatory and final judgement.  Its a bit of a mind twist at times, you never know 100% for everyone if they told the told.  There is one scene where a judgement might be wrong and there is no way to reverse them.  The ending will give you a case of the feels and smash your heart.  Its the best possible ending possible,  but it hurts.
>> ARTICLE
Please watch Stein's Gate, please. :c
>> ARTICLE
Just wait till you watch Clannad & Clannad After Story. 
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the world of anime! If you don't mind I'd love to give you some suggestions:


**MUST WATCH:**

Cowboy Bebop - Dirty, Gritty, kind of like Samurai Champloo but in space with guns.

Clannad and Clannad After Story - From the "Slice of Life" genre. Its a RomCom(romantic comedy) in season 1 (Clannad) that turns into a very serious show in season 2 (After Story). Be warned, Season 2 *will* make you tear up. SUPER Sad but SUPER worth it.

Full Metal Alchemist - Follows the story of the Elrich brothers as they attempt to atone for past sins. The concept of alchemy is somewhat supernatural, but if you enjoyed Death Note then I know you aren't afraid to get into supernatural stuff. Really a must-watch anime.

Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood - A reboot of the original FMA. This one changes up the story quite a lot and is even better than the original.

Neon Genesis Evangelion - A dark anime that focuses on a main character who obviously has some anxiety issues. Its a mecha-type anime meaning it features large robot-like stuff fighting (Think Pacific Rim if you don't know what mecha is).

Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - In the future people get rid of their bodies for prosthetics because they are stronger and less prone to harm. This can cause issues when trying to tell the difference between man and machine.

-------------------------------------------

Other than those here's a few suggestions from different genres:

**ROMANCE:**

Spice and Wolf Seasons 1 and 2 - A very slow paced romance that focuses on a traveling merchant and his wolf-goddess companion Holo. Not for everyone, but was very well done IMO.

Yosuga No Sora - DEFINITELY not an anime for everyone. If you're a very open minded person there is a high chance you'll enjoy it, but it features themes that aren't exactly acceptable in today's society. Nontheless I feel it was very well done and enjoyed it quite a lot. [Spoiler Alert](#s "Features Incest, approach with caution")

**DRAMA**

Angel Beats! - Hard to summarize this one without spoilers, but it's basically the best thing you'll ever watch. Starts slow, gets much more fast paced. Episode 7 of Angel Beats was one of the only times I've ever cried during an anime.

Kokoro Connect - KC is on the top of my list right now because of its INSANE character development. Seriously if you aren't careful you'll get very attached to the 5 main characters in this show. A group of friends form an after-school club but soon begin experiencing supernatural problems. Starts off silly, gets very dark in some places.

Kanon (2006) - Super good SoL anime with very strong character development. It's not for everyone but I encourage you to give it a shot.

**ACTION:**

Bleach - One of the "big three" shonen anime. Focuses on spiritual beings called Shinigami that work to cleanse the world of Hollows (big evil dudes). Really nice action sequences. 

Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden - Somewhat childish, kind of a kids show but still very good. The second of the "big three" shonen anime. Starts off hard to watch IMO, but can hook you if you get into it.

Needless - If you enjoy Bleach's fight scenes you'll enjoy Needless's fight scenes. The shows are very similar.

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagan - I cant even describe this one. I've only seen a few episodes myself but so far it's been wonderful with some pretty over-the-top fight scenes that sometimes don't make much sense.

Inuyasha - A girl falls down a well and finds herself in feudal japan, but with demons and magic and stuff. This anime is SUPER long (something like 300 episodes) and was one of the first anime's I ever watched. Really nice fight scenes and an AWESOME romance throughout the entire thing.

**HORROR AND/OR SUSPENSE:**

Felt the need to group these two genres as almost all horror anime is also suspense.

Psycho Pass - In the future you can be labeled a "Latent criminal" just for having criminal thoughts. What happens when the system is broken?

Ergo Proxy - Very similar to Death Note. Takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where people are confined to live in the domed City of Romdo. Touches on parts of the human psyche as well as some philosophical mumbo jumbo.

Steins;Gate - I'm hesitant to place this here as I haven't actually seen it myself but it's one of the most popular animes at the moment. I'll be starting this one once I finish re-watching Champloo and Angel Beats!.
>> ARTICLE
what were your friends watching? :)
>> ARTICLE
If you're into like war and strategy watch Kingdom its very mature too it has shonen vibes but its alot of kill so its fades in comparison (Not that I think that you know what generic shonen is like but yeah you'll see)
>> ARTICLE
Watch Clannad and if you dont like that I suggest watching the current anime being released/that has been released right now. For example, Tokyo Ghoul, Zankyou No terror or Akame Ga Kill. Plus check out Sword Art Online. It gets a little cliche at parts but the first 13 episodes are fantasic and then... well the writer fucked it up but its still good, worth the watch. Have fun!
>> ARTICLE
Know how you feel, felt the same way after watching Attack on Titan which  broke me into anime after ridiculing it for so long.
>> ARTICLE
No, you were right to make fun of us. I still make fun of us.

90% of anime is pure cliche/perverted trash. Just like a large percentage of western television.

Since you dug Champloo, look for Cowboy Bebop, Zankyou no Terror and Kids on the Slope. All are by the same director and are more 'adult' stories. Bebop is jazzy sci-fi opera noir. Zankyou is a thriller, and Kids on the Slope is a drama.
>> ARTICLE
Mirai Nikki, Ninja Scroll, Paprika, Welcome To The NHK, Code Geass
>> ARTICLE
Watch MONSTER and Baccano!, Op. If you were blown away by Death Note, youll probably die of Exitement when youre watching those two Masterpieces
>> ARTICLE
Since you mentioned Samurai Champloo, watch Cowboy Bebop.
>> ARTICLE
lol you hav a whole new life a head of you now!

good luck with fanbases

Death note's ending broke how good the story was.
>> ARTICLE
If u like details, check /r/patchuu that's art to its finest. 
>> ARTICLE
I strongly recommend Code Geass, Attack on Titan, Ghost Hunt, and When They Cry (or as it's called in English translation from Japanese, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni)

Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion/Revolution is a mecha genre anime, the main character (MC for short) Lelouch I'm certain you'll immediately find strongly resembles Light Yagami from Death Note in terms of the dramatically psychotic & intelligent personality. You'll love Code Geass if you loved Death Note.

Attack on Titan is still fairly new and they're working on the second season right now, the main character Erin and his adopted sister Mikasa basically kill giant humanoid monsters that have plagued human civilization for 100 years, safe behind a giant wall around their settlement at first till it's destroyed one day, it fast-forwards a couple years till Erin is old enough to enlist into the military to combat the giant humanoid monsters and in the most badass way possible.

Ghost Hunt is just a very well written story about modern investigations of the paranormal (kinda like Ghost Hunters TAPS except with a few religious & paranormal powers to fight off evil entities).

When They Cry is the greatest psychological thriller I've ever seen in anime thus far. Prepare for total mind fucks when watching this and be very, VERY patient with it, at first like me and everyone else who's watched it you'll just be sitting there saying "WTF? Why is it playing the first episode I've already watched?", pretty much (without spoilers) it goes through cycles of life where SOMEthing is always different from the last cycle. For instance, the first cycle you'll notice one person died, in the next cycle that person is alive but someone else died. It continues doing this until near the end where it starts to make sense what kind of paradox time loop is actually happening. Be careful with this one as well, it does have a few graphic details, violence, and some disturbing and disgusting themes in a few spots here and there but it's part of the story.

Anyways I hope that you take at least one into consideration, they're all amazing and definitely worth the watch. The entertainment value on these you'll find and I'm sure everyone can agree with me when I say this, they will have you watching them over and over because they're just that good.

Happy watching! :)

edit: Also, if you're into sexy harems, I would recommend giving Girls Bravo and Shuffle a little peak. xD
>> ARTICLE
a lot of people tease anime watchers, if you didn't bully someone (bully and tease are really different) we can forgive you :D welcome to the community :3 knowing that more people are giving anime a chance and liking makes me happy
>> ARTICLE
I gave up on Champloo.

If you like full length movies, they cover more ground since they don't have to spread out a story over 4 hours minumum, give The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, or Princess Mononoke a try.

If you prefer series,

Darker than Black
Freezing
Gunslinger girls
Eden of the East
Chobits 
>> ARTICLE
Now watch NGE and your transformation will be complete. 
>> ARTICLE
BERSERK series, not the movies - now.
>> ARTICLE
I would recommend you to try out Naruto with Japanese audio and English subtitles, because I think the English version makes Naruto look incredibly retarded saying "believe it" 100 times per episode, which i don't think he says at all judging from the english subs. And you may also see a lot of hate towards the anime, but the reason for it is because people that have caught up to the anime are excited for the new episode, but sometimes almost nothing happens in that episode so that things can get dragged on, but when you have around 600 episodes to watch trust me, you'll like it, it's much more mature then the American/western versions. My friend was like you, he use to mock me for watching anime, but he started watching Naruto the Japanese version, and one day he came up to me talking like a complete fanboy of the show saying it's very different then the TV version and he really liked it.
>> ARTICLE
You are me from four years ago OP. 

Also my brother from two years ago. 

We all started somewhere. 

Welcome. 

Edit: watch Gurren Lagann 
>> ARTICLE
Next up for you to watch is Code Geass, Full Metal Alchemist, and Full Metal Alchemist: brotherhood. 
>> ARTICLE
There are lots of people who think like you used to, that anime is crap and just for children.. But then they'll go home and watch Frozen for the seventh time.

Welcome to the fold. 
>> ARTICLE
Lol I got hooked up by watching naruto and one piece
>> ARTICLE
Watch ghost in the shell to blow your mind. Watch clannad to flense your soul and then feed it to the neighbours cat.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like you have to watch a lot of other anime before you can truly feel it's worth, but at some point you have to watch HunterxHunter. I think a lot of people can agree that it is the best shounen an it's one of my favorites probably in my top 3. It's exactly how you describe death note as being unique and better than most American tv. The chimera ant arc is really one of the best stories.
>> ARTICLE
Be forewarned, some anime is downright horrible and if that's the case, the manga might be 10x better.

Dude, watch FLCL. It's amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
> cheesy kids shows and **fan service**

To be fair, that's still a lot of the content.
>> ARTICLE
If you thought Death Note was good for the mind games, then Monster would blow your mind.

And if you liked Samurai Champloo, then I would also recommend other shows similar to it, like Cowboy Bebop (by the same writer/director), and one that seems to get forgotten about, Michiko & Hatchin (not by the same person at all, but very similar in style and attitude, with a similarly great soundtrack).

Also, considering the shows you're currently into, I would also highly recommend Black Lagoon. It's a series that can almost be anything you want it to be; mindless action and violence, or deep existential introspection, and it does either effectively.

At the time I got into anime (a looong time ago) you almost couldn't go wrong with a series featuring a Yoko Kanno soundtrack. I started to tell you to just pick any series with a Kanno soundtrack and enjoy, but I wouldn't want you to accidentally step into Brian Powerd or Aquarion. But a lot of really, really strong series have soundtracks composed by her:

* Macross Plus
* Please Save My Earth
* The Visiion of Escaflowne
* Cowboy Bebop
* Macross Frontier
* Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex
* Kids on the Slope

and others I can't think of right now or haven't watched to have an opinion on. Put them on your list of stuff to check out.
>> ARTICLE
the quality of death note diminishes kinda laughably after like 10-13 episodes. you should watch hunter x hunter and psycho-pass. both some kick ass shows.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to hear you've come around! I would recommend Knights of Sidona, Cowboy BeBop,  Soul Eater, and if you're feeling adventurous and really want a heavy dose of "Japanese wtf" Excel Saga. Happy Watching! 
>> ARTICLE
Don't even know if you'll see this because of all the other comments, but welcome to the club :D
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I was the same way until my friend told me to start watching them.
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of anime that are for children or full of fanservice. But like live action television, there's amazing shoes that stand out from the rest of the crap. A lot of anime that got dubbed in the US like FLCL and Cowboy Bebop are  worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
On a side note, one of the few western cartoons I find amazing right now is Avatar: The Legend of Korra. Hell, even The Last Airbender was pretty damn good (although it seems that Korra is a little more mature).  
As far as anime goes:  
FMA: Brotherhood, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Beebop (yeah, they were on Adult Swim in America, and for good reason).
>> ARTICLE
Hey, if we are talking about western cartoons, Stephen Universe and Gravity Falls have been doing some things right.

Possible Instructions for getting significant other to watch anime:

My wife thought the same thing, essentially (anime was just weird kids shows, and she REALLY didn't like subtitles). I let it go for a long time...until I watched Steins;Gate. It actually has a pretty good english dub, so I MADE her watch it.  Her: "Where is this going?"; "I don't get it." Me: "SHUT UP; KEEP WATCHING."    Finally, and if you've seen it...you KNOW what episode eventually happened. Her: "Oh, I get it."  

Then she binge watched Sword Art Online on Netflix, got hooked enough to keep watching the new, subtitle-only eps. Now she can watch subtitled anime--and now is watching Death Note.

I think it's maybe important to have them step in with something that isn't too much culture shock and has a great story, maybe a great dub. Don't start with, oh, say, Kill La Kill. 

(Edit: I actually liked Kill La Kill--kinda. But lets be honest, it is what it is and we wouldn't die without it)
>> ARTICLE
I was pretty similar. In high school, I judged the anime kids pretty hard (in my defense they were pretty much otakus), but the summer after I graduated I was bored and decided to give it a shot. Attack on Titan hooked me and I ended up binge watching all the episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, OP? Now that you've given anime a chance and started off with some good selections, Your redeeming homework is to watch shows such as Cowboy Bebop, Black Lagoon and Ghost in the Shell.
>> ARTICLE
I was liked that too, but I think it's justified against stubborn weeabooism. All of my friend's sceensavers were just wallpapers of anime girls, in varying degrees of SFW-AlmostNSFW, so I would repeatedly tease him for it which of course led to me being prejudiced against anime. Until I watched Death Note.

The power of anime holds no bounds.

There's good and bad anime, just like there is with anything in any medium. Seek out the good, laugh at the bad!

Hey man, I was the same way. I would be like "I don't really like anime, but I've been watching this one show..". I would quickly realize in my head, oh wait, I think I love anime. I loved Dragonball, DBZ, and DBGT as a kid. Never really gave anything else a chance until a couple years ago. Cowboy Bebop, Champloo, Attack on Titan, Space Dandy, Hellsing Ultimate. Some of my favorite shows, amazing shows, that I blew threw and love. There also great anime movies out there like Red Line, Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away. All worth a watch. So much good, well written, and beautifully created anime out there.

Heh ... the head chef at the sushi place that I sometimes go to and I will occasionally chat about japanese media, specifically anime.  He finds the concept that Americans embrace being otaku and that it's not really stigmatized like in Japan to be strange.  He's still of the "anime = pokemon | porn" mindset.  When I tried to explain Mushishi to him, he couldn't get past the literal definition of mushi, and between my weak Japanese and his only slightly better English, I had a hell of a time explaining the concept to him.  Tried to get him to watch it, but he wouldn't go for it at all until I showed him the trailer for the live action.  Haven't been back since then, so don't know if he ever watched it.

Mushishi had a second season recently and a third soon from what I heard.

Welcome to the club, brah. If you got so pumped by Note and Champloo (they're good), your mind is gonna get blown all over the place with all the stuff you've yet to see.

I would personally recomend Black Lagoon (pure action, full of badass characters), and Psycho Pass (good sci-fi, second season is coming).
>> ARTICLE
I have one word for you- seinen anime.  There's a lot of good stuff out there.

For similar awesomeness, check out Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Haibane Renmei, Kino's Journey, the Higurashi series, etc.

>> ARTICLE
watch eva you fucking plebian
>> ARTICLE
There's nothing to apologize for.  You gave it a chance and now realize its good.  There's always something in anime that hits on the genre or subject you like.  Because anime isn't a single genre.  Its a type of animation made in Japan.  You can even arghue Korean and Chinese animation fit under the same category.  So basically, any genre you like in western live action can also be found in anime.  And a few original genres not found in the west.

Now if only about 1 billion other people in the western world gave anime a chance like you did, they'd understand why most of Asia loves anime so much.
>> ARTICLE
Doood, that baseball episode was absolutely hilarious!
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass, if you liked Death Note. Death Note is one of my Favorites too.

Also give comedy animes a try, for years I stuck to typical action seinen, but I broadened my horizons and ended up with a whole new slue of anime to watch. In the comedy genre I suggest, Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple, Rosario + Vampire, Kill la Kill, among others. (These definitely have action in them too. 

For stuff you should just try, Sword art Online, Attack on Titan, Elven Lied, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, High School of the Dead, Trigun, and Cowboy Bebop.

If you start with a few of those you will be hooked and then you can branch out on your own depending on what you liked there, believe me you tastes will change over the years too.

P.s. Everyone has their guilty pleasure anime too, like Bleach, Fairy tail, Hunter x Hunter, Yu Yu Hakusho Soul Eater, to name a few of mine. Don't look down on people just because they watch some mainstream stuff. Try a variety of stuff and see what you like.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop next. If you lived Samurai Champloo, it's a must. 
>> ARTICLE
Let the binge begin! Same deal happened for a good buddy of mine. I transferred 10 of my top anime series to watch and he cleared it all in under 2 weeks. So beware.. You're hooked now.. The binge is real..
>> ARTICLE
Heroic Age and Knights of Sedona are badass!
>> ARTICLE
You need to watch Cowboy Bebop, ASAP. 

Then Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. (If you're unaware: the one with "princess" in the name is ten times as badass.)

Then Akira. 

From there, probably Ghost In The Shell - first the movies, then the show. It's always one part brilliant action sequences, two parts talking, and one part cyberpunk mindfuck. For music's sake alone I would recommend the *first* Hellsing adaptation. Ditto for Trigun. Also anything with Yoko Kanno as a composer is guaranteed to sound amazing. 

edit: oh shit, Dennou Coil.
>> ARTICLE
Watch Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood and Fate/Zero (Fate/stay UBW is just starting as well and looks amazing!)

Zankyou no Terror and Tokyo Ghoul have also been awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Watch Code Geass and Clannad :D
>> ARTICLE
if you liked death note you should check out Code Geass, it's REALLY good. it isn't as much of a psychological thriller as death note is however the main character is very similar ( a genius who gets a supernatural power and tries to change the world for, what they think is, the better, through *maybe* evil methods.) you also get some awesome mech fights and probably the best ending in any anime **EVER** 

TL;DR. you should try Code Geass, it's really good        
>> ARTICLE
You should try guren laggan and Kill la Kill
>> ARTICLE
Definitely check out the works from Studio Ghibli 
>> ARTICLE
Saved for later readings.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone's listing series so I'm gonna recommend you check out Studio Ghibli movies- especially the ones directed by Hayao Miyazaki, like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. They're classics in the anime world, and although geared towards children are beloved by all ages. 

If you wanna be depressed watch Grave of the Fireflies-it's sad as shit.

Also, I'm not really sure if people talk about this on the anime sub but there's an American show done in an anime style called 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' and a second series currently in its fourth season called 'The Legend of Korra'. Once again these are geared towards children but have fans of all ages. Anywho, both are fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
I notice that no one has mentioned Hellsing, which I thought was pretty cool.

Also while it's not strictly anime in that it's not Japanese, the Avatar series are really good too.
>> ARTICLE
I did the exact same thing as far as making fun of my friends and whatnot, then one night while we were all chilling they threw Mirai Nikki up on the Projector and started it. I didn't think I would find it interesting at all, but I was hooked after the first few episodes.

Since then I've watched 4 or 5 other anime(s?) and I've since gotten a  few other people into it.

 It's really entertaining when others make fun of it because I was in their shoes just a few months ago and know firsthand that they couldn't be more wrong about it if they tried.

Try BERSERK  it's older animation, but the story blew me away~ 
>> ARTICLE
One of us, One of us...
>> ARTICLE
Check out Attack on Titan (from the director of Death Note),  and definetly Psycho-Pass!
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly what I said after watching my first anime! I can recomend cowboy bebop if u liked samurai champloo, and also helsing 
>> ARTICLE
I used to dislike Anime too. It's weird really, when my friends recommended me to Anime for the first time, I couldn't stand it. I hated the Japanese voices and how every girl felt like they were moaning.

Years later, I decided to give Anime another shot. Instead of watching subs, I watched dubs. I got hooked, but people usually frown on me when I say I watch dub.

Anyways, a year later, I watched almost all Animes that were dubbed and just couldn't wait for the dub versions. Now I watch sub...

Interesting how things turn out.
>> ARTICLE
yay! another convert!  I too stayed away from it for a much longer time than I should, not because I equated animation with kids stuff but because most of the anime watchers I knew were all socially weird like really on the extreme side.  But I finally broke down, the call was just to strong!  I'm glad you gave it a chance too!
>> ARTICLE
As somone who also got into anime after watching Death Note few years ago.There is tons of great animes out there but if you want something similair as DN i definetly reccomend Code Geass!
>> ARTICLE
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. You ain't seen nothing until you've seen this.

OP, take a look at my hummingbird (in flair). You'll find a considerable number of high quality anime in it.
>> ARTICLE
I really dig Rosario + Vampire
>> ARTICLE
> The story telling is definitely unique compared to the typical American crap that's over done and predictable

Slow down there. You will soon notice how even many anime are crap and predictable. There are just so many that come out every season that most of the time you will find 1 or 2 good ones every season.
>> ARTICLE
Check out kyousou giga (TV) 
Idk what tv stands for in this case but without it you would be watching a different anime i think  .( there are if im correct 3 animes under this name )
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop is a must as a series also enjoyed Basilisk...mainly for the badass characters.  Sword of the Stranger, Memories (specifically episode 2), Vampire Hunter D,  Ghost in the Shell (series and films), Ninja Scroll, Blood:The Last Vampire.

>> ARTICLE
Genocyber. No. I'm joking, don't watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
Give Outlaw Star a shot too.


Really fucking fantastic, it never gets the love it needs.



Also obligated to plug One Piece as it's by far my favorite anime/manga series. It's fucking *long* and a bit of a slow start but the characters and world building are phenomenal.
>> ARTICLE
Even though you used to look down on anime, most of us are jealous now that you get to experience the anime we love for the first time. We won't ever get to see those series for the first time again.
I hope you have a list all lined up. You're in for a treat.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if anyone has suggested ghost in the shell. I found it to also be very well written. Plus I has one of the best anime composers of all time in my opinion Yoko Kanno
>> ARTICLE
Watch Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, you watched death note first! Code geass is very similar (though a bit heavy on fan service at times), and is my all time favorite anime. Have fun on your anime spree!
>> ARTICLE
I watched ~150 and now I understand why people hate us, or rather, the annoying online animufag kinds at least.

Anime is good, but the faggotry it breeds in the fandom is horrible. Now if you disagree with me it would mean that you don't care about anime but only about the circlejerking.
>> ARTICLE
I used to be the same way. Always giving one of my good friends a lot of crap for reading Naruto manga during reading time in class back in middle school. Then she showed me Code Geass in high school and I was hooked.

We now go to anime conventions on the west coast, not as much as we did back in high school but we still hit AX. Also without her, I would have never met my boyfriend of 6 years who's also into anime lol
>> ARTICLE
This thread gave me some great new anime to watch. Thanks OP and redditors.

Unfortunately you really have to dig through a lot of mediocrity to find the really good stuff. But it is there. You just have to find the type of stuff you like and follow similar suggestions. 
>> ARTICLE
You got a lot of catching up to do...
>> ARTICLE
Can I recommend Code Geass? It has a very similar main character in how clever they are, and it is highly entertaining. Very clever writing as well, I recently finished it myself.
>> ARTICLE
I'd imagine quite a lot of us are on the same boat but we were just stupid kids who didn't know any better. I bullied a couple of people really badly for watching and here I am 8 years later lost in 3 different shows.
>> ARTICLE
Most kids in America grew up watching Toonami  whether they want to admit it or not. I've known plenty people who grew out of it though. Luckily I wasn't one of them.
>> ARTICLE
the way I see it, some (most) anime isnt very good the same way most cartoons from anywhere arnt very good, but taking cartoons from two cultures lets me pick from the cream of the crop.
>> ARTICLE
The movie Spirited Away is a must see. It's an eye opener and a great gateway movie.
>> ARTICLE
You should go ask /r/onepiece why you should watch One Piece
>> ARTICLE
stark differences between death note/samurai champloo, and mushi shi, try something thats sorta closer to the other two you watched, try attack on titan..brah
>> ARTICLE
Mushi-shi, in my opinion, is much worse than SC or DN. Those both have great stories that evolve over time, but mushi-shi is pretty much the same story over and over, like Hell Girl.

I would recommend some more classics like Trigun, Dragon Ball, Outlaw Star, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and maybe a few newer ones like Soul Eater, SAO, Attack on Titan, and Gurren Lagen (I didn't like GL, but everyone else on the planet seems to love it).

If you love the smart story in Death Note, watch Ghost in the Shell
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit! Someone that hasn't seen all the best anime out there!!!


Watch:


- FLCL

- Code Geass

* Full Metal Alchemist

* Tengen Toppa Gurrenn Lagann

* Log Horizon



I'm sure others will add recommendations.
>> ARTICLE
People recommending FLCL need to understand that not everybody knows what FLCL stands for, let's not be lazy, you took the time to write out Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, I don't see you abreviating that to be TTGL.

FLCL stands for Fooly Cooly, and it's among other anime that are the bottom of the barrel as it's very retarded and nobody should be recommended to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Watch Ghost in the Shell... right freakin now. It's deep, but it's the greatest anime ever imho.
>> ARTICLE
There are some great anime out there but at the same time the fans can be pretty awful lol
>> ARTICLE
So I'll list 3 great series.

**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012)**

**One Piece**

**Space Brothers**

I suggest you watch them.
>> ARTICLE
There's actually some pretty good American crap that's out there.
>> ARTICLE
Try Code Geass, i personally prefer it to death note, but oppinions differ on that issue :)
>> ARTICLE
I love both :D
>> ARTICLE
just don't watch Macross Frontier,  not ready for that roller coaster. No but really watch Macross Frontier. 
>> ARTICLE
And you should need to apologize!  
I didn't really care about anime but I heard about death note from a youtuber and the name sounded so damn cool, so I watched it, now it's one   of my favorite anime :D 
>> ARTICLE
Watch fullmetal alchemist brotherhood, steins;gate and/or gurren lagann as soon as possible.
>> ARTICLE
> and fan service 

this one is sadly over the top true. Yes there are some very good that manage without fanservice, but most the time... let's just say the last season had a really good anime where the producers thought it would be nice to introduce an 11 year old girl with a panty shot... But god dammit, NGNL season 2 or riot!
>> ARTICLE
As I've told countless anime neophytes before, I have a giant list of anime. Some are great, most are meh, some are terrible, and some should have never been made. Want it? It's like russian roulette, but instead of missing brains as the prize, it's missing time.
>> ARTICLE
Wait til you watch the rest of the good stuff....
>> ARTICLE
I realize you're getting an insane amount of recs, and probably now have a thousand things to watch, but I thought I'd mention a few more obscure shows or those that aren't getting rec'd.

Seirei no Moribito - this is one of those shows that I feel could be shown to almost anyone, regardless of any prior experience with anime. It's a phenomenally well-paced, well-animated fantasy show with no fanservice, revolving around a female bodyguard who must protect a child prince from assassination after he is possessed by a water fiend. I don't have enough praise for this show.


Ouran High School Host Club - Now this one's a classic. To warn you, though, it's a reverse harem (one girl surrounded by attractive guys) shoujo (targeted at girls) romance anime. So if you absolutely can't stand romance or anything like that, it's not for you. But I'd encourage you to be open-minded and watch a few episodes. It's funny and most of the guys get quite a bit of character development by the end. 

Uchouten Kazoku ("The Eccentric Family") - This one's pretty obscure. It's an anime about a family of tanuki (creatures of Japanese folklore,  mischievous shape-shifting "raccoon-dogs") and their misadventures, as well as a plot around the mysteries of their father's death. It's everything a slice of life anime with a side of plot should be; I just ask you to please not judge the first episode as it is, in my opinion, the worst episode. It has the most fanservice anyway.

Natsume Yuujinchou (Natsume's Book of Friends) - And here's another classic. It's often compared to Mushishi, though at their core they are two very different anime. It's about a boy named Natsume who can see youkai (Japanese folkloric "spirits" of many different types) but was isolated from a young age due to this. When he's in high school he finds out about the Book of Friends, an item passed down from his late grandmother who could also see youkai. Natsume decides to return the names to the youkai in the book. A peaceful, introspective episodic series. 

Princess Jellyfish - This is a hilarious show that deals with some common issues in Japanese society such as otakus, but I don't think it's hard to understand for someone without much knowledge of anime. It's a bit hard to sum this one up, but it's basically about a group of otaku women with very different obsessions who live together in a womens-only apartment building. They don't have jobs, can't even talk to normal people, and generally live a secluded life with only their obsessions. This all changes when the youngest of the group, a jellyfish otaku, meets a stylish "princess"... Don't be fooled by the title as the show really isn't too girly. It's also got an amazing English dub that I would highly recommend, and it's one of the funniest anime I've watched. Speaking of funny anime...

Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun ("Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun") - this is also one of the funniest anime I've watched. It might require a bit of knowledge of manga to enjoy thoroughly, I suppose, but since you have such a long watchlist already I'm sure you'll pick up enough by the time you get around to this one. It's something of a parody of the shoujo genre, which are romance manga targeted at girl's and tend to be very samey romances. The anime itself is about a girl who has a crush on a guy who turns out to be a shoujo manga author, and when she confesses to him he misunderstands her to be a fan of his. Despite the misunderstanding, she gets to know him and his circle of friends/assistants, and shenanigans ensue. This has lots of over the top humor, but it works. So. Well. It's also a really new series with a high possibility of a second season!

Zankyou no Terror ("Terror in Resonance") - I mention this one largely due to your enthusiasm over Death Note, as it's somewhat of a controversial show. It's about two mysterious boys who also happen to be the terrorists "Sphinx" wanted by the police for terrorist attacks around Tokyo. However, somehow no one has ever died in a Sphinx terrorist act. A lot of people think this show turned into crap about halfway through, but people think that of Death Note too, so eh. If nothing else, it's amazingly animated.

Isshuukan Friends ("One Week Friends") - One of the cutest anime I've ever seen, One Week Friends is about a girl with a very specific kind of amnesia - her memory of those who become her friends is wiped every week. It's some sort of hybrid between romance and friendship, and I applaud this show for having realistic character conflict that doesn't slip into melodrama or cliche. No fanservice either. Just a really good little show. 

Haikyuu!! - This is a sports anime. Sports anime are a subgenre of anime which focus around a team, usually of high schoolers, playing a specific sport. Haikyuu!! is about a volleyball team. There's not too much else to say here, other than that I consider this to be a very good example of a sports anime, and that I recommend you watch it even if you don't like sports - I hate sports, and I like a good sports anime every now and then. Haikyuu!! is also exceptional for being very funny, having a bit of its own style, and being well-animated. It also has no fanservice. Really, you should check this out just to see if you might like sports anime. 

Log Horizon - the players of an MMORPG called Log Horizon are transported to the world of the game and they must find ways to live in their new world. This is a very interesting one because, although anime with the "trapped in an MMO" premise have been done a couple times before, Log Horizon is the only one to ever in this way. The characters' goal is not to find a way out, since none has been presented to them, but to learn how the game has changed since it was merely a game, and how they can live there. It's not an action-heavy series, but a political one, with lots of scheming and clever plans courtesy of the genius main character. Since you liked Death Note, I think you like that sort of thing.

Durarara!! - I saw this one mentioned a few times but not enough in my opinion. Durarara!! is a fantastic story that is woven between the narratives of many prominent denizens of Ikebukuro, and the mysterious headless (motorbike) rider that roams the streets. A great example of urban fantasy, with humor, plot twists, some of the most interesting characters in anime, and more. It has a really great English dub and after years of waiting, it's getting a sequel in January!

Tsuritama - this is a very obscure anime, and it should introduce you to the thought "Japan makes some really freaking weird stuff." Specificalky, weird comedies. Tsuritama is about a boy who had no friends because of his severe social anxiety, until one day his life is invaded by another boy claiming to be from outer space, that adamantly demands they learn how to fish. It's really hilarious in the first half, and then becomes more serious as the plot kicks into overdrive (but still with sone comic relief thrown in ). I know it sounds weird, and it is, but it's a really underrated anime.

I think that's it from me. I could probably go on, but I don't want to spend the whole day on this one post. I heavily second the people recommending Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Steins;gate, Fate/Zero, Baccano, AnoHana, and Soul Eater; they're great anime that every anime fan should see at least once.
>> ARTICLE
I reccomemd School Days, though most of the episodes aren't too good the ending is definitely worth it. Also, its best to watch this show without knowing anything. Make sure you tell others of it afterwards too
>> ARTICLE
Aw, dood...why ya' gonna sick School Days on the new kid so soon? At least let him get his bearings first...

Y'know, on second thought, why not? And we can sit him down to read the Elfen Lied manga afterwards. Might as well give him the complete experience.

Spice and Wolf

That is an almightily important show to go on your watchlist
>> ARTICLE
Just wait until you watch black lagoon
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure someone listed Cowboy Bebop and Trigun already. But try Gungrave the Anime. Very noir-esque and to the point and I betcha' you'll like the "villain" more than the protagonist-hero :)

It takes a big person to admit they were wrong about something. Well done :) Anime IS AWESOME!

Ghost In The Shell /with some self made tags/ (sci-fi)

Trigun (sci-fi, comedy)

Cowboy Bebop (sci-fi, comedy, drama)

Kenichi (comedy, martial arts)

Have fun! Oh, and welcome to the group... o_o
>> ARTICLE
alright ... well you need to pick up Code Geass.  50 episodes... a little long for some people but I promise it's worth it.  My personal fav is Gungrave but noone else seems to like it lol.  But Code Geass , please.
>> ARTICLE
never too late. Welcome to the Wonderful World of Anime. *hihi*
please, to have a more enjoyable and memorable watch, NEVER EVER read spoilers, avoid them at all cost and erase high expectations. Each anime has their own charm, comparisons are inevitable but, still... indulge in every episode of your chosen anime. If its not your cup of tea, don't just drop it like its hot, some are just slow paced but get better as they progress. :)
sit back, grab some food, and have a blast!
for first watch, go for the mainstreams, you could never go wrong. Of course they are popular because they're the best. then later on, go hunt for underrated gems, some of them are surprisingly amazing but, yeah, quite hard to find.
>> ARTICLE
You really should watch Baccano!, it's one of my all time favorite anime series (remember, there are sixteen episodes, not thirteen).  Watch it dubbed.  

I would also recommend for someone like you the recent Zankyou No Terror (Terror in Resonance), which aired this summer.  It's very short; it's only eleven episodes long.  Quite good.  It's a sort of action/suspense thriller.  

The obvious ones to watch are Cowboy Bebop (dubbed) and Fullmetal Alchemist.  Now, I prefer the original FMA to FMA Brotherhood, but probably most people will tell you to watch Brotherhood.  I'll let you decide, but...yeah.

Tatami Galaxy is a fun little show--again, quite short.  It may or may not be your thing, I'm not sure.  There is a lot of fast paced talking though, so if you're a slow reader it might not be for you--subtitles flash by as breakneck speed.

Now, Naoki Urasawa's Monster is an epic of an anime; it's really a masterpiece.  However, it's 74 episodes long.  That is quite a commitment to make to a show, so I can understand why one might be intimidated by it, or unable to spare the time.  It's a psychological thriller, exploring the nature of (pure) evil, and humanity's capacity to do to terrible things.  I will say that it starts off slowly, and many episodes can feel slow.  Don't let it put you off.  (Note, I watched it dubbed).

I would recommend Katanagatari, which is set in Feudal Japan and is about a swordless samarai and a strategian who go around Japan collecting swords (well, that's the premise, anyway).  If I remember correctly, it's twelve episodes long but each episode is 45 minutes long (it's been a while since I saw it).  I said I *would* recommend it, but there are several fan servicey moments with the main female lead (the strategian).  Many.  However, it's truly a great anime. Some of the characters' appearances are ridiculous (that is to say, all the ninjas are dressed in highly dubious costumes), but I was more amused by that than anything.  You may want to hold off on this one, though.

-

What are your thoughts on anime movies?  I'm sure you've seen Studio Ghibli (Miyazaki's) films before, as a kid (although if you haven't, you should go see all of them.  Spirited Away first).  

If you are interested in anime movies, I'd recommend Satoshi Kon's films.  Specifically Tokyo Godfathers and Paprika.  Tokyo Godfathers is about three homeless people who find an abandoned baby in a garbage heap, and set off to find her parents.  All three are complex and wonderful characters.  I loved them all.  It's also set during Christmas, so hey, Christmas movie.  

Paprika is said to be one of the inspirations for Inception, which I don't doubt. Basically, it's about...er...well, to quote the wiki, it's "about a research psychologist who uses a device that permits therapists to help patients by entering their dreams."  Sorry.  Bit of a cop-out, but it's hard for me to introduce it without giving too much away.  I will say that it delves into dreams and people's minds in ways that honestly were more creative and interesting than Inception, and I liked Inception.  

The animation for both movies is top notch, and the soundtracks are spot on.  Note: watch both in the original Japanese.  I don't know if Tokyo Godfathers was ever dubbed, but Paprika was and I stumbled across it on Youtube and my GOD stay away from it.  

So, yeah. Some suggestions.  I'd love to hear about your growing experiences with anime.  Keep me/Reddit updated.
>> ARTICLE
No on here has mentioned it yet so... Space Dandy, by the makers of Samurai Champloo. It's (usually) lighthearted and funny. Even when it's not funny, it's still entertaining.

It's kind of like a parody series. It takes common anime tropes and flips them on their heads. But at the same time, it also does things that I've never seen any other anime do.

And if you liked Death Note, you would LOVE Psycho-Pass.

Your problem is generalization. Anime is a medium, just like other T.V. shows and film. The medium shouldn't really be a factor in the overall quality of the piece. There's good anime and bad anime just like there are good and bad T.V. shows and movies. 

That being said, you picked a really good show to watch in Death Note just based off of plot alone. Depending on what your looking for, like visuals, soundtrack, plot, etc. there's a lot of good stuff out there. If you liked, Death Note, I would recommend you watch Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I wrote this exact thing, Samurai Champloo / Death Note were my two first anime, and remain my all time favourites.

My friend said to me: Just watch one episode if you don't like it, don't watch the rest and continue hating it. 

Watched them, loved them.
>> ARTICLE
I only started watching anime about a month ago. From what I've seen, it's more powerful than real-life TV. I'm not sure why, but the second-hand embarrassment I get from watching Watamote or the heart-pumping fear I get from Attack on Titan top anything else I've watched. Those are two (Very different, but) great anime as well, if you're interested. For the OP, I'd say give Watamote a miss.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Romance/Drama animes seem to have a lot more feels to them than normal ones too; I personally think the soundtrack plays a huge part in how you feel about an anime (Clannad for instance; incredible soundtrack that just makes the mood of the anime perfect)
>> ARTICLE
Has any one seen the live action of Kite yet? Is it any where as good as the original?
>> ARTICLE
Yea I used to be the same since my best friend would show me anime and one was this show where the girls were mermaids and the villian was a witch and I was like "wtf is this". She told me it was her second time watching it and I thought she was crazy. A couple years later, I watched Death Note and Attack on Titan and got really into anime. So I had to admit to her that anime was awesome and that I was wrong. I have to admit that I'm a beginner but I want to get more into anime and to connect with more people who do like anime so here I am on this subreddit. 
>> ARTICLE
And just think, there are shows that are vastly better than those two as well, IMO.
>> ARTICLE
Whats better in your opinion?
>> ARTICLE
I think plenty of suggestions have already been given, but...

Monster - I believe this to be a masterpiece, a work of art, and I wouldn't say that lightly. The quality of the characters and story are just on another level.

Toward the Terra (or Terra E) - This is kinda hard to find, but it is my favorite anime of all time. It really gets the feels going and truly has an epic feel to it.
>> ARTICLE
the openings i think usually lose people... imo, at least is why i didnt get into it by myself until friends said to watch it
>> ARTICLE
Haha! I can't tell you how many of my friends and family I've converted to the anime. Even my own husband. I would recommend Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate. Also, Attack on Titan was awesome! I'm an original Otaku and I still see new ones that blow my mind.

Welcome to the fold. There is more than meets the eye with anime. Do please see Railgun. You may be intensely entertained by it.

Hahaha same story here man.
Before holiday i told a friend anime is shit.
At my holiday i met a guy and he watched anime we watched some eps together and it was awesome!
After i got back i watched like 3 full series.

Two great ones to start with and Mushi Shi is an excellent next choice!

Here are some of my favorites to add to your queue...

Cowboy Bebop is canon.
Ghost in the Shell: SAC
Berserk (classic)
Attack on Titan
Full Metal Alchemist
Trigun
Vampire Hunter D

>> ARTICLE
Dude watch Neon Genesis : Evangelion 
Changed my life
>> ARTICLE
Some good sport shows are: Haikyuu, Baby Steps, Ping-Pong, Eyeshield 21, and Kuroko no Basuke. I recommend all of these and welcome to the anime community! 
>> ARTICLE
Now when you make fun of it, it's self-deprecating, not insulting!
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same way. And there are a few shows that are beautifully sad. Seriously I never thought a cartoon could give a grown man the feels the way it did. Here are a few good ones: Clannad, Angel Beats, , K-on, Little Busters, Air and, 5 Centimeters Per Second and Children who Chase lost Voices.

Starting to watch anime is a unique feeling, I know because I just started not TOO long ago.

And one piece bro<

> don't worry as a new anime fan it is normal to not feel inclined to watch the extremely popular anime yet but when you finally decide to watch(for me it was when I couldn't figure out what to watch next then decided to give Naruto a try and never looked back since) you really won't regret it. Tokyo Ghoul (subbed though) is pretty sick too but if you are new then you are watching dubs probably and don't do horrors until you've watched a recommended 15 series cos that stuff can be omgwtf why did that happen (wanna be more accurate but I coul scare you away newbie :D
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! ill check it out. I just finished Psycho-Pass and its a new favorite. There were way more suggestions than I thought there would be.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my gosh the same happened with me I used to think anime was just some stupid cheesy shit but JESUS WAS I WRONG
My friend finally pestered me enough and got me to watch noragami on Netflix and god was I hooked
Then I watched blue exorcist
The SAO
I'm currently watching death note
In my opinion SAO is horrible but the other two are amazing
>> ARTICLE
you know cartoons is completely different from anime
>> ARTICLE
I was the same xD, I just finished watching Parasyte (took me 2 days) and have started Sword Art Online. I used to make fun of my friends for watching it, but dam its sooooo gooood!
>> ARTICLE
cowboy bebop. that's all.
>> ARTICLE
Have fun watching Steins;Gate when you get around to it. Oh, and Garden Lagann. Such amazing anime.
>> ARTICLE
I never believe these stories
>> ARTICLE
One of us 
>> ARTICLE
Watch Gurren Lagann if you're into manly stuff. 

Watch boku no pico if you're into man stuff. 
>> ARTICLE
anime's great but it's ridiculously oversaturated, you'll be having the time of your life marathonning all these 10/10 shows and then all of a sudden start wondering what the fuck is this theres nothing left but cookie-cutter slice of life animes
>> ARTICLE
That's where I feel like I am now :\
>> ARTICLE
If you liked Champloo, watch Cowboy Bebop.  Its a classic and imo the GOAT
>> ARTICLE
Just as long as you don't start thinking that SAO is the best anime ever.
Then you are too far gone in the realms of shitty anime

Apology not accepted. You were an asshole for no reason, learn to live with it.

You're still a dick
>> ARTICLE
Thanks mate. I'm really happy to hear you say that!

Your welcome dick
>> ARTICLE
Apologize if you want, but you're still a dick. It's obviously unkind d and unreasonable to make fun of someone for what they are into...everyone is different and *the way you do shit isn't the only correct way*. Your apology is meaningless unless you correct the behavior as a whole.
Well, it is not completely meaningless, it's good of you to at least acknowledge that it was a bad thing to do, but only when you found that you were also a douche that likes it...? That's not so hot.

Watch Boku No Pico.

I used to laugh at the fat chick wearing the naruto jump suit and headband to school and I even watched some early naruto stuff. I didn't do it to her face or anything at least. I think my case and yours is maybe a little different though.

You're a jerk.

eh? someone wears naruto clothes to school they are asking to for ridicule, at least I didn't do it to her face.

It's cool.  I know a lot of people who were(still may be) like you who think that Anime is "just for kids" and that live action "means so much more." These were the words of someone I spoke with who I wasn't able to convince otherwise, but I'm glad you actually sat down and gave it a chance.  I tried to explain that animation (not just japanese) allows the producers to have more power to create, control, and ultimately induce "the feels" that was intended whereas with live-action films or series, there may be more restrictions (shooting of location, poor acting, difficulty of finding the "perfect" actors), etc.  A bigger budget may help, but the beauty of anime is that the setting and the personalities of the characters can be created *exactly* as the creator intended.  
>> ARTICLE
u gotta watch Code Geass 
>> ARTICLE
Your penance is Boku no Pico.  Get to it.
>> ARTICLE
NO
>> ARTICLE
Definitely give Gurren Lagan a watch to you won't be disappointed. 
>> ARTICLE
Try out Cowboy Bebop and Darker Than Black.  Cowboy Bebop is a classic and is fairly realistic outside of the scifi elements.  Darker Than Black is a suspense espionage/action anime with some paranormal elements.  Both have pretty good plots and are appreciable by people who are turned off by tropes you see a lot in popular anime.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, cool. Thanks, I'll try those.
>> ARTICLE
Agree with both, and would also recommend giving Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex another try. Especially if the OP liked Death Note, since GitS blows it away in the intrigue department.
>> ARTICLE
It took a 2nd time for me to appreciate GitS as well.  After watching series after series where the writers make "intelligent" people do dumb things, GitS was like a light in the dark.  My first time through I thought it was slow and boring and didn't really appreciate the episodic nature (I was expecting a 26 episode continuous story).  Then the second time I realized there was considerable depth to the series and enjoyed it.

Anyways, some series I think are good and "normal", if I interpreted it correctly:

* Bakemonogatari
* Kara no Kyoukai
* Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood
* Ruroni Kenshin - Trust, Betrayal, Reflection

Also you can check out my 9's and 10's in my MAL profile and read the summaries to see if you would like any of them.

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously amazing movie. I totally back this.
>> ARTICLE
Planetes definitely fits the criteria of "not a typical anime plot."  It's a sci-fi series set in space that has more in common with western sci-fi shows like Firefly and Star Trek Deep Space 9 than any anime I've ever seen.  Despite being set in space, it's very hard sci-fi; the universe doesn't push the laws of physics beyond belief.  It's probably my favorite series; the characters all feel really genuine and three dimensional (even the "insignificant" supporting characters) and actually develop over the course of the story.  The characters feel very "ordinary;" the premise is that they're working as garbage collectors (in space), which adds very much to the realism of the characters.  The pacing is also quite good; things start rather slow (but interesting) and move along at a steady rate until toward the end when things magnify in intensity, both in terms of character development and events.

You would probably also like Eve no Jikan.  It's a 6-part OVA (roughly 90 minutes in length total).  It's a sci-fi story set in the near future where robots like those from Asimov's literature have become common appliances.  There's very little action, but it's very fun to watch and there are a lot of parts where it springs twists on you that force you to re-examine your thinking.  If you enjoy having your brain tickled, I highly recommend taking the time to watch it.

I must recommend Baccano.  It is not "normal," per se, but it definitely appeals to western audiences and it doesn't succumb to any common anime tropes.  [I've already written a summary for the reddit wiki](http://redditanime.wikia.com/wiki/Baccano!#Kuiper_Beltran) which tells you most of what you need to know.  The short version: if you are a Quentin Tarantino fan, you will *love* Baccano.

On a similar note, Spice and Wolf might interest you.  It doesn't have a specified real world setting, but the universe seems to be reminiscent of Europe circa 1500 AD, definitely not a typical anime setting.  It has fantasy elements (one of the central characters is a pagan wolf deity), but unlike a lot of fantasy series, it's not all about swords and sorcery.  Spice and Wolf's plot is largely centered on trade and economics (the main character is a merchant).  It's very unique and I enjoyed the story a lot.  Watching the series was kind of a learning experience for me, and not in the "this is educational" sense of the word learning (though there is some of that), but more in the "This is new...aha, I get it!" sense of learning.  I enjoyed it a lot.

Venturing out further into the world of "common anime tropes:" When you peel back the layers, Full Metal Panic is a super robot show, but it's presented in the style of a real robot show, making it pretty accessible to "non-anime" types like yourself.  If you're interested in the *idea* of a super robot show but find yourself unable to enjoy them, you might want to try out Full Metal Panic.
>> ARTICLE
Seconding Baccano!
>> ARTICLE
Monster was pretty "normal".
>> ARTICLE
Seconded, but Monster can be boring at times. It's also rather grim while Death Note was lively and had a very clever plot, while Monster is much more realistic.
>> ARTICLE
I recommend Welcome to the N.H.K. to everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Eden of the East, Baccano and Durarara-

Maybe even Senkou no Night Raid, Darker Than Black, Gunslinger Girl, and Samurai Champloo?
>> ARTICLE
I havent seen Night Raid yet, but I second the rest of this. Looks like what your looking for.
>> ARTICLE
Eden of the East is a great watch.
>> ARTICLE
I just wish I could get my hands on a subbed version of the 2nd movie :(
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think a lot of what anime has going for it is its ability to explore the imagination without much restriction.

Suggestions for more-or-less realistic things, off the top of my head:

* Crying Freeman (this becomes less realistic as it progresses)
* Flag
* Koi Kaze
* Michiko e Hatchin
* Planetes
* TO

Some movies:

* 5 Centimeters Per Second
* Grave of the Fireflies
* Robot Carnival (you might not like this one, but read about it on wikipedia or something)
* Tokyo Godfathers

I'm curious what you didn't like about Ghost in the Shell?
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the suggestions, I will definitely look into them. I saw several sites recommend the first two movies you mentioned as well, so I will try them out first.

To me Ghost in the Shell seemed like it had a lot of potential. I loved the idea of it being more than AI, and it having arisen in the mass of data and algorithms out there (even though I would still deem that AI). However, it seemed as though not much else happened or was explored. There were minor reflections on what it means to be human, and what makes us different from machines, etc. but I just felt as though it didn't take it anywhere. She searches for the Puppetmaster, finds him, and merges. After seeing it, it's hard for me to think of much else that went on.

I just need more things to happen. It would have been interesting if she had done more with her curiosity about being human. She could have secretly gone and had an operation to become entirely human, leaving her machine shell behind her, and then the Puppetmaster begins taking over everyone with machine bodies, and she is the only one who can stop him since she can't be hacked or something. Or instead of her merging with the Puppetmaster at the end she could have merged at the middle so we could see her undergo a huge transformation. I mean, she just merged her consciousness with a near God-like super AI. All that I see her do after she does so is walk out of a house in a little girl's body. It just wasn't that compelling for me...

I'm lost for words. Just... no.

What you're describing is cliche'd as hell and would have taken away from the story and the questions it raises. You seem to have missed everything that was implied.

> Or instead of her merging with the Puppetmaster at the end she could have merged at the middle so we could see her undergo a huge transformation.

On the other hand it could be that you just like shows to have tangible, as in shown on the screen, as opposed to implied conclusions...
>> ARTICLE
Just going to say, *Koi Kaze* is pretty much guaranteed to weird out most people watching it, regardless of where they're from. It's not a bad series by any means, but it is challenging and uncomfortable to watch because of the subject matter. It does not suffer from the kind of anime tropes you mentioned, though.


>> ARTICLE
I replied to his post before he editted in the requirement to not be weirded out. I do think it does a superb job of telling its particular story, but yes, if he doesn't want to be weirded out its probably not for him.
>> ARTICLE
What I liked about GitS was the ideas it tried to convey. The idea of merging your consciousness with another being - AI or not - is pretty interesting, I think. Like darkswarm said, however, the two seasons of the series are more like what you seem to want. The second movie, Innocence, is also more of that nature.

I also really liked the style of GitS. The presentation I found rather amazing and I wish I could find more movies and shows that did that.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like you've only watched the Ghost in the Shell movie. The TV series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex does a lot more of what you'd probably find interesting. There are episodes about the ethics of human-android relationships, an entire episode situated in a chat room where people try to trace the origin of a meme-like media phenomenon surrounding a particularly skilled hacker, and other really cool stuff. The political intrigue is also exceptionally well done. There are weak episodes here and there, but you should definitely give it a try. And there's a second season of it too (and possibly a third on the way) if you like it!

I'm also gonna sneak in here my standard recommendation of Haibane Renmei. I've had a relatively good amount of success using it to introduce friends to anime. It's a well-done drama that is thought-provoking and doesn't do a lot of outlandish things that you'd probably consider a typical "anime-like plot."
>> ARTICLE
>Koi Kaze

Seriously? I think you've acclimated a bit too much to Japanese cultural norms. This is good, but I wouldn't recommend it as "normal" for someone new to anime.

I posted this response before he edited his post indicating what he meant by normal.

Ah, fair enough.

Thanks.

>> ARTICLE
NHK ni Youkoso (Welcome to the NHK) is great.
>> ARTICLE
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, definitively (not sure if you mean you tried the movie or the series in your post, but the series is a lot more... engaging than the movies).
>> ARTICLE
Kaiji's about a normal guy that gets fucked over in life endlessly (and many times it's his own fault). That's a gross oversimplification of the plot, but I don't want to give away any spoilers. It's the most addicting thing I've ever watched and nothing about its style says "Japanese."

Welcome to the NHK's fairly "normal" in style and is about completely unexceptional people.

Monster is probably about as realistic as anime gets, although many people may find it "boring"; Legend of the Galactic Heroes would probably be its scifi counterpart, and I've yet to find anyone say anything negative about it.

RAINBOW's an ongoing series about prison life--rape and all.

These are just some of my **MAN**ime favorites.
>> ARTICLE
If you want **MAN**ime, there's nothing quite like *Gurren Lagann*.  Just saying.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I just started watching Kaiji and it's the closest thing to Death Note I've seen so far, good recommendation!
>> ARTICLE
Akagi and One Outs may also interest you.
>> ARTICLE
I second kaiji.  I didn't think I'd like it, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It has some plot elements that are slightly similar to death note, although it is a very different show.
>> ARTICLE
I second Legend of the Galactic Heroes (which I am currently watching), it has a fairly realistic style, and if you're into space opera/politics/etc., it's worth getting into. And if that is your thing, Crest/Banner of the Stars may be worth a look too (it's a personal favorite).
>> ARTICLE
The Melancholy of Har....just kidding, this will not be your show. Here are some anime that are more "soap opera" like but still very good (at least imho)

- Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien (Drama, School life, Romance)

- School Days (Drama, School life, Romance)

Black lagoon might be something for you if you enjoy John Woo movies and shootouts.

It might be helpful if you can give us a direction where this is going (Action, Drama etc)
>> ARTICLE
School Days is so not normal dude, and I mean by OP's definition of normal.
>> ARTICLE
Well....I mean it is not a standard anime plot. But I guess you are right.

Sorry

Great Teacher Onizuka is really good, try that one out. There is also a drama for it that is really good too.
>> ARTICLE
I think that GTO would suit this mans tastes...
>> ARTICLE
I second this one. I thoroughly enjoyed GTO.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass is similar to Death Note. Both main characters are trying to save their world and both are bestowed with some power. Code geass is HD and it is awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Ninja Scroll, Sword of the Stranger, Grave of the fireflies, Berserk, Princess Mononoke, howls flying caste, Paprika, Laputa, Nauiscaa: valley of the wind, Spirited Away, and Planetes.
>> ARTICLE
Seirei no Moribito is at the top of my list. It's kind of a period series about a female bodyguard protecting a young prince, and has less magical elements in it than Death Note. It's beautifully drawn, has great acting, and am awesome score you can listen to again and again. The little combat in it is choreographed very well, and always meaningful to the plot. I highly recommend it.

A similar (and excellent) anime movie with very few magical elements. Check it out.

Wolf's Rain is also a great choice.
>> ARTICLE
Nana is nice if you like that kind of thing.
Genshiken is also pretty "normal", i.e. about everyday life in an anime club.
>> ARTICLE
I liked Genshiken for the fact that it focuses on the development of the characters throughout school, and helps us understand ourselves a bit better. Definitely a more "normal" anime.
>> ARTICLE
You might be interested in browsing a site such as AniDB.net looking for certain categories of anime. I think that ["Daily Life"](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=lexicon&vtype=cat&relid=239) might apply best to what you're looking for (also called "slice of life" I believe) as it will have a normal, every day kind of plot. ["School life"](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=lexicon&vtype=cat&relid=21) and ["High School"](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=lexicon&vtype=cat&relid=236) might also be generic categories for you to explore and then narrow down the results to those that you want.

Unfortunately the art style (e.g. giant eyes; snot bubbles) and such may not be immediately apparent from the title, but hopefully a good synopsis (best to get those from the fansubbers) or pictures of the anime will help you determine if you're into will enjoy it or not.

Good luck. :)
>> ARTICLE
Trigun's always good if you haven't seen that. It certainly has it's silly moments, especially the first few episodes, but if you can get past that it's a really great series. And like I said, the first few are pretty darned silly. A lot of the attempted humor in anime just seems strange and not really funny to me. Maybe a "lost in translation" kind of situation. Anyways, enough rambling. Watch Trigun because once you get into the main story it's awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Have you read the manga? The plot is very different after a few chapters, is much easier to follow, and is excellent.
>> ARTICLE
I have not. I've actually never read any manga before.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop is the first anime any person should ever watch. It is close to flawless.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game. Watch the first 7 episodes and you'll be hooked. It is very accessible to American audiences. 
>> ARTICLE
I would recommend actually reading the manga Bakuman.  It's by the same guys who did Deathnote.

It's going to be released in anime sometime this fall or winter, so until then, you're stuck with manga.
>> ARTICLE
Legend of Galactic Heroes
>> ARTICLE
Monster is okay but a little slow, slower than Death Note - more like a traditional TV series in that respect.

But yeah, I'm in the same boat as you really. Death Note was so awesome.
>> ARTICLE
GTO
>> ARTICLE
The guy's asking for a slice-of-life anime and all you guys have been recommending are anime in sci-fi settings.
>> ARTICLE
I would recommend 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' and 'Now and Then, Here and There'. They're both realistic, and particularly intellectual and philosophical. Those two kind of shaped my young brain and became what I compared all other anime to afterward.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, sure, and while we're at it, I might also recommend *School Days* and *Elfen Lied*.
>> ARTICLE
To your list, I'd like to add Green Legend Ran.  It felt a little similar to Now and Then, Here and There.
>> ARTICLE
I would disagree with your recommendation of Neon Genesis Evangelion to someone who is not overly familiar with anime. To appreciate it you have to at least be familiar with the popular tropes in anime and, more specifically, mecha.

That show, at least in my opinion, is best watched as a commentary on anime-specific storytelling style in the mecha genre. It plays with the tropes prevalent in the genre and twists them to break the viewers expectations, formed by previous works that feature giant robots and similar plots.

In contrast, Now and Then, Here and There is really a great show, regardless of your background. Moreover, it's the more philosophical of the two in the sense that it raises actual questions and is not just about a pathetic teen rambling about his "misery".
>> ARTICLE
Now and Then, Here and There was amazing and I believe a great choice for the OP as it seems at least to me, to transcend the medium of anime, and really, television series' in general. It, like Grave of the Fireflies and Kino's Journey (another series I'd recommend to the OP) utterly engrosses the viewer into the story and characters, so much so that the medium becomes a formality.  
>> ARTICLE
I fully agree with you, especially on the recommendation of Kino's journey - that show certainly fits the criteria of "no snot bubbles" and has some intellectual merit as well. 

As you brought up shows that transcend the medium, I feel I have to throw in Mushishi in here, but I'm afraid that OP wouldn't like it as it has a very different pace from Death Note or any other shows OP mentioned, for that matter. Even Kino's Journey wouldn't probably be the best kind of show to recommend to someone who prefers shounen series.

NTHT is incredibly depressing though.

Lucky Star is ALWAYS the wrong recommendation if somebody is new to anime, given the large volume of jokes based on references to other anime.

That's a joke?

Yes,the 'you don't have to bleed while laughing at it,not even actually laugh' kind
>> ARTICLE
try berserk, it's one of the more realistic fantasy animes (realistic in the sense that the fighting and such isn't overblown, there's no flying, no yelling out the names of your attacks, etc...). ok yes there's a giant sword, but beyond that it's more or less realistic with the exception of the very first and very last episode.
>> ARTICLE
>ok yes there's a giant sword

Well, the sword's quite realistic too, as a matter of fact. It's pointed out, well, at least in the manga, that Guts wields it more like a hunk of blunt metal than a sword, chopping his enemies with the sheer force of the moving mass.

There's none of the "tree gets sliced in half and quietly starts to fall in the background a few seconds later" crap.
>> ARTICLE
Berserk realistic... Funny hearing them in the same lines but I understand what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
90% of the anime is set in a no-magic, middle-ages type setting.  His huge sword behaves just like a huge sword like that should
>> ARTICLE
You want more normal?  It doesn't get more normal than *Azumanga Daioh*.  It's as Japanese as raw fish and rice balls.

Try on GTO as well.  It's somewhat more ridiculous than "normal" (but less ridiculous than *Azumanga Daioh*), and honestly, the live action version wasn't bad, either.

*Clannad* will make you cry, unless you're a robot.  Watch it anyway.

Of course, if you like cute, annoying characters that do next to nothing except occasionally play ear worms, I might also suggest *K-On!*  Well, I like it anyway.

*Cowboy Bebop* is also normal and for a change isn't set in a high school.  *Planetes* is also up that alley.  If you enjoyed those, *Mobile Suit Gundam*, *Super Dimension Fortress Macross*, and their associated franchises might be to your liking (*Macross Frontier* gets bonus points for setting up a love triangle in episode one, then absolutely refusing to resolve it without forgetting about it).

Someone's recommended *Welcome to the N.H.K*, and it's not bad for normal, but the main character is possibly schizophrenic.  

Another thing someone's mentioned is *Lucky Star*.  You're not ready for that yet, young Padawan (though it might be up your alley eventually).  You need to get through the above, at least one round of *Gundam* (watch the original *Mobile Suit Gundam*, but I don't know much about the later series), and all of *Full Metal Panic* (recommended) and Haruhi (watch the first season a couple dozen times and let it eat your brain completely before watching the second season--if you didn't like it enough to do that, don't even bother with S2) before you're ready for that.

For Gurren Lagann, it doesn't seem he's too interested in mecha.  I've given him some ur-mecha recommendations, and if he likes those, go on to EVA and Gurren Lagann.

Haruhi, well, he did say he wanted "normal".  That show starts off normal, but takes a turn for the insane at the end of episode 3.

Good to see though, Netflix getting their act back together makes it easier to get my friends to watch things.

Yeah i remember watching it with my friends on xbox back when it had group watching, never knew why they took it off.

New remastered, eh? That's worth another rewatch. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm assuming that'll happen.

They need to add more of their older titles back, and expand there. So much good 80's and 90's sci-fi stuff they could add. 
>> ARTICLE
Now they need Jojo and a European subscription option to use the US servers for viewing and then they I'm completely satisfied. 
>> ARTICLE
Just use Hola.com switch the country to US
>> ARTICLE
Latter will never happen, they can't do that without reworking every single one of their contracts with studios for their material. That said, there are certain ways to use the US version on pc for free, and on consoles for a very small monthly charge if you google around.

Look into proxy netflix options. Netflix totally knows i dont travel between Canada UK and America everyday but they dont care.

The ending was very flawed. 
>> ARTICLE
That fucking girl. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes I shall do the same.
>> ARTICLE
Might do the same, any one know if English sub or dub is better ?
>> ARTICLE
Sub almost always has better acting. 
>> ARTICLE
Most people here seem to be recommending the dub. Ignore them!

The original Japanese version is voiced by Mamoru Miyano and Kappei Yamaguchi, two incredibly skilled (and well known) voice actors. They do an amazing job, and they have the benefit of being around the original writers/directors, who actually have some idea what's going on.

A lot of meaning is lost in the dub due to poor translation and acting, and a lot of timing/intonation/etc is ignored.

The most egregious example is the famous scene in episode 8 (minor spoilers), where Light is writing names in the Death Note with one hand, and eating potato chips with the other. The scene is meant to subtly and metaphorically show many things -- Light's casual disregard for human life, the duality of his character (half killer, half student), and so on.

The dub absolutely fucked up this scene by having Light shout:

"I'll take a potato chip.... (heavy breathing)... and EAT IT!!!"

WTF? It was potentially yet another amazing scene from the show, filled with metaphor and understatement, beautifully acted in the original. But the dubbers completely fail to understand the nuances of the scene, and have the main character blurt out some nonsensical out-of-character BS that kills the mood and turns the scene into an online laughing stock.

So go with subs, and: (a) hear some decent acting, and (b) get a translation by someone who actually gives a shit.
>> ARTICLE
Actually the ridiculousness of it shows the absurdity of everything. 
>> ARTICLE
I prefer the sub as someone who prefers dubs most of the time.

I saw several minutes of the dub and L's voice *really* put me off, unbearably so.
>> ARTICLE
Started it last night, IMHO, sub is better.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it in Japanese, it's extremely good.  But the dub is also one of the best dubs I've ever heard.  It's just a matter of taste.
>> ARTICLE
DUB. Trust me.
>> ARTICLE
how to i get the dubbed version? netflix only seems to play the subbed.
>> ARTICLE
I'll take a potato chip, AND EAT IT !
>> ARTICLE
I've watched both and the English VA for light just kinda fits him better

I also absolutely despised Near's voice in the sub like holy shit everytime he came on screen i had to clench in preparation 
>> ARTICLE
My vote's on dub
>> ARTICLE
Both are good. Though I'd suggest going back and watching the other version at a later date as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Neither one is any better than the other. If you like hearing things in English, go with that, but if you'd rather hear the original go with the Japanese version.

The English VA doesn't disappoint at all though, trust me.
>> ARTICLE
I was a huge fan of the subbed. The voice acting in japanese is incredible,  I highly recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
Same.  I'm not a big anime guy and it's the only show I refuse to watch the dub because of how I have fond memories of following the sub when it was new every week with my friends in middle school.

All according to keikaku.
>> ARTICLE
^Translator ^note: ^Keikaku ^means ^plan
>> ARTICLE
Please tell me this is the real dub.
>> ARTICLE
Yee death note has great dubs, and i generally dislike anime dubbed.
>> ARTICLE
Totally, the only anime other than Death Note that i like to watch dubbed is Black Lagoon.
>> ARTICLE
..b.but..but Trigun. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think i've watched that yet and i've got a feeling that i need to right now.
>> ARTICLE
It's honestly my favorite dub. Reminds me of Cowboy Bebop. 
>> ARTICLE
I really like Vash's voice actor.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he did a really good job. 
>> ARTICLE
I always preferred the Black Lagoon dub since in universe, they're speaking English most of the time. 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, in Black Lagoon, they're actually speaking English. The main cast is a Japanese businessman who does business overseas (and is thus fluent in English) and 3 Americans of different ethnic background.

There's a scene in season 2 that highlights this. It's when they're doing the negotiations in Japan with the Yakuza people. In English, the scene works, but in Japanese the scene is just cringe worthy. 
>> ARTICLE
I just watched that arc last week, I was wondering how it would sound in Japanese.  

There are some anime were English just works better.  Space shows like Cowboy Bebop, series that have an international cast of characters and shows that are heavily influenced by the West.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano? Probably is the best dubbed anime, if not one of the best
>> ARTICLE
Really? I'll make sure to check it out then.
>> ARTICLE
I would have to go with Ghost in the Shell:  Stand Alone Complex for best dub.
>> ARTICLE
I'll make sure to check that one out too.
>> ARTICLE
Both seasons are on hulu, fyi.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, thanks for telling me.
>> ARTICLE
I'd  be a bit weary of this one actually. While the main cast has fitting voices, they all sound kinda monotone and disinterested most of the time, except for Batou who's English voice is perfect. Also random side characters range from acceptable to complete and utter crap. 

There's also one episode that involves and a kid and these high pitched robots they use called Tachikomas and the voice acting in that episode is a complete pain to watch in English since you have an adult straining to sound like a kid and an annoying high pitched robot throughout the entire episode. It was an okay dub for its time, but it is nowhere near the level of Black Lagoon/Baccano/Death Note and others mentioned in this thread.
>> ARTICLE
Thats the reason i watch subbed all the time. Its not that i think all dub is shit, its that i've already heard the best there is too offer.
>> ARTICLE
It is glorious, but doesn't unseat Bebop. All those bad accents on the boat in the flashback, good lord. 
>> ARTICLE
True, but I try to forget about that scene

Jacuzzi also annoyed the shit outta me but I can't blame the VA for that.

Yup, and it's glorious.

[Sure](http://i.imgur.com/AFNTPFn.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I mean why they didn't just write "plan"
>> ARTICLE
It was done as a joke by the sub group IIRC. If you watch a lot of subbed anime you'll come to realize that certain groups have this annoying tendency to not completely translate things and leave some of the Japanese words in the subs. Normally the idea is that you only really do this is the word has no real English equivalent, but some groups do it anyway because they either get lazy or they think they're being more "pure" or something. The image was made to make fun of those groups. 

There's a much better/long explanation at tvtropes.

Get back Angel Beats? I don't need to cry again man. Don't do that to me.

The problem with Angel Beats! for me is that they don't make you attatched to the characters or the story, since it's only 12/13 (can't remember) episodes. Not a tear :/

I've watched angel beats several times, and I swear man. Each time I watch it, I think I cry a little more on the inside. ;-; #DemFeels

Best dub ever. It's pretty much the only show I'll watch with English audio.

I didn't care for the dubbing, though a lot of other people here seem to agree with you. I feel like the Japanese voice acting conveys Light's insanity (like when he's explaining some devious plan coming to fruition) better for example.

Get the Hola unblocker browser extension, it lets you access the versions of Netflix that other countries has. I've been using it for Death Note and Series 7 of Doctor Who (you'd think that considering Doctor Who is a flipping British TV show that we'd get Series 7 on the UK Netflix first.)

Death Note used to be on Netflix but only available in subbed, That's when I watched it, now I see why they took it down for a while so they could add the dubbed version

Most of the times I don't talk about shows that I'm watching to avoid spoilers, tho I don't have someone to talk about them anyway

Wow. Are you serious? I was watching Death Note a couple months ago, subbed on an anime web site. It was very low quality but I put up with it. Now of course it's on netflix, which I have. But I stopped watching, and I have like 4 episodes left. Finishing them now.

I hate it when i do that. Watched almost all of Sword Art Online, then bam, added on Netflix.

I seriously tried to watch this on Netflix a week ago and was disappointed it wasn't there. Now I'm knee deep in attack on Titan. Maybe rewatching this will be next.

Can someone convince me to watch this?  

I know what the base of the story is, some guy with a book that you can kill people with by writing their name in, but it just doesn't sound interesting to me, but I hear it's really good. 
  
One of my friends has tried to get me to watch it for a long time but I have such a huge backlog that I don't care to get around to it, as I'm not entirely interested. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't watch it, it's overrated as hell, especially considering how the story drops from interesting to outright retarded for the second half.

The notebook is just a catalyst for the actual storyline between a genius sociopath and a genius detective trying to unmask and kill/turn in each other.  It's a fight that's way more clever and intense than any physical fight I've seen.

It revolves around a smart antagonist and smart protagonist fighting it out with mind games. 

It has a bone chilling soundtrack, very clever writing and a plot that keeps you guessing what will happen next.

It's frustrating how they drop good shows like Death Note and Naruto but leave the same four seasons of FMA:B on there for all eternity.

Why isn't FMA:B considered a good show by you.  Objectively its much better than both DN and Naruto so why *shouldn't* it stay up?

I love FMA:B! I'm just saying I hate that they've had the same four seasons up for ages.

I never really liked Death Note...I tried to watch it in the past 3 times, and EACH time I gave up. But I LOVE the story of it, just hated the way it was executed. Hopefully this time I can really get into it haha! 
>> ARTICLE
I was really worried that he was just going to kill Misa when he saw the manager there. It isn't too big
of a jump to think they are working together in some way. Glad he didn't and everything is going perfectly
to plan right now.

He just grabbed the death note didn't he? I guess they have cameras set up there if he uses it there or in his car
they will know about the death note! A gun too, I think someone is going to end up dying here, I don't know
who but it's all going a little too smoothly.

Predictions:

It seems things are really going L's way, if they find out about the note itself things will be really hard
for Light if he becomes Kira again. Especially if they manage to get a hold of it, then they will see Rem?!
Misa's the only one who can really stop something like that from happening and I don't think she can do
that under L's nose, he is super suspicious of her now. They also spent some time this episode with L asking
Light if he thinks it is somebody controlling things from behind the scenes which seems like foreshadowing to me. 
If they do see Rem I can see her misleading them in that direction since she wants to keep Misa safe. I'm not
sure if L would be tricked by that, but when he even thought shinigami might exist he completely freaked out, so
it could catch him off guard. Then if Light touches it too he can totally use that to his advantage.

Things really could go either way from here.

Last time me submitting the threads today. /u/Neawia will be back to be the OP tomorrow. So rejoice that you don't need to deal with the faker anymore.

Man L is really pissy at the moment:

> I suppose this is what you would call a victory, right, Matsuda?

No need to bash Matsuda here.

Damn L must be thinking very hard lately so many sweets, or he has just a snack attack.

MATSUDA!!!!! THE LEGEND THE HERO WE DESERVE! 

He may not have the brains but he has the guts to catch Kira.


>L: That was just because Light messed up.

He still has a grudge against Light, they never become friends in this universe...

And my DVD stopped working again... no further comments to the episode from me...

---

[All Rules](http://pastebin.com/vKXmUpej)

New Rules:

35. Only by touching each other's Death Note can human individuals who own the Death Note in the human world recognize the appearance or voice of each other's god of death.

8. The Dead god of death will disappear, but the Death Note will remain. The ownership of this Death Note is usually carried over to the next god of death that touches it but it is common sense that it is returned to the great god of death.

----

No questions today because I just didn't have the time because of the problems with my DVD

Also nothing really in this episode today gave me ideas for questions anyway...
>> ARTICLE
So you were the show and typing the comments at the same time!? It almost seems like you are treating this like an anime assignment of sorts. 
>> ARTICLE
Well I write while I'm watching yes, but only because when I write it down afterwards I just forget to mention some things I wanted to tackle...


>> ARTICLE
I think it's interesting that L is willing to let innocent people die here for him to solve the Kira case. Lately it seems most Death Note fans hate Light but love L, because he's fighting for 'justice'. But when pushed to his limits, L is just as willing to forgo his ethics to achieve his goals. These characters really are the opposite side of the same coin.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly feel bad for L at this point he was right on all cases but light was one step ahead and now he just can't get over it. And I love how all of them already knew who the kira in their group was. They just figured they would go along with it because he is easy to fool and it was safer.
>> ARTICLE
When everything goes according to plan, there will be a burning feeling that something will go wrong in the back of the mind. Yes, Matsuda is indeed badass and Kyosuke is the real idiot here. Mat is very courageous and intelligent but he looks stupid because he is surrounded by geniuses. 

Kyosuke is so predictable that L anticipates what he does to the letter days beforehand. Seeing a villian crumble just according to plan is made all the more delicious when the villian is a filthy greedy bastard, and that is phase one of the "Keikaku". L is also now very close to the truth,but he is literally playing with the deathgods now.


1. How much of this do you think is playing into Light's Keikaku?

2. What is your favourite Keikaku in anime?

3. Who is your real best girl and why?

In this show Naomi, because she was the most capable woman in this show.

In anime it's Morgiana, because she is [badass](http://puu.sh/nAZ2W.webm), [adorable](http://gfycat.com/SolidDetailedIchthyostega), kind and [gorgeous](http://25.media.tumblr.com/4e7bf4523e77a8a4e02b6e95ba9621c7/tumblr_mkjylc2N1g1qhrxsqo1_500.gif).

Rip Naomi, she was just *too* capable but her death scene is one of the best the series has to offer.

I have never heard of Magi, pitch me this anime!
>> ARTICLE
>I have never heard of Magi, pitch me this anime!

Well it's mostly a shounen battle anime first and foremost, but it concentrates much more on worldbuilding than other shows of it's genre. Also it plays in a One Thousand and One Nights setting, with Djinns and treasures and Magic.

Also this show has Morgiana

The first seasons villains start of kinda generic but they get much more fleshed out ones in later episodes and a very relatable villain in the second season.

Also they have Morgiana.

And the second season makes one of the things I love the most in fantasy explaining more in depth how the Magic is working in this world, and I love magic systems in fantasy especially when they treated like science.

[**Also this show has Morgiana in it.**](http://gfycat.com/KindNeighboringHarvestmen)

And this show doesn't shy away to tackle themes like slavery and racism (more in the second season).


Also the show has HanaKana playing an [adorable](http://gfycat.com/GlisteningBouncyDonkey) yet also really [terrifying](http://i.imgur.com/cpnmeU3.gifv) princess.

It also has the sexiest power ups in anime called [Djinn Equips](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/90/79/7c/90797cb05f14c768110bf4721f16ace8.jpg)

I should basically watch it for Morgiana's sake.
>> ARTICLE
Yes Morgiana, is the best. I'm just a bit worried that I overhyped her too much but she is really best for me atleast.

Also there's a rewatch going on for this show at the moment, tomorrow is the last episode of season 1 It's probably a bit late to catch up though....

Poor Matsuda man. He gets to be the guinea pig.

Man that was a hype episode. Usually my comments for this rewatch are kinda long but I was so absorbed in this episode I didn't write much. Looks like everything is going according to L's plan.

[L up close.](http://i.imgur.com/uEULsVD.png) Get some sleep, son.

Yeah, theyll find someone like that, Matsuda. Its you.

I like this secret meeting. I wonder what theyre going to do from here? Shed light on Higuchi? At the very least they'll decide how to protect their own asses.

Time for the plan. Turn on the tv, Higuchi. Here we go.

So Higuchi wrote Matsuis name in the Death Note. He knows its not his real name. I cant help but feel like in the real world, at least in this year, the internet would find out who Matsui really is in a matter of hours or sooner. They saw his face. His name would be posted in a bunch of different places by assholes who just want to see him die for no reason. He would be dead so fast. Assuming Higuchi was checking the internet.

Higuchi is panicking like mad. I love this plan. He should be questioning why Misas company is being so helpful with such a bizarre request. Instead hes gonna go get himself caught.

This shit is intense. I hope Wedy doesnt get shot or anything.

Higuchis fucking nuts. He always just talks out loud when Rem is right there listening.

Me too /u/Neawia. Me too.

For real, I have no idea what Ryuk is doing during this part of the story.

Also you seem to have a huge fetish for L closeup's.
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! It's just that every single episode has had at least one close up view of a character. Usually it's Light or L. I just felt like making it a recurring thing in my posts to screenshot them.

A man gotta do what a man gotta do. He happily risks his life for the world. Matsuda is a true hero.

I once again want to comment on how we're at a big peak in the story but I would end up putting that on almost every episode because the pacing, at least in the first half (can't remember if it is good in the second half), is pretty consistently good. 

At this point, L almost has every piece of the puzzle but is just short of the last slip up to confirm it. However, he is in a difficult position because even if he could confirm that Light was Kira, what could he do? He knows Light isn't Kira any more so can't exactly just arrest him. He doesn't even know what he is fighting yet and can't know if locking up the trail behind Kira would help.

>How many times have you watched Death Note?

I may have done a proper rewatch only once but certain episodes were watched many more times than I can remember.

>What is the most interesting thing you learned in the past week?

I need the Spice and Wolf light novels. Along with a couple of college textbooks.

I had in mind something like, "I learned how to fix a flat tire." Though I suppose learning that you *need* the Spice and Wolf novels (and college textbooks, those are important too) is a worthwhile discovery.

3 times, 2 were when trying to get someone else into anime

ERASED having a killer plot

> ERASED having a killer plot

I enjoyed the first three episode so much that I've put it on hold until it finishes airing. I just can't wait for the next, and I want to avoid any spoilers in the discussion threads.
>> ARTICLE
Not a bad idea. I gave in and read ahead on the Manga. I could not.... Just.... Wait... 
>> ARTICLE
I don't really read manga. Is Erased finished? Any idea if 12 episodes will be enough to cover everything or am I going to have to wait an extra three months for a second cour to finish?
>> ARTICLE
No the Manga is not finished yet. We do know who the bad guy is, so it seems it's near the end. Don't know if it'll be on time for the finale of the Anime tho. Which is one of my worries with the show. I think it's pretty doable with 12 episodes, had the Manga been finished already. 

So we may or may not see another cour and they just leave cour 1 at a pivotal moment in the story, the reveal of the villain. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't dislike if they can make it all work in 1 cour. Hopefully they don't put a big reveal at the end though and then stop making more episodes.

Thanks for the info!
>> ARTICLE
The anime will have the same ending as the manga.

Good news.

I remember reading somewhere the end of the manga and anime will be around the same time. I think the manga will end 2 weeks before the finale, but I can't remember exactly.

I've seen it three times in the span of 9 years. It brings back some fond memories everytime I think about it. It has an amazing atmosphere, plot characters, music. It will make you feel every possible emotion... If you haven't seen it yet (looking at you, teens), do yourself a favor and don't miss this rewatch.

5 times, but Neawia you already know that 

*  For what reason(s) are you enjoying your favorite airing show so much? (use spoiler tags if necessary)

Well Durarara is just great, diverse characters, fun dialogues, and a so confusing plot that even the[ characters can't keep up with it](http://i.imgur.com/qjnMvrf.png)^(don't know if this is good or bad though)... (minor spoiler latest episode)

That I should upload webms on gfycat with the simple upload

I'm just patiently waiting for Netflix to throw it up when it's finished. Hopefully they don't take too long because I kind of want to watch Durarara already.

- I've watched Death Note about 4 or 5 times and it's one of my favorite anime.

- I'm currently watching Code Geass for the first time and I like it a lot so far especially since it reminds me of Death Note in a few ways. Also enjoying it simply for C.C.

- I learned that when I connect my laptop to my TV using an HDMI cord it only fills about two thirds of the screen so that's pretty interesting and annoying.

Tied with /u/Saikimo and /u/BeinDraug, it would seem.

Delusional. Just like /u/The-Sublimer-One. ^^Just ^^kidding, ^^she's ^^not ^^*that* ^^bad.

> I learned that when I connect my laptop to my TV using an HDMI cord it only fills about two thirds of the screen so that's pretty interesting and annoying.

Switch the aspect ratio on your tv? Check output settings on your laptop? I don't know. That sucks if you can't get it to go full screen.
>> ARTICLE
I've tried so many different things to get it full screen, but I'm pretty computer challenged so I'm probably missing something simple. It's weird too because the audio and video comes through the TV perfect, it just won't go full screen.

And who is your favorite female character in Code Geass if it isn't C.C.?
>> ARTICLE
> it just won't go full screen.

Weird stuff. Use your google-fu powers. I hope you can figure it out. If you have a Mac I can offer some help. I use an hdmi to connect to a tv from time to time.

> And who is your favorite female character in Code Geass if it isn't C.C.?

Ugh. This is a tough question for me. I do like CC, just not to the extent of her being one of my favorite characters ever. I do like Milly. She was pretty fun. Otherwise, hmmm, Villetta or Cornelia.

My first time watching DN was in english before i was used to subs, i re-watched it after i'd gotten used to subs. I think watched it 2-3 more times after that so 4-5 times in total.

Erased is probably my favorite anime this season loving the mystery and the perfect contrast between wonderfully sweet and incredibly dark.

This week i learnt that plasm blades are becoming a real thing in medicen

*Plasma* blades? That sounds awesome. What are they used for, cutting people during surgery? Amputations? PLASMA AXE!!!

Still in trial phases but the idea is that they will be sterile and cauterize the incision as it's made to prevent blood loss

Do you happen to know what the suggested fansub is? Or I guess I should ask for this era.. if for some reason the dub is suggested (like it is for spice and wolf ect although I watch almost all anime subbed)
>> ARTICLE
*I* don't know what the recommended sub would be. Surely someone should. If not, perhaps I'll pose the question in the next 'reminder' thread which will probably be the '1 week reminder'.

I have seen people say the dub for Death Note is quite good. I'm more of a dub guy myself so that's what I'm going to be watching.
>> ARTICLE
I was a little bummed when my fansubs for DN (group unspecified) didn't have the Keikaku TL note meme.  It's like playing FFIV and having someone correct the engrish for "you spoony bard."
>> ARTICLE
> if for some reason the dub is suggested

This is just me personally, but it's totally up to preference. The dub for Death Note is easily one of the best I've heard. There aren't really any distinctly recognizable voices in it that are overused in anime dubs either. The acting is pretty over the top, but only slightly more so than the Japanese.

If you really want to watch it subbed, go for it. I'd say if you're open to the dub though, definitely give it a shot. 
>> ARTICLE
>How many times have you watched Death Note?

I've seen it all the way through 4 times, and watched a few episodes a bunch of times.

>For what reason(s) are you enjoying your favorite airing show so much?

Sekkou boys is so ridiculous and stupid that it makes me laugh like an idiot while I watch it.

Pokemon facts are always good. I knew Shuckle has that high DEF stat. Figured he'd be able to use that to his advantage somehow.
