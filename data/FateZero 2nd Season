Kirei v Kiritsugu is my favourite fight scene in anime.
>> ARTICLE
That's one of my favorite fight scene ever!

You have both guys pulling out all their tricks just to have a tiny edge of winning and are constantly pushing each other to their max. 

Such a great fight!
>> ARTICLE
I like how kirei and kiritsugu never talk to each other during the entire series and the first thing they do upon meeting is to kill one another. 
>> ARTICLE
I love it too. [Heaven's Feel](/s "It's the same deal with Kirei vs Shirou at the end of HF. No servants, just a one on one battle. Shits going to look spectacular animated.")
>> ARTICLE
how? its a [Heavens feel](/s "kung fu priest beating on a terminally ill kid")
>> ARTICLE
Plot! Armor!
>> ARTICLE
yeah, but whose [fate spoiler](/s "body is made out of swords").  
>> ARTICLE
It gives me the same feel as [Kenshin Himura vs. Hajime Saito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHObo1yvyg): very raw with two characters where you can feel the bloodthirst oozing out of the monitor.

I've watched this show like three times and Waiver finding that T-shirt gets to me every time.

[UBW Ep 25](/s "His cameo was short but man it was satisfying.")

Also when he appears in Ionian Hetairoi T.T


>> ARTICLE
I dont think thats him lol well no one is really sure since its only a strong guess by the fans but he does look like him
>> ARTICLE
It's the tie that gets me. Like, the resemblance is striking once you've seen him as an adult, but that tie is what caught my eye the first time around.
>> ARTICLE
Well its a strong guess since it's logical. The throne of heroes are disconnected to timeline anyway. Him becoming a hero in the future and being summoned into Ioinian Hetairoi is entirely possible.
>> ARTICLE
Saber's "YAMEROOOOO"  before blowing up the grail will always make me sad :(.
>> ARTICLE
**Kiritsugu vs Kirei fighting in the Bat Cave was fucking epic !** 

Definitely my second favourite fight in the whole Fate series only being beaten by Heavens Feel final fight for me . I wished they used the Emiya time alter OST in this fight for the first part but oh well

Well this is the final re watch and I had fun with the conversations and dank meme's I guess next time we discuss Fate again is when Heavens Feel comes out bye ! 

Edit:  Also a Question about the last scene[](/s "Did Kerry die at this scene or was it a few days/weeks/years after this scene ? I haven't played the VN for a long time so my memory is fuzzy ")
>> ARTICLE
Spoiler? :P
>> ARTICLE
for what ?
>> ARTICLE
The edit. [](/s "Does it show him die? I honestly can't remember even though I just watched it lol. If it doesn't then that's a spoiler for Zero only watchers. If it does show it then ignore my awful memory.")
>> ARTICLE
hmm I dont think its a spoiler but oh well okay I would spoiler tag it 
>> ARTICLE
I agree it's not really a spoiler but yeah there's some people who wouldn't know that yet so I'm just being careful.
>> ARTICLE
Answer is yes.
>> ARTICLE
[Not really a spoiler](/s "Yeah, that's where he died. Shirou says he thought he just fell sleep and went to bed himself, only to find him dead the next morning.")
>> ARTICLE
ah I see ok thanks 
>> ARTICLE
"I want to be a hero" AAAAAAAH I broke down so hard I'm still choking...ffffff what a rollercoaster! Urobuchi you evil genius!  
  
Tomorrow I'll figure out how to get my hands on the VN and how to even use it...gah, so excited about that but first, this episode:  
  
**Berserker**  
Kariya lived and died in despair. I instantly knew what he saw was just a hallucination of his desperation. Being cast aside so arbirarily by the one person you loved and sacrificed evrything for...I can not begin to imagine the pain he felt in his last moments. Damn this is dark.  
  
Berserker's death only served to further pain poor little Saber...I am not even surprised by that at this point.  
  
**Archer**  
Gilgamesh is the only one who lived through all this shit while being  unchanged (mentally at least). That proposal-sorry, declaration-to Saber was soooooo Gilgamesh!  
So, his wish was reincarnation (like Rider's) he just didn't realize it himself, right? Why else would he be alive as the sexiest mofo out there (seriously, that caught me off guard)?  
  
Kirei Kotomine, oh you evil, evil bastard. Well, at least you know you are an abomination. That is...better than not knowing it? Or not?  
Anyway, that fight with Kiritsugu was super spectacular! Too bad it achieved virtually nothing...  
So, that mini-apocalypse means that he won the war, right? Kerry rejected the grail so it accepted Kirei's wish instead, right?  
So his new goal is finding out how the grail works if I understand correctly...riiiight? I'm unsure about this affair.  
But man, that engrish at the end...that alone deserves death, ughhh! Also, when he handed over the dagger to Rin...that was one of the biggest subtle "FUCK YOU" moments in anime. This guy really has no shame....I kinda like him.  
  
**Saber**  
This series is bascially about "Who has it worst and who can fuck up Sabre's emotions the best". She got her dreams crushed so hard...for now at least. Her next master will be more like-minded.  
When she was forced to kill the grail...aaaaaa that scream will haunt me!  
  
Kiritsugu...ooooooooh boy we dvelved so deep into his mind it's crazy!  
That scene with the grail revealed a lot about him. In reality he wanted the world to be peaceful because he wanted his family to live in peace so applying his methods to achieve this would mean killing the "less-important" (the whole world) to save the "more-important" (loved ones).  
He could not agree to this and rejected the grail (much to Sabre's dismay) by murdering a fake version of fucking everybody ever.  
To say it was hard to watch (especially what followed all this) would be an understatement.  
Watching him clinging to his ideals, all that was left for him, was the most heart-breaking scene in the series. He went back to his original dream "I want to be a hero" and tried to save as many people as possible (but man was that a sad sequence) and failing at it miserably.  
Then, he found Shirou (the protagonist of F/SN, right? That was a genius move from the writers.) and you could see just how happy he was. Basically, his dream had been fulfilled (as Shirou says it).  
Damn, I love this character.  
He is the second most tragic one in all of anime IMO.  
  
BTW can someone give me a tl;dr about Angra Mainyu? He/She/It seems to play a big role in all this but I don't understand a word from the wikipedia entry. Thanks in advance!  
  
Lastly, I would like to thank you all for this rewatch! Without this, I would not have gotten into the Fate series until much later, or possibly never! That would have been a huge mistake, so my thanks to all of you!  
And sorry for my semi-broken english!
>> ARTICLE
Who is the most tragic if Kiritsugu is the second most tragic? 
>> ARTICLE
Guts from Berserk
>> ARTICLE
Guts probably .

Anyway am I the only one who thinks Archer (fate/stay night) is more tragic than Kiritsugu when it comes to back story  ?  
>> ARTICLE
I felt like Archer's ideals were just too much generic shonen without much behind them. Kiritsugu actually experienced putting these in to action through his adventures with Natalia and the plot of Zero going all Macbeth mode and slaughtering everyone around him
>> ARTICLE
I actually think its the opposite since Archer [UBW spoiler](/s "Was a proper Hero/Guardian of the world  that Kiritsugu wanted to be . Archer experienced being a Guardian where his job is to save a lot of people  by killing people as his daily job .") 

You could say Kiritsugu also experienced this since he has to sacrifice his love ones to save many too. But what made me feel sorry for Archer more is [UBW spoiler](/s "that he regretted being a hero so bad that he wanted to kill himself by killing his past self  . Its the regret that kills me  and the fact that no matter what happens he would never be saved and stuck in an eternal time loop. At Least Kerry dies in peace with no regrets  ").  
>> ARTICLE
The Last Episode of the VN gives closure to Archer Character 

[VN Spoiler](/s "Fate Shirou follows a similar path to Archer's past. The diference is that he upholds his ideal cause he met Saber. Finally ending his long journey in Avalon. He uphold his ideal, uphold Kiritsugu memory, saved people on the process, became a badass, reached a peaceful life in Avalon. All the hardwork finally paid off. The hardest path but the one where he can feel proud of himself and that is the most important thing")
>> ARTICLE
My memory is fuzzy so forgive me but ..

[VN Last episode](/s "Im pretty sure that was shirou himself who went to Avalon  and not Archer (who was from a different time line despite being the same person ) ") Again have not played it for a long time so I might be wrong :P
>> ARTICLE
No no you are right [VN LE](/s "The one who reaches Avalon is not the Archer we see in the 3 routes but it is a Shirou that followed the same path as Archer but hold a light inside him that make him never fully regret his path. The usage of projection and fighting probably made him look like Archer at the end but this 'Shirou/Archer' reached Avalon. If you talk about Archer as a specific character (The one in the 3 routes) his best end would be the UBW end (Despite he will forger the events the next time he is summoned) but if you refer Archer as the individual that upholds his ideal and became a hero despite realizing that to save people many will die, then the Fate Shirou is the one that gives hope to character arc.")
>> ARTICLE
Can you elaborate on the part about [spoiler](/s "reaching Avalon.") I don't remember reading anything in the wiki about that.
>> ARTICLE
[VN heavy Spoiler](/s "When you end the 3 routes in the Realta Nua version of the game a new sequence unlocks. In there it shows how the Shirou from the Fate route followed the path of becoming a superhero and... he did it. He became a heroic spirit (A counterguardian) and roamed the eras saving humanity of destruction. Ej: He went to ancient Greece where he met Ajax, we know that because he has Rho Aias. But with these journeys showed him that he couldnt still save everyone. He created his UBW were each blade in the ground is the grave of someone in his journey. 
That is the Archer part of his life but this Shirou hold something more preactiate in his heart. It is the combination of his ideal and someone else and that is Saber. He never regret his decision because he was upholding the ideal of Saber also and he found that beatiful and something that he will never give up. But deeper inside a wish was kept on secret, he wanted to met her again. He knew it was impossible but never abandoned the posibility and continued forward in his path.")

[](/s "While all these was happening Saber was waiting. She was waiting in Avalon, the land where King Arthur goes after his death. While she was there, she was sleeping and watching Shirou path in her dreams. She knew that he wanted to find her and she also wanted to meet him again but she knew it was impossible. Still, she kept that wish in her. Merlin was in that land and told her: That wish is almost impossible. Two miracles would need to happen:
*One must wait continuously, one must pursue endlessly*")

The hero who endured the pain met the girl.")

I think i overdid it. Sorry, i love Fate route.
>> ARTICLE
Ah I see I get where your coming from now 
>> ARTICLE
Ehh. 

I thought Kiritsugu had it worse, by quite the margin 

[spoiler for UBW and Zero](/s "While Archer was betrayed by his belief I don't think he had anywhere near the emotional trauma of Kiritsugu. I mean ffs, he had to watch the girl he loved (and the village she lived in) turn to zombies, had to kill his dad, had to kill the person who raised him after the whole ordeal, just for the sake of his ideal.")  
>> ARTICLE
Ummm.[UBW Spoiler](/s "Archer gets to experience this FOR ALL ETERNITY. At least Kiritsugu got the sweet release of death. Archer kills everyone he wants to save literally forever.")
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "Ehhh. I still question if he REALLY wanted to save them. Sure that's what he says all the time, but his words just seem incredibly shallow. Kiritsugu literally has to kill everyone that he ever held dear to him by the end of the Fate/Zero while Archer has to kill people he wants to save because of his 'ideal'.") 
>> ARTICLE
[UBW Spoiler](/s "Shirou, and in turn Archer, is all but dead inside. The only way he can continue living is by saving people. To him, EVERYONE is someone he holds dear. If he can't, he might as well drop dead then and there. Remember how he rushed to save Illya and teared up in front of her grave despite being, for all he knew, a complete stranger who actually went and tried to kill him? Shirou is broken like that.
That's what makes Shirou such a tragic character. Prior to UBW's end, he's destined to suffer because he can't save everyone, and he'll feel every death like himself dying in their place. Shirou changed his path, but Archer will forever follow his and get the full package of misery and regret for all eternity.")

Have you read HF?[HF Spoiler](/s "A particular ending called 'Superman' deals with that exact issue and puts Shirou in almost the same position as Kerry at the end of Zero. Would Shirou kill his loved ones as easily as strangers like Kerry? The answer is "Yes". Because he, like Kerry, wanted to save people. He did it, as Archer urged him to, as well.")
>> ARTICLE
Can you elaborate on the [spoiler](/s "Superman") plot. I don't remember reading anything about this on the wiki.
>> ARTICLE
This is a huge HF spoiler that i really don't recommend spoiling for yourself. Read at your own risk. [HF Spoiler](/s "We learn that Sakura was being prepared by Zouken to be a grail vessel. She got corrupted by Angra Mainyu and killed people and that she, if left to live, WILL grant AM's wish and kill every human on earth. Shirou, faced with that situation, acts like a true 'Superhero', shuts down his emotions -to Kirei's overwhelming delight- and lets Rin kill Sakura. Then Rin, having killed her Sister and is about go mad if she didn't get the grail, fights Shirou to the death. He then goes to kill Illya and every master in the war to destroy the Holy Grail. "There's no need to talk about the obvious outcome. Emiya Shirou will turn his mind to steel, and become a superhero". This is one of HF endings in the VN.")

BTW you really shouldn't read too much from the wiki. It'll not only spoil you, it'll also give you wrong expectations and half truths.

The VN should be your *only* source of information.
>> ARTICLE
Before I read the spoilers, is this the plot of an upcoming adaption/movie? I've seen a few HF things in /r/manga and remember reading about a new series. 
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "difference in preferences then. For me Zero did much better with taking the whole 'superhero' ideal and putting it to its test. UBW didn't feel like it had half the heart Zero did, and Shirou holding 'everyone' dear makes me just gag a little at how cliche it is. Kiritsugu's story was visceral and extremely personal while Shirou's seemed a lot more cut n paste superhero morals with a biased mentality.
Also haven't read any of the FSN VNs so whatever happens in them as part of 'backstory' I don't particularly care about. I'm simply judging this based on the anime.") 
>> ARTICLE
I get where you're coming from, but only because UBW's adaptation failed to present Shirou correctly and kinda made everything seem dull compared to the VN. Zero's adaptation really excels on that front compared to UBW's.


[UBW Spoiler](/s "Shirou holding everyone dear is actually far from being cliche. A cliche protagonist wants to save everyone because it's the right thing to do. Shirou, however, doesn't have a moral compass. He's more like a machine that can do horrible and evil things if his distorted 'ideal' required it. There's a scene in Fate when he confronts Shinji and essentially goes "Shinji, *punches him in the gut* do X. No? Well,*breaks Shinji's arm* there goes your arm. Do X. Can't respond from the pain? *grabs Shinji's throat and tightens the grip* Guess your throat is next then. Bye, Shinji.", all in a calm and composed manner. As you can see, a cliche righteous protagonist wouldn't act like that. Shirou shares tons of similarities with his father than you realize.")
>> ARTICLE
> So, his wish was reincarnation (like Rider's) he just didn't realize it himself, right? Why else would he be alive as the sexiest mofo out there (seriously, that caught me off guard)?

ah, haaa... no, not exactly.
>> ARTICLE
Angra Mainyu is originally the persian god of darkness, he was summoned during the 3rd grail war as avenger as 8th servant class and got rekt by saber fast. but because he was summoned, he corrupted the holy grail, resulting it willingly destroying the world (?, feel free to correct me at the last part, am not sure about that anymore)
>> ARTICLE
Actually it's never fully specified who defeated him, only that he was an odd summoning attempt replacing the berserker class, the guy tried to summon the strongest servant possible and he went to the myth of Angra Manyuu, however the real Angra Manyuu was just a villager that went trough martyrdom to embody everything wrong in the world, in his last moments he died of old age with a twisted sense of love and forgiveness making him the embodiment of hate, knowing everyone around him would be free of the stains embedded on himself in the end he accepted his existence. He never was a divine being let alone the one they tried to summon, but still had protection from the laws of order due to the origin of his myth. 

Due to being a shitty villager his only noble phantasm(and even there it's barely one) was the manifestation of a progressively weakening curse and 2 devil fang swords that aren't really noble phantasm as well but tools for rites. 

The details of his quick defeat are not entirely displayed however it is known his "NP" and his nature as a wish come true cursed the grail and ended up merging the semi sentient state of the greater grail into a copy of its curse thus becoming all the evils in the world. 

Being what it is it tries to manifest into the world within the rules it is bound with wich is the servant system(Heaven's Feel) and the Saint of humonculus network that composes it's physical manifestation. 

So try to avoid using fake information, being defeated by Saber was a false projection of a third war setting with 5th war fake models stored in the grail memory. It never happened outside of Ataraxia loop.

>> ARTICLE
> So, that mini-apocalypse means that he won the war, right? Kerry rejected the grail so it accepted Kirei's wish instead, right?

It did and it didn't: it's a bit confusing to explain since the last episode has a lot of little things that say "yeah, this series is a prequel so we don't really have to explain how this all works in depth here". Essentially, the Grail's corruption by Angra Mainyu would have twisted any wish into destruction (which is why it was so willing to grant Kiritsugu's wish, since doing it with his methods would have caused a great tragedy.) Kirei's wish was straightforward destruction, so it went to him and *tried* to grant his wish, but Kiritsugu understood the nature of the Grail and had Saber destroy it before it could properly grant the wish, which is why the apocalypse stopped where it did. So Kiritsugu won the war, Kirei was given the wish and the wish itself was aborted before it could be granted.

>BTW can someone give me a tl;dr about Angra Mainyu?

No way to do this without Third Holy Grail War spoilers, but I'll keep them as light as i can. [Angra Mainyu spoilers](/s "He was an ordinary man who was blamed as the embodiment of all the world's evils by his people, who did horrible things to him and wished for all the world's evils to be collected in him so the world could be good. He passed into legend as a Persian god. In the Third Holy Grail War, the Einsberns bent the rules of the Holy Grail War to summon Angra Mainyu as the unique Avenger-class. The Grail is a wish-granting object, so the Grail tried to grant the wishes that the villagers filled him with after he was killed. This sort of worked, but in return it tainted the Grail. This is why wishes it grants are twisted, and why someone like Gilles de Rais can be summoned as a Heroic Spirit despite not being a heroic figure.")

honestly, heaven's feel spoilers, since heaven's feel is the route that explains a lot about the holy grail war itself.
>> ARTICLE
If you are not into VN games dont force yourself since its quite a long task plus the Fate route (the first route you would play) is considered boring till later parts by many people . 

My only tip to you is that lower your expectations not because its bad but fate/zero is really different than F/SN as a whole apart from the premise of the Holy Grail War .

Your going to get alienated if you play it right now or in the next few days since in  Fate/stay Night Romance is a big part as well as there is many Slice of Life scenes which Fate/Zero did not have at all  . 

I always said If you can make it past the boring first few half of the Fate route then there is a big chance you would stick to it and be a fan of the series 
>> ARTICLE
Yea, waaay too much talking about breakfast and food preperation in general in the beginning of the FSN VN lol
>> ARTICLE
It's mainly boring because 80% of the fate route is spoiled by zero. Sabers identity (which isn't revealed until halfway through), Gilgamesh and kirei.
>> ARTICLE
Shhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiit that doesn't sound good....but I want more regardless!
>> ARTICLE
Just treat it as a new Fate series and less of a Fate/zero sequel .

Treat it as Fate/stay night and not Fate/zero 2 if that make sense...

For me its still worth it since even though its obviously different than Fate/zero the idea of the Holy grail war is still  exciting and what made it popular in the first place
>> ARTICLE
So I should expect thematic differences?
>> ARTICLE
There's a huge thematic difference.  The Fate route is a lot of world building (which could be tedious for you to read, since you already have an idea of what the world is like from F/Z), but if you can make it through that you'll like it.  Personally, although they are incredibly related, I treat them as two different series.  For all three routes, they start out with a ton of slice of life scenes that develop the characters.  Depending on whether you like the characters or not, these scenes can either be very fun or extremely tedious.  I, for one, enjoyed them.  If you wanted the continuation of Zero (stuff with Sakura, angra mainyu, and a much darker theme that's a lot like Zero), then you could just read the Heaven's Feel route, but you wouldn't get the full experience.  Each route serves to develop Shirou's character further, and a lot of the impact of Heaven's Feel comes from comparing its events to those of the first two routes.  Overall, I would say that I like the VN *as a whole* better than Zero, but there's gonna be a jarring difference in tone from Zero to the VN.  It's only to be expected - because Zero was a prequel, it allowed for the villains to win and for the protagonists to die, whereas Fate was the original and was therefore a slightly more standard story (even though each route has great twists)
>> ARTICLE
Not going to lie, all these comments are making me worry. I guess I can only tell how it if I read it myself. 
>> ARTICLE
I just got done with the Fate route yesterday after watching Fate/Zero last well. It was amazing. And this is supposed to be the worst one.
>> ARTICLE
I'm reading it right now. It's pretty good, but those meals are way too fucking dragged out. I thought that they were just part of the slice-of-life introduction part but I'm 10 hours in and there are still 10 minute-long scenes of describing breakfast.  
Could you fucking not???
>> ARTICLE
Haha, the SoL scenes do drag on forever. I guess I had forgotten about it since I was so far gone from the beginning. It's soooo damn long.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I would never want to turn you off to the VN, because it is (in my olinion) absolutely spectacular.  You shouldn't let the comments make you worry - you just need to go in with an open mind.  If you go in expecting Fate/Zero 2.0, then you won't get what you're expecting, and it may dissapoint you *because* you were expecting the wrong thing.  On the other hand, if you go in blind (like I did) and like the characters(which I think you will, they're very well developed and relatable), then you're going to have an amazing experience.  The characters feel more human than those in F/Z did - they have their own goals, ethics, and (most) have morals.  They're not killing machines that have been training their entire lives for a war, they're schoolchildren/inexperienced mages that were thrust into a war that happened 50 years too early.  Overall, its still an incredible experience, and I can't recommend it enough.  So far I've recommended it to 6 of my friends in real life, and each one of them has enjoyed it tremendously.  If you want, you can skip some of the world building by watching the prologue episode + episode one of the Ufotable UBW anime - they cover up to about day 3 of the visual novel.  From then on, you would want to read the visual novel so that you can read the Fate route - it introduces characters, develops them extremely well and sets up UBW and HF.  You can theoretically just watch the UBW anime/read the HF route, but I would personally say that doing anything but reading the entire VN is a mistake. If its not for you, then don't force yourself through it.  But I'd say you should give it till about day 9 or 10 of the Fate route until you make that decision - at that point, the world building is largely over and the plot moved quickly for the rest of the visual novel.  If you do decide to read it, let me know what you think of it - I always love hearing what people think about the VN. Also, if you go to the r/fatestaynight subreddit, they have a great installation guide that could help you if you need it.

Fate/Zero is about all kinds of conflicting beliefs, as virtually every Master and Servant brings their own unique worldview to the table, and are then explored. Many of the Masters are competent adults knowing what they're getting into, and fighting viciously to get what they want.

Fate/Stay Night is largely an exploration of a single character's worldview, following three branching paths in which it is challenged in different ways. The Masters are younger and wetter behind the ears because the Grail War takes place 50 years early and no one is prepared for it. This leads to stories where the main character is woefully unprepared, doesn't take the war as seriously as he should at first (the slice of life portion), and then finds himself struggling against the odds (the intense life or death portion).

The MC in Stay Night is Shirou, Kiritsugu's adopted kid, and its the story about the ideals he inherited from his father. "I want to be a hero."
>> ARTICLE
> the Grail War takes place 50 years early and no one is prepared for it.

~~40 years early.  supposed to happen every 50 years, but~~ derp, i apparently can't read.

but still, the 5th happened only 10 years after the 4th (primarily because of [reasons](/s "the leftover mana from the servants that the holy grail ate that were not converted into 'wish'"), which is gotten into in heaven's feel.)
>> ARTICLE
Nope, 60 years

Fate/complete material III: World material - FAQ with Nasu: Holy Grail War, p.131
Q: Even though it should only happen every 60 years, was the 10 year gap between the Fourth and Fifth Holy Grail Wars as short as it was because the Lesser Grail was destroyed before the Greater Grail could direct the accumulated mana to establish its pathway trapped some unused mana in the Grail? 

A: Thats true.
>> ARTICLE
well shit, as i was.
>> ARTICLE
I always thought it was a very odd number to have for a recurring event. 50 seemed more "right".  But that's why I remember its 60, its just weird.
>> ARTICLE
That can work but I already know I'll miss the conflicting ideals :/
>> ARTICLE
Do NOT expect Fate/Zero 2.0, you will not get that.

The point-of-view "problem" isn't as black or white as people make it out to be. Yes, most of the time, you will be experiencing the story from Shirou's perspective, but important scenes of other characters will always be shown in interlude scenes, where the protagonist has no influence on. You'll still get to see a lot of different ideologies presented, just not as *evenly* spread out like in Fate/Zero. And I'm using the word 'evenly' very carefully here, because a lot of the Masters in Fate/Zero are very robotic, in a sense that they kinda represent some sort of ideology, but it is only rarely expanded upon: Kayneth, Tokiomi and Ryuunosuke all suffer from this, while a select core cast of characters get more screen time for proper development and character study.

Fate/Stay Night kinda works the same way, with the only difference being that you're stuck in an 1st person perspective most of the time. To compensate for this, interludes following other characters are actually very frequent. But the 1st person perspective is very important in F/SN, because of one core element that Fate/Zero lacks: mystery. Slowly unraveling something the game didn't yet fully explain to you before is actually a lot of fun and adds a very nice sense of suspense to the VN. In a way, F/SN is about finding out how and why exactly, while F/Z is more about skipping the details and getting down to business (which F/SN also doesn't lack). Both have their merits, they're just different.

Fate/Zero is an expansion on the already pre-existing story of Fate/Stay Night, but it was written in a way so that it can be translated into anime very easily: linear.

The storytelling of the Fate/Stay Night VN is not linear. It follows three thematic arcs that build off of each other, while at the same time depicting the same starting point from which on the protagonist will go down his journey. It then starts diverging via the butterfly effect, leading the player to one of many possible endings (which includes 40 bad endings).

Each single route isn't all that amazing by themselves, the strength of the VN comes from how well it uses its format of non-linear storytelling. This in turn makes the VN as a whole (all 3 routes combined) one of the best reading experiences I've ever had because you can get a ton of amazingly implemented non-linear thematic connections when analyzing the entire story on a meta-level.

My biggest advice I'll give you would be: Be open-minded and also keep in mind that the story was written and completed before 2004 when the author was still fairly inexperienced and was trying to establish himself. There can be a lot of weird and jarring sounding phrases in the VN because of that - not to mention the sex scenes that were mostly shoehorned in to raise game sales (it was necessary back in those days otherwise the company would have probably tanked). But don't let those very superficial negative elements discourage you from further exploring the world presented. It is regarded as one of the most interesting fictional universes to immerse oneself into for a good reason.

Have a good time with the VN and if there are any questions left, feel free to ask around on /r/fatestaynight

I don't have anything to add but I'd just like make sure that /u/seninn acknowledges this because I think it's absolutely spot on.

It helped! My thanks to both of you!

It depends on the route your playing/reading. 

For example in Unlimited Blade Works its about Shirou and his Ideals and Dreams (which is to become a Hero of justice) so Kiritsugu is going to get mentioned here  because he is the biggest reason why he wants to become a Hero in the first place. 


For Heavens Feel that route would test him how much is he willing to sacrifice (body,dreams,ideals)for the one  person very important to him if he really wants to become a hero . Also in here is the continuation of the Kotomine Kirei storyline from Fate/zero plus the secrets and how the Holy Grail Works (the matou family would play big part here just like in Fate/zero) 

Also shirou is not the same on every route  when it comes to his ideals and main romantic relationship .


**Edit:** I forgot to mention the most important thing .

 Fate/zero tells their story differently than Fate/Stay night .Fate/Zero focus on everyone like Game of Thrones so you know whats everyone is doing and their plans there was no clear protagonist in Fate/zero for the first half of the series.

While Fate/stay Night focus on Shirou Emiya and his buddies for 90% of the time everything that happens goes through him and what he thinks of the situations that is happening . 
>> ARTICLE
Ffffffffff what you wrote in the edit is worrying. I **REAAAALY** fucking like that aspect...oh well, I can't be dissuaded now but I'll lower my expectations.
>> ARTICLE
I just recently finished fate stay/ night ubw and liked it almost as much fate/zero. The big thing about stay/night for me was all the parallels and references with zero and the other stay night( yes the not spoken of Deen version)

While the others don't have the GoT type perspective and focus on developing a handful of characters they're still worth watching because the best thing about the fate franchise is even though all of them are good stand alone stories, the crossovers and connections between them is what really makes them awesome.
>> ARTICLE
 Yeah thats one of the biggest appeal of Fate/Zero and why it works so well as an anime on a war setting . 

Im only saying this to you cause I always see you in the re watch lol so just giving some advice so you wont hate the franchise as a whole because it did not meet your expectations for being different.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I certainly don't want to hate it but if it just doesn't have the aspects I love so much about F/Z then naturally I won't enjoy it as much :/
>> ARTICLE
I know he's scaring you, but I wouldn't take it too much to heart.  Even if you want to say the themes etc of F/Z are strictly better, he's still talking down a 9.5 in relation to a 10.  F:S/N is still better than 99% of the junk that gets put out.
>> ARTICLE
You shouldn't expect the character arcs set up by Fate/Zero to tie up nicely either, there's three routes so that's about 60 hours for everything to wrap up. Things you are already expecting to see happen won't until a long long time has passed.

Expect highschool anime shenanigans, originaly the VN  was heavy on the mystery side of things and had you second guessing at all times because you don't even know who is a magus, let alone a Master, not even that Kiritsugu was a Master himself or Saber's identity. Shirou doesn't know jack-shit about the families or even what the Grail is, so you'll get to see him *slowly* find out about everything you already know about.

The *higschool mystery* is only going to be *highschool stuff* for you.

F/SN isn't a battle royale either, it's more of a ritual that the main character is trying to stop rather than participate in. Same setting but different writers and completly different structures, the themes are the similar though.

If you are not familiar with VNs it's going to be even more grating, the translation is terribad and the presentation is not something you are used to. I like F/SN quite a bit more than F/Z but honestly I don't think I'd even bother to even finish it the first route had I watched F/Z first.

Take it for a spin and if you don't like it there's a lot of other good VNs out there. I'd recommend playing a VN that's a bit shorter so you can familirise yourself before diving deep into something so long that you might not even enjoy.

IT ALL COMES TUMBLING DOWN
>> ARTICLE
Kirei vs Kiritsugu was so hyped. I love how they don't even exchange any words, just immediately charge into killing each other like the sworn enemies and profession killers they are.

The last two episodes is basically Saber and Kiritsugu trying to one up each other as to whom has it worse. And as always being Kiritsugu is suffering. Guy wins the grail only to find out it has been corrupted into the most evil thing of all. He destroys it and is then he's cursed by the grail and slowly until he dies. five years later....one of my favorite anime characters truly have one of the most tragic stories in anime. Rest now Kiritsugu....as a hero of justice.
>> ARTICLE
I kinda realized something, couldn't he be summoned as a future servant ?
>> ARTICLE
It's extremely unlikely that Kiritsugu could come back, as he did not make enough of an impact on the world to register on the Throne of Heroes.

*The Magus Killer*, on the other hand, might have a chance. That figure is a small legend in the magical community. But if he were summoned, his personality would be what everyone *thinks* Kiritsugu is like, rather than what he is - just as Iskandar differs a bit from his historical counterpart (as revealed in his discussion with Waver at the library).
>> ARTICLE
If the "Magus killer" was summoned, wouldn't he be a wraith rather than a hero?
>> ARTICLE
Nah. When it comes to servants it's extremely unlikely that modern age mages or heroes can become servants. I think it has to do with the fact that using modern weapons has made battle less heroic and more akin to slaughter. Something along those lines....I'm not an expert on the Nasuverse. I also think you have to make a contract with the universe to come back as a heroic spirit but that could also be incorrect.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're correct, pretty much.  I think there's also the fact that there's so many people in the world of talent in the Nasuverse that almost anyone of so much power to do anything with it would be taken out before they would really become a world renown hero, which is what it requires to be a part of the grail.  To be seen as a hero by the grail, you have to have a legacy.  It's a lot harder to do with a big mage organization and church that will take you down if you start revealing the fact that magic exists or doing anything major.
>> ARTICLE
Given his old line of work I think he'd fit perfectly in assassin class especially if you could get a hold of his Contender or even better one of his remaining bullets as a summoning catalyst.
>> ARTICLE
Of course,  but as we have seen with certain characters in the Naruverse the possibility exist. He is just like Batman.....except with guns. He is the hero that we need, but not deserve

I thought Kariya killed Aoi? On a side note, Kirei is a cold man for giving Rin the dagger he killed her father with. 

>> ARTICLE
That whole scene is darkly funny due to, knowing what we know about Kirei, how obviously he's trying to get Rin to crack. Pretty much everything he says is a steadily worse thing about her life now.
>> ARTICLE
The body will typically shut down or cause you to pass out from being without oxygen before dying if I recall correctly.  It's sort of a defense mechanism.  So, Kariya probably strangled her until she passed out, then stopped when he thought he had killed her.  The time she was without oxygen was enough to cause brain damage, though.
>> ARTICLE
My pet theory is both Aoi's survival and brain damage were caused by the sadistic, magical healer who just so happened to be nearby.
>> ARTICLE
That's what makes Kirei so good. 

He don't give a fuck! He just wants to see the world burn.
>> ARTICLE
While at the same time being mad at himself for wanting to see the world burn. Kirei is nuanced like that.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure Kariya didn't kill her, Aoi suffered from... Uh brain damage?? If you've read the VN [fsn spoiler] (/s "it's said that Rin's mother died some time during the 10 years")
>> ARTICLE
She got the brain damage as a result of the strangling. A lack of oxygen fucks up your brain pretty badly relatively quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Man, it was so sad seeing her at the very end. [spoilers](/s "Not knowing that Tokiomi was dead and Sakura is gone.")
>> ARTICLE
Saber's exchange with Lancelot is the part that always stands out for me as one of the saddest exchanges for Saber, as a sort of brutal manifestation of the Kings meeting with Gilgamesh and Iskander. 

This is basically her worst case scenario for her actions not being suitable for a leader: her selflessness  causing Lancelot so much pain, and yet he affirms the knight's loyalty to her.

Fucking heart breaking.
>> ARTICLE
When I watched this as my first entry into the fate series the ending seemed kind of weird, but now it's amazing seeing things come full circle.
>> ARTICLE
>Emiya Kiritsugu, you truly are Angra Mainyu. The one worthy to bear all the evil in the world.

I thought it was funny to see the Grail call Kiritsugu that because, considering Angra Mainyu backstory in Heavens Feel, if he was in that position, I think Kiritsugu would accept that fate.

I'm not going to add any spoilers because it's very easy to hover over.

**First Time Watcher Alert**

Episode 24:

* And here it is, the final duel!
* Both of these fights are KICKIN!
* Kiritsugu's gonna have a tough one.
* I'm really curious how a boot to the face can dent a stone column

* Now THAT's a bullet
* That grail be fucking shit up and shit's not even over yet

* So now we're in a mindfuck anime?
* This is some Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind shit
* Holy shit this is pretty dark. No Aoi strangling dark, but still pretty dark
* HOLY FUCK HOLY FUCK NO, STOP IT NO, DON'T SHOOT ILLYA
* HE DOES SUFFER, BUT STILL, HOLY FUCK
* K, so how does Kirei escape the bullet to the head? I so confuzzled
* Wife? Lol, wut. OH RIGHT, FATE ROUTE, I forgot he even wanted Saber, it's been so long since Fate route.
* Destroy the Grail.... [UBW](/s "this is UBW all over again")

Episode 25: 

* How will they stretch out the finale? Mostly an epilogue I assume.
* Saber is regret ;_;
* Oh right, the town is supposed to burn, I forgot about that
* True suffering, Kiritsugu being unable to help anyone

* THIS FUCKING DAGGER!!!!!!!!!!! KIREI YOU ARE SUCH AN ASSHOLE
* Saber is regret
* OH SO THAT'S WHY KIRITSUGU NEVER WENT TO SEE ILLYA
* So weird hearing Mona Marshall's voice come out of Shirou, I actually like Mona Marshall's voice, but I've always hated Shirou's JP seiyuu
* And the stage is set for F/SN, Kiritsugu accidentally warps Shirou's mind into wanting to be a hero of justice. So sad.

Overall: Amazing finale, perfect way to end the series. just the right amount of awesome, despair, and regret. I am so curious why Aoi never shows up in Fate/Stay Night though. Final Verdict on the Fate series?

Unfortunately this is something the anime skipped for time reasons.  From what I recall, the light novel explained that Kirei's clothes had runes inscribed throughout to protect himself. 


> HOW IS SHE NOT DEAD!? SHE GOT STRAIGHT UP STRANGLED

Strangling someone doesn't necessarily mean they will die.  In order to protect itself and use less resources, the body will shut down when you are without oxygen.  You'll pass out, basically.  Granted, any time you have without oxygen will start causing brain damage, but you won't die unless you continue to be strangled after passing out.
>> ARTICLE
This is more of a question about UBW, but when [UBW ending spoilers](/s "Gilgamesh is killed by Shirou, what happens to him? Does he go back to being a Servant, or is he gone forever?")
>> ARTICLE
All servants killed pretty much root to power up the lesser grail, servants are copies of the throne versions anyways. 
>> ARTICLE
gone back to the throne to hang out
>> ARTICLE
That particular incarnation of the character dies. Whenever a Servant is summoned, it's basically a photocopy of the "Master Version" hanging out in the Throne of Heroes. It doesn't remember anything about any earlier "photocopies" made, and the "Master copy" isn't updated with anything that happens to the summoned version. 

The big exception to this is [Fate](/s "Saber, since she isn't actually dead yet - she's getting pulled from Camlann to any possible future where she can get the Grail, as the price she demanded for becoming a Guardian. This is why she can't go incorporeal like other Servants, and why she retains her memories from one war to the next.")
>> ARTICLE
[FZ](/s "That still applies to Gilgamesh even though he was given corporeal form by the Grail?")
>> ARTICLE
Its the same instance preserved from disappearing in that particular case, not a reinstantiation from the master copy.
>> ARTICLE
That fight scene was crazy :S
>> ARTICLE
The scene with Rin and Aoi destroyed me.
>> ARTICLE
So only question left is, is it the grail's the one who is lamenting Kiritsugu's betrayal or is it Irisviel? I feel that Irisviel died too abruptly D: [UBW](/s "Also the one who visits Ilya in the snowy castle, is that the grail too?")

Oh and why did the grail stop spouting curses on its own? It was filled with the power of 5 servants I expect it to go a lot longer than just engulfing a mere section of the city.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been watching it with everyone (I just purchased the Box Sets for my birthday!) , but from what I remember she's the vessel of the Grail and as she's dying she realizes her conscious is merging with the Grail which I would assume the Grail then uses her image both here with Kiritsugu and that scene in UBW but since the Grail isn't all it's cracked up to be its essentially an evil version of Irisviel.
>> ARTICLE
you're right 
>> ARTICLE
Not entirely, she did merge, however she is the spitting image of the Juztease humonculus model. 
>> ARTICLE
Big spoiler but the humonculus model that works as lesser grail is a copy of the original greater grail up to Illya wich is considered on part with the original due to being a miracle on her own. 

That's why the essence of the grail is similar to Irisviel, and why Zouken dialogue with the nexus memories of the greater grail trough Irisviel is important.

Let's not forget Irisviel last wish wich was to remain herself, so Angra Manyuu on a sense stored a perfect version of her due to his affinity with wishes. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure I'm following you at all. So the grail also expresses her will and not only using her image? Didn't she determined to die for the sake of Kiritsugu's wish?
>> ARTICLE
Angra Manyuu is not a hero himself but the manifestation of collective wishes for him to take on all sins, as he lacks a concept of self he sees the object of fulfilling wishes as self validation, hence why it corrupted the grail so easily and even sees non good heroic spirits as Giles acceptable for the Grail war. And will try to get wishes to himself in other to fulfill them. 

Irisviel last wish upon seeing the true warped nature of the grail was to remain herself, so Angra Manyuu stored her information in a vein of conserving her to fulfill her wish. It's something similar as the events on Ataraxia altough Urobochi got this right by a fluke. 

Angra Manyuu lacking a concept of self manifests to other trough common imagery, in the case of Kiritsugu it exploited the fact it had Irisviel stored wich is also easy as the Juztease model was the basis for the greater grail wich became the embodiment of Angra Manyuu. 
>> ARTICLE
Do we ever find out why Gil was spat out and given a new life by the grail?
>> ARTICLE
Secret wish?
>> ARTICLE
It's more discussed in FSN, but the grail's original purpose was to materialize a soul, the Third Magic.
>> ARTICLE
Spoiler for the VN

Essentially what happened was the Grail showed everyone it consumed the horrors of the world and specifically what humanity inflicted on itself. Gilgamesh within the Grail sees all this and basically says something along the lines of "Because I'm the King of Kings and rightful ruler of the world, all of this is my responsibility to bear and I forgive you for my lapse of duty." At which point the Grail decides to spit him out with a healthy dose of almost immortality.
>> ARTICLE
didn't he lacked immortality? he said so in his fight with ubw berserker right?
>> ARTICLE
~~almost immortality~~ You're a real boy now!
>> ARTICLE
Yes, there's a scene in the novel that the anime completely skipped where he's inside the Grail. The basic explanation that FSN also gives is that his ego was too much to be corrupted by all those curses, so he pretty much came out unscathed. The reincarnation is just a basic property of the mud.
>> ARTICLE
>  The basic explanation that FSN also gives is that his ego was too much to be corrupted by all those curses, so he pretty much came out unscathed.

IIRC that's the explanation Gil himself gives, but later on when Shirou is talking to Saber she disagrees. She says that due to his ego he able to retain a similar personality, albeit a crazier one, so he was corrupted to some degree.
>> ARTICLE
Nope. It is stated multiple times in the VN that he was untainted by the grail and it had no effect on him.
>> ARTICLE
All of those instances are by Gilgamesh himself, both Saber and Kirei say that the grail must have corrupted him.

Kirei said he was untainted in Heavens Feel.

holy shit rins mother and Illyasviel
>> ARTICLE
Hi, first time watcher here. While I found this anime to be very good at times, I also found it very confusing at times. So bear with me, because my "review/thoughts" may be a bit lengthy.

So "good news" first: The concept of having characters from legends was interesting, I enjoyed that there were many characters with different ideals, goals and personalities. From Iskandar and his ideals to the ideals of Karia. All of the characters have their ideals and goals portrayed through their own lens, and I appreciated it. There was no authority or narrator to judge them for their goals, in a sense letting us as the viewer empathize with each character. In addition, the show contains a lot of variety when it comes to fighting, from spear vs sword battles, to dog fights, to fighting giant monsters the size of Godzilla. I also commend the show on how great some of its scenes were: Kariya choking Aoi, Kiritsugu's village turning to zombies, Iskandar's noble phantasm and the death of kayneth+diamuid.

The bad news. Let's start off with the plot... which can be quite confusing and disjointed at times. So we have the holy grail, a bit of its history and what it can do (we are somewhat led to believe that it is omnipotent). Next, we have each character introduced, the master and their respective servants (I should note that I don't really understand how each master summons their servant but w.e) and the world tournament, sorry the fourth holy grail war is about to begin. Now apparently there are rules to the war, and you're suppose to have a judge/ref/mediator from the church to ensure no rules are broken during the war. Although, we know barely know of the rule...and some of the rules that we do know end up being broken (mediator is killed and he transfers command spells to his son, who was suppose to be out of the war, but then magically ended up back in the war; the grail is suppose to be this omnipotent object, but in the end it seems like it's not really omnipotent, has a mind of its own and is very flawed in realizing the wish of the winner... even though apparently there was no winner?). The other issue I have with the plot is that the "War" doesn't really start taking place, and characters don't start dying off until the second season. The first season is about character exposition and a bit of progression but the real fighting start a season late. Another issue I have sometimes is the dialogue. I guess the author is trying to set up some sort of mystery around the character s(ex. gilgamesh and Kirei speaking before betraying Tohsaka), but the dialogue just ends up being very vague and confusing at times.

Lastly, some questions. Why is Kariya trying to kill the woman he loves, when there is no reason to suggest that he held any hostility towards her before (I should state that I do love this scene though, it was extremely well done). He was cast aside by her before by her marrying Tokoimi and he was still willing to save her, so why kill her now, it destroys the goal that he had throughout the whole series (being reunited with Sakura, Rin, Aoi; it doesn't make sense to me). Next,  how is Kirei still alive? Same with Gilgamesh? Aren't the servants suppose to disappear once the war is over? So the grail isn't all powerful? Why does the grail simply curse Kiritsugu when he says he doesn't want humanity saved the way he has been saving it (i.e by being a pragmatist and killing few or fewer so the many can live)? If the grail has the personality of Irisviel, then it would not act to curse Kiritsugu, Irisviel wouldn't even curse Kirei during her death, so why is Kiritsugu being cursed to a life of regret? Moreover, what is the point of fleshing out Kiristugu's character and the fact that he'll sacrifice the people he loves to attain his ideal of world peace by having him kill his daughter? We already knew Kiritsugu would sacrifice everything for his goal, he's killed people that he has loved in the past? and why are the einzbern's rejecting Kiritsugu when his wish couldn't be granted... the wish they wanted too as well, the wish they agreed with him on 8 years or more before the war??

Don't misunderstand I didn't set out to dislike the series, it was very enjoyable. I just couldn't help but express my critique of this series. Maybe I'm an idiot and didn't pay enough attention to the series so I asked some stupid questions or maybe I did, I don't know. And I probably should've watched stay night to get a better understanding of the series, since I do know that zero was a prequel and had a determined ending. Anyways still a good watch!:)
>> ARTICLE
You're unlikely to get a reply off someone else now since you're a bit late so I'll try my best to answer some of your questions, please note I haven't played the Fate/Stay Night VN but I have seen the Unlimited Blade Works anime. I'm not really that knowledgable about the Fate world.

I believe the stuff to do with the grail and the war as a whole is explained in the Heaven's Feel route of the VN. It's worth remembering that this is actually a prequel to Fate/Stay Night.

It's clear that Kariya is not in a mentally fit state at that point in the war. Aoi says something along the lines "How would you know, you've never loved anyone" and he just fucking snaps. It's an accumulation of everything he's been through rather than an in the moment thing.

I think Gilgamesh and Kirei actually won the war, hence their wishes were granted. Kirei's wish was for all that destruction and Gilgamesh's wish was for true incarnation.

I believe the Einzberns wanted the grail more than anything as that is the wish of the main 3 families (Matou, Tohasaka, Einzbern).

The Fate/Stay Night visual novel would probably clear up most of the questions you have but that is a long read. You could watch the UBW anime and wait for the Heaven's Feel movie(s).

>> ARTICLE
> I think Gilgamesh and Kirei actually won the war, hence their wishes were granted. Kirei's wish was for all that destruction and Gilgamesh's wish was for true incarnation.

In reality, there was no winner in the war; that is why the grail manifested 10 years later instead of 60.

Did Gilgamesh say he ever really wanted true incarnation? AFAIK he only really cared about sticking around after the grail did its thing.
>> ARTICLE
I know I'm late ahaha, no time to marathon it all yesterday, but thank you for your answer. I appreciate it! 

I'll try to read the novel and watch SN at some point to help me understand the story line a bit more!:)
>> ARTICLE
i have no idea what the anime is about. I thought Kirei was killed by Kiritsugu? Where did Saber go? How Assassin died? Why there will be destruction if the grail was being destroyed? Why Kiritsugu ordered Saber to destroy that?

>> ARTICLE
You're a little late to the party, but I was reading through this thread, so I'll do my best at answering your questions.

> I thought Kirei was killed by Kiritsugu?

He was. However, when the black mud pouring out of the Grail engulfed him, he was given new life, basically (same reason why Gilgamesh didn't disappear).

> Where did Saber go?

Because of certain circumstances, Saber doesn't reside where all the other spirits are (the Throne of Heroes). Instead, at the end you see are on top of a hill at the Battle of Camlann, which is where she awaits death (basic gist of it, to go deeper you need to talk some F/SN spoilers).

> How Assassin died?

Every part of Assassin was ordered to attack Rider, and then they were all killed inside Ionion Hetairoi. Since they were all there, there weren't any parts of him left after the attack. Kill all parts = dead for good.

> Why there will be destruction if the grail was being destroyed?

When Kiritsugu refuses the grail, it turns to Kirei and attempts to grant his wish instead. His wish being destruction. The only reason the destruction is contained like that is because the grail was destroyed before the wish could be completed.

> Why Kiritsugu ordered Saber to destroy that?

When shown how his wish would be accomplished (through a method that he knew himself), Kiritsugu realizes that the grail is corrupt, and not an omni-potent wish granting device. Because he realizes it's basically evil, he orders Saber to destroy it in an attempt to end the war (which is also the reason why the next war happens after 10 years, instead of 60 years).
>> ARTICLE
wow really appreciate for the explanation, but I still don't understand some of the point there, and yeah I watched F/SN too, my face is exactly the same while I watched the F/Zero.

on F/SN, I don't recall that it talked about Saber past, why did she ended up that the hill to awaits death? Does all the servant actually don't remember anything from the past war? What is the relationship between the archer and emiya? I remember when both of them fight, Saber do help Emiya to heal himself, and archer do talked something about the relation between Saber and Kiritsugu, may you elaborate this? 

So where is the servant located before they being summoned? What is the certain circumstances you mentioned there?
>> ARTICLE
Saber's past is explained in the Fate route of F/SN, so you'd have to play the VN for that (the anime follows the Unlimited Blade Works route, and the movie will follow Heaven's Feel route). But here's the gist of it:

[Fate Route Spoilers, I guess](/s "During Saber's last moments in life, at the Battle of Camlann (the hill) she regrets the decisions she's made to get to where she is, and yearns for the grail. Because of this, she makes a contract with the world. If it gives her the grail, she will agree to become part of the Counter Force (special subset of Heroic Spirits who are summoned to protect the earth itself). So in order for her to get the grail, she is frozen in time at the hill (meaning she can't die there until the deal is fulfilled), and is summoned into the Holy Grail War for a chance at winning the grail. So when the war is over, and she didn't get the grail, she goes back to the hill to await the next summoning. This is also the reason she can't go into spirit form like the other servants, because she is not dead yet.")

> Does all the servant actually don't remember anything from the past war?

No, servants don't remember anything between the wars. The reason for this is that their actual soul is located at the Throne of Heroes (read below), which exists outside of any timeline. When a servant is summoned, a copy of them is made and put into the timeline. When they die, that copy is simply deleted, and a new copy can be made the next time. The only exception to this is Saber, who remembers, because of what's said above.

> What is the relationship between the archer and emiya? 

[Major UBW Spoilers](/s "Simply put, Archer is Shirou from the future. This is why he's called 'Heroic Spirit EMIYA'. The long version is basically that in another timeline, Shirou made a pact with the world (almost like Saber), where the world gave him great power in life, so that he would later become part of the Counter Force in death. This is what Shirou deemed to be the right choice in order to become a hero of justice. But eventually he gave up on his own ideals, and so when he's summoned into the war, he tries to kill Shirou so that he won't grow up with the same fake ideals that he did.")

> I remember when both of them fight, Saber do help Emiya to heal himself, and archer do talked something about the relation between Saber and Kiritsugu, may you elaborate this?

Not entirely sure what you mean here, but I'll try. So Kiritsugu is Saber's master in F/Z. When she is summoned by Shirou in F/SN, she remembers the past war, so when he says his name is Emiya, she realizes he is related to Kiritsugu. But Shirou doesn't know any of this, and so I assume you're thinking about Archer explaining that it was Kiritsugu's and Saber's fault that the destruction happened, and Shirou almost died.

> So where is the servant located before they being summoned?

When a person dies, their soul is returned to what's called "the Root" (or Akasha), which is basically where all souls come from, and where they go after life (there's more to it, but not important to this). Akasha also exists outside of any timeline. When a person leaves great accomplishments behind on death, their soul instead goes to another place outside of the timeline, called the Throne of Heroes. This can happen because people acknowledge them as great people, because they made a pact with the world, or because of people's knowledge of them, basically. That is why people who didn't exist in reality, or who weren't "heroes" can be summoned, because people's knowledge of them or their legends make them "great people".

So their souls are stored at the Throne of Heroes. When the Grail War happens, and a master attemps to summon their servant, the Holy Grail actually does most of the work. It pulls a copy of a hero's soul (not the real version, just a copy) from the Throne of Heroes, and materializes it at a point in the timeline for the master to make a contract. When they die, or the war is over, that copy is destroyed and the real version remains at the Throne of Heroes for the next time.

[UBW Spoilers - Gilgamesh](/s "At the end of F/Z, Gilgamesh is also engulfed by the black mud, but because his ego is so large, the grail was unable to corrupt him, and spat him back out, but this time in a 'real' body, which allows him to remain in the world after the war is over. Because he also still has his contract with Kirei, he's still given mana to exist as well. When he is killed in UBW, that's still only a copy of him from F/Z, so the real Gilgamesh is still at the Throne of Heroes.")


>> ARTICLE
oh i see, now most of my question is answered, like why Saber can't be into Spirit form, I always wonder this for the entire anime. Btw, what is the ancient thing that those magician used to summon the servant? Where they get that? Is that thing necessary in order to get the servant summoned? Because what I recall in Fate/UBW, Shirou doesn't use any of them, is it because Saber is not dead yet? In the end of F/SN, did she died? or she just goes bk to the hills?

So you mean Saber is still remember the past while Kiritsugu asked her to destroy the grail? Because in Fate/SN, she doesn't seem angry, and seems like already forget everything, something like : "Nah I dont give a fuck to Kiritsugu anymore, now is Shirou time" I was curious about this, when Shirou mentioned about Emiya, Saber just gave a some kind of worry face, shouldn't she show angry face? lol

I was really confused when you talk about Throne of Heroes, because I didnt seen this in both anime season, the only thing I could relate to this, is when Saber explain to Shirou what actually happen while in Shirou house.

In this case, will you mind me to ask more? haha

Irisviel von Einzbern, what is this family do? they do beaker? the beaker to the holy grail? So this family can do alot of Irisviel? [F/SN Spoilers](/s "But why in Fate/SN, only the child of her and Kiritsugu remained? If the family can produce more beaker, the child wouldn't have to die right?")

The magic immune system(not sure what it called) across all magician house, what it do actually? The anime just simply said there is this thing in all magician house.

And the bullet, the Kiritsugu bullet, what it do actually?

The family system in this are so weird, something like, if your family need a heir to your magic, I had to gave you one of my child who have magic potential, and I got no feeling about it, not even sad or angry to this matter, why? LOL I was like stunned, she is tohsaka child right, how can they just gave other people? Oh yeah, and I thought Sakura is being fed with the worms? But in F/SN, she just like ordinary person, where is her magic power?

Kirei had contract with Gilgamesh? But how come he can still get Lancer?

I so sorry man for a lot of questioning, I even can't sleep after watched F/Zero, my mind is just keep thinking why, why this happen? how come this happen LOL
My friend told me to watch F/SN, because its easier to understand, in the end I broke the friendship with him after watched it LOL. But man, thanks for answering this! 
>> ARTICLE
> Btw, what is the ancient thing that those magician used to summon the servant?

They use an item that has significance to a certain heroic spirit. This is called a catalyst, and if it's use in the summoning, it basically guarantees that you'll get that specific servant. For example, when they summon Saber, they use Avalon as the catalyst, which is the sheath for Excalibur (her sword). This makes it so they're basically guaranteed to summon King Arthur. As for where they got it, they basically just excavated it from somewhere in Britain.

> Shirou doesn't use any of them, is it because Saber is not dead yet?

After F/Z, Kiritsugu decides he doesn't need Avalon anymore (remember he took that from Irisviel, and it has healing powers and all), so he implants it into Shirou as a child. The shed where Saber is summoned is the same shed where they put Irisviel to heal, so there's already a magic circle there, and since Avalon was nearby, the Grail helped summon Saber.

> In the end of F/SN, did she died? or she just goes bk to the hills?

[F/SN End Spoilers](/s "She goes back to the hill (since she didn't get the grail). A summoned servant can not 'die' as in they're dead forever. If they 'die', they just go back to where they were (the hill for Saber, or Throne of Heroes for the others)").

> So you mean Saber is still remember the past while Kiritsugu asked her to destroy the grail?

Yes, she does. I can't really tell you why she's not angry, though. I guess she doesn't see a point in being angry at Shirou for something that Kiritsugu did.

> Throne of Heroes

Yea, the Throne of Heroes isn't talked about in the anime. Take a look at [this picture](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/typemoon/images/5/56/Thrones_of_Heroes_diagram.png/revision/latest?cb=20131001103333). The top picture is what happens when someone who should become a heroic spirit dies. Their soul (the red dot) gets removed from the timeline, and put outside of it at the Throne of Heroes. The bottom picture shows what happens when it's summoned. A clone of the actual soul is made, and summoned into the timeline. As for what the Throne of Heroes actually is, I'm not sure it's explained any more than being a place outside of the timeline that houses heroic spirits.

> Irisviel von Einzbern

Irisviel is not a real human, but a homunculus. The Einzbern family specializes in alchemy, and so they're really good at creating "artificial bodies". After the 3rd Holy Grail War (the one before F/Z) the Grail was damaged in battle, so the war could never be completed properly, so for the 4th war (F/Z) the Einzbern family created a body for the grail, which is what Irisviel is. Simply put, she is the grail, but made into a real body so that it can protect herself. The reason she feels emotions and all like a real human is because she spent a very long time with Kiritsugu.

> What about Illyasviel?

They could have created another Irisviel, definitely, but Illyasviel (their daugther) is considered to be a miracle on her own, and the "next step forward" in terms of a homunculus. This is because while she's created through powerful alchemy, she was born through natural birth (because they modified Irisviel to give her a womb). 

[F/SN Illya Spoilers](/s " Illyasviel herself is heavily modified as well. Her body is actually about 70% magic circuits. She can also serve as the grail vessel, should Irisviel die (which she did). Because she's not fully a real human either, that's why she still looks like a kid in F/SN (she's actually 18 in F/SN), because her growth stops. But yes, had Kiritsugu made his wish, then the war would be over and Illya wouldn't have to be the grail vessel.")

> The magic immune system(not sure what it called) across all magician house, what it do actually?

Magic Field/Bounded Field (the former is how they translate it in the anime). Does different things, depending on who set it up and what they want it to do. The one around Shirou's house only alerts him of intruders, nothing else.

> And the bullet, the Kiritsugu bullet, what it do actually?

Short version: It cuts any active magic circuits, and reconnects them improperly, so they become unusable. This means that the more of the magic crest is active, the more damage it'll do.

Long version: In Fate/, there's something called "Origin". This is like a driving force that determines certain details and general actions of a person. I thin it's pretty difficult to explain properly, so I'm not going to say more about that for now. In any case, Natalia powders a part of Kiritsugu (his ribs) into bullets. She calls those bullets his "mystic code". 

A Mystic Code is like a tool designed to help a magus. They can either amplify one's own energy (Rin's jewels are like that), or they can have a predetermined usage (which Kiritsugu's bullets have). 

So what Kiritsugu's Mystic Code actually does is that it "manifests" his Origin in his target. His Origin is "severing" and "binding", so that's why it has that effect on the body, where it messes with the magic circuits.

> The family system

Alright so, magi have this Magic Crest, right? This allows them to use magecraft, and the more developed their crest is, the better they can use magecraft, basically. However, it takes a very long time to develop a magic crest, so it's common for a parent to pass on their crest to their child upon their death. This way, the child gets all the magical power that the parent had collected during their life, instead of having to "start over".

Since Kariya left the Matou family (because he didn't want to be a mage), and Shinji isn't a mage, the Matou family don't have a proper heir. Tohsaka had two heirs, so he was willing to give away one of them, since he can only give his crest to one of them (he could technically give it to both, but it would split the power). His reasoning is basically that Sakura is still a member of the Tohsaka family deep down, and now she'll get the chance to become a mage, and fulfill the Tohsaka dream in the next Holy Grail War.

That's also the reason Shirou is so bad at magecraft, even though Kiritsugu was a mage. Shirou couldn't inherit Kiritsugu's magic crest, and since he wasn't a mage to begin with, that just means he's starting from zero.

> Sakura is being fed with the worms? But in F/SN, she just like ordinary person, where is her magic power?

Interacting with the worms don't necessarily make you look all fucked up, that's just a side effect of Kariya doing it all in a single year (for Sakura it would be more like 10 years, at least). And she does have magic power. [F/SN Heaven's Feel Spoilers](/s "In fact, Sakura is actually the real master of Rider. She just doesn't want to participate in the war, so she gives the rights as a master to Shinji.")

> Kirei had contract with Gilgamesh? But how come he can still get Lancer?

He's a dirty cheater, that's why. [F/SN Spoilers](/s "He isn't the original master of Lancer, so he wasn't the one to summon him. An Irish master originally summons Lancer, but is killed by Kirei, who takes on the role of his master.") There's technically no rule that says you can only have one servant, it's just that the grail won't help you summon another one, and it'll put a lot of stress on you to supply mana for multiple servants. This isn't a problem for Kirei since he doesn't need to summon Lancer, and most of his mana goes towards Lancer (because of circumstances with Gilgamesh). Either way, Kirei is a really powerful mage, and has a lot of untapped magic energy in the form of the unused Command Spells on his arm.

----

No problem about the questions, man, I'm happy to help!
>> ARTICLE
so you mean sakura will also become like Kariya in the end when the side effect start to take place?

Oh ya you mentioned about magic circuit, what the hell is this thing? Is it some kind of "tools" in your body that let you use magic? how come they are some people only have 30% of magic circuit, but some else have higher, how they accumulate this figure?

The Magic Crest, is that something like a fortune for a family? But they have to keep on grinding and grinding to make it more powerful? Just like we play war games, we have to grind gold and minerals?

[F/SN Spoilers](/s "Rin do pass her magic crest to Shirou right, if that thing was so valuable, then the entire situation is like : this is my life work, take it Shirou?") Wow, that amount of sacrifice...

I heard that the magician needed some kind of energy providing to those servant? What is that actually?

I still don't understand about the Illyasviel, if she is so special, why dont the Einzbern family keep her safe? Its like you just left your jewelry on the bus stop. Does the Einzbern family have anyone else leftover? Because from the anime, I only saw Illyasviel, and 2 servant. 

What is Counter Force? The anime didnt mention about this too.

So whats the ending for F/SN? [F/SN Spoilers](/s "Shirou rejected that job, what is that job about?") What about Rin? What is she going to do next?

Big thanks again mate!
>> ARTICLE
> so you mean sakura will also become like Kariya in the end when the side effect start to take place?

Not necessarily. Look at Zouken (the grandpa dude). He's really old, but he's not like that, and his magical energy comes from the worms as well. Sakura has had a long time for her body to get used to the worms, and her "training" wasn't as extreme as Kariya's either.

> you mentioned about magic circuit, what the hell is this thing?

Think of Magic Circuits as an additional nervous system that runs through your body. Instead of being nerves, however, they allow you to convert life force into magical energy and perform magecraft. Unless I'm mistaken, the amount of circuits you have is determined upon birth. The average magus supposedly has around 20 circuits, while Rin for example has 40 main circuits. But numbers isn't everything, as quality of circuits also plays a role. Shirou actually has 27 circuits, which is a lot, but they are of very low quality.

> The Magic Crest, is that something like a fortune for a family?

Ok so, let's start from the bottom on this one. You decide to engrave a magic circle on your body. This allows you to eventually merge your magic circuits with the crest, to store all the magical knowledge that you've collected during your life. With that knowledge stored inside the crest, the spells stored will become easier to activate, for example (such as not having to do an incantation).

You then have a child, and this child would have to go through that exact same process. Because of this, it would take a very, very talented mage to be able to constantly surpass their elder in terms of knowledge. Basically, it's a waste of time having to start over every time.

To bypass this, you decide that when you die, you will transfer your magic crest to your child. That child now has access to all of the magical knowledge that you stored inside the crest, and it can build upon the information from there. When the child grows up, its circuits will also merge with the crest and store whatever information they gathered, until they pass it on to their child.

This means that the longer you've passed down your crest for, the more powerful the owner of it is. That's also why you don't want to split it between several children, as it takes away generations of work.

As for [F/SN Spoiler](/s "Rin passing her crest to Shirou, that's a weird one. See, a magic crest is like an organ, so it requires a compatible host. Most of the time this means someone in the same family, but even then they have to do it slowly during the childhood to avoid problems. Therefore, Rin can't really give Shirou her entire crest. What she does is she gives him a makeshift piece of her crest. It won't last for all of his life (wiki says about a week), and she didn't really lose her entire crest, it was more of a way for her to share some of her magical energy with Shirou so that he could manifest UBW.")

> I heard that the magician needed some kind of energy providing to those servant? What is that actually?

Mana. Magical energy. As I said above, magical energy is generated by converting life force, so mana and life force are the same (that's why Rider says it would have killed Waver if he had used his supplies to use Ionion Hetairoi twice. The servants are spirits who require mana to remain manifested in the world. This mana is provided by the master, which is why they say they're their "anchor to this world", and also why a servant will disappear shortly after their master dies. The more powerful the master (the more mana it can provide), the more a servant can use their abilities freely.

> Illyasviel, if she is so special, why dont the Einzbern family keep her safe?

They do keep her safe. At the end of F/Z, Kiritsugu tries to go back to see her, but the Einzbern family keeps him out with a magic field (because he destroyed the grail, so he betrayed them). So Illya stays at the Einzbern castle until it's time for the 5th Holy Grail War, at which point she travels to Fuyuki to fight. While she is the grail vessel, she is also the Einzbern trump card. A homunculus born from a human/homunculus relationship, consisting of 70% magic circuits. She's very, very powerful as a mage, and summoning a really strong servant helps her even more. However, if she is to fail in the war, the Einzbern family can just create new homunculi (although maybe not as powerful as Illya).

> What is Counter Force?

The Counter Force is often called the "Will of the Earth", but basically it's a group of spirits that make sure the Earth, and humanity, won't come to an end. When needed, these spirits will be summoned to stop whatever is threatening the world. [F/SN Spoiler](/s "Archer is part of the Counter Force. When you see him appear in all those different places, killing people, that would be him being summoned by the world.") So the world grants you power in life, and once you die, it stores your soul so that it can summon you with that same power later on as well.

> So whats the ending for F/SN?

[F/SN Ending Spoilers](/s "Rin goes back to studying magecraft, and Shirou becomes her apprentice, but when Shirou is offered to be officially accepted into the Clock Tower (like the headquarters for the Mage's Association), he says that he has different plans. So he and Rin travels the world, although Rin is still with the Clock Tower.")

There's an entry in the Fate/ series (don't remember which one) where [F/ Series Spoiler](/s "Rin and adult Waver actually go back to end the Holy Grail War once and for all after the 5th HGW. This takes place after the UBW route, if I'm not mistaken.")
>> ARTICLE
Now I can understand 80% of the story by your explanation, this really solve my insomnia LOL.

So the archer in F/SN is actually summoned? I thought he was travel from place to place. Oh ya the Zouken grandpa, how he die?

How you guys got so much details about this fate trilogy, the anime didnt even explain so much, or does it?

The catalyst you mentioned previously, they need to find it themselves? I mean, where they got the information of where are these thing hidden?

Does the anime actually related to world history?
>> ARTICLE
> So the archer in F/SN is actually summoned?

Yes, he is summoned as a servant. However, it's no mere coincidence that he's summoned by Rin. [F/SN Spoiler](/s "Rin thinks she's not using a catalyst in her summoning, since she thinks she can summon Saber without it, but she actually does have a catalyst. Her pendant. Remember how she gives Shirou a pendant when he gets killed by Lancer, and Archer gives the pendant back to Rin, but Shirou still has his. So suddenly there are two pendants. That's of course because Archer is Shirou from the future, so he still had the one from his timeline. So the pendant acts as the catalyst for Archer.")

> Oh ya the Zouken grandpa, how he die?

In Fate/Zero, you only see him when Kariya is training, and near the end when he's talking to Kirei. When Kirei hits him, you see that his body is altered, and he doesn't really have a normal human body. He has a big part in Heaven's Feel, which is gonna be a movie anime soon, so if you want to wait then watch that, otherwise read below:

[F/SN Heaven's Feel Spoilers](/s "In Heaven's Feel he actually appears again as a sort of antagonist. He tries to summon the grail using his own methods to win the war, but is ultimately killed by Kirei and Sakura.")

> How you guys got so much details about this fate trilogy

Well, F/SN is originally a VN which has 3 routes. The Fate route does a lot of world-building and focuses a lot on Saber. The Unlimited Blade Works route focuses a lot on Shirou and his ideals (but is also seen as Rin's route). The last route, Heaven's Feel, makes a lot of revelations about the Holy Grail War as a whole.

On top of that, Fate/Zero was a Light Novel originally (and I think there's a manga of it as well). 

There are also other entries to the fate series, including Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, which is a sequel to F/SN; Fate/Apocrypha, which is like an alternate setting; Fate/Strange Fake, which is about westerners trying to replicate the war. That's just to mention a few, but the series is quite extensive, it's just that only F/Z, F/SN: UBW, and soon F/SN: HF have been adapted so far (not counting Fate/Kaleid since it's a spin-off). 

The movie series Kara no Kyoukai, and the VN Tsukihime and Mahou Tsukai no Yoru are all also written by the same person, and take place in the same universe as Fate (although they focus on different things, but the lore is the same).

All in all, there are a lot of things to read and draw information from, or you could just hop around the wiki if you're lazy.

> The catalyst you mentioned previously, they need to find it themselves?

Since a catalyst is most often a real object, which just has some significance to a certain spirit, yes, they need to find it themselves. Some may be easy to find (you might find something in a museum), but something like Avalon takes time to find. Basically, they knew that Avalon had to be buried somewhere in Britain, so they scoured the land to find it, and eventually they did. I don't believe there's anything more to it than a normal excavation (aside from using magecraft).

> Does the anime actually related to world history?

Partly. Almost all characters they use for servants were real people (Alexander the Great, Nero), or taken from real legends (Hercules, King Arthur). For the most part, they also try to keep the Fate version of the legend as similar to the real legend as well, but there are some obvious differences. One of the biggest ones being that a lot of people summoned into the Saber class are women in Fate, but their real legends say they were men. Of course, they are all legends, so there's no actual "right or wrong", so the writers do take some liberties. 

But for example, Saber as King Arthur was (according to real legend) king of Britain, he/she drew Caliburn from the rock, and was eventually gifted Excalibur by the lady of the lake. He/she then married Guinevere, who loved/was loved by Lancelot. He/she was also eventually killed by Mordred (his/her son/daugther).

So while they do change some details (some big, some smaller), it's mostly correct, and practically all the names they mention are of real/legendary people.

I'm glad we did this rewatch. I really like this show. A lot of what I think about the show is in a video by digibro on youtube. For some reason, the fact that most of the characters die and many have their ideals crushed is something I find entertaining. I also like how Kirei and Gilgamesh, which represent nihilism in a way are the ones who survive and are ultimately happy in the end. The idea that almost everyone's ideal is stupid for various reasons and that if you don't really have as much to care about, then you'll be best off because you have the least to lose is something that appeals to me because it's true in a way and I find that I live by it to an extent. Of course their actions are unacceptable but a lot of the core ideas behind their character are things that I agree with. In my life, not caring about other people's stupid ideologies and acting for my own pleasure has made my life pretty rad. People might say that's terrible because it probably is but look at who's enjoying life more. Anyways, great show, looks good, interesting characters, not too long or short, and entertaining.

1. Madoka Magica

I liked heartbreaking stuff. The pain and suffering of a particular character from these anime is just too fucking great.

Ga-Rei Zero is one of those animes I try to get all my friends to watch. When they come back and tell me the can't get into it, I just don't understand. IT'S SO WONDERFUL! Like a glorious train wreck.

I still cant believe that Madoka is so short. They fit such a good story in so few episodes.

That pacing is just perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see some love for Kyousougiga. That's one of my favorite shows and I rarely see people mention it.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, but obscure :)
>> ARTICLE
It aired at the same time as Kill la Kill so that's not surprising. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it was kind of an underdog in a season of some pretty heavy-hitters, so it's not surprising a lot of people overlooked it. It also started with a rather confusing, breakneck speed episode 0, which might have turned some people off.

It's a shame, though. It has such a cool visual style, an interesting cast of characters, and a satisfying ending. Not to mention pretty tight thematic focus.
>> ARTICLE
Try FLCL. Only 6 episodes, but one of the best-crafted stories I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
I have "never knows best" on my left arm.  I absolutely love this show. 10/10
>> ARTICLE
And ahead of its time.
>> ARTICLE
In what way? I love it but nothing about it feels out of place for the time it was made.
>> ARTICLE
It was a testbed for a lot of new animation techniques pioneered by Gainax at that time that were later used in stuff like Diebuster, Gurren Lagann etc.

Edit: Not to mention how uncommonly popular it became in the U.S., it's probably more popular here than it is in Japan and Adult Swim even solicited Gainax with money to make a second season (which they turned down) 
>> ARTICLE
If memory serves it wasn't very big when it was released, at least in the States. I watched it with a friend who was way into Anime then but never heard it discussed. A few years later it became more popular.
>> ARTICLE
You think so? To me it felt like it was at its most popular when it was first released, and while it's still well known and regarded it's popularity has only waned since then. I guess it's all a matter of perspective and what parts of anime fandom you engage with.
>> ARTICLE
It grew in popularity mainly because Adult Swim ran it over and over again nonstop for years, allowing so many people to hop aboard the FLCL bandwagon over time. But when it first came out, I can see how it wouldn't be as popular.

Plus, it was contemporary with Toonami, which is most peoples' first gateway into anime itself. I think before Toonami anime in general was a really niche medium. 
>> ARTICLE
Try Pale Cocoon. Only 1 episode, but one of the most intersting stories I've seen.

I mean, there are a ton of good OVAs. I love [Riding Bean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1NAhlVRaZ4).


>> ARTICLE
RIDING BEAN IS AWESOME.

More people need to watch this OVA.  It's super short and highly rewatchable. It's silly and tons of fun.  A  comedic Japanese take on the cheesy American 80s action flick.

Ping Pong is written by Taiyo Matsumoto, but Yuasa wrote the script. And the anime has more plot than the manga, I don't know who came up with that, but it's genius.

>> ARTICLE
- 1) Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches

- 2) White Album 2

- 3) Noragami


>> ARTICLE
Eh, Yamada was pretty entertaining, but it was also quite forgettable and quite difficult to absorb just because of how rushed everything was in the anime. It just skipped from scene to scene, and skipped out on a bunch of scenes and backstory details that fleshed out the characters **a lot** more in the manga.

Most of the witches were literally just skimmed through, and the anime offered no reason to really care for them. 

It is probably one of the best examples of shows that would benefit **a lot** from more episodes and a much slower pacing. 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, those witches that were "skimmed" were not really fleshed out in the manga either, and mostly just served as plot points. I think it was a very good adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
There is going to be a season two of noragami btw. If it ramps up like the manga does, it's going to get even better too!

KIMI TO

1. Outbreak Company

2. Kino no Tabi

3. Sora no Woto
>> ARTICLE
1. Sora no Woto.
 * It starts off lovely, then it gets cute, then it gets dark, and then suddenly it's the most heart-touchingly beautiful ending I've ever seen. Probably the only show to feature an ancient spider tank made of future and then have the balls to be a non-action show and let the thing sit in a shed until it's needed.

2. Baccano!
 * Probably the craziest storytelling I've seen, nothing does fun and exciting quite the same way. Take a bunch of great characters, then grab their storylines and tie them all together in a big knot. Slather the whole thing in some fantastic prohibition-era flavour complete with the best damn jazz soundtrack around and a dub full of genius. Then cut your creation up and serve it in completely the wrong order but somehow get everything to wrap up nicely at the end. That's Baccano! Technically 16 episodes but the last three are OVAs and I'll take any excuse to recommend it here.

3. Girls und Panzer.
 * Imagine a Moe slice of life show about a bunch of girls living through school life. Now think up some absurd gimmick that no one will ever expect. Something ridiculous like the girls drive tanks around after school. You are now ready to ride the moe bandwagon all the way to money town. Except you're not going to do that. You're going to kick that "slice of life" nonsense and turn this thing into a god damn sports anime. A good one. With tanks. Come up with an absurdly big cast of characters, structure the plot around a major tournament, the protagonists surprisingly grim backstory and some serious stakes. Then throw them into some actually really fun tank battles with real strategic depth. Now direct this thing like a champ. Master the pacing. Know when to build the tension, and when to deliver. If you can do this, you can create Girls und Panzer.

>> ARTICLE
What is it about?
>> ARTICLE
27 year old business dude falls in love with his 15 year old sister, not much more than that.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough
>> ARTICLE
As has been said it is about a brother who falls in love with his younger sister. But it is the way the show handles the subject of incest and age difference which makes it so good in my opinion.  
The show gives you something to think about, it knows incest is not accepted but what if you are truly in love?
>> ARTICLE
It is much more than that, it takes incest seriously unlike shit such as Oreimo.
>> ARTICLE
replace incest with pedophilia, and sure.
>> ARTICLE
Next thing you know, you'll be saying Lolita is a terrible book because it's about pedophilia.
>> ARTICLE
it is about incest, you learn that very early on. But I think it treats it more seriously than other shows and is definitely worth a watch.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Koi Kaze without any prior knowledge to it. I didn't grasp that it was about ACTUAL incestual love until the very end in which it left me both disgusted and amazed how good the series actually was.

>> ARTICLE
What did you think it was about?
>> ARTICLE
It was a while ago I watched it... But if I recall correctly I thought it was more about misunderstandings. She wanted to be more with her brother and him trying to avoid weird shit happening, I never undrstood they had deeper feelings towards eachother (except maybe she having a small crush on him) until the last 2-3 episodes when they made it super obvious.

Edit: It was more I who was oblivious to the fact that it was an incestual relationship since I went in to the anime blind (as it isn't a common theme to be serious about). So I kinda neglected every bit of info thrown at me.
>> ARTICLE
I see. The reason I'm genuinely curious is because the premise of the show is made pretty clear in episode 1 (at least I thought so).
>> ARTICLE
I mention it all the time! :P (I seriously post about it in almost every romance thread.)

But yeah, it's a really good series.

I'm on episode 5 right now and honestly it's somewhat boring but I'm persevering because everyone says it's amazing while claiming it's underappreciated even though I've seen a hundred posts talking about how amazing it is and not a single negative comment.

Hope it doesn't turn out sour.
>> ARTICLE
There's been plenty of negative comments (especially one guy circlejerking his hate here for it), trust me. It's one of those "It's not for everyone" type anime like Trigun, Monogatari, or Space Dandy.  I and some others really love it for the atmosphere and lost history of the world, while some others do find it overall boring and wish there was more to the world and lore. If you don't like it that's completely understandable.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I think I'm just on a moe overload. I need to balance that out... maybe with Kaiji.
>> ARTICLE
Also, don't miss out on the OVAs (not available on Crunchy if that's where you're watching). 

7.5 is good fun, but the second OVA, Episode 13, is absolutely essential.

1. Hibike! Euphonium  
- For a twelve episode series, this one had perfect pace and absolutely beautiful animation. And a big factor for me in shorter series is how rewatchable it is, how many hints there are to pick up later. H!E is a masterclass on small details, and it's larger themes are executed perfectly as well.   
  
2. Madoka Magica  
- self-explanatory. What a brilliant work of art and storytelling.   
  
3. Sora No Woto  
- One of the greatest examples of "show don't tell" done right. Complete with a perfect soundtrack, fantastic voice acting, and broken yet hopeful characters, Sora No Woto doesn't waste a second of its allotted time. In fact, it just makes you wish you had more.

#1. Barakamon

My go to relaxing anime, Barakamon is a slice of life with an overarching plot of a calligrapher moving from urban to rural Japan. He befriends the inhabitants, including a lovable little scamp. 

#2. Sakamichi no Apollon/Kids on the Slope 

A coming of age story where the protagonist, an amateur pianist, is introduced to jazz by two classmates. The mood of Sakamichi no Apollon reminds me a lot of Ghibli movies. 

#3. Baccano! 

Set up similar to Pulp Fiction, Baccano! involves multiple linked stories presented in an achronological fashion. While confusing at first, lovable characters and a fun OST kept me watching till everything started coming together, and then the plot had me marathoning it till I finished it.

I'll leave out OVAs since it's a bit unfair to compare those to TV series (otherwise my list would be entirely OVAs, I think), and stick just to TV shows with fewer than 13 episodes.

1. Wandering Son

Oh dang I made a hipster list, whoops. Whatever, those are all great shows in their own rights.

Okay, I would like to second (third, fourth, whatever) The Devil is a Part Timer (Hataraku Maou Sama). Great show, I absolutely adored it. The humor was spot on, I laughed out loud tons of times. 

Also, no one has said Eden of the East! Very interesting story. It's funny, genuine, and just extremely intriguing. I was drawn in from the very beginning, and I think you will be too.

Oh, this isn't a suggestion thread... my bad.

For my last one I will just say Death Parade.

a lot of people listed a few good classics, but for recent shows, I would suggest No Game No Life and Death Parade
>> ARTICLE
So little No Game No Life in the comments :O

 I haven't seen many that you all quote though.
>> ARTICLE
* Death Parade
* Barakamon
* Madoka
>> ARTICLE
One very underrated show that, aside from one cringe-worthy voice-acting scenes, is an absolute masterpiece: [Zankyou no Terror](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23283/Zankyou_no_Terror)

Another that is also a masterpiece, but thankfully did not go under the radar, but deserves more attention: [Death Parade](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade)

Another great one would be a prequel; whilst it had a very weird first episode that had almost no link to the entirety of the show, it managed to deliver a very great standalone story: [Ga-Rei: Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4725/Ga-Rei:_Zero)

Those are my Top 3 Picks.
>> ARTICLE
You guys seriously don't have Angel Beats in the top 10 comments? Is this real life?
>> ARTICLE
Angel beats takes all three spots for me
>> ARTICLE
1. Angel Beats
2. NGNL
3. Madoka Magica
>> ARTICLE
Probably:

- Madoka Magica

- Haibane Renmei

- High School of the Dead
>> ARTICLE
I guess I can't include Baccano since it's technically 16 episodes.

1. Usagi Drop (10) - Warm fuzzie incarnate.
2. Barakamon (10) - Somewhat similar and just barely inferior to Usagi Drop. Handa and Naru some of the best characters in anime!
3. ...Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (9) - Had to decide between this, Nichibros, and Anohana. I feel the characters have more to them than Nichibros and I guss Nozaki-kun's hilarity trumps Anohana's cryfest.

The rest are a bit hard to decide on.  Mood depending either "Humanity has Declined" or "A Sunday Without God".  The latter is a bit weak in the middle, though.

or alternatively, if Ultimate doesn't count due to 50 min episodes, then 3 = Death Parade. But I think it counts. I'm counting it.

I think there's something to be said about a show that can tell a full story in a short 13 episodes. If you can keep it sharp, dense, and engaging and make maximum use of screen time you can have something as epic and powerful as Madoka unfold in a mere 4 hours, and honestly that's where a lot of the impact comes from.

1. [Maoyuu Maou Yuusha] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/14833/Maoyuu_Maou_Yuusha)

2. [No Game No Life](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life)

3. [Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21843/Shingeki_no_Bahamut:_Genesis)

Interesting notes about Maoyuu: It feels a lot like [Spice and Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou) in that it simultaneously places focus on the main characters' relationship and the mundane but realistic-feeling fantasy world instead of action. To add to this feel, the two main characters are voiced by Jun Fukuyama and Ami Koshimizu, the VAs for Lawrence and Holo respectively from Spice and Wolf. Additionally, the story was written by Mamare Touno, who later went on to write [Log Horizon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon). So if you've watched either of those two anime and liked what you saw, go ahead and give Maoyuu a try. If you haven't watched either of those, **WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? JUST DO IT!**

TL;DR Maoyuu slightly fills the hole that the end of Spice and Wolf Season 2 left in me.

Maybe School Days is a bit controversial, but I think that's how I like my short, 1-season anime to be. I feel like it was a good experience to go through, but I'm glad it's 12 episodes and not 24.

I also liked Madoka Magica but it has the 3rd movie to go with it, so that's kind of not fair.

And you guys thought being Lancer was suffering yesterday.

Being Kerry is truly suffering. Poor guy's life has been one tragedy after another. It's no real surprise his out look on war, heroes, mages, and the world is the way it is.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm surprised that he even has a conception of good such as he does. If I went through all of that, I would probably be more of a nihilist like Gilgamesh and kirei.
>> ARTICLE
If you're any form of good in something written by Urobuchi, it's just a fact you're gonna suffer.
>> ARTICLE
Nasu made him suffer first, Urobochi only did Maya and Ryunosuke. 
>> ARTICLE
You're forgetting Kariya, the one who suffers the most. Besides, i'd imagine that Kiritsugu's backstory was written by Urobutcher.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, the entire setting, plane, overall magus ability and early life where already done, we knew of his involvement and magus killer  tittle before the LN. Also Kariya isn't listed in the character contributions by Urobochi, if anything the setting on the Matou was entirely written of by Nasu. I think you are confusing the raid subplot that got scrapped akin to Shota assasin. 
>> ARTICLE
No, Kariya scenes were definitely written by Urobutcher. In one of the post faces Nasu talks about how he rejected one of the scenes with Sakura because of how cruel it was and said something like "What color is your blood!?" to Urobuchi and then Urobuchi rewrote it.
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know he is the one that wrote Kariya and the whole deal with Shinji parents to withold Zouken methodology. However I can't deny several scenes outside if Irisviel/Juztease relations in the LN weren't Orchestrated by Urobochi.

Now with all the characters introduced I can post this without fear of spoiling.

First time watching this show, man I gotta say what the fuck was I watching before this shit. As soon as I finish fate/zero, then it's fate/stay then I get to wait for heavens feel with all you guys.
>> ARTICLE
Congratulations I guess. Most people would tell you to read the vn but it's super long and a lot of it has already been spoiled. I think it'd be interesting to go anime only if you don't want to read it.
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch every anime related to Fate, then lose my VN virginity and play through all the VNs.
>> ARTICLE
Don't watch the Deen adaptations, though. Well you can, but they're nowhere near as glorious looking as ufotable adaptions and in my opinion also aren't as good.
>> ARTICLE
People already warned me about that. Plus I've seen the PS2 dragon on youtube. That can stay the fuck out of my life.
>> ARTICLE
You should also read the LNs and play the games, Fate/Extra and Fate/Apocrypha are particularly good.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/apocrypha is a game? I'm very interested in that setting.
>> ARTICLE
No, Fate/Apocrypha is a light novel.
>> ARTICLE
thats what i thought...but i thought you may have been referring to some other form of medium for that setting. 
>> ARTICLE
but to be honest, Apocrypha was originally planned to be a Game- but they decided otherwise and it was made into a Light Novel, and F/Grand Order became a Game instead.
>> ARTICLE
Can't forgot the sequel to F/SN, F/HA.  I'm reading through it right now. 
>> ARTICLE
...games?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, there's Fate/Extra, the upcoming Fate/Grand Order, Fate/tiger colusseum, Fate/unlimited codes and Fate/Extra CCC.
>> ARTICLE
How can I get these games in english?

Fate/Extra is already localized and sold in the united states, but Fate/Extra CCC wasn't localized here at all and doesnt have a full translation as far as I know. Fate/Grand Order isn't out yet, but Fate/Unlimited Codes is localized here as well for PSP (But it's just a fighting game).
>> ARTICLE
On what platform?
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Extra, Fate/Extra CCC and tiger colosseum are on PSP, Fate/Grand Order is going to be on IOS and unlimited codes was on both PS2 and PSP.

The fate series is that old? And games are still coming out on the PSP?

Fate/SN is from 2004, and yeah, the most recent is Extra CCC, from 2013 and it was released on the PSP, though it's like the Heaven's Feel route of Extra.

I'm so fucked...
>> ARTICLE
I'd just watch the *Fate/Stay Night UBW* anime (the one that ended recently), followed by *Fate/Zero* (prequel) and the upcoming *F/HF* movie.
>> ARTICLE
Since you seem interested, i'll give you some of the big ones in the Nasuverse you could get into.

- Kara no Kyoukai - It's one of the first Nasuverse works that was written (Predated only by Witch of the Holy Night) and is honestly a pretty highly acclaimed anime on it's own.

- Tsukihime - Despite what google may try to tell you, [there is no Tsukihime anime](http://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk137/Erwaldosdai/NoTsukihimeAnimu.gif) so dont try to watch it. Instead there is the Visual Novel that is pretty good, but it's being remade and is probably going to be adapted by Ufotable after Fate/Stay Night is completely finished anyways. I suggest you check out the Visual Novel anyways just to see if you're into it.

- Witch of the Holy Night - Unless you can read Japanese you won't be able to read this one *yet*, but you should keep it in mind anyways for when it finally does get translated since it gives a lot of context to two pivotal characters in Kara no Kyoukai and Tsukihime (One of whom is actually kind of important in Heavens Feel).


>> ARTICLE
Thanks man! Saved this comment!
>> ARTICLE
Just to add to his comment, the translation for Mahoutsukai no Yoru was started by Commie IIRC but never finished. While hopefully someday someone completes it, there is currently an available-to-download english prologue. There's also other translations in other languages, and in fact I'm currently reading [a french translation](http://moontrad.fr/) that is 70% done (just putting it out there in case you or anyone else knows french and is interested).
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
Well, good to know! It's been sitting on my PTW list for quite a while but now I have a reason to pick it up! I take it it's not too closely related to the events of the Fate series?
>> ARTICLE
Not at all. Just takes place in the same universe.
>> ARTICLE
Okay.
>> ARTICLE
And it happens around the same Time.
>> ARTICLE
The actual events of Kara no Kyoukai don't relate to the Fate series, but one of the protagonists in it is pretty important in Heavens Feel, and even is alluded to have helped out Kayneth get a functioning body.
>> ARTICLE
haha yeah, that's the psycho from KnK5
>> ARTICLE
Of all the things that happened, I did not expect this to turn into Resident Evil O_O.  
Good Kalafina song choices too!  
But seriously, this cleared up any question I had about Kerry.  
Some people called the entire plane scene lazy, forced drama but there really was no other way. At that point, Kiritsugu had already developed his world view and acted according to it. Save as many lives as possible by whatever means necessary.
When she smiled as the plane blew up I almost shed a tear, but when Kiritsugu broke down, I cried with him.  
I knew what was going to happen the moment they mentioned the plane. You may remember that during his introduction someone said something like "Once, he took down an entire plane to kill his target."  
Overall, nice backstory. As nice as a life of murder and disappointment can get.  
I want to believe he wins but since there are Fate series other than Zero...now I'm sad (_).

Is it? I just meant that if you have to eliminate 6 other teams to grant your own wish, is that truly victory (well, of course it would be but you get what I mean). I get it if you could think it's a spoiler, though.
>> ARTICLE
Kirei
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the first time I watched it looked to me that they were setting up kiritsugu vs kirei in the end with kariya as a possible wildcard and waver as someone who just survives. I thought kiritsugu would win at first because kirei seems to be the villain but since I heard the show was dark I also thought kirei could win. Those were my impressions at this point, but who knows how it will end? Well, most of if do, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
I just can't think of anyone else.  
Kiritsugu is out of the question, Waver is no winner material, Kayneth is dead, Tomiko is dead, Kariya is dying...
>> ARTICLE
Your reasoning is sound but [fsn and fz](/s "that assumes that grail truly is an omnipotent device that grants wishes") or that one person gets to touch it and they don't end up all killing each other. It would definitely make sense for kirei to win given what we know so far, though.
>> ARTICLE
I feel that the airplane scene is quite thoughtful. She is quite selfish herself, and would never kill herself ( 'prioritize yourself above all else) to save others. While she might have never expected the event, she accepted it calmly. But perhaps she was expecting it, and the long radio talk is a plea to destroy her as she can't do it herself.
>> ARTICLE
I know I'm way late with this but, in case you missed it, while the passenger jet is exploding time slows down and it shows her mouth break into a knowing smirk, as if to say "Thanks, kid..."
>> ARTICLE
Being Kerry is suffering. 
>> ARTICLE
I find that part funny because kiritsugu is super easy to pronounce if you know anything about Japanese and these people are fluent. Do the people on the island speak a different language that we hear through Japanese or is she just stupid?
>> ARTICLE
She could be just fucking with him.
>> ARTICLE
I think the island is meant to be in the Philippines, so they're probably not speaking Japanese. 
>> ARTICLE
They don't speak Japanese, we are just hearing as if it was.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I usually don't question it when they do the same thing with English but when it's Japanese I notice.
>> ARTICLE
If you're a character written by Urobuchi it's a pre-requisite.
>> ARTICLE
Nasu wrote him, Kiritsugu just wrote the LN based on what was already stated and mentioned in other fate works. 
>> ARTICLE
Nasu wrote him to be a character who suffers by default, Urobuchi wrote the actual events in which he suffers [Fate/Zero](/s "excluding the finale"). I dont know why he's getting downvoted.
>> ARTICLE
The plane event is mentioned beforehand, his involvement with dead apostles was as well, the plane incident also. Both where stated even before fate zero LN. 
>> ARTICLE
I replayed the Fate/Stay Night VN relatively recently, and I dont remember anything of the sort. I remember them going through small details like Saber rarely talking to Kerry or how Saber used Excalibur and for some reason Nasu mentioned that it destroyed a boat (Which we see in the anime) that Kiritsugu apparently said the owner had insurance on and *maybe* Kirei mentioned the plane incident to Shirou, but it wasnt said what happened with the plane.
>> ARTICLE
The plane incident was touched in complementary material just like the bridge wich has taken a bit more of focus on the Realta Nua version and on ubw rewrite. Kiritsugu story was touched briefly in side nasu publications prior to the release of the gender bent issue of the type moon magazine. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that would make sense, I remember a prototype for Rider's character also coming with material for Fate/Stay Night. Do you have a link to that one? It seems like it would be interesting as to what Nasu had in mind for Kiritsugu.
>> ARTICLE
Tracing it would be rather hard but just finding the reverse images scan or by going into the type moon wiki page for releases would bear fruit I guess. 
>> ARTICLE
You should be able to find it in the Encyclopedia on the typemoon wikia. That's how I read some of the other material books.
>> ARTICLE
Well Kiritsugu has been through a lot. Really glad these two episodes we got to see his younger lifestyle as there wasn't much background info for him before
>> ARTICLE
When I first watched this I totally thought I was watching a completely different series when I started episode 18. Though I was really happy to finally understand Kiritsugu's background with these episodes (even if he's a Zwei expy from Phantom Requiem)
>> ARTICLE
I would *love* to have an anime focusing on Kiritsugu's life before the Grail War. We really never did learn much about Kiritsugu the Magus Killer. Our glimpses of him come from before and after his dark career.

Urobuchi plz.
>> ARTICLE
There is a Manga if I am not completely mistaken.

EDIT: Yes, I was mistaken.
>> ARTICLE
Oh dillyfeathers.
>> ARTICLE
The sudden change in tone and presentation, particularly in the lack of a op and Ed while both episode ends with along drawn out scenery shot with somber music really made me wonder if FZ had a different director directing these episodes.

Regardless, these episodes are much needed as I felt that there was not enough character development due to the limitation of the medium and the fact that there are too many characters( masters and servants), but I am quite impressed with what the show has manage to present within the two episode to show how fucked up kiritsugu's life was and what shaped his world-view, and I'll say it here that kiritsugu has got the potential to be one of the most compelling MC I have seen in anime. 

Anyhow I'm excited to see how the war will turn out towards the end!
>> ARTICLE
holy fuck Shirley
>> ARTICLE
I never liked these two episodes but they do give us an interesting look into kiritsugu's character and how he developed his ideal which shiro eventually got as well. I hope everyone remembers the scene from early on about how he once took down an entire plane because good target was on it. I also love the song at the end of the second episode.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just watching this now but I really want to say, why didn't Kiritsugu even try to save Natalia? I mean even if she didn't have a parachute, she could've jumped out of the plane and land safely in the sea.
>> ARTICLE
**First Time Watcher Alert**

Episode 18:

* I wasn't very interested in this episode much
* Most of my reactions were talking about how I liked Kiritsugu actually having emotions
* Zambiez were lame
* Seriously why the zambiez, theyre not in FSN
* Natalia is cool tho

Episode 19:

* Kiritsugu was kinda cute trying to suck up to his master
* I'm getting a very Juicy-Yuuji feel from Kiritsugu in this episode.
* Seriously tho, WHY ZAMBIEZ
* Also why 66 bullets specifically?

Overall: Meh, filler that didn't need to exist. Average episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I interpreted as kiritusugu being a   type of devil (666= number of the devil) but not entirely hence the 66. Also 666 bullets you wouldnt need to use them sparingly
>> ARTICLE
I know I'm literally replying to your 4 month old comment, but I just wanted to say that I don't think the amount of bullets is anything special, they're made out of his ribs, so it just so happens that that's how may she could make with what she had.
>> ARTICLE
Well, if you think about it, we get to see kiritsugu develop his ideal which [fsn](/s "shiro has as well")
>> ARTICLE
>  Meh, filler that didn't need to exist. Average episodes.

There are no filler episodes in F/Z. Unless you consider getting a greater understanding of a major character's backstory is filler.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, side-story that is used as a filler for main content. Same idea with Rin's story in the first season
>> ARTICLE
The Rin episode is pretty much filler though, I don't know why they didn't just have a Kirei background episode with the story about his wife to show you how broken is character is.
>> ARTICLE
The Rin episode wasn't *completely* filler, the Kariya and Aoi part of it are pertinent to the plot.
>> ARTICLE

>Zambiez were lame

>Seriously why the zambiez, theyre not in FSN

>Seriously tho, WHY ZAMBIEZ

Because they're in other series in the Nasuverse that predate Fate/Stay Night including Kara no Kyoukai and Tsukihime (There were a lot of Tsukihime and KnK references in these episodes, for example one of the KnK antagonists appearing as an enforcer.)

>Overall: Meh, filler that didn't need to exist. Average episodes.

I dont think you exactly know what filler is. These are relevant to not only Nasuverse lore, but also for Kiritsugu's character development.
>> ARTICLE
I meant to say side-story. This would have been better as an OVA rather than an episode in the main series.
>> ARTICLE
It's 100% relevant to understanding Kiritsugu's thought process and why he does what he does in the final few episodes. The show is literally shit without them - even if they weren't that entertaining.
>> ARTICLE
I'll hold you to that, because they've previously said "he's dead inside due to having a shitty life" before
>> ARTICLE
You'll see why they needed to do this as an actual episode in later episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm holding you to that

RIP Rider. You were *truly* the best bro. It was cool that Gilgamesh at least admitted that he respects Rider and that he would be free to challenge him again.

[That fight](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/de6e150d779a12b87991b8af2fd9655f.png)...[Those words](http://mm.gmstatic.net/156/236572.gif)...[The respect Gilgamesh and Iskander had for each other](https://avvesione.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/jojos_bizarre_adventure-08-jonathan-tears-crying-manly-expression-emotion.jpg)  
This was one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen in my life...  
  
**Saber**  
Poor girl is just trying to stay relevant by whatever means necessary. Fate/Zero is clearly not her show.  
Still, the confrontation with Berserker helped to further develop her character, by which I mean that her views took another beating.  
There is no happy end in Fate/Zero.  
  
But that scene with Irisviel got me. I've seen her death coming from miles away (but who didn't?) but the fact that how anticlimactic it was and what followed after it made it pretty clear that this is not the end.  
Go Kerry, I believe in you!!!!!  
  
**Berserker**  
I CALLED IT! I FUCKING CALLED IT! At first I was like "Hah, finally they reveal Lancelot" but then she said Arginoth and I was like "Wait, what? Who?" then it all worked out anyway.  
I don't remember what exactly went down between them though, I'll have to google that after this.  
  
Kariya should just die already. It would be better for everyone but especially for himself for this to come to an end. That brief scene with him was so depressing...  
  
**Rider and Archer**  
The highlight of today's episodes.  
That little scene with Waver and grandpa was pretty charming. A little bit of foreshadowing for Rider.  
Then the mantear-train started rolling:  
Rider telling Waver that they are equals and friends...the manliness was already overflowing at that point!  
After that, the little exchange of words before the battle ("You are an usurper worthy of my judgement"-so fucking badass). It was already apparent at that point that Gilgamesh respects Rider. Gotta love how he tried to convert him one last time before the battle (but I loved the Enkidu reference by Gilgamesh more!). So typical of him!  
Then shit got real. (that Waver battle cry though...) First of all, I have no idea what Gilgamesh's weapon supposed to be, but it has to be nerfed yesterday! Anti-planet Noble Phantasm? Get the fuck out of here! How is anyone supposed to fight against that? "I will wake you up and show you the harsh reality!" Not that hard when you can fuck up space-time without breaking a sweat...  
But they couldn't just leave it at that! No, they had to make me cry one last time! "You are my king!" AAAAAh god damn it I am tearing up again! At that point, Iskander knew he had already lost but still went in like the badass he is!  
Gilgamesh's final words to Rider made me respect him. As much as he is stuck up in his own ass, he just couldn't ignore Rider's manliness!  
What really got me is that he even acknowledged Waver's loyalty towards Iskander.  
  
Meanwhile, Kirei is being psychopath again. This will not end well...
>> ARTICLE
Gilgamesh is just completly broken. He is so powerfull that Nasu needs to write his personality in a way that he doesnt one shot everyone ( not taking anyone seriously and being super arrogant ).
>> ARTICLE
>First of all, I have no idea what Gilgamesh's weapon supposed to be, but it has to be nerfed yesterday! Anti-planet Noble Phantasm?

Its called Ea and it terms of stats it has a EX rank. The funny thing is that Gilgamesh is so god damn OP that if he wanted to he could probably win the Holy grail War in a day or two. 
>> ARTICLE
They're consistent about it too, which is what makes it great. In a certain spinoff that uses a different Holy Grail War system altogether, Gilgamesh is capable of outright ruining the whole purpose of the War. And it's a plot point.
>> ARTICLE
> There is no happy end in Fate/Zero.

Truer words have never been spoken.

> But that scene with Irisviel got me.

Ugh...Irisviel's death always gets me. I knew it was coming the first time but the way she dies...alone and scared and knowing how Kiritsugu loves her and Illya more than anything...it hurts man. As I've said before, being Kiritsugu is suffering. Poor guy loses everyone he loves.

It's also good to see the emotional reaction you first time watchers are having towards the Gilgamesh vs Iskandar battle. Many manly tears have been shed to this scene. Hell, it still brings me to manly tears every time.
>> ARTICLE
>Being Kiritsugu is suffering.

Gen Urobuchi is sitting somewhere behing a pair of black sunglasses with a smug smile on his face.
>> ARTICLE
Gilgamesh is huge on the master-servant structure of society (with himself as the master of everyone, of course). Waver willingly and wholeheartedly accepting his 'place' as the servant of a better man clocks in with that idea and gives Waver great worth. [UBW Spoilers](/s "Gilgamesh's plan with the grail is intended to leave behind people like Waver as the sole survivors of the world.")

>Spoiler

That kind of ideal is what makes Gilgamesh clock in at Chaotic Good on the alignment chart. He has humanity's best interests at heart, whether they like it or not.

>> ARTICLE
Even though it's more of an easter egg kind of thing than anything else, the man in the Ionian Hetaroi just looks like a slightly younger adult version of adult Waver. That and the fact that the character art for the respective episodes of Fate/Zero and UBW were done at different times, so the character artists for UFOtable might've altered things slightly.

Sorry for the late reply, just wanted to point that out.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is, even if that guy isn't Waver, chances are that Waver is still *somewhere* in the Ionian Hetaroi as he pledged himself to Alexander. So it might as well be him.

Heroic spirits are technically "idealized" from their flesh and blood selves. Nasu logic would make it work.

I think it could, this person has a tie type thing even if it is under armor. Even if it isn't true i can still believe!!

That is official art on him by the way. Well to a degree he was also influenced by Taiga in what being a Hero and saving people is like, just like Taiga was interested in English as a language after his little time with Weaver having the most badass [interloper](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/typemoon/images/2/22/TaigaOP.jpg/revision/latest/thumbnail-down/width/340/height/340?cb=20140610200102).

The entire scene of Gilgamesh vs Rider from this episode is my favorite in the series, maybe even my favorite in all of anime.  His speech about living to tell about "Iskandar's last charge" and then the charge itself gives me chills.  Especially the OST, *You Are My King*.  When the chorus kicks in as Rider starts running towards Gil... I get goosebumps.  The sheer determination of him to reach Gilgamesh, even after his horse is killed, even as he's being pierced as he runs, is incredible to watch.  My first time watching the series, I was so sad since I had had the ending of Zero spoiled for me by the F/SN VN... And I knew that Rider was gonna lose.  He was my favorite character in the series, and one of my favorite of all time.  At least he ended up losing to Gil, the most OP of all the servants and another one of my favorites.  It was a fitting end for Alexander the Great, the biggest bro of all time.  Even Gilgamesh respected him in the end.

Arondight is the sword tied to Lancelot myth. A sword able to rival excalibur to a degree. 
>> ARTICLE
Also legendary as a *Dragon* Slaying Sword, which means it gets a boost in power when fighting dragons. Being wielded against Arturia Pen*dragon*.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, but also a sword that lost its divine status due to it being used to kill his comrades, in the end it's still a powerful sword that increases rank and saving throws when held by Lancelot. This is why it rivals a Excalibur and is powerful when dealing with Arturia. 

It makes you wonder how weak Arturia would be against Saint George, his skillset seems to counter hers hardcore.

Well that's sorta the point with Fate/Zero since its a prequel written after FSN. Like you know its not gonna end well, you know things aren't so hot, and now seeing how that happened is what makes it interesting.

Iskandar vs Gilgamesh is probably my favorite fight in the entire series. [The musical score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0KnBHHOJ0k), the emotional delivery of the lines and the spectacle of Iskandar's final charge into certain death....it gives me chills and moves me to damn tears every time.

This isn't a spoiler, but those chains are the ultimate sign of respect you can get from Gilgamesh.

It's stated in several instances that Enkidu is his most valuable possession and that it's mostly reserved for dire situations or to fight fellow demigods. Going further into the scenarios in wich they where used is a big spoiler already.

Isnt using Ea the ultimate sign of respect you can get from Gilgamesh ?
>> ARTICLE
Ea is his most powerful weapon yes, but his most beloved and trusted treasure are the chains Enkidu, named after his greatest and only friend. He only ever uses Enkidu when his life depends on it, or against a foe he finds truly worthy.
>> ARTICLE
For the biggest part he is more willing to EA spam in his appearances or to use it when he gets angry, however the uses of Enkidu where either to save his Ass or to guarantee a win against heroic spirits with divinity. 

Also naming your chains after the most important being in his life counts, despite his fascination and willingness to talk with EA. 
>> ARTICLE
After twelve and a half minutes of intense Wikipedia searching, I still don't know what Lancelot's problem is with Arthur(ia).  
Isn't he supposed to be angry with Elaine?
>> ARTICLE
Do you remember the closing words of the Banquet of Kings? Rider tells Saber that she is no true King, as her superhuman and untouchable virtue provides no example that an average person can live up to or even be inspired by. This is Lancelot proving the sentiment correct.

He feels ashamed at his betrayal, and even more ashamed when Saber refuses to castigate him for it. She dismisses it - and therefore in Lancelot's mind *him* - as unimportant. All he wants is to be actually led by Saber, for her to provide an example he can follow, and instead all she gives him is a sense that he's unworthy of her. And he ends up hating her for it.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I see.
>> ARTICLE
well Nasuverse changes alot of mythos BUT...

in some of the stories in the Arthurian myths, Lancelot totally had an affair with Guinevere and fucking left the Knights of the Round to reclaim his honor. Arthur never punished either of them for it(the quest was self-imposed). He never came back and is probably why Arthur dies fighting Mordred. Remember, in the myths, Lancelot was the best. 
>> ARTICLE
He was never punished in the nasuverse, this drove him insane. 

He wanted to repay his debts, he wanted to be loyal and pay the price but his "king" being more than a concept than a human forgiving him ended up destroying him inside specially on the circumstances of the king final battle. 

Irisviel consultation room consists of all the servants exposing their problems with Irisviel and young Taiga inside the grail, he explains everything there, and we see bro Giles to boot. Iskandar had no regrets on his path so he marched straight to the grail.

I can relate to that to a degree.

I think Waver is arguably the protagonist of the story. Everyone else, well if you were watching/reading in order you knew how they were going to end up. Everyone who's read F/SN knows Tokiomi gets murdered by Kirei, etc. So their respective stories are already set in stone, which leaves only a little room for flexibility in the creative department. But Waver was a brand new figure, and he could be taken anywhere. Not to mention the heaps of character focus he received, his overall improvement in terms of personality and how [Whoa jeez there's a wild spoiler](/s "he's the only character to receive anything close to a happy ending. Not counting Gilgamesh, but then he's the villain of the piece.")
>> ARTICLE
There are so many ---tagonists in this story that it's really hard to label who's which actually that's one thing I love about Urobuchi's writing he can shift the protagonist almost seemlessly if he wants to. However though we know the fate of Kiritsugu I would probably label him the protagonist as his story gives rise to Shirou's personality which leads to the main FSN story.

HAH, I DID

I heard in the original novel, Berserker was dual wielding MP5s like he was [friggin' Master Chief](http://pintaw.com/images/wallpapers/master-chief-halo-2-Wallpaper.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
Does this mean if Gil had successfully used Ea [FSN:UBW Route](/s "he would've defeated Shirou handily and it was his arrogance that made him lose to Shirou?") 

Also for Rider's end I listen the song Restless Soul by Hammerfall. Glory to the Brave is a good substitute for the collapse of his Reality Marble, but I prefer to save that when I'm contemplating the real costs of war.

Also this is a nitpicky thing for me but how does Beserker get a hold of what looked Barret .50 Cal, either way it was an Anti-tank 50 Cal rifle when that weapon is hard to get in most US states much more so Japan. I guess they could've raided a US base which seems the most likely, but it just kinda bugs me how he kinda just has them. Also I don't think US bases really store MP5Ks anymore there are far better submachine guns and I don't think they have a contract with H&K anymore, but I could be wrong (I know their contract with Beretta is up soon). And I'm unsure at the heavy rifles that the JSDF has, but in that case wouldn't you go with a Howa Type 89 over MP5K? Kiritsugu used his connections to sneak his weapons in so that makes sense. I just don't see a priest sneaking in Anti-tank and sub-machineguns into the country on relatively short notice, unless he went to the yakuza or something. It's just something that always bugged me.

Also I totally forgot that creepy ass Illyasviell had on her face at the end of ep 23. [FSN HF](/s "as she gets corrupted by Angra Mayu")

In the gun department, don't underestimate the church in the nasuverse, they are extremely competent in warfare. 

Japanese gun laws has different loop holes that are abused such as the entrance of weaponry part not being illegal wich prompts to problems when they are assembled illegally. This bears resemblance as this story is dealt in the period of time before some law changes to counterfeiting. 

Also the Japanese army is known to keep old weaponry in Stock, it's a common think joked around on movies and Anime.

Fate/Stay night from DEEN is listed higher than Fate/UBW from ufotable? ^^^jesus^christ
>> ARTICLE
Haven't watched any of Fate series, can anyone tell me why is Fate/Stay night so hated while everyone loves the other series?
>> ARTICLE
Um....its complicated. 

The F/Sn that is hated is the 2006 version. Its considered a very poor adaptation of the Fate route of the F/Sn visual nove,especially in regards to the protagonist. It has plot points and spoilers from the 2 other routes, and because of mixing up all those it suffers from pacing issues.Also the animation is very poor and hasn't stood the test of time.

The other 2 series are F/Sn Unlimited Blade Works- which adapts the 2nd route of the VN very faithfully and is a great anime overall. And Fate/Zero- which is the prequel of the F/Sn anime, and is considered one of the top tier animes to come out in the last 5 years.

There are other stuff related to the Fate franchise- Fate/Kaleid which is an alternate universe thingy but still loads of fun apparently, the Unlimited Blade Works movie which is made by the same studio of the 2006 version and also considered pretty bad adaptation unlike the newer series.

Hope that was helpful!
>> ARTICLE
so if i want to start watching fate what order would you recommend?
>> ARTICLE
So basically it is hated because DEEN fucked it up. I just started watching it(going to watch whole franchise), and i can understand why it gets all the flak. The animation quality is by far the worst in any anime i've seen(haven't seen that many, i'm more of a manga guy). 

The overall production is just piss-poor by not just the standarts of 2006 but even the entere 2000s.

Your comment was very helpful, thanks for taking time to answer me!

PS: A couple episodes in and i see why Saber's the best girl.

Yeah, DEEN certainly dropped the ball on this series. So it kind of deserves the criticism it receives.

Nuuuuuuu
>> ARTICLE
Saber's romance was not only horrible but her character is just asinine. She's like the least likable character in that show, and I will never understand why she's popular. Fate Route was horribly average, and it should only be slated as average. UBW and HF are incredibly better, and so are their heroines. I'm probably going to get down voted for this but whatever, I just can't stand her nor her nonsense. 

In my opinion:

Heaven's Feel > UBWRoute > UBW Anime > A ton of shit(including FZ) > Fate Route >>> Fate Anime >>>> UBW Movie

There's literally no point in debating with someone with such obviously bad taste.  Just let him stew in his own edgy salt.

>> ARTICLE
At this point, it's just different taste, not bad. It doesn't mean that you like Saber that you have bad taste, just not the same taste as me. The contrary can also be applied. While I did say that I did not understand why someone would like a character like Saber,  I never judged anyone who actually did. 

We are talking about fictional characters at the end of the day. People will dislike some, and others will dislike others. I may disrespect a character and you can too, but there's literally no reason to disrespect each other because of our divergent tastes. 
>> ARTICLE
> Saber's romance was not only horrible but her character is just asinine. She's like the least likable character in that show, and I will never understand why she's popular. 

This entire statement is contrary to what you just said. By making this claim you are judging her popularity and by extension judging why people like her. If you were just talking about the character, then sure, your earlier statement you stated rings true but you went and said you'll never understand her popularity. That undermines your entire argument man. So even if you didn't mean to judge people for liking her you've unintentionally implied that and mostly come off as someone who's just annoyed with Saber fans for making her popular.

I was mostly joking for the most part anyway. Saber is indeed my favorite and I banter often that the other girls are shit but I'm joking at the end of the day for the fun of it. I like or at least appreciate basically every character in the Fate Franchise. Except for Shinji. Fuck that guy.

You must be new to anime, If you're the MC you can do whatever you want to your romance option and it does not matter

Its the culture difference I suppose
>> ARTICLE
No I'm not new to anime. I don't think anyone who actually seen a 40+ hour visual novel is new to anime. He treats her like shit, and like the shallow veggie she is, act as if it bothers her but does nothing about it. Her apparent growth was extremely shallow and sexist all things considered. So much that I will not consider it growth but digression. I feel like Saber is an insult to actually strong female characters. She can fight, but she doesn't have the mentality that makes a character strong. 

Sakura also doesn't have it, but she got an interest enough character conflict that I can look past it. Her personality is also pretty well rounded. Rin is just extremely badass in terms of personality and is a character who's portrayed much better than most women in such fiction. She's ultimately perfect.  
>> ARTICLE
And the MC is just bad in general, doesn't make saber any worse. 

Rin is perfect you say, so saber is missing the tsundere ? 
>> ARTICLE
Rin Tohsaka. (I made an essay or something like that about Rin a long time ago, so here)

Rin is without a doubt the deuteragonist of FSN. For a character usually known as a tsundere she is one of the most complex characters in the Fate Series. She has many layers. First, in her day to day, we see the perfect student persona. This way, she keeps herself away from the normals so she doesn't have to hurt them if they find her secret. Then we see how she behaves once she relaxes a bit, with Ayako. And we see a person who is witty and likes have verbal fights while maintaining a facade of elegance and aloofness. Behind that, we discover the cold magus that she likes to think she is. That's it, until Shirou breaks through that layer like a sledgehammer (punny) and we finally see the tsundere. And that's not even her final layer. Once Shirou (and the watchers/readers) see whats behind her magus persona, we see a character with flaws, flaws that in my case endear her to me even more. She is stingy, has a short temper, is lazy and weak in the mornings, isn't honest with herself about her feelings, is a bit of a manipulator and likes to make fun of other people.  


But she also likes to have a challenge, has a very high sense of fair play at the beginning (whatever advantages she gets after the start is another matter), wants to keep the innocents around her safe, takes her responsibilities seriously, is very intelligent and, above all, incredibly funny. She is the character with whom I laugh the most in the novel/anime. And behind all of that, we find her true persona. A kind person. In my opinion, probably the kindest character in FSN, by far (probably Sakura is the only one who is somehow close, but not that close. Again, this is my opinion). She is compassionate, and despite her words, thinks of the others around her before herself (but in a much more balanced way than Shirou, she knows to keep the balance that is her own person safe so she can measure things, to somehow use her words). 


It helps to bring my opinion of her higher that, without having a really game breaking ability (besides being a genius magus, and in a war like the HGW that doesn't help that much when you face some of the monsters of the war) or being overpowered to the max, she can take names and kick asses, even when completely overwhelmed [Spoiler](/s "oh, hello there, Caster, let me introduce you to my FIST TO THE KISSER!"). Oh, and she is cute. I can't forget to mention that. 


Rin's case is a strange one for me. I'm usually a sword and childhood friend person, and I favor the underdogs over the stars, but Rin came, looked at Saber and Sakura (sword in the first case and underdog and childhood friend in the second) and kicked them out of the ladder. Hard. And with hard I mean harder than what  [Spoiler](/s "Herk ")could do. Although Sakura managed to get near it with time. [Spoiler](/s "I blame her shadow induced almost omnipotence cheating to let her recover, or something. And Hollow Ataraxia, can't forget about that.")

>> ARTICLE
Also Saber is shit because she's shit. Shirou was shit in Fate route too, but it was how she related to him in that route that brung her character down with him. Her relationship with him, her own basic character and her asinine growth are what made her a horrible character. HA improved their relationship but sadly, her character stayed as basic as before. 
>> ARTICLE
So.....

TL;DR You like Rin as your waifu because you pretty much skimmed over Sakura as quickly as you could despite her desire and motivations literally being the most complicated of the series

Cool
>> ARTICLE
So, she is complex cause she is the average tsundere that is prideful, tough, and kind underneath. Gotcha. Makes her perfect. Gotcha.

In that end, she was portrayed as this horrible women who dared to defy her men. Ultimately, she was portrayed as if she was in the wrong for killing him, and that she was a horrible person for doing so. 

Not to forget that I stated that:


and like the shallow veggie she is, act as if it bothers her but does nothing about it.


I really want to point the fact that I stated that she acted as if it bothered but did not do anything to dissolve her relationship with Shirou, instead, she decided to hop on the very person who treated her like an uncapable piece of shit. 
>> ARTICLE
That is the connotation you have given to that ending or even that conversation. Instead I see it as an act of an independent person that has the right to chose but it is in a position where she personally doesn't feel comfortable with the outcome because of all the time they spent together.
Furthermore, the way Shirou acted was because ofhis PTSD and survivor guilt than Saber understood because she saw his past.
He was the first to treat her as a person, unlike Britain or Kiritsugu. (Well Iri classifies but because she had the same condition as her)

That's a misconception that stems from Cowboy Bebop having a number of issues when it first aired in Japan. The series is very popular over there, it's considered a global sensation for a reason.

What I find as few surprises on this: 

* Ga-Rei: Zero is relatively high
* Revolutionary Girl Utena is still in the high 200s
* GATE I thought was a big hit, guess I was thinking wrong
* Legend of the Galactic Heroes is **not** in the top 100
* School Days is in the top 200
* Jojo, OPM, and NHK are in the 300s
>> ARTICLE
GATE had a good premise, but the harem aspect just got really grating after a while. It felt really forced and added nothing to the story. Also having a female character, that looked like a pre-teen, go into a weird orgasmic trance whenever there was a slaughter got really gross really fast... (=_=)
>> ARTICLE
I don't think those are the reasons it is not rated as good in Japan, nobody complains about harems or goth loli goddesses. It's much more likely it's about the Anime toning down the violence and not being true to the source thus fans of either the web or the light novel or the manga not rating the adaptation high.
>> ARTICLE
The violence was also toned down from the manga which had toned it down from the LN, so being a sub-par adaptation might have something to do with it.  It's also rather nationalistic, which could make the current target audience uncomfortable.
>> ARTICLE
Where could I read the Light Novels in English? I'd like to read what the author had in mind with the violence

I'm not into LN's so I couldn't tell ya.  Even if I knew I'd probably have to pm you the site because I doubt it's legal.

I will add that even the LN isn't strictly the original as there was a novel before that (but there shouldn't be much of a difference).

Someone seems to have picked it up. Check Bakatsuki (I'm not sure if fan-translations count as piracy on this sub so use some google-fu). Someone has translated the first book and are working on the 2nd one. 
>> ARTICLE
I think NHK hit too close to home for many viewers. It's hard to be objective about a show if it makes you gaze deep within yourself in a brutally effective way. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's not forget FMAB is ranked 30. 
>> ARTICLE
Because it doesn't take place in Japan.

Joke aside, it would be meaningless to compare both websites if they don't weight the scores the same way. On MAL you need to have at least watch 20% of the anime for your score to have weight. If on Anikore your score counts without even asking how many episodes you have watched (I don't know that) then it would be meaningless to do a comparison. 

There's also the fact that they might calculate the score differently. MAL only takes the overall score in consideration, while Anikore might not.

It is a fantastic thriller IMO.

> Legend of the Galactic Heroes is not in the top 100

Thats wrong... the anime is also ridiculously popular. One of the maybe 5 anime you can truly consider mainstream. Is in the top 5 for anime TV ratings every week.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it's popular (although less popular than the manga), the "not so much" was meant more for the quality aspect (I mean, the anime certanly has it's moments, but over time it really lost the hang of it).
>> ARTICLE
last time I watched it, the anime consisted of 10 mins of new content and the rest of recaps, filler content (like the voice intro and stuff), OP and ED. and the animation is...well...Toei (nothing more needs to be said here)

If it got any worse then may god have mercy on the anime viewer's sole. 

EDIT:
>sole 

I am not changing that lol
>> ARTICLE
The early parts were actually pretty good, yeah they had recaps but you could generally skip them and have a good time. The thing is that they started to make each episode the equivalent of 1 manga chapter, and it's absolutely impossible to do so, things just got so slow and the pacing went to shit, along wiht the animation quality, nowadays it's just...not good...(though I have to admit they shine in the important bits)
>> ARTICLE
As a Japanese, I guess that voters who use this site is almost all of the "anime" otaku and they don't treat One Piece as an anime. Beyond that, that is the most popular/selling manga in Japan, so the manga is more popular than the anime and the fans mostly have read only manga just like FMA:B,HxH,JOJO... imo. Sorry if it was hard to read.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about ranking but I'm sure by views it would beat all of these anime's.

Other stuff that I noticed and felt was weird compared to our rankings:

* Nisemonogatari is the second highest monogatari. 

[I wonder **why**](#head-tilt)

* the main Eva series is higher than the rest as well as significantly higher than on MAL.

* OPM nowhere as near our rankings.

* DEEN'S UBW is 359...

Intresting how the old HxH is higher than the remake. Is it nostalgia, or was the remake not well recieved or what?

>> ARTICLE
Out of curiosity, did you watch Castle in the Sky subbed or dubbed? Also, which would you recommend if you have seen both?
>> ARTICLE
Subbed, but dubs for Ghibli movies tend to be good. I watched the old one first and then the remake just to see what has changed. Almost everything in the old one is in the new version as well. If you do not care for comparing, then you will be fine with the new one. But personally, it is a fun thing to do and the old one is not that bad.

Edit: autocorrect

Disney did the dub so its pretty good. Great family movie.

I would like to see a list that combines remakes, ovas or new seasons of anime so we get a franchise ranking.
>> ARTICLE
One of the problems though with that is both Gintama and Gintama' are both on it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not just nostalgia. It was a very competent adaptation, especially for the time. In terms of animation quality both are stellar and the 1999 adaptation holds up pretty damn well.

I think what bumps the 1999 up a notch is the tone set by the use of color and sound. It used muted colors which suited the darker direction Hunter X Hunter eventually moved into (with body part traficking, gangsters, assassins, murder, and eventually drugs and cannibalism all being major parts of the story), while the 2011 adaptation continued to use the bright saturated palette that suited the series early on, but less so with every arc. Since both adaptations are highly competent, similar to FMA vs. FMA:Brotherhood situation, the Japanese audience probably rated the older one higher because the tone was more in-line with what is depicted in the story.

I actually really hate that comic because it ignores all context of the situation to make Shinji look like a bigger bitch than he is. 

By piloting that robot Shinji's mental state lowers because he's fighting shit you would see in nightmares all while feeling the pain himself (Not to mention that it sometimes goes Berserk harming him/his friends/ random people further fucking him up mentally), Misato is a slobby alcoholic who wouldn't sleep with him anyways because she views him as a child, Asuka genuinely hates him and she's a bitch anyways, and Rei [Evangelion](/s "is his sister/mother.")

Like if they left out the first panel I would have taken the comic's comedy at face value, but they include that so it just seems like a shitty argument saying Eva is shit.
>> ARTICLE
you just got #triggered so I win
>> ARTICLE
You threw out some heavy bait there, you deserve that win.
>> ARTICLE
You are telling me that one of the most influential series to be ever created, and what is till today the best selling anime release of all time, shouldn't be in the top 100?

I love Eva and I realize it's not everyone's cup of tea, but we are not talking about top 10 or top 3, but top 100. 

If you don't think Eva deserves a spot in the top 100, then I don't know what you think should. 

I would ask you to name 100 titles better than Eva, but that would be a waste of my time and yours.
>> ARTICLE
#triggered

I can name 100 animes that has an actual ending which would beat Eva *tv* series. Also I've seen eva before I've seen the internet so I know what going vanilla into the series is like, and it feels like "It would've been better series if it had better ending and mc".
>> ARTICLE
I think most people who have watched 100 anime can name 100 anime with subjectively better endings than Evangelion, that doesn't make the characters, plot, animation, or aesthetic any worse
>> ARTICLE
but characters are badly written/generic, plot is conclusionless, animation goes to hell as show progresses and aesthetic is probably the strongest point.
>> ARTICLE
Actually The World of Golden Eggs is the best selling anime release of all time (don't ask me why, not a damn clue), Evangelion is 2nd ;P

Though, SAO will probably pass it in the near future (if it hasn't already) if we are including all season volumes.
>> ARTICLE
I'll do you one better: Evangelion should absolutely be cemented in the top 3 anime of all time and it's a crying shame that many people don't see it that way. 
>> ARTICLE
influential doesn't necessarily = best. I don't think the original eva tv series should be in the top 100 either, on it's own it really isn't that amazing.
>> ARTICLE
But why the hell is End of Evangelion ranked way lower than the series? It should at least be right next to it, if not even higher.
>> ARTICLE
Based on popularity, NGE is ranked 29 on MAL, it's ranked 206 in terms of score. And what OP has posted is a popularity rankings, instead of score rankings unless I'm mistaken? 
>> ARTICLE
It's a combined score of both rating and popularity. I don't know how the math works, but it's a combined overall score.

But since it uses popularity into its score from user inputs, I considered it a popularity score/ranking.
>> ARTICLE
They sure love their P.A. Works! I'm glad, it's my favourite studio. Especially fond of their love for Hanasaku Iroha, it's a solid 10 in my list.

Pleasantly surprised to see Nagi-Asu at 22. Japan great taste confirmed. Even more surprised to see Angel Beats at 17 though -_-

[HAHAHA.](http://i.imgur.com/ks9EdqB.png) Surprised to see EoE rated that much lower than Eva though.
>> ARTICLE
Arguably the best non-Ghibli anime movie rated lower than semi-hentai loli harem...japanese tastes are...interesting?
>> ARTICLE
The ones that really surprised me with their spots are True Tears, Nausicaa, Nagi no Asukara, and Chihayafuru.

I thought the general perception of True Tears was quite awful even though it's one of my personal favorites so it being placed in the top 100 was a shock. Nausicaa, for obvious reasons. As for Nagi no Asukara and Chihayafuru... I'm just glad they have a high ranking cause both of them are true hidden gems. Nagi no Asukara was perceived well and is very well liked on the sub so I'm not that surprised, but Chihayafuru in top 10 was unexpected. 

I mean, I thought the Japanese youth didn't care about karuta? /s

Natsume Yuujinchou deserves that spot for sure.

Kinda over hyped tho
>> ARTICLE
I felt the hype is completely justified. The music is epic, the fight scenes are epic, the art is amazing, and it's pretty funny. Just because it's popular doesn't make it overhyped
>> ARTICLE
I thought OPM was fun, but not like - best shounen series ever fun. Top 100 would be much more justifiable, but Top 20 out of 10000 entries?
>> ARTICLE
I think its one of the best shonen. Not the best action anime seeing as **spoiler alert** everyone dies in one punch, which is extremely lackluster in the practical sense. However as a whole: comedy, production, sound, visual entertainment, action, and concept it is certainly an anime worthy of praise and prestige.
>> ARTICLE
It's in my top 10 for sure. The only shounen I think I've enjoyed more is Shokugeki(bear in mind I haven't watched hxh)
>> ARTICLE
This happens all the time. People dislike it when people like things they don't, so they *must* voice their opinion as loudly as possible. Eventually, people that liked it get scared that their opinion is "wrong" because the vocal minority, well, becomes vocal, and eventually stop posting their opinion. You can see that with almost any popular series, whether it was SAO, AoT, FSN, etc. Hell, even less popular ones face this.
>> ARTICLE
People consider attack on titan bad? What the fuck? 
>> ARTICLE
Go try and say AoT was pretty good a few days from now.
>> ARTICLE
It does get fairly slow after the first half of the anime, but I wouldn't go so far as to say its "bad".
>> ARTICLE
Yeah SAO was kind of the worst case though. First pretty much everybody loved it and then after a while everybody seemed to hate it. So slowly most people started disliking it.
I still like it though but all the negativity has kinda ruined it for me.
>> ARTICLE
Highly agree. People say OPM has its moments but it slowly leaves you unsatisfied, but I very much disagree with that. I watched the whole series twice, once right after I watched the final episode. The hype moments are still hype and its the only anime I'd consider getting a blu-ray for. People are just scared I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Scared of what?
>> ARTICLE
Where in my comment did I say our MAL wasn't fucked up? I mean hell, don't even say OPM, say the new Gintama, A SHOW THAT HAS NOT EVEN FINISHED AIRING, IS TOP **FUCKING** 3....and I LOVE Gintama...
>> ARTICLE
Top 11
>> ARTICLE
It's already started its decline?  That was sooner than I thought honestly O.o
>> ARTICLE
It's good, but not great. Never deserved to be in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, that's what I figured, I just thought it would hold out longer from all the hype surrounding it.  I'm assuming within 4-5 months it wont be top 20 even.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the same thing with Shigatsu. Figured it would drop like NGNL. 

I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
>> ARTICLE
They aren't at all comparable.  Shigatsu started the season higher than OPM and stayed there.  OPM started out lower and rose higher based on hype, as as you can already see, it will likely drop back down to a more reasonable level eventually.

Shigatsu had a much better story than OPM as well from the sounds of it.
>> ARTICLE
Uhh... Shigatsu started at an 8 and rose to it's current score as it aired and after it finished. OPM started at an 8.5 and rose to it's current score as it aired. No different.

OPM has a +9.00 score. That's not easy to achieve on MAL. At this point I'd be surprised to see it drop below that.

> Shigatsu had a much better story than OPM as well from the sounds of it.

And that's totally subjective. I myself would very much disagree with that statement. Shigatsu has a clear and complete story, but not necessarily a better one.
>> ARTICLE
one punch man had amazing fights and music, but it didn't have a story holding it together like shigatsu which is important to an anime holding its rank.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama would disagree.
>> ARTICLE
> Welp, I'm all for letting people like what they want, but IMHO even fans of SAO will agree that is preposterous.

Fan of SAO here, it kind of depends how you're ranking it.  In terms of my favourite anime that I enjoy watching, it's easily in my top 20, probably in my top 5 even.  Considering these sites are more or less popularity contests, then of course SAO is going to be top 20 in Japan.

If we're talking about the quality of a show, then SAO being top 20 might be pushing it a tad, but I could see top 100 argued depending on one's perspective.  But I could also see an argument that FMA:B being #1 on MAL is equally as absurd.  Why is FMA:B above Shirobako?  I think that's ridiculous.  Of course, not everyone is going to agree with me, such is the realm of subjectivity ;P
>> ARTICLE
Yes, if people rank it based on enjoyment I've got no problem it being in the top 25, I wouldn't agree with it, but I would find it fair. Now, it's *""""supposed to be""""* based on quality, that's why I just can't find it in me to let it have such a high position, it's just that...I mean... even if you're a fan you've got to agree, there are at least 16 series/movies that are more well done, I know it's a subjective thing but throw me a bone here...

Now with FMA:B, yes, I also don't think it should be 1st, but it's got enough quality that I won't really find it unfair or extremely ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
> Now, it's """"supposed to be"""" based on quality

You and I both know that never has been the case nor will it ever be ;P

> even if you're a fan you've got to agree, there are at least 16 series/movies that are more well done, I know it's a subjective thing but throw me a bone here...

I already said I did!

> Now with FMA:B, yes, I also don't think it should be 1st, but it's got enough quality that I won't really find it unfair or extremely ridiculous.

I find it ridiculous.  Even in my limited anime watching experience I can already name a couple of shows better than FMA:B, I imagine someone who has seen far more than I could do better than 2.

How is School Days better than Welcome to the NHK?
>> ARTICLE
Forewarning. This is just the my off the cuff ramblings. Bullshitting because I am bored and it somewhat makes sense to me.   

**TL;DR: Wider range of viewers = wider range of tastes.**

The reason there are shows that are in drastically different slots ranking-wise could be because of how readily available anime is in Japan. 

It's their regular animated television over there unlike it is in the Western world. 

Kids as young as 1 all the way to adults old as 80 are subjected to it over there. That's a muuuch wider age range for possible anime viewers. Meaning muuuch more possibility to have different shows be more popular. Then that factors into female viewership as well. If this and other boards are any indicator, there are far more male viewers than female in the West. Think of how that would change if every girl in Japan was subject to seeing anime everytime they turned their television on. Anime is their animation. What all this means is 14-20 something males (just generalizing this figure) would be the average viewership instead of the dominate viewership. Giving a wider range of likes and dislikes. 

Lets say SOA viewers in Japan range from 5-14 (makes sense as you could think of it like TMNT and GI Joe's was for me or you as we were kids). The boys would watch it for the battles. BUT WAIT! It has a bunch of cuteness to it. So the girls who are subjected to watching tv in Japan would be watching it for it's cuteness and the romantic story. While over here in the West, the ones subjected to it would mostly be the 14-20 somethings who actively seek out anime. Mostly boys. Mostly people who are well aware of quality. 

As for Studio Deen Fate/Stay Night, it could simply be attributed to the Novel. Which the main story is Sabers. In which people would want to watch her stories over Rins. Which could account for more votes. 

I also think there may be a discrepancy between what Westerners and what Easterners decide is quality and there definitely is a big discrepancy between what we all consider is normal.

It's a great watch if you're a fan of SHAFT, and though a little overly dramatic has a good story.

I can't speak for the VN, but the anime is one series I heard a lot about before thinking of watching it. Perhaps not here on this subreddit, which tends to talk more about airing anime and some very, very few older titles, but EF is definitely not as underground as you would think, it does have its fair share of exposure in other communities (MAL and 4chan and MAL at least).

Here is a reminder Most Japanese don't use rating sites like the west and this site is not reliable, it also use the reaction from twitter and other sites to determine popularity so this not "what is the best" ranking you can go to site and see how people rated the Story/Visual/VA/Music/Character but still no reliable.

Sales are better way to determine Japanese taste also TV Rating if they are available. 

Edit: thinking about this have the opposite problem of MAL that Sequal gets rated higher here it gets rated lower lol.

I don't know what to say about this list but honestly, from either an objective perspective or a subjective one I can't agree almost at all with this order. And I'm pretty sure when it comes to te sale numbers they don't match this data either. It's just weird :/

These rankings.. Damn. SAO #16, Angel Beats! #17. And even though i love K-on... Having it above animes like ToraDora, Attack On Titan, And FMA: (Brotherhood), seems a bit absurd.

My thoughts:
Happy that *Cowboy Bebop*, *Evangelion* and *Madoka Magica* are so high, but I'm actually surprised they're not higher.
As stated already, why is *Spirited Away* so low?!

There's no way in hell Hunter x Hunter (2011) could be reasonably considered #600, do people really ignore it because "hurr hurr old version is better"? or maybe Hiatus x Hiatus ? 

However, it's refreshing to see some Ghibli titles not this recognized in the west like Castle in the Sky or Nausicaa in the top.

Based on the scores it seems they use a 10 point scale instead of ratting everything at least a 7.

the rating system is 1.0 - 5.0 across 5 categories: story, visuals, voice acting, music, characters. and the full rating is the average of these 5 scores

At least Gintama is in the top 50.

**First Time Watcher Alert**

Episode 20: 

* Watching Irisviel slowly degrade was really hard. I enjoy her character a lot, she's a really good foil (positively) for Kiritsugu
* Rider's at his best when he's talking with Waver :)
* Waver so tsundere, love it
* Aaaaaaaand Rider's at his worst when he's talking to/about Saber
* More paint and suffering, featuring our NTR hero, Kariya
* Yuck, more worms. Zouken you suck hard core
* Maiya nooooooo, you were scary and badass.... Please don't die QQ

* WHAT WAS THIS EPISODE
>> ARTICLE
Being a relative of Zouken is suffering, being reminded of the original model of the grail was painful for Zouken as well.

The body count rises and the climax draws near, prepare some tissues the ost will be glorious from now. 
>> ARTICLE
Kariya.. the feels man, the feels.
>> ARTICLE
There is no other guy in this series that I want to succeed so bad as Kariya . 

He may not be the MC of the show but to me he  is my MC since I am rooting for him so hard more than Kerry and Waver.

One of the good things on this show is like Game of thrones where I can root for many people  I want . If I dont like Kiritsugu I can root for Kariya or Waver for majority in the series 
>> ARTICLE
This fucked me up badly. Oh Fate, how I love you for making me go through this...  
  
**Rider**  
It was all suspicious from the start. Rider is not the kind of guy who would do shit like that! Kiritsugu says so later on!  
He planned his 2 fights out pretty well though. Too bad it didn't work out for him against Saber. I can imagine that chariot would have helped him a ton in the future.  
Also loved the little bonding with Waver in the woods.  
  
**Saber**  
Her riding skill sure is handy! Turning into fricking Ghost Rider on the bike was badass. Hell, that entire chase sequence was pretty as fuck. Ufotable knows how to handle CGI.  
I don't know why she just left them there though...  
  
Being Kiritsugu is nothing but suffering. I don't know how he hasn't killed himself yet. Everyone around him is dropping like flies. Maiya wasn't necessarily my favorite character, but god damn it don't hurt Kerry like that :/.  
  
**Berserker**  
His identity still remains a mistery (he is totally Lancelot) but that little scene with him and Kariya might be relevant later.  
So he can transform? Damn, that's a useful ability to have here!  
  
And now the star of the show: **Kariya**  
Oh, sweet baby jesus in heavens, oh boy, that was very uncomfortable to watch. It was a matter of time before he snaps but this just blew all my expectations out of the water.  
Being betrayed like that is just too much. Plus, the worms already ate his brain. I mean, that's the only explanation why he just stood there instead of trying to explain the situation to Aoi.  
I'm not convinced that the strangling scene had to take that long but it was effective as all hell. Especially his scream. Once again, I have to applaud the Japanese VAs' ability to scream like all your friends and family just died.  
Not going to lie, with all the madness happening on screen, I thought that he might rape her corpse right there and then.  
His scream was more terrifying than that could have been though.  
At this point, he is completely unpredictable. However, if I had to guess I would say he will use his command seals to make Berserker kill everyone.  
And what the fuck is wrong with Zouken?  
  
**Archer**  
These guys are just too much! All that despair happening, I am on the verge of closing the video, and Gilgamesh is just sipping wine like "Meh, not a bad play but still pretty shit."  
The moment I saw that I just laughed out loud!  
Kirei is heading down the path of becoming the next Zouken. Not a nice thought, but true. He has no right to call out Zouken's vile bullshit.  
When he said "This wine tastes sweeter than before." I immediatly thought "Yeah, those are Kariya's tears. Enjoy them!"  
"I would like to sample this again." Well, that's bad news for everyone still alive and involved with him...
>> ARTICLE
> So he can transform? Damn, that's a useful ability to have here! 

He can, but it requires a ton of mana.  If I recall, it's explained in the light novel that it can basically only be done via a command seal.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that's because Berserker is not the type who would just listen to requests
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much.

No spoilers, just novel clarification: The Noble Phantasm that makes him impossible to identify and gives him the crazy CG aura is known as For Someone's Glory, and it's actually meant to hide his identity and let him impersonate others. Because Kariya added the Mad Enhancement trait to the summoning process as per Zouken's request, he forced his Servant to manifest as a Berserker-class and so he can't control that Noble Phantasm unless given a direct order with a Command Spell. He can still use Knight of Honor (the Noble Phantasm that lets him turn any weapon he grabs into his own Noble Phantasm) because it's very instinctive.
>> ARTICLE
Aha, thanks!

Since you've said that you're going to read the VN after Fate/Zero, do you plan to do it before or after the UBW anime?
I'd suggest that you read the VN before watching UBW to have a more linear experience, because otherwise you'd be jumping from UBW back into Fate, read UBW which you've already watched and *then* finally arrive at Heaven't Feel.

If you keep the UBW anime for after reading the VN, you'll already have the full experience and the full scope of the universe and there will be less plotholes in the UBW anime for you.

Honestly, it works either way and it's your choice, I just wanted to make this suggestion.
>> ARTICLE
I'll read then.
>> ARTICLE
Or play the fate route, then watch ubw, and then maybe play the ubw route to get the good ending, and then play the hf route, that is what I did, and pretty much what UFO-table recommend to do.
>> ARTICLE
AAAAA why does it have to be this difficult?
>> ARTICLE
Well you can skip fate if you want to, there are a few things that wont be explained, and you won't get the conclusion for saber path, but it is skipable since it is mainly buildup for the other two routes. You can also skip the good ending for ubw if you want to, the true ending is better imo anyway.

So you can just watch UBW by UFO and then play HF if you want to.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'll read the Fate route, watch UBW and decide at the end if an alternate outcome is worth going through the UBW route, then read HF and the rest of the Nasuverse.
>> ARTICLE
Well there is always all the dead ends, that you don't see in the anime, and you can skip text (ctrl as default) when playing VN, if you do decide you want to see the good end, and all the dead ends.

Gen Urobochi as creator, this has to be expected
>> ARTICLE
Nope, Nasu takes the creator seat, all the lore was established already. 
>> ARTICLE
Gen wrote the F/Z novels 
>> ARTICLE
Under heavy surveillance of Nasu as both are friends and hardcore role playing pals, every word he wrote was supervised by him to fit his lore, several of Urobochi ideas where scrapped by Nasu go and inform yourself. In the same vein Urobochi really influenced Nasu for good with caster here as that character was the biggest mash ups of both ideals in the writers mindset, Urobochi wanted an asian mage tough. 
>> ARTICLE
Then it would require Nasu to have some sort of writing skill comparable to Gen, which is not true. 
>> ARTICLE
Kara No Kyoukai is better written for me than any Fate series  imo . 

Fate/Strange Fake has big  potential since its being written by Ryogo Narita (Baccano,Durarara) who is a expert at fledging out many characters at once which is perfect for the war story telling . Only 2 volumes has been released so far but I like what Im seeing . Im getting some  Fate/zero vibes on this series 

I dont really think Gen is a amazing writer but he works well with Nasu since Nasu is great at world building (fate route) but Gen is good at executing things 
>> ARTICLE
Lore wise it's hard to beat Nasu, Urobochi admits this openly in several instances of his career. 

Gen is an scenario writer and Damm he is good at it, however he is rather weak at keeping a lore as he is more focused on the setting than on the consistency on most of his works. He has a really good theatrical display wich translates well into animation as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Nasu is superior to Gen when it comes to worldbuilding.  Both of them are fine writers.  Gen and Nasu are good friends either way, and they enjoyed working on Fate/Zero together.  Gen is a big fan of Nasu and Nasu is a fan of Gen.

Can I point out just how meta Kirei felt for me? He enjoyed watching people's suffering and strives to see the moment when everything 'breaks'. It's almost like he is...us? It's like the whole point of watching fate/zero. Each master, if not already broken, will break in the series. And we are there to witness that juicy glorious moments.
>> ARTICLE
He was designed to be the shadow of a coin that is Emiya,   he was since his inception made to force the VN player out of his safety zone and even buy a sense of security in the first 2 routes, it's character traits translated really well into Zero being a puzzle character that the VN players can't get enough and into Urobochi writing style as an antagonistic force.

Kinda why I wanted to go through this rewatch, I totally forgot how Maiya (see: Not!Ein from Phantom of inferno) dies.

This is a tough couple of episodes since I'm always and forever #TeamOsananajimi but damn Kariya only let her off with strangulation? I mean no speech about who the person(s) were that put him in this position. I mean I get it it's supposed to be a spur of the moment thing, but I'm surprised he's not as bitter as he should be (imo)

>> ARTICLE
For a moment I thought there was going to be rape with how his mental state goes, but it ended up with a lengthy strangle scene. I do suspect that urobuchi has considered that to create impact, but I'm glad he didn't go that route as that'd be a tad too much for me to handle  O.O 

Quick question btw, how did kiritsugu learnt to create a reality marble with time magic as basis? His dad literally burnt all his research and he killed his dad before he got to learn any magic. Unless he managed to pick it up himself through sheer talent or something after he bombed the plane, I don't see a good fit within the timeline where he has the time and mentor to teach him time magic. I did suspected Natalia, but all that was shown in his memories was that she taught him how to use guns, although she did displayed that she knows magic on the plane but time magic? Wasn't that supposed to be a field that has not been researched?

Damn, I've been underestimating saber. She could've killed rider with one strike. Curious to see how berserker's master will recover from this

From a Doylist perspective, it's the main reason why she was crippled early on by Lancer's cursed spear. She'd have dominated the field (Archer aside), otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
My guess is, he won't.

>> ARTICLE
These two episodes had some interesting elements in them. The whole scene with Kariya in the church definitely had an impact the first time I watched it. The riding scene was cool to watch. I didn't really care about Maiya and it was obvious she wasn't going to make it from the beginning anyways.
>> ARTICLE
I will say this does illustrate the recency bias people have. Statistically speaking, what are the odds that the last two seasons have produced 3 of the Top 10? Even when you consider that most people don't watch anime older than 10 years old, unless it's a classic (NGE, Bebop, Utena, GitS, original Gundam for example) this does seem pretty skewed. 

In my experience, it might be because people have a tendency to rate airing anime against each other, rather than against their whole list. I know I've had to adjust scores after considering my own tendency to do this. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call 00 "original Gundam".  While it's definitely no G Reco or Iron Blooded Orphans, it's not as old as Zeta or anything that age.  Most of the alternate era series have a similar feel to em, like 00, Seed, and current stuff, than the original Universal Century stuff does. 
>> ARTICLE
On the contrary, I'd argue that it's because the popularity of anime makes it so that recent shows get bigger budgets.  The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

There's also the matter that recent shows are likely to be more in line with the tastes of a modern viewer.

These, and various other reasons, are why recent shows tend to get better reviews than older ones.
>> ARTICLE
>The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

The voice acting and music are as good as they've always been, or at least since late 80s. As for the art, I think that in 2005-2008 the studios have mastered digital production and can produce steady high quality animation unless they rush things or cut the budget.

>> ARTICLE
Good points, though I'd argue that English dubs are still improving and have still got a long way to go compared to Japanese VAs.

OSTs have been getting better though - if only because the budgets are bigger.
>> ARTICLE
I think the recency bias has more to it than people just snubbing older series though

1) Older series are just harder to come by on the streaming services. Even if they are on there, you have to really dig through all the recent series to get there. Streaming services tend to push their Simulcasts to justify their licensing expenses

2) Anime crowd skews young. People watch anime of their age before earlier ones. I watched anime from 1995-1999. It wasn't until 2011 that I caught up to things from the 80s and 70s (though I did watch Mazinger-Z and Voltes V in the 90s). 

3) People who HAVE seen those might have moved on to something else in their life, and thus are never really around to mention it enough in today's anime communities, because while they were good, there just wasn't *enough* about them to talk about for 10-20 years. *Pivotal* series like NGE and Cowboy Bebop have been talked about and dissected for so long, particularly in the West, they're just ingrained in the community's collective memory. 

Other series just don't have the same staying power, unless they're a genre defining series. 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu? Meanwhile, how many people will still be talking about Madoka, K-On, Monogatari, and JoJo? Now think about how many Shirobakos, Syokugekis, and Shigatsus there have been in the 20 years since 1995, and have since been forgotten. That contributes *immensely* to recency bias. 
>> ARTICLE
> 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu?

Not sure about Syokugeki, but the other two yes absolutely. Shigatsu will at least have the staying power of Anohana (5 years) or Angel Beats! (6 years).

Or possibly because people have rubbish rating scales and don't actually care about the numbers they slap on.
>> ARTICLE
But of course you, with your omnipotent, perfectly refined taste, would never do such a thing. /s 

Elitism much? 
>> ARTICLE
No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale. I've seen /u/JexInfinite 's opinion parroted many times in this subreddit, no idea where you're getting the "elitism" claim from.
>> ARTICLE
> No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale.

Its not just people. The entire rating industry had moved toward a 6/7-10 rating scale. 6 these days means terrible, 7 average, 8 good, 9 great, 10 fantastic.

Its just normal. You looking at almost all game or movie ratings, they conform to the warped rating scale. Its just how it is. I think it ultimately came from the academic grading system, where a 50% is a fail, so anything under 5/10 is meaningless.

There is really no point complaining about people using the most common system of rating. 
>> ARTICLE
I vote on a binary "Did I enjoy it or not?" scale.  either an anime gets a 10 or a 1.  
>> ARTICLE
Those people typically are the people less experienced in anime tend to gravitate heavily towards the popular or new shows and slap high numbers on everything because they haven't seen much else and it's all unique and new

This is probably seen in practice by me personally with Gundam 00 vs. Code Geass. Both very similar in quality and plot from the same age, from the same studio. I enjoyed Gundam a lot more but they're two shows in practice which I would see having almost the same score if they were equally popular

But most of the people who've seen 10 shows and given 10 to all of them have seen Code Geass due to popularity and being recommended everywhere. Most of these haven't watched or heard much of Gundam so it has a far fairer score
>> ARTICLE
I've heard of gundam all my life, but it was only after I came to /r/anime that I first heard of Code Geass - so if anything, I'd argue that the bias would go the other way.

Still, as you say, I honestly still don't see what's so good about Code Geass.

There are a lot of snobby edgelords on this sub who think you're a scrub if you have an average score over 6. Pay them no mind. If you like something, score it whatever the hell you want. 

Just keep in mind how good you think it is compared to ALL the shows you've seen, not just the recent ones. 
>> ARTICLE
Average score means nothing if you don't know what shows they rate. Some people only watch good shows. You're suggesting that scores be on a bell curve, but I deny this. If a show is good, it is good. The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.
>> ARTICLE
I rate on a bell curve, but the curve is centred around 7.5. Most shows on my list is rated 7 or 8. I simply try to avoid shows if before watching I feel that there's no chance for me to rate the show 8. Life is too short to watch mediocre anime (or read mediocre books, or watch mediocre movies, or play mediocre games), so I don't even bother.

My MAL graph just coincidentally happens to be somewhat resembling of a bell curve, but I would never intentionally adjust the score to fit with everything else. I look at each individual show/movie as its own thing when rating.
>> ARTICLE
> The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.

This is why I kept my "10" rating for Attack on Titan even after seeing much better shows. I just love it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it does, the point of 10 point systems is for it to be relative to other entries 
>> ARTICLE
> Some people only watch good shows.

Yeah, this is sort of the justification I give for rating 10 across the board. I pick what I watch very carefully so that I know I'll enjoy whatever I invest my time in.
>> ARTICLE
So, you've either seen up to 15 shows, or are really generous with scores.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I'm just easy to please. Then again, I've seen no more then 60 shows so I haven't consumed anywhere near as much as material as the average MAL user.
>> ARTICLE
yes, this. Plus from what I've seen from over 20 years of watching, anime *has* gotten better. It'd be dumb to normalize your score to the "average" anime when that average keeps going up every year. 

Instead, I normalize mine to the status quo of being bored. If an anime entertains me even a little bit, it gets a 6. If it makes me feel like I wasted my time, it gets 4 or below. I rarely finish shows that are 5 or below. 

PLUS, people by and large operate based off of recommendations. Essentially normalizing to the average *of what you've seen* is just grading how accurate people's recommendations were to you, which is counter to the spirit of ratings. 

Grading on a bell curve will make sense *only* if you select your anime to watch randomly.
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is a fantastic show because of how it did something completely new. It created several character archetypes which didn't previously exist. Just because those archetypes are now overused and everywhere, it doesn't diminish the value of how they originally affected the industry.

Akira is another example of something that was ahead of its time, but isn't necessary up to today's standard of quality. (I would argue that it absolutely is, but that's beside the point.)
>> ARTICLE
Technically, NGE didn't create archetypes, it just morphed them slightly and made tsundere/kuudere (Asuka vs Rei) more popular. 
>> ARTICLE
Less popular shows get less views, which means less ratings, which means less popularity. It's a loop.

Then there are people like me who just don't have time to watch terrible shows and just stick with what're regarded as "good" shows. What happens then is that my ratings get inflated because I don't watch enough bad shows.
>> ARTICLE
Same, don't even have enough time to watch all of the good stuff let alone the not so good ones. I got a lot of 8 and 9s.

I think people confuse "hype" with "overly memed". Just because people mention it a lot doesn't mean it's "hyped".

It's the only one out of those three that could be in a realistic anime top 100, so yes it's worth watching.

Much more than Erased for sure (I enjoyed it, but it's ranking is way inflated right now). Also get on that!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this is why MAL makes me sad. You have Gundam 00 but no 08th MS team nor war in the pocket nor unicorn!? 

And only about 6 or 7 shows before 2000 on the list. To be fair older shows do tend to be longer, however there are plenty of shows before 2000 below 26 episodes that arebetter than the likes of gate and no game no life (which is inexplicably at no. 22).

Also the fact that Gunbuster isn't on the list is really sad, that show has probably the best ending of all time (I cry every time the colour hits in!)

Well atleast ping pong, tatami galaxy, and rainbow are high up.
>> ARTICLE
I could think of a bunch of anime that if they came out in the last year would be much higher on this list. Outlaw star, The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, and GTO arn't even on here. Explain that. 08th ms team and pocket are two anime classics probably best in the entire Gundam universe. Im sure im leaving a bunch of quality anime from the 90s and 80s that are 10x better than some of the shows on this list.

>> ARTICLE
Jesus! Those three aren't on the list? I just assumed they were when I scanned it! See this is why I don't trust people...
>> ARTICLE
GTO is 43 episodes and currently ranked 28th on MAL.

>> ARTICLE
yeah I was mistaken on that, I edited it out and replaced it. Such a good anime thought it was much shorter than that.

Isn't diebuster the sequel to gunbuster?

Why is that relevant?

I misremembered the number of episodes in each series. I, for some reason, was under the impression that they were both longer, and adding them together would push it above 25

Could be worse.

*stares at every Animebracket contest from /r/anime where Gundam keeps getting snubbed again and again*
>> ARTICLE
Unicorn is rated way higher than 00 and 08th MS Team is pretty close, they just aren't on this list due to OP's weird-ass criteria. They both fit easily into less than 2 cours, he probably just doesn't know exactly how entries of UC Gundam relate to each other and considers it a continuous story, so he only included AUs when making this.

Gundam 00 needs to be removed from this list as it has 2 seasons of 2 cours each.

I still don't get how there's such a gap between Gurren Lagann and KLK on MAL....

KLK only has boobs

Gurrenn Lagann has boobs AND giant robots.

Also I have to feel that an adolescent male protagonist is more relatable to the target audience of both series than a snarky female. 
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill has a *lot* of boobs, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's also part of the Gainax bias...though I agree Gurren Lagann was better crafted & planned out story-wise, Kill La Kill was more enjoyable and the ending=far less a base-breaker with the fans.
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of relative quality, you can't deny that Gurren Lagann is much more approachable to a wide audience than KLK. I feel like that has to be part of it. I also feel that Gurren Lagann was just plain better, for action, themes, and characters. (This isn't an insult to Kill La Kill. I *love* Kill La Kill)
>> ARTICLE
No Outlaw star, Gundam 08th MS team, Gundam war in the pocket,  The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, Gurren Lagann, and Gunbuster all missing from this list. It is funny how skewed toward recency MAL ratings are. 
>> ARTICLE
1) Recent anime are more easily available from streaming services

2) Anime crowd tends to skew young. A lot of people who watched anime, don't anymore

3) hardly anyone mentions those series anymore

There are not many people who would have seen those things you list, and if they have, they probably won't be on MAL now.

People aren't just thumbing their nose at older anime. It's more likely people just don't know about it
>> ARTICLE
Yea I know they arent thumbing there nose, but it is such a shame since there are so many good anime from not that long ago. Movies dont seem to have these issues though on IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes(for the reasons you listed I guess).
>> ARTICLE
well, it's a lot easier to obtain old movies legally than it is to obtain old anime too. Older anime are basically a niche within a niche at this point, and a lot of their distribution rights are held by IP trolls. A better comparison is non-American movies (or movies whose market was never intended to be the American public), and there is absolutely a parallel recency bias there.

Did you like Konosuba?
>> ARTICLE
I loved konosuba lol The comedy in that show was some of the best I've seen, although I havn't seen that many comedy shows. I honestly found it way more enjoyable than One Punch in my opinion
>> ARTICLE
Both of them are parody shows with stupid yet funny comedy. But I think opm was better overall. Better story, better comedy and better characters. The only good character that came out of konosuba was Kazuma imo.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its different for everyone. I just thought the gags/silliness was a lot funnier in konosuba 
>> ARTICLE
OPM has top notch fight scenes with amazing fight direction, an awesome soundtrack, interesting characters, some shounen subversion elements, and most of the comedy was on point. It has almost everything you could want from a light-hearted action series. That's all some people want in a show, so to them it's perfect.
>> ARTICLE
New "twist" on the regular superhero story, cool and likable side characters, competent pacing, interesting setting, great animation & art, good soundtrack, and many people found the comedy to be pretty funny.

It was also a show that I'd say got better as it went along. It started out kinda cool but got more interesting with the Hero Association, got more intense with the Sea King arc, and the Boros fight was the best part of the show and a great finale. I can see why a majority of people would enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying I didn't like it, I thought it was pretty enjoyable myself. I just don't see why people give it a 10/10 when the show barely had any story. My friend gave OPM a 10/10 yet FMA Brotherhood an 8... I just don't understand how its a master piece with such a high rating  lol
>> ARTICLE
Seems you're focusing on a pointless rating system.
>> ARTICLE
Well its not really that, its just people calling it a masterpiece like its the greatest thing is what I don't understand. It was good but nothing that made me say damn that was so amazing greatest thing I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
That's precisely my point. You're focused on a show rated at a 10 being objectively better than an 8, which really couldn't be further from the truth. The entire rating system is a shitshow precisely because people reduce extremely subjective shows to an extremely objective method of comparing them, and completely ignore what makes them unique.

As far as this specific example, I can see why someone would enjoy OPM so much. Its short, sweet, and just a lot of fun. No fat on the story. good visuals. most importantly, its fun, light entertainment. Its not one of my favourite shows, but I can see why someone enjoys it so much.
>> ARTICLE
FMA is quite a bit different than OPM. It's quite a bit more serious (at most points) and can certainly take on a darker tone in some parts. It's also not trying to be subversive. It's a straight up shounen that takes itself more serious than most and with a much more focused narrative. For some people this makes FMA better, for others it's not as much what they're looking for.
>> ARTICLE
Ratings are subjective and a lot of people just enjoyed the show. I don't think there really needs to be much more than that. IMO not having a big in-depth story isn't an issue if it is still one of the most enjoyable shows I've watched. At the end of the day it just comes down to how people rate things and the easiest way to rate something is by how much you enjoyed watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Rating on enjoyment is so much more subjective than rating the actual show (eg characters, plot, themes, soundtrack, animation).
>> ARTICLE
Obviously, but every rating is going to be subjective anyways. In addition you could have the most well written characters and the best objective quality story in existence, but people may not enjoy it. Personally I find just as much value in a review based purely on how much someone enjoyed something as a review that is trying to be objective. At the end of the day I don't care how good something is if I don't enjoy it, and I don't care how bad something is if I do enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I find reviews based on enjoyment to be utterly useless. I can never experience that enjoyment the same way, if at all. What I *can* experience is the characters, plot, soundtrack, etc. Rating and reviewing based on things that are actually in the show rather than how a show made you feel is a lot more logical, and produces scores that have meaning.
>> ARTICLE
But like I said even those things are subjective. Where I see a good character another may see an insufferable twat. Everyone has differing tastes in music, so a soundtrack may be good but still may not be anything you would enjoy. I would think rating the plot would be the easiest to do "objectively", but even then it is usually going to be based on prior experience. When you've watched/read hundreds of shows/books it will be a lot harder to find an original plot that stands out, but for someone without much experience an average or mediocre plot may be amazing.

IMO no review by some random person online is very helpful regardless of the criteria used. A review only becomes truly helpful once you've begun to understand the context the reviewer is looking at the work through. If you have totally different opinions on what constitutes a good character, or anything else, then a reviewer saying that a character is great means nothing to you. Until I understand a reviewer I take their reviews with a huge grain of salt.
>> ARTICLE
Subjective, obviously, but other people are able to witness and experience them. *Nobody* else can experience how the show made you feel, so it's a useless point.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody can tell me for certain how I'm going to feel, but a ton of people can make accurate predictions based on how they felt. If a lot of people think something is sad/funny/enjoyable then I will most likely have the same experience. The whole basis of an averaged score on a site like MAL is that most people will fall in line with the average. If something is rated a 7, regardless of the reasons but as long as those people were as honest as possible, the majority of people will like it but not love it. Maybe you have some particular tastes, but then you can just find a reviewer with tastes more similar to your own. Like on Steam there are curators or, I imagine, the clubs on MAL.

To get back to the original topic of OPM being highly rated, I don't think most people care about an in-depth story. Most people can find plenty of enjoyment in a lacking product, and OPM is executed extremely well in all other aspects. In addition it isn't like it has a bad story - it simply has very little story which I see no problem with. I mean it works for Dark Souls right?
>> ARTICLE
Does your friend rate on personal enjoyment?
>> ARTICLE
Quite clearly, he would. If OPM is higher, it could only be because he enjoyed it more.
>> ARTICLE
When I asked him he just said FMA was "alright" lol
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like it wasn't for him.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm well I think you have to look at it differently. One Punch Man is trying to accomplish different things than FMA. How well does each accomplish what they set out to do? Personally I think OPM does a better job even if FMA has a more ambitious story. More story doesn't automatically make something superior. There are many other aspects to consider. 
>> ARTICLE
The amount of story it had was perfect for the atmosphere the show was trying to create. Not every show has to have super in-depth character backgrounds to be a masterpiece. Dragging out the story would've slowed down the show too much to keep it interesting imo.

At the end of the day it was a really fun show with great music, visuals, comedic timing, and amazing fight scenes. What more do you need?
>> ARTICLE
There was no goal from what I remember with the show? It was just this monster showed up, he goes to fight it. Again I still enjoyed the show I just feel like its way over hyped imo 
>> ARTICLE
IMO part of what makes the show interesting is that the villains are the ones trying to achieve some goal (and get all the power up sequences and other tropey things) instead of Saitama. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably because of the hype. I really like OPM, but I don't think it was a masterpiece as a lot of people claim, the anime was really good and had nice animation, but the best part of the story is still in the webcomics in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind
>> ARTICLE
It's almost like people can have their own opinions and whatnot.
>> ARTICLE
While I can't say I'd give OPM anything above 9 I can easily see why FMA:B would get 8. It's somewhat too long for the story it's telling and has its share of shonen tropes. They're not bad per se, but it's not the masterpiece of deep writing as well.
>> ARTICLE
For me random comedy scenes killed FMA and also Brotherhood . OPM was solid and honestly fun story not the best but worth watching .

Also I think that about  half of shows on this list are overhyped but my it's just my opinion . Maybe it's becouse I like SoL , Drama and Fantasy stories more
>> ARTICLE
eh, the random comedy scenes brought FMA down to earth for me. It's just that FMA had less of those than FMA:B because of the shorter run...
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind

A show doesn't need to have a story if it's not necessary. In OPM having a continuous narrative wasn't necessary since it was a gag comedy.
>> ARTICLE
that would all good if it was actually funny.  Unfortunately it was all too happy making the same joke over and over.
>> ARTICLE
OPM didn't literally have only one single joke. Yes it had the overlying "one punch" gag but it was used in many different ways, sometimes as a joke and sometimes for a serious moment. Overall the show also had a variety of comedy moments that didn't center around Saitama's gag.
>> ARTICLE
ok, list some examples of other kind of gags.  Maybe I'm missing something, but almost all the gags are just people/villains looking down on the MC, who beats the villain effortlessly.  
>> ARTICLE
[OPM spoilers](/s "In the episode where Saitama and Genos were infiltrating the evil doctors lair, he set traps on every floor in preparation for their arrival. Instead of following the standard "clear the dungeon to the boss" trope Genos just instantly blows up the entire building and they enter the basement from there. This was funny because the viewer wouldn't expect this and it subverts the trope.")

[OPM spoilers](/s "After the "robotic monkey" is defeated he is acting like a hardened badass minion and gives the whole "you'll never defeat X" speech. Once he learns that they were actually defeated he drops the robotic voice and takes on a whole different persona asking to be spared. He says that the robotic voice and attitude was him just trying to sound cool. This is funny because it was unexpected at the time and surprises the viewer.")

I could keep going and pull out every single one liner from every single episode that either got a chuckle or an outloud laugh from me but I think you see the point. Every episode didn't have 20 minutes of nothing happening until one single joke about a single punch was pulled at the end. The episodes were lined with small to larger jokes derived from the characters speeches, interactions among each other, and actions in the world they were in which all worked together and created the overall comedic tone/atmosphere of the show.
>> ARTICLE
that's just another variation of the same "Saitama is too powerful" gag, the other being an example of "villains acting all arrogant until they are put in their place by Saitama, who is too powerful" gag
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling you don't really want to be proven wrong. 

Look at his first example, how does that fall under the "single gag" at all? Second example, doesn't fall under the "single gag" either.

These examples are pretty far from the "saitama too strong" gag, so unless you are unfamiliar with the references, its likely pretty clear to most that this isn't a single gag show
>> ARTICLE
And as a variation they're different, they're unique with the characters interacting in different ways which isn't boring or uninteresting for the viewer.

Genos constantly getting turned to modern art, the weird backstories for each villain, the strange character designs for each villain (I mean fucking look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/JJzfkFL.png) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/5qG4z0B.jpg)), [or even just the absurdity of certain situations in the show.](http://gfycat.com/PoshHelpfulIberianbarbel)

On the whole, the comedic situations he's placed in make [Saitama a](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/3wwk6k/anime_irl/?) [very](http://i.imgur.com/8GtTdCl.jpg) [relatable character](https://i.imgur.com/ixk3nTm.jpg) with the added bonus of just being hilarious in general. This is why I can't quite understand why people say the show only has the One Punch gag, it's a comedy with a varied arsenal of jokes to tell, yet for some reason people just say "LEL ONE GAG MAN".
>> ARTICLE
> monologuing

That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.  

>lackadaisical attitude

If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too.  What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.


> modern art

don't see what's funny about a good guy being almost destroyed every time, even less so when it happens every time

> LEL ONE GAG MAN

personally, I would go with One Punchline Man
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why I tried to give examples, you're actively trying to not have fun with the anime, and that's why the comedy doesn't work with you.

>That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.

Not with most other characters in any fictional media. Most would listen to the long backstory without saying a word, so no, I wouldn't quite say it's a "natural reaction".

>If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too. What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.

Again, the point is that this is abnormal for a main character of a show. Does Superman act like that? No. To give a currently airing show as an example, does All-Mighty act like that? No. These are the characters Saitama is parodying because they're so common, and his character type as MC is so uncommon. See, this is what I mean by the fact that you're actively fighting against this anime tooth and nail in order to not have fun with it. Everyone else sees Saitama as unique and funny, yet you're sitting over here trying to jump through mental hoops to see him as this normal character that is totally obvious to write as the MC of a superhero show.

tbh, the fact that it was nothing but a gag comedy for the first 5 episodes made me question where the hype is coming from. I mean yeah, it was hilarious, but it was the anime equivalent of Chocolate Mint flavor ice cream: you don't get it too often, it's pretty good, but ultimately nothing to be excited about.

The last 7 episodes though, made me think "oh, this was what manga readers were hyping it up for"

Still though, I have to think a fair bit of that was casual anime-only people just parroting the manga hype. 
>> ARTICLE
Seconded. I personally think that OPM stands out from the current arc being covered by the manga 'til the end of that arc in the webcomic. [OPM end of latest finished webcomic arc spoilers](/s "Sweet Mask obsessing over Saitama's power after thrashing Garou gave me chills. That, and whenever he shows up with his High Rank Harem.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think most people claim it as a masterpiece, it was just a really fun show with a good "hype" factor.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe not in anime communities, but people who don't watch much anime tend to overhype it a lot (look at its IMDB rating).
>> ARTICLE
it's because it's the "not anime anime". People who saw DBZ and thought it was dumb come to this and say "OH MY GOD, IT'S SO AMAZING".

Well there sure is a lot of trash, but at least there is also a lot of pretty good stuff.

I'm not sure I would have NGE on this list since EoE is more or less required watching.

It kinda is, but the ending, as little sense as it makes, also does its own job of giving closure to the series.

I agree, but EoE just adds so much both in clarity and thematics, combined with it being the originally intended ending till they ran out of budget makes it add so damn much to the series.

On the contrary, I think Madoka is too high.

Edit: Sorry I have a different opinion.

Oh yeah, the fact that my Top 3 favorites are on there, as well as most of the other of my Top 10 is pretty cool

not that I need validation, but hey being able to agree with other people that anime rocks is good

Yeah, I'm just impressed Shinsekai Yori is so high up.  I guess the list doesn't weight for viewer count, and SSY managed to find a dedicated audience that really loves it.

That list is all over the place, for every good series is followed by 6 series that shouldn't nowhere near the top 100. And the list is also oversaturated with recent series.

That list would be interesting if it weren't so useless. MAL scores mean nothing, so you've basically got the most popular 2 cour shows, not the best. In fact, making a list of most popular shows seems a lot more useful.

Hmm.

Aye, unfortunately.

Should I watch Rakugo? I watched the 1st episode before, and has a really interesting set of characters, but I cant get past the culture of it all. What this stage comedian thing is and how it works... looking it up on wikipedia doesnt even do it justice.
>> ARTICLE
For me it was hard to convince myself to watch it, but when I did, I loved it.  It was a pretty weird experience, that's never happened to me before, but I would definitely recommend watching it.
>> ARTICLE
But what about the culture aspect of the show? Because i dont know jack about the stage comedy storytelling aspect of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Mmm honestly it doesn't really matter. All the stories are self contained, so if there is additional backstory to it, it's not really necessary.  The important parts of the show are generally not the actual performances, and that's where the gold is. The stories are good, but the characters make it great. 
>> ARTICLE
Yay Rainbow getting recognition.  Not many people talk about it here.

Some of those anime have seasons announced to come... so.. should they be there?

Shouldn't Attack on Titan be removed simply because it is a show that is designed to have more than one season?

I did & neither were listed so I was hoping there was an extended list since the top 100 list shows 107. I was thinking they were adding more so I offered two suggestions. How are you doing today?

I'll definitely have to check out some of these other series because a lot on this list I haven't heard of so it would be good to check some out for my art inspirations.

this is nice because sometimes you dont want to invest yourself in a longer series. although something like bakemonogatari can be seen as a standalone series, it is better to plow through the whole series

Anohana was amazing ;_; made meh cri

And although S;G is one of my face series, can it be counted as 26 or less episodes of you count OVAs and films? If so then that will surely change with the new series that I believe is coming out? Or is that just a fan dream

I can't believe Haibane Renmei is ranked 83rd...

Serial Experiments Lain and Lupin III: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine are outstanding, I'm shocked that they both have just under an 8.0 rating.

MAL score didn't even hit 8.0, FYI.

Yeah but konosuba doesnt have as much incest so its not as good

Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

Good to know. [Those liars at MAL!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.
>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.

Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.

Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay.

> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.

Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).

tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.

Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.

I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.

That scene from Le Mort d'Arthur makes me tear up every time. One of Arthur's last lines

>What joy is now left to me on this earth? You must know it was you and Sir Launcelot I loved above all others, and it seems that I have lost you both.

Hits me hard for some reason. As much as I disliked Stay Night's adaptation, the final scenes with Arthuria in her own time were heart-breaking. 

Why can't we just have an anime of Arthurian legend?
>> ARTICLE
I kind of wish they just kept the original design from Fate/Prototype, where Saber as King Arthur was male, instead of catering to an audience that they assumed wouldn't accept the premise of you being a female magician summoning a male hero.
>> ARTICLE
I think the Prototype concept was interesting - if they played the legend straight. At the same time, though, I think a female Arthur is somehow more endearing to me, and it also distances Nasu's Arthuria from the Arthur of myth - a fairly incompetent, idealistic, weak fellow who really only had vision and charisma on his side.

I am torn on Nasu's practice of saying "fuck you" to the established tales though. Just to make things more interesting he completely disregards the reality of the characters like Alexander - and also Arthur.  
>> ARTICLE
I just always felt it would be a better and more accessible work in general if someone explaining the series could say, "Seven magicians summon seven heroes from across time to fight for the Holy Grail" without having to quality it with "Except most of the legends are butchered, and King Arthur is a woman."
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean by that, but most people who won't watch because of that stipulation probably wouldn't have watched it at all because it's anime. Once you're more into the medium I think you get used to see this kind of thing butchered (see Cthulu mythos and Abrahamic myth).

Also, if they had been really faithful to Arthur, no one would have liked it. Arthur was incompetent and never won a fight. He was incapable of making decisions because his very public sense of honor forced him into certain positions.

Also Launcelot was a borderline psychotic hypocrite who occasionally spewed some idealistic nonsense that was a far cry from what he actually practiced. He had a tendency to go berserk in battle and kill wantonly. He also had a tendency to sleep with random women - Arthur's wife Gwynevere included - and, when confronted, dive out windows naked and run off into the woods for a few years to become a hermit.

In short, if they had been truly faithful to those myths no one would take them seriously. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I wouldn't mind limited liberties being taken with the mythos behind each individual summoned hero, but King Arthur being a man is kind of an undisputed character trait amongst the various sources.  And, ahem, Alexander the Great did not have a beard!

I just mean that a lot of anime would be much more accessible if they felt less provincially Japanese.  The less stereotypical Japanese stuff that gets tossed in as if it were the most natural thing in the world, i.e. butchering Western legends and KYAA FANSERVICE, the more likely that people from other cultures would find it watchable.  Examples that come to mind for me are Ghost in the Shell and Kino's Travels, thought-provoking with messages that are capable of resonating with even non-Japanese viewers.  I feel like Fate has a lot of the traits that would make it accessible to a larger audience, but I keep coming back to how they took excessive liberties with the legends and GODDAMN IT KING ARTHUR COULD HAVE BEEN A BADASS, BUT IS INSTEAD A LITTLE GIRL.
>> ARTICLE
You stealth editted your comment on me, so I'm going to try this again.

What I am talking about is also agreed upon between all the different versions of the myth. Arthur only ever wins one fight, and that's because his guards intercede. He is a very consistent character despite being featured in many different myths. 

So ultimately, Nasu's Arthuria is a very distinct character from Arthur in more ways than just the gender. She is also an embodiment of the common image of Arthur, rather than a strictly accurate representation of the mythical character, gender aside even. 

*Now to bring up the latter half of your post.*

I totally understand and agree with what you're talking about. I am groaning my way through Umineko due to my love for Milton. Everything about the Seven Sisters of Purgatory hurts me to my core. I think Satan, Lucifer, and Beelzebub and I think [this](http://www.demonicpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/img-Dore2.jpg), [this](http://ibeelzebub.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/gustave_dore_paradise_lost_019.295105735_std.jpg), and [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HidON146Uf0/SPKDkvkin1I/AAAAAAAAAKM/9hnMIi8sVCs/s320/gustave_dore_paradise_lost_002.jpg). I think brooding intellectual bad-ass tragic antagonists with near god-like strength done up like Roman centurions. I think angels throwing mountains out each other while Jesus rides a diamond chariot and hurls lightning bolts. 

Instead I got [this](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/288/7/f/seven_sisters_of_purgatory_by_bluejule122-d30saow.jpg). The only reasonable thing I can do is say "they're aren't the Seven Princes of Hell, they're just some shitty throw away characters in a shitty Chinese cartoon."

I think the same is the only way to approach Arthur if it bothers you as much as this bothers me. It isn't Arthur. It's Arthuria.

And besides that, the point still stands that Arthuria can still be a bad ass. Woman though she may be, Arthuria is significantly more bad ass than Arthur ever managed to be in his actual source materials; she's just prettier, occasionally acts like a simpering little school girl and is often sexualized. Sure, I take issue with how much wasted potential they had in the idea, but that's just because Nasu writes rape fiction with magic. Can't be helped.

I mean, we were introduced to this awesome female knight with a fierce sense of frugality, duty, and honor. And then, *big twist,* she's actually Arthur. Giving her a good treatment, we get to see this king of knights in all her ideal, owning in combat, and then gradually we understand her motivation in her ultimate failure in her own myths. But she just happens to be a girl.

That's what should have happened.

*edit:* That all being said, to continue to rant because it pleases me, the same could be said of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory. Sure, make them female. The source texts themselves establish that angels have no form or gender. But give them a *respectful, thorough* treatment. Make them characters, not jokes. At least Arthuria got that much - from Urobuchi if not Nasu.

When I was young there was one which was kinda magic-mechaish. Each knight had an armor with a special feature. It was awesome back then, dunno if it aged well.

[Japanese Folklore Tales 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6277/Manga_Nippon_Mukashibanashi_(1976) - 1471 episodes

More anime deserve this kind of treatment.

Maybe it would give Angel Beats enough time to capitalize on the concept

Spice and Wolf season 3 with 1471 episodes!

Slowly getting through that first season.

Good to see the Major seasons have a high rating XD

Gintama in most planned to watch doesn't surprise me one bit. It seems like quite the mountain to tackle, but it pays off!
>> ARTICLE
I started it a few months ago but couldn't get past the episode after looking at that huge number of episodes even though I've watched the big 3.
>> ARTICLE
some people say it starts to get better at 25. I definitely liked the episodes before, but you might wanna try to hold out that long. Obviously if you notice that it's not for you you shouldn't push yourself
>> ARTICLE
I've heard that too but I didn't have the motivation back then to watch it. That changed since back then though so I might pick it up again soon.
>> ARTICLE
Tell me about it.  I watched 74 episodes and I find it...  Okay nothing really special.  Just most of the comedy in it is not for me I guess
>> ARTICLE
Is it true the premise combines sci-fi with samurais? Oh did I get that wrong? 
>> ARTICLE
well in theory yes, it's sci-fi with samurais. but it's much more. It's the comedy that makes the show, so the setting doesn't matter all too much  (it's still very well used). So you see loads of aliens showing up in feudal japan with spaceships. Just see for yourself, it's tough to describe.

201
>> ARTICLE
You're wrong its more than 201 its 260-ish
>> ARTICLE
You're talking about different series. Gintama has 201, Gintama' has 51 and Gintama Enchousen has 13.
>> ARTICLE
Its still Gintama? 

When we talk about Naruto we talk about Naruto and Shippuuden they're the same show just with a little pause between them.
>> ARTICLE
Not to me.
>> ARTICLE
So you think Gintama' isn't a part of the Gintama series?
>> ARTICLE
he did say *over* 200
>> ARTICLE
and 201 is over 200
>> ARTICLE
Thats my point, he was saying it as if OP was wrong with his over 200
>> ARTICLE
> he was saying it as if

but that's only you assuming things

and you also assumed I was saying 201 isnt over 200 which is not what I was saying, so we should just both stop assuming :P

It was most likely due to the first four episodes, which were so bad that their director [was fired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Star_%28manga%29#Anime) over them.

Interestingly it was the same guy who was then fired from KyoAni and, once he was out of the company, he apologized the fans for the E8 controversy, while it was still airing, IIRC.

I don't know how much effort it would take, but it would be interesting to see these figures adjusted for popularity.

If show X is in 100 peoples lists, and 90 dropped it, while show Y is in 1000 lists, and 91 dropped it, it obscures the relative ratio.

Luckily, animeadvice also keeps track of relative stats, but they're less interesting, and probably not entirely accurate either.

I am unsure why this sub takes such a disliking to ecchi. It's just another genre, granted catered to a certain age, after all. 
>> ARTICLE
Well the main reason is a large portion of it's "fanbase" just use it as masturbation material.

I don't see why people are so affected by that?

Because anime is not hentai

Action is pretty hype and if the boobs keep being uncensored like they were the past seasons, they'll be hype too.

I once saw a censored version by mistake... The lens flare on the boobs really made me laugh.

But then I switched back again to the uncensored version and lived happily ever after!
>> ARTICLE
Wait there's a censored version? Well I guess that makes sense.  For when it aired or something
>> ARTICLE
How do you put Hellsing Ultimate on hold o.O
>> ARTICLE
probably because it took like 6 years for 10 episodes to be aired at a pace of 1-3 episodes per year. some people just got tired of waiting and haven't bothered to finish it yet.
>> ARTICLE
I'm assuming there were a lot of people who put it on hold because they were waiting for the last 2 episodes to be dubbed and haven't gotten around to watching them yet. (I'm in this exact situation)
>> ARTICLE
But... there are subs.
>> ARTICLE
The Hellsing Ultimate english dub is widely considered to be better because the characters have fitting accents, in addition to it just being an overall good dub.
>> ARTICLE
Ok... I'll have to think about which I'm gonna watch before watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely dub, you gotta get those over-the-top German accents in all their glory.
>> ARTICLE
And Crispin Freeman as Alucard.  It's why I watched it dubbed

I'm glad to see Major getting some love, I really recommend watching the first(maybe second) episode.  It does a great job of drawing people's attention

One Piece never fails.

Touch, Cross Game, Kemono no Souja Erin, and Rose of Versailles are all in my top 15. I'm definitely gonna try Major now.

I haven't seen Romeo's Blue Skies either but really liked the other World Masterpiece Theater stuff that I've seen (Akage no Anne, Heidi, Marco). 


>> ARTICLE
Man Romeo's Blue Skies is amazing, although I guess I can see why people wouldn't like it. My parents got me into classic literature at an early age, so I'm a sucker for stories like this.
>> ARTICLE
Is there a way to find the shows with the highest plan to watch vs completed ratio? 

Basically, the shows everyone has on their list, but they never get around to watching.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean like in the case of Gintama where only 28% of the users that have it on their list have completed while 51k (Also 28%) out of 178k people are planing to watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, seems like an interesting measure, Legend of the Galactic Heroes has more people who plan to watch it than who have actually completed it, for example.
>> ARTICLE
It should be possible but kinda hard to pull off since not only is the data on the website really off sometimes but you also can only sort by a single field. 

I've tried limiting the number of members that have the shows on their list as well as limit the complete and plan percentage so it kinda looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KW8wFUU.png) but then you've to deal with the wrong data like in Jinsei and M3's case.

Scraping the data from MAL directly might yield better results but I've no idea how to do that. You could try playing around with the settings [here](http://test.animeadvice.me/#state/plantocompleteratio) to give you a better list but it won't be really 100% accurate.

Sorry for not being really that helpful.

You can ask about MAL data animeadvice site creator. You can look contacts in http://animeadvice.me/

Don't be sorry! Thank you for trying, I was simply being curious, that's all.

i've currently resorted to going down to things ranked over 1k for new shows to watch. there's some good, bad, and definitely 90's stuff back there. 
>> ARTICLE
Death note getting put on hold and dropped this much....I guess this is what happens when people over hype the shit out of a good show.
>> ARTICLE
Well... the reason for most of the shounen anime drops are cause the manga is just so fraking far ahead. I gave up on shippuden by the Hidan and Kakuzu ark. And i recently read like 100 chapters to finally end the 10 years of watching and following Naruto.

[Naruto ending spoilers](/s "The ending was pretty appropriate but the last boss was kinda shit. Also the whole profecy thing kind of makes all the depth and conflicts of all the characters in the whole story kind of pointless which really really sucks. Im Happy guy sensei had a really cool fight tho.")

>> ARTICLE
Really impressed with Parasyte popularity rise .  surpise no Bahamut in there .  
>> ARTICLE
Bahamut is actually not anywhere near Parasyte's popularity (Only half as many MAL members have it on their list). The popularity list for this season goes like this:

1. Parasyte
1. Psycho-Pass 2
1. Log Horizon 2
1. Fate/Stay Night: UBW
1. Amagi Brilliant Park
1. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso
1. Trinity Seven
1. InoBato
1. Grisaia no Kajitsu
1. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah was suprise to I see alot of people talking smack about psycho pass season 2  and log horizon 2 right now how its bad compared to season 1  so was shocked to see them above UBW considering its popularity. My guess is people are confused on the order of the fate series so alot dont watch it yet
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me that doesn't ever favorite tag anything MAL since giving something a 9 or a 10 is considered in my opinion a favorite tbh I think its a meaningless function 
>> ARTICLE
The lack of Slam dunk :/
>> ARTICLE
Hellsing: Ultimate in the put on hold top 10 when it only consists of 10 OVAs. No surprise, though. That series is insufferable. 

Pokemon in the most dropped top 10, aka, we dropped it because we grew up. Period.

Seeing the movie ptw makes me sad

Why is that?

Kizumonogatari, Evangelion 4.0, Little Witch Academia 2, and Heaven's Feel are all things that I very much want to see

Well at least the latter 2 aren't that far away.


I still vividly remember freaking the fuck when I read about the Eva Rebuilds, on AICN.... in 2000andfucking6

God heavens feel is going to be insane!

Yeah kinda crazy that we already have a trailer and general idea of when heavens feel is going to be released before we even get something other than a title card for evangelion 4.0

>> ARTICLE
It's melodramatic, poorly written at times, and crawls at a snails pace. The flashbacks that repeated the same thing over and over triggered my GGO PTSD. It's a good show, and I'm certainly enjoying it, but calling it a masterpiece just devalues the shows truly deserving of that title, IMO.
>> ARTICLE
I meant compared to the other anime of this season.

>> ARTICLE
Masterpiece isn't a comparative word. A masterpiece is a masterpiece regardless of context. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably the only show that will make me fall in love with a middle schooler...
>> ARTICLE
I never get which school system the translation's based on: the Japanese one or the American. Either way, I won't understand shit if it's not called elementary, secondary and university.
>> ARTICLE
It's absurd to compare two shows that have nothing in common.
>> ARTICLE
I meant that a lot of people talk about it compared to Your Lie in April. Sorry, I should've made that clearer.
>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari is not 50 hours long. It's 10.

Those are minutes and it's for the longest episodes.

I must've missed the title inbetween that and the category above.

I can't believe that Fairy Tail is more popular than Parasyte. You can't even compare those 2 shows, parasyte is so much better.

And theeere's the person finding any reason they can to bitch about Fairy Tail.

You can't really compare the two since one of them has been airing since 2009 while the other one has barely started this season.

* **Fate/Zero**

    Obviously.

* **Lupin III**

    It is simply unlike anything I have ever seen

* **Sakamachi no Apollon**

    Started because of legacy (Kanno + Watanabe), have not been disappointed yet.

* **Hyouka**

    Absolutely stunning animation, plus classical music and excellent voice acting from Clannad-man and his bro. 

* **Jormungand**

    From the makers of Katanagatari, including composer Taku Iwasaki (TTGL, Katangatari). Plus I have a thing for the insane (anyone else love [Malkavians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malkavian)?)

I'm keeping tabs on other shows, but these five have completely secured my attention. 

EDIT: I admit, I have been avoiding Studio DEEN like the plague after what they did to Fate/Stay Night and Higurashi. I am told however, that **Sankarea** is shaping up to be an exception. So I'll add that to my list as well.
>> ARTICLE
I had to drop Jormungand after the 2nd episode.  The pacing for the series feels too rushed and the entire thing doesn't appear to make much sense.

Or that's what I got from it.
>> ARTICLE
I'l agree that it did feel a bit rushed at times but I don't think that's a reason to drop it. Give it some time it has great potential
>> ARTICLE
Having never seen F/Z (or F/SN), should I watch F/SN first? Is it necessary/worth it? Stay Night seems to be considered inferior to Zero...
>> ARTICLE
No, really do yourself a favour and avoid F/SN, it contains spoilers for F/Z anyway.
>> ARTICLE
No need to watch F/SN first. Play the visual novel if you have time, but F/Z was directed by someone who never read nor watched F/SN (thank god).
>> ARTICLE
DEEN are shit when it comes VN adaptation (Also Umineko was bleh), surprisingly though I've been enjoying Sankarea and Kore wa Zombie desuka that are both made by DEEN.

* Accel World - Looks pretty, interesting technology and [cabling "sex" :P](http://8ths.in/accel-world-ep3-chiyu-hentai-fanservice/)
* Acchi Kocchi  - Always turn in to  pile of moosh at the end of each episode.
* Eureka Seven AO  -  Loved the original and AO proves that it will be too.
* Fate/Zero 2nd Season - Battles are amazing to watch.
* Haiyore! Nyaruko-san  - Crazy, nonsensical and hilarious
* Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? of the Dead  - A clusterfuck of bizarre, weird, pieces of shit, funny, moe and a drunken rainbow-puking fairy is great to watch.
* Medaka Box  - read the manga so I'm sticking to it despite the beginning being slow
* Natsuiro Kiseki  - Shutdown brain before watching.
* Nazo no Kanojo X  - Very unique and I like the old style animation.
* Sakamichi no Apollon  - I fricking love Jazz
* Saki: Achiga-hen - Episode of Side-A  - Loved Saki for it's cute girls playing superpowered mahjong, even if I don't understand any of the rules.
* Sankarea  - Enjoying it.
* Shirokuma Cafe  - Fun to watch
* Smile Precure!  - Way better than Suite Precure -kuru
* Uchuu Kyoudai  - Enjoying it.
* Upotte!!  -  GO TO FNC! GO TO FNC!

* **Space Brothers-** no explanation needed everyone should be watching it
* **Kids on the Slope (Sakamachi no Apollon)-**has been good so far and looks to only get better. Hoping for more music in episode 3.
* **Hyouka-** seems good and looks promising although I don't entirely understand the hype and all the talking it up..it's only been one episode and nothing particularly amazing or mind blowing has happened yet
* **Tsuritama-** This show has been fun and interesting. I'm hoping more of it starts to make sense but either way I'm really enjoy this.
* **Kuroko's Baskettball-** it's alright but I'm hoping the next few episodes will step it up. I'm a sucker for some basketball but this show is pretty cheesy and really not that good

zetman, lupin, jormungand, and there's a few more I'm watching and a few more I need to watch.
-edit just watched Accel World it's not the best but I definitely enjoyed it

Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is barely hanging on the list. I'm finding it hard to like any of the characters. They're just setting the story up but i'm sick of main characters who ask none of the important questions. Teichi just allows Yuuko to lay on him all the time and it is not interesting. I do not want another show where the lead is a complete idiot.

dropped: Sengoku Collection, Mysterious Girlfriend X, Saint Saya, Ozma, Phi Brain, Medaka Box, Upotte!, saki, polar bear cafe(might give another shot)

might give Hiiro No Kakera another chance but the first episode was really bad

>> ARTICLE
> sick of main characters who ask none of the important questions

like.....what?
>> ARTICLE
[spoilers](/s "Like why Yuuko knew his name before he told her and about some of what he saw. If seeing her ghost required looking in the mirror and what happened to the others who have seen her.  The rumors had to of started somewhere. I also find it hard to believe she hasn't discovered anything after 50 years. He asks himself some of these questions in episode 2 and then he forgets.........what?? It looks like Teiichi spends hours with her just letting her lie on him and push him around while he pretends not to entirely like it. All that time and he never thinks to bring any of it up? What a joke.")  
>> ARTICLE
Your watch-list looks a lot like mine.  Up-vote!  The only big differences is that Lupin III is a must-watch for me, and I want nothing to do with Hyouka.

upotte! because why not

natsuiro kiseki because its alright

haiyore! nyaruko-san because its amazing

kore wa zombie desu ka? of the dead because its amazing

hyouka! BECAUSE EVEN AFTER ONE EPISODE, THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE IS AMAZING
>> ARTICLE
* **Eureka Seven AO** - Because I most obviously continue what I started with the first season.
* **Fate/Zero 2** - Seems more action packed than the first part, and is infinitely better than FS/N
* **Folktales from Japan** - I love folktales and I love children's stories
* **Jormungand** - Koko is too fascinating to drop
* **Natsuiro Kiseki** - A cute s'life with interesting fantasy elements
* **Phi Brain 2** - Because I watched the 1st season and feel obligated to finish
* **Apollon** - Jazz-inspired josei is an obvious must
* **Saki: Achiga-hen** - Flair and mahjong are oh-so exciting!
* **Sankarea** - So much more intriguing than I expected. Dark and seductive
* **Shirokuma Cafe** - It's a polar bear running a cafe.  Duh.
* **Amnesia** - Still interested in Yuuko's whole deal
* **Tsuritama** - Brilliance with fishing and aliens
* **Uchuu Kyoudai** - I wa-wannna be an astroooonaut!
* **Zetman** - On the fence, but still curious about the dark sci-fi world

im still catching up on alot of stuff (watching Mirai Nikki now), but Saint Seiya Omega has my attention.

**In order of awesomeness**

* **Haiyore! Nyaruko-san**

IMO best show of the season.

* **Sankarea**

Zombie moe with a great, dark story.

* **Acchi Kocchi**

Just plain old light-hearted moe.

* **Tasogare Otome x Amnesia**

Romantic comedy with dark undertones

* **Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? OF THE DEAD**

Harem comedy that makes little sense. Watching it just cause I watched the first one.

* **Accel World**

Contest-type plot with a meh main character, but I started it so I might as well finish.

**Haven't watched these, but I'm interested**

* **Hyouka**

Haven't watched it yet, but it's KyoAni so why not?

* **Fate/Zero S2**

Haven't finished the F/SN VN, and I promised myself I'd do so before watching any of the Fate stuff.

* **Saki Achiga-hen**

Don't know if I actually will cause I haven't watched its source material.

Uchyuu Koydai (Space Brothers) would be under great for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Sankarea, Jormungand, Accel World, Sakamichi no Apollon
>> ARTICLE
In order of my interest for the respective show:

* **Fate/Zero 2**
* **Kimi to Boku. 2** (I feel like I'm the only one on /r/anime who's watching this one... It's great, though)
* **Hyouka**
* **Acchi Kocchi**
* **Natsuiro Kiseki**
* **Medaka Box**
* **Tasogare Otome x Amnesia**
* **Sankarea**

The last three are shows that I'm not especially interested in, but they're not *quite* bad enough to make me drop them, so I feel that I might as well watch them to the end seeing as this season isn't exactly packed with good shows.
>> ARTICLE
1) Accel World - Just watched the first episode last night.  Seems good so far although I'm worried it'll be like a .hack kind of show.

2) Fate Zero - Awesome show, can't wait to see more.

3) Apollon - I'm surprised how much I'm enjoying this show, although [2nd episode](/s "I'm surprised they did the standard beach episode on the 2nd ep")


>> ARTICLE
Wow, looks like people are sticking with a lot of shows.

I'm only keeping up with Fate/zero second season, Tasogare Otome x Amnesia, Acchi Kocchi for my weekly dose of moe, and Space brothers.
>> ARTICLE
F/Z and Kore wa Zombie of the Dead only because I've seen first seasons of those. Overall nothing interesting this season.

I want to watch more shows, but I've to much schoolwork, ffs. :(

Also, I like Medaka Box very much! :D But F/Z is by far the beste anime show of this season. :<
>> ARTICLE
Watching Sakamichi no Apollon, Space Brothers, Eureka Seven Ao, Hyouka, and Tsuritama. 

I dropped Saki side-A, and I'm probably going to drop Kuroko no Basuke, but I'm going to pick up Sankarea, Fate/Zero, and Lupin III at some point because I've heard they're pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
uchuu kyoudai
>> ARTICLE
The only one I started watching is Tsuritama. It seems like I'm missing out... shoot! I wish I had more time to watch shows!
>> ARTICLE
* Lupin III - this show is ecstasy encapsulated in 23 minutes.  I've never looked forwards seeing a new episode of something every week like this show.

* Sakamichi no Apollon - Classic Watanabe; OST has been good but somewhat lackluster so far.

* Space Brothers - FEEL SO MOOOON!!!

* Kuroko's Basketball - I'm seeing where this is going.  It's entertaining for a sports show, but man is the depiction of basketball in this show tuurrrrible.

There's a few others I mean to take a dive into like Tsuritama (because it's noitaminA, duh) but haven't yet for one reason or another.

Saki Achiga-hen, everything else is just to waste some time.

Hyouka

Jormungand

Tasogare OtomexAmnesia

Medaka Box


>> ARTICLE
* **Space Bros** - Extremely underrated but one of my favs this season imo
* **Sakamachi no Apollon** - Loving the theme and the characters so far. Hoping for more jazz sessions and references to other jazz figures. 
* **Fate/Zero** - Lots of actions so far. 
* **Jormungand** - Lots of interesting and likable characters.
* **Hyouka** - Bit slow but enough to get you hooked. Lots of quality here. Looks promising in the future. 
* **Acchi Kocchi** - HNGGGGG
* **Accel World** - Typical anime story. Enjoyable to watch tho.  
* **Shirokama Cafe** - Has its moment, a fun show to watch. 
* **Tsuritama** - A bit boring imo. Also the alien characters annoy me -_- Very pretty tho, hopefully the plot will move along. 
* **Zetman** - Read the manga but not liking the anime. Considering to drop it. 
* **Nazo no Kanojo X** - Liking the old school manga style here but not liking the pacing of this story. Might drop if I continue to not like it. 


Overall this season's been great so far with lots of great shows. Planning to get to Lupin III but feel like I should watch the predecessors first. 

>> ARTICLE
Sankarea is my absolute favorite this season. 

Fate/Zero 2nd. Beautiful. 

I watch Accel World when I feel like it. 

And I watch Shirokuma cafe basically just for the opening. I have a feeling it will be super predictable.

[] BoxOfficeMojo reported 5,557,907,165 for Eva 3.0 back in early February, but Bunka Tsushin reported 5,260,000,000 at close of theatrical release. As a Japanese source and a more recent source, I'm going to have to give Bunka Tsushin more credibility here. BoxOfficeMojo may be overly affected by changes in exchange rate as it's not clear how they calculate their totals.

If Deens shitty adaption did that well I'm definitely interested in seeing how Unfotables adaption goes and whether or not it beats Fate/Zeros sales.
>> ARTICLE
Read the list in OP

> (2011) *52,133 Fate/Zero [ufotable]

> (2012) *45,804 Fate/Zero 2nd season [ufotable]


>> ARTICLE
The point I was trying to make was that I'm interested in seeing if the recently announced Unfotable Fate/Stay Night remake ends up selling more than Fate/Zero
>> ARTICLE
Huh, with all the hype that Haruhi got in 2006, I would've expected much higher sales. Did it all go into merchandizing?
>> ARTICLE
An average of 42K is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly didnt expect to see Bakemonogatari so high up. I knew it well recieved but whoa. Thats amazing.

I'm happy to see Hataraku Maou Sama doing well.
>> ARTICLE
When you consider that Nisemonogatari is also up there at 60k, and the Neko OVAs did really well too, the Monogatari series is actually a powerhouse selling series. I'm looking forward to hearing how the first volume of Season Season did, which released recently. 

And then you consider that Madoka is up there, and the movies did really well, it shows that Shaft and Shinbou might be considered the most successful anime team on the market currently. 

>> ARTICLE
I actually saw the sales for Nise before I'd ever seen Bake so I just assumed that Nise did better than Bake and never bothered to check just how well Bakemonogatari actually did.

How well did Neko do? Also Neko wasn't an OVA, it was a TV special. I think they aired all four episodes in one night and simulcasted them as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know it was a TV special. It tops the list at 56k. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Love Live outsold Jojo, an immensely popular franchise with a lot of content and history behind it. Though I guess it's not completely fair to compare the two since Jojo had 2 adaptations, with a third coming soon (with the third being the most popular). But I guess that just goes to show you the power of moe idols.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I can't wait to see the numbers after Part 3 comes out since it's what they live by over there.
>> ARTICLE
What the heck is "The World of Golden Eggs" lol, looks like a children's show which makes sense. 
On the list I'm surprised that SAO *only* sold 35k, thought it was more popular than that. 

SnK no surprise it's selling big. 

Madoka somewhat of a surprise I knew it was popular but not quite 71k popular.

I thought Haruhi would be near the top of the list but only 42k.

Wonder what it would take for a series to break 100k these days, would have to be immensely popular and/or have a lot of volumes.
>> ARTICLE
>What the heck is "The World of Golden Eggs" lol, looks like a children's show which makes sense. 

It's not. It's an adult short (one of the episodes revolved around 2 teens fucking in the bushes at school). Very much like Robot Chicken's story style but there are no cultural jokes. Just plain datsuryoku-kei comedy. Occasionally there is a live-action cooking segment reminiscent of the one from Tentai Senshi Sunred. 

It aired on MTV in Japan so think about American MTV cartoons and that should give you an easier picture.



>> ARTICLE
Why am i not surprised?
>> ARTICLE
Fate series sucks anyway. I don't get how someone from the West can stomach the horribly interpreted Western themes.

I'm sorry, I know it's dickish to hate on things, but I can only take so much inundation of this show's praises.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how much experience you have with the fate series, but having played the visual novels I can safely say I have no idea what "western themes" you are talking about. If you are just talking about pulling from western legends like King Aurthur and whatnot, then 1 those are not themes, and 2 you could not be more wrong. 

But yeah the anime sucks pretty hard. Did almost nothing right.
>> ARTICLE
You're nitpicking over a word that's not even really even wrong. The interpretations at least in the anime were really shallow, as well.
>> ARTICLE
Everything in the anime was really shallow. The anime was really shallow. The VN gives character profiles to each of the servants and explains how they are affected by being summoned. Forcing them into a class alters them from their historical/mythological selves in various ways. Additionally they are strongly affected by how people remember their legend, rather than actual fact. 

They give a lot more depth and characterization to each of them, and delve more into the legends they are from.
>> ARTICLE
I see, so the problem I mentioned is probably not there in the VN.
>> ARTICLE
I know most of those... but it's the first time I've ever heard of the first one, "The world of Golden Eggs."

Not sure I'd really classify it as anime.  It was a weird cel-shaded (or something) comedy comprised of random skits - the closest comparison I can make is maybe something like Robot Chicken.  I didn't realize it was *that* popular, but I do remember a lot of my friends enjoying it.

Pre-2000 rankings

http://i.imgur.com/2C8dcWw.png

Note: NOT average sales. Box-sets / re-releases included. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
All those poor people getting shipped empty boxes...
>> ARTICLE
I was very confused about this list until I reread what this list actually is. These aren't the all-time best selling TV anime sales, these are the all-time best selling TV anime **average** sales.

So, although older anime series like Evangelion might have had the highest total number of sales, those sales *per month* (or whatever time period this chart averages) have tapered off over time, causing it to fall off the chart. So, this chart will tend to show higher rankings for newer series.
>> ARTICLE
No, that's wrong. Those sales number are total average tracked by [Oricon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon) from the day the BD/DVD is released up until now, it usually stays the chart for only 2 or 3 weeks since most of the sales come from the first week so there're no such thing as 'per month' sales. And Oricon is established in 1999 so this list is only limited to post-2000 anime (that's why there're no Evangelion)

There's a list for pre-2000 (Anko-chan posted it), but i'm not so sure about its accurateness.

>> ARTICLE
Seems a mistake in titel: To aru Kagaku no Index.

It's either 'To aru Kagaku no Railgun' or 'To aru Majutsu no Index'
>> ARTICLE
I noticed this as well. Pretty sure Index does not classify as "scientific". It make me chuckle. Usually I see the opposite and people write "To aru Majutsu no Railgun".
>> ARTICLE
Am I missing something? Shouldn't Evangelion be on top? Or at least on the list?
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty niche anime, to be frank, and not everyone that watched it understood it or liked it. That's not to say it wasn't well done, though.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the movies would sell well, because of all the ads and publicity stunts we see in convenience stores and whatnot.  Maybe US anime fans have an unrealistic perspective when it comes to seeing Japanese promos for Evangelion movies.
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion, as I understand it, was a pretty big success. Not the biggest, but it had good reviews. But it just wasn't accessible to the mainstream. It is, after all, a mech series at it's core, and very into sci-fi beyond that. Throw in some daddy problems and a dash of odeipus (sp?), and you have a series that a select few will love, but most will not understand. They'll just see giant robots.
>> ARTICLE
>Not the biggest

Except that it has the highest BD/DVD sales out of any anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Then why isn't it on the list? It does say "all-time."
>> ARTICLE
It's been said in the thread multiple times already. The people collecting the data starting in 1999 so all of the anime are from 2000+. EVA is from 1995. EVA has sold 170K+ copies, more than Bakemonogatari, which is at the top of the list.
>> ARTICLE
> The people collecting the data starting in 1999

I didn't see that, sorry for the confusion.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to watch it again, since I enjoyed it but alot went over my head as I've found out recently.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it once with a friend, didn't like it. Watched it again, and still didn't like it, but I saw that it was more than I'd given it credit for. So good move.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched it, tried watching it again, realised that there really was that much stuff left unexplained and left disliking it even more.
>> ARTICLE
This list only has anime that came out in 2000 or later; the data for older series is less reliable, but Evangelion is the series with the highest per-volume average.

I'm guessing that this list is just a copy of the post-2000 data from [here](http://www.mania.com/aodvb/showthread.php?p=2010466#post2010466), although I don't know why Golden Eggs isn't listed there.
>> ARTICLE
Is this average per year, per season, or per month?
>> ARTICLE
I didn't realise how popular SAO was.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't one piece the most popular ever?
>> ARTICLE
It's the top-selling manga of all time, not sure about anime.

Ohhh that may be true, Totally forgot this was just anime, some of these im a little suprised they did so well but werent continued
>> ARTICLE
i had no idea bakemonogatari is that popular.

why is it so popular? 
>> ARTICLE
Have you been living under a rock????? Bake has always been known to be one of shaft's great successes and it shouldn't be a surprise judging from nise's sales number
>> ARTICLE
did not realize it was more popular than haruhi/k-on!

(almost as much as both of them combined!)
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the world of Shaft..... where fanservice blows everything else out of the way
>> ARTICLE
You can say that for Nise, but Bake didn't really have that much fan service.
>> ARTICLE
Just because Nise has way more fanservice than normal doesn't mean Bake didn't have its fair share.

That's also not counting Nisemonogatari with it.

It aired prime-time and is a family friendly show. I don't think it's especially popular compared to other prime-time shows like Sazae-san or Doraemon, but It's much shorter so I can see it selling lots of dvd's as opposed to Sazae-san which has almost 7000 episodes.

I think it's supposed to be educational. It's to help learn English if I recall right. So that may be one reason.

Woah this is so weird. I went to bed last night looking for these exact statistics, but couldn't find any. So, thanks!

Edit: Shouldn't Neko:Black be on this list? It's sold 60k+ last I checked.

It shouldn't count as a special, it aired on TV first

I agree. I think it also aired on Nico at the same time? So I guess it's both. Maybe the difference is that it wasn't made for a specific time slot.

Some interesting things I noticed:

For how much love Steins;Gate gets here, it's pretty low on that list - just beating out Chuu2, which at 15k is more than I was expecting. Also surprised to see Cowboy Bebop so low. Does that include US Sales?

I'm glad to see Love Live! and GuP up there. Someone already mentioned F/SN at 26k. I liked it. I'm glad it's up there.

Clannad > Clannad: After Story; lel. 

I know people like Bakemonogatari, but I'm surprised at a mammoth 78k. Is there a reason for that? Is it just that good? I've got it, I'm gonna watch it now.

*monogatari and Urobuchi slaughter. Holy cow.

It's cool to see how well the data fit a curve. http://i.imgur.com/LQdIW3s.jpg

10 of KyoAni's 18 TV series make that list.

It is really good, but its high numbers have always confused me as well. To me, it doesn't really have the features some of these other shows on the list have, what you could think of as universal appeal. Maybe its uniqueness makes it stand out. Maybe the LN was insanely popular anyways, so it already had a solid fanbase. I'm curious to know.

Hmm. I'm not sure about that. The story is great but the pacing for the anime is horseshit.

There's nothing wrong with liking it, but it's a bad show on almost every level. It was like a poor man's Avatar or FMA.

How was it "bad"? It was pretty, had some nice characters, a kinda unique setting and some pretty welldone action scenes. It was a bit childish sure, but I don't think it was bad...
>> ARTICLE
The pacing was really bad, for starters. All the arcs were paced poorly. The earlier episodes were just rushed, and didn't allow you to form any sort of connection to the characters. The later arcs were drawn out and dragged on to unreasonable lengths.

The characters are some of the worst I've seen. Obviously this was to cater towards a young audience, but that's no excuse for having poorly written backstories, and shocking character exposition. Alibaba is probably the character I hate the most (save Kirito). He was written to be juvenile and immature, as were most of the characters, which honestly reflects quite poorly on the writers.

The plot was not well thought out, and was unsatisfying, especially compared to the superior Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Basically, this is the list of every show that has sold over 10,000 copies, which is considered the marking of a large success. 

Card Captor Sakura was highlighted because of the positioning at the bottom of the list. All the series that are moving up the list are from the last year (2012-13, anyway), except Card Captor. It was released in 1998, yet it's moved up! Very impressive!

Sakamichi no Apollon slowrolls its status as "the only 2012 anime with a prayer of appealing to anyone outside of anime fans".

SAO proves adolescent power fantasies are a dream that cross oceans, with equal success in Japan and abroad. Shinsekai Yori continues to be outsold by damp paper towels. The industry marches on.

I'm surprised that Kuroko no Basuke is only that high despite the insane popularity in doujinshi community and elsewhere.
>> ARTICLE
Do you know why these number are relatively low compared to other video sales? 10.000 copies can't be far more than 300.000$, which doesnt seem much for a whole animation company, or am I missing something major?
>> ARTICLE
A season of anime doesn't cost $30, it's closer to $300.
>> ARTICLE
Although I'm not so sure about how much they make, well, let me just say that anime industry is actually pretty hungry business, where people work endlessly in a pretty bad condition.
>> ARTICLE
Each volume (of which there are 6 per series) is $60 each, so $320 per series sold.  There's also DVDs and sales made later down the road.  Then there's merchandise like figurines sold for hundreds of dollars (not sure what royalties/margins the studios get), OSTs, posters/wallscrolls, plushies etc. I assume that since they pay to air their series (versus being paid in western TV companies) they might also get paid for their shows viewership by advertisers/the TV network for advertising.

They don't make crazy amounts of money per series, that's why the animation quality is so low in the first place. The animators in Japan are paid pretty poorly and a lot of the work is passed out to Koreans and others to keep the costs as low as possible. Animation quality also doesn't really seem to affect sales so there's not much point investing in something which doesn't seem them any returns.
>> ARTICLE
Seeing Shin sekai yori at the bottom, while seeing shows like Busou Shinki or Oniichan dakedo getting four-five times the number of sales, really makes me lose hope in the industry. I was hopping SSY would launch a trend for anime based on actual novels but no, apparently telling a story isn't as successful as pandering.

Not that there's anything wrong with LN or VN, but the keep adapting the strangest titles..
>> ARTICLE
SSY really is glorious. If anyone hasn't looked into it yet then go try it now. It just doesn't have the mass appeal or otaku pandering to be a success. It's a niche interest within a niche interest. Disappointing because the anime medium has so much potential for bringing good stories to life with the right art and music and SSY is a great example of it.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone tell me what these numbers are?

These numbers are combined BD/DVD sales in Japan for each of the series in total.

Ginga e Kickoff is a kids show. Who buys kids shows on DVD? NTR is something I'm quite surprised about. I haven't seen it, but it looked like the kind of show that would sell at least 2k.

If a show is not well received, then yeah it can sell very little.  With the amount of money put into each show, studios can afford few failures.  I suspect (don't quote me on this, merely a thought) it's why studios create shows which pander to the Japanese otaku with shows featuring moe, fanservice, etc.  Those shows will be much more likely to succeed.

It's probably because Idolmaster is more known for the games than the anime and the anime is just a by-product of its popularity. While Love Live is a manga which means it originally has no sounds and people prefers the one with music

Can someone explain what the numbers are in relation to current vol./total vol.?

So for SAO, would this be an accurate reading of the data: the 39,745 sales are the average sales over the only three volumes currently out (6 have yet to be released).

EDIT: Oh what is the time scale of these sales? Per week/month/total sales?
>> ARTICLE
The numbers are the average of the Volume sales. So yes 39,745 is the average for the 3 volumes of SAO out right now and not the combined number. When another volume of SAO comes out it will then be averaged into the numbers.

Expect any of the averages for incomplete series to go down when they are completed as First volume sales are almost always highest.

Edit: These are the sales totals. After volumes stop ranking on Oricon they are considered the total for that volume since the numbers drop to such an insignificant degree like >100units/week
>> ARTICLE
So it would be fair to say that SAO has sold about 120,000 units (~40,000 * 3). Which would mean it would have 120,000 * ~$50 = $6,000,000 roughly in sales of those first three volumes? That's pretty baller if so.

Last question. How do volumes rank on Oricon then?
>> ARTICLE
Oricon collects data from tens of thousands of retailers and releases the sales data for the top 50 Bluray and top 50 DVD in sales for each week. Recently they changed it to include the top 100 of each. 

Anything over 500 sales will usually show up on the list and even more will now that it is 100, so the sales data is fairly accurate
>> ARTICLE
SAO volumes are 66 USD on amazon.co.jp, so it'd be 7.9mil. That's also discounted from the RRP of 90 USD so it'd likely be more when factoring in smaller discounts from other retailers.
>> ARTICLE
Yay!

Hellsing Ultimate is more like 30 episodes with its 1 hour runtime, same with Katanagatari and 24 eps.

> Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, Gintama, HxH, FMA:BH, Monster, DBZ, Bakuman, Code Geass, Durarara are among my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Did you read the rules I used for the list?

Half the point of the list was to remove second seasons of things from the top, because they require the time investment.  If the first season still does well then it's in the list because it's standalone, which second seasons are not.  
>> ARTICLE
But then, why would you include second seasons for some shows but not others? At the point, the 40 episode thing becomes a very arbitrary guideline.
>> ARTICLE
You're not even following your own rules m8
>> ARTICLE
> Rule 1: No anime longer than 40 episodes. Period.

Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show. 
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show.

I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point.  If people want to continue after that, that's their decision, but all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.  But that's ok.  I'm going to remake the list taking into account all this stuff.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point. If people want to continue after that, that's their decision,

truly, if this is your interpretation of your rules then your list doesn't make any sense. Everybody can continue or stop after ~40 episodes of anything (first season or not), they don't need your misguided list for that.

>  all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.

> Code Geass, Attack on Titan, Chihayafuru on the list

ok, so what you do is claiming it's enough to call something a 'first season' to make it stand alone. Because these three very clearly don't have any resolution in the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Well is certainly my fault for not explaining the purpose well.  The overarching goal was to remove incredibly long running shows, but more importantly to remove sequel bias within the context of show length.  So all these shows that are not only long, but also contain a huge score jump in the second season tend to dominate the list quite a bit. A guy a while ago made a combined season list which averaged scores, and that was awesome, but didn't necessarily remove what I feel is the heavy score bias from familiarity that plagues the top 100.   But anyway, is a moot point now. Intentions are meaningless.

>Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, absolutely. Except for Hyouka, all of my top 5 shows have more than 50 episodes. I also freaking love JJBA, One Piece and a lot more.

I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

Longer shows have a better chance to properly explore the setting and the characters and you can get easier attached to them as well. I also prefer slower pacing way more than to fast pacing, but that's just me.

Anyways, thanks for the work.
>> ARTICLE
> I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

I was having a discussion with a buddy of mine about this.  We've both read the Wheel of Time series, which is good, but a massive time investment.  There are a lot of good, long running shows and if I'd started them at the time it would be fine, but trying to jump in now...not sure it's worth the time.
>> ARTICLE
When i was new to anime, i was actually sad that there were so few long shows. I was in Post Anime Depression after FMA:B was my first proper anime(that i knew was anime and intentionally sought out), worse was it after doing HxH up to the airing episode (119 iirc.) in a week. Felt like i'd never find anything like them again, and i really haven't had a lot anime past that point be either. So long ones are good, as long as you don't get stuck in Naruto/Bleach fillers. Skip those if they don't please you, that's what i do. 

HxH probably has the best pacing imo. (Chimera arc exempt, that one was a bit slower IIRC.) To me, the first 20 episodes felt like 50, and in a positive way. For some reason, the 2 minute episode situation that a lot of good shows have didn't happen in HxH, though i'm not sure why. It's wasn't a bad thing, i enjoyed those long good paced episodes because they felt so filled. 

As a side note, to me, HxH was great from the beginning, so i understand that for those that didn't like it as much at the beginning, might have felt different about this.

Why not Bake + Nise + Neko?

Higurashi (when they cry) has a second season which pushes it to 50 episodes total. (+ several ovas, 6 of which counts as a third season)  
  
I guess you can see the first season only, but 90% of the plot of the first season is explained in the second season. It's a bit weird to only include the first season on the list, since the story doesn't make much sense without the second season to back it up. 

If I was to pick anime from a list like this, I would rather have all the shows included be 40 or less, including all relevant sequels. If I want a short anime, I don't want to discover later that there are actually two more seasons that weren't listed just to keep the episode count down. 

That's just my opinion though!

That mofo has beautiful eyes I must say! But a what a manipulative asshole he is! Warping Kirei so he betrays his mentor and everyone else just so Goldie can have fun with their despair...  
Though, he actually said some deep stuff about joy and happiness.  
Why do I have a feeling that this will fuck up everyone's day at some point?  
  
**Lancer**  
Being the chivalrious servant he is. Hasn't done much this episode. Aside from trusting that bitch of course.  
  
**Caster**  
Oh, how I love this child murdering duo! He was so cute, trying to console Ryuusuke and all.   
And then that dialogue about God...Wow. Quite an original view, that's for sure! What's more surprising is that he managed to change Caster's views too. Rather impressive.  
I am also sad, since everything is pointing towards one outcome. They gonna die. They still got more development than I expected but I am still sad :(  
R.I.P. Cool!  
  
**Rider**  
First of all, that dialogue between him and Waver about...well...basically everything. This is the second time this guy gave me goosbumps just with his words alone. What an awesome character! Definitely my favorite!  
Rider is into RTS. Mighty fine taste bro!  
Poor dude must be annoyed by how everyone wants to kill him on sight before he could say anything!

> WHAT A VILE CLIFFHANGER! Leaving people hanging like that for months must have caused quite an uproar back in the day.

I forgot how much of a cliffhanger it ended on so I feel bad for having a day between the seasons let alone a few months.


>> ARTICLE
I thought I could stick to the schedule and was taking it easy so far, then episode 13 hits and I'm like 'fuck it' and caved. Worth it!
>> ARTICLE
It's Code Geass all over again.
>> ARTICLE
Nowhere near as bad as Berserk Ultimate cliffhanger final episode .


>> ARTICLE
That made sure you go and read the manga!
>> ARTICLE
That one was just brutal. I wouldn't say this one is as bad but it still sucks.
>> ARTICLE
CG was plain evil.
>> ARTICLE
It was at this very moment, that the rest of the masters knew, that they had fucked up. Caster probably should have been a priority much sooner to be taken care of, huh?
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, I don't know why Tokiomi hadn't just sent Archer to waste him already.
>> ARTICLE
''Hey Archer, wanna go kill Caster?''

''No.''

''...''
>> ARTICLE
I now know exactly why Tokiomi didn't send Archer to kill Caster, but now question how he intended to get Archer to kill Caster eventually, since that was the whole point of putting a bounty on him in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
"Your excellency, do you desire to slaugher a pack of mongrels all in one go and claim the Holy Grail?"

Probably not enough smooth talk, but that's the goal.  Kill Caster: Get the command seal.  Kill other people who came to kill Caster and have weakened themselves: Steps closer to the Grail.
>> ARTICLE
I realize I'm really late here, but that's the thing - So far, Gilgamesh has stated that he gives 0 fucks about the Grail.
>> ARTICLE
Just smooth-talk him until he fires a few swords into Caster's face I guess. Though I guess that didn't take into account that gi-fucking-normous Cthulu thing.
>> ARTICLE
It's surprising that they didn't considering that at least 3 of the masters knew where Caster was located.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't figure out where he was located until literally the day before when Waver found the location, and then Waver destroyed Caster's hideout. Then immediately as Caster returned to his burned down hideout him and Ryuunosuke decided to do what they did in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure they saw him as a threat, considering he didn't seem to be interested in the other Masters and Servants at all (Other than Saber)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but there was still the incentive of another command seal. Although Waver and Kirei probably didn't need them, Tokiomi could have probably had use for it.
>> ARTICLE
I just love Ryunnosuke and Caster's talk for how meta it is. You could quite easily replace 'God' with 'the author' and get what's really happening here, two characters deciding to be evil because it makes for a better story.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly this.

That speech was double duty as one of the most concise explanations of the narrative role of the antagonist as well as an absolutely hilarious piece of theological mumbo jumbo.

It really reminds me of how [Cabin in the Woods Spoilers](/s "Cabin in the Woods, the recent Joss Whedon horror flick, is a meta horror film where the ultimate evil is only placated by having horror movies play out in reality, as a form of human sacrifice. In the end the ultimate evil is really just horror movie fans with their incalculable lust for blood.")

Woa...okay.  
Nobody is allowed to talk shit about Urobutcher after this!

"You're an unbelievably interesting man."

I hope all first-time watchers have caught the meaning of the chats that Kirei and Archer have been having since Gil almost straight-out said it.

Archer is grooming Kirei to become someone like him, someone who can find entertainment and pleasure from seeing mongrels suffer and fail in their endeavors, whether their hopes are commonplace "foolery" or very rare "stupidity."

The house that Saber and Irisviel go to is in fact the one featured in F/SN, where Shirou lives. Very cool to see it for those that have read the VN or seen previous anime series. [F/SN spoilers](/s "The same circle that Irisviel uses to use her magic is the same Shirou uses to summon Saber.")

The talk of religion and philosophy between Ryuunosuke and Caster has always been very fascinating to me. How a psychopathic murderer could come up with such an extravagant way to describe God as someone who enjoys both courage and hope as much as despair and bloodshed is quite interesting, super interesting in fact.

The relationship between Waver and Rider is probably the best between Master/Servant pairs. In the one hand, you have Rider, one of the most famous person to ever lived, his name forever in the history books (even if they're inaccurate lol), so he'll never be forgotten, then you have Waver, a mage that is completely unknown. The difference in status is huge and Waver knows it, hence why he feels so inferior and incapable when he's next to "Iskandar, King of Conquerors."

As for the final fight against Caster in the river, THE GREATEST COOL IS INCOMING, and it's probably some of the best technical animation on an anime series to date, and of course the content of the fight itself is awesome, so look forward to that in the next 3 episodes first-time watchers.
>> ARTICLE
You know, I had no clue who the hell "Iskandar" was.  And when Waver showed him that book about Alexander I didn't understand what the connection was.
>> ARTICLE
As a general rule of thumb: As soon as a Servant's name is dropped you are free to google that without fear of spoilers (unless the Type-Moon wiki is involved)
>> ARTICLE
and the best part about Archers grooming is that [ALL FATE SPOILERS] (/s "Kirei already is")
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, and yes, it is a spoiler. Not just for Fate/Zero, but definitely for Fate/stay night as well. 

[](/s "It's easily my favourite aspect of Kirei's character. He was always a twisted bastard; all he needed was a little push from Gilgamesh to fully embrace it.") 
>> ARTICLE
He was already in a crisis given a certain someone actions, I really wish they did an ova with Kirei life it's an amazing tale to be honest. 
>> ARTICLE
Amazingly tragic and fucked up, you mean.

And I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Ryunnosuke's philosophy stops just short of him realizing he's a fictional character and I love that aspect of his character. From a meta perspective, he's actually the sanest member of the cast.

The talk between Rider and Waver is great too. It's a real marker of Rider's maturity that you could easily miss and dismiss him as a simple boisterous meathead. He doesn't just think he can beat the hell out of everyone that gets in his way, he's fully aware of how difficult his  dream is and he is taking on the challenge specifically because it is almost impossible.
>> ARTICLE
>There is nothing in Kariya Matou's fate that could bring a man joy. For him, life is nothing but suffering and tragedy.

No need to remind us :(

**First Time Watcher Alert**

Episode 12:

* Kiritsugu being flustered is a rare sight
* Something about the way Gilgamesh is talking about Kirei's lips disturbs me
* Backstabbing is abrew
* Tfw you mistake Maya, who's driving a car, as Waver.
* Oh shit, Shirou's house in FSN
* Irisviel already broken
* Kirei having another chit chat with drunk as fuck Gilgy
* Never goes well

Episode 13: 

* Ryuunosuke calling someone "inhuman" is such lols
* I somewhat lost my attention at ryuunosuke chanting gospel
* Maybe you're just tall Rider. Like holy shit, youve gotta be over 7' tall.
* Waver so tsundere.
* Rider having a nice heart to heart with Waver. He's been dead to me since episode 11, but Waver's growing on me.
* Caster causing shit. They should have killed them while they had the chance

Overall: BUILD UP!!!!!!! Im so curious how they're going to kill off so many characters in so little time

The hilarious fact is that people seem to ignore that Caster could give rider a run for his money in the BRO scale. Ultimately being a bro was the thing that caused him his fate crisis to begin with(it wasn't just Joan it was how things ended for the men under her command), then stuff went bad... Really bad for the rest of his life. 

Welp I recommend people to watch Irisviel consultation room to get a bit of extra caster after the next couple of episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if you knew already, but Saber is King Arthur not Joan of Ark. Which is one of the reasons Casters obsession is interesting. He doesnt realize he has the wrong hero 
>> ARTICLE
You are talking with a 2004 VN player here dude, Jean the counter force aided human of France was the one who called Guiles to aid her in battle due to his riches and ability to support her army. However caster fall was the witch execution of the Saint he believed to follow and the terrible fate that ensued to his comrades in the battles, as by that time they where considered heretics, this did a huge emotional scar on him and stuff only went downhill on him, you should do your research on this topic. 

There is also a bit of in cheek humour with Saber from new Orleans in her passport if you noticed. 

I never called Arthuria Joan, I pointed it wasn't only his obsession with Jean that caused his downfall while he was alive but how he felt betrayed at the men who died at a cause God had forsaken in his eyes. 
>> ARTICLE
Alroght gotcha, I guess the wording just sounds like youre referring to Saber. Wasnt trying to offend
>> ARTICLE
Came from reading the VN and I have to say it's really interesting to see the gradual character development of kirei into what he is in FSN. 

Another thing that I'd like to point out is the magic circle that was drawn in the storeroom. In FSN it always baffles me how saber was summoned as she seemed to appear out of nowhere in the storeroom without any rituals. Turns out irisveil set up a magic circle in the storeroom, and it's interesting how saber was responsible for preparing the magic circle, so she aided her own summon in the future which I thought was pretty interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure Caster's giant tentacle monster is literally supposed to be Nasuverse Cthulhu.

So basically it's King Arthur and Alexander the Great fight Cthulhu. This can only get better. 
>> ARTICLE
God I love Ryuunosuke's brand of scenery-chewing evil. Just that whole scene between Ryuunosuke and Giles is perfect. I love how they address the issue of Giles being imprisoned for his lands.

And also we see Urobuchi's cephalopod fetish.

Yeah I'm pumped for this boss battle against Super-Saya, yeah.... wait that's it?
>> ARTICLE
Left us hanging off of the edge of a cliff there, not cool Ufotable! I love Kirei + Goldie convos so much, Rider being an inspirational hero to Waver, Ryuunosuke and Caster have a pretty twisted view of God to be honest but it's funny to watch, not enough Kariya, still not enough Kiritsugu, I have quite the dislike of Saber building up on this rewatch whereas I'm really beginning to appreciate Iri.

I hope I don't forget :3

Thanks for the info. 

Personally, Joshiraku was also among my top anime of the season, and Kokoro Connect would no doubt be on that list as well (if I were not afraid of watching it) 
>> ARTICLE
The journey of Rinne no Lagrange has been wild. I remember people really enjoying the first few episodes and then it slowly wasn't talked about anymore. When the second cour came around no one cared. A swift fall from grace to say the least. 
>> ARTICLE
This is what annoyed me about sword art online personally I preferred accel world but sao just totally eclipsed it. There probably wont be a second season now. 
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, did you even give Sword Art Online a chance?
>> ARTICLE
I finished it but personally I hate how much it was hyped up considering there were many more in that season that were better but it just had a far larger budget to work with therefore it was popular. The concept is not new this time it just had far more budget to it had more advertising and better animation therefore popular. 
>> ARTICLE
So you hate a show because its more popular? Im sorry but that is incredibly unfair, especially since they are both written by the same author. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they're trying to say that because SAO was so popular, Accel World is less likely to get a second season (because SAO would get it instead).
>> ARTICLE
Yes exactly and I get down voted simply for my opinion and them not even listening to my explanation which was valid.   
>> ARTICLE
Im aware that's why I was mad because one had a much larger budget accel world would have been 1000x better with a budget and team that large working on it. Accel world felt rushed but the actual connections with the characters and the story in general were much better in my opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
Why is this happening? The first season didn't do nearly that well.

Also, what's the show about?
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching the show this week, so someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I know:

Uta no Prince-Sama (Shortened to Utapri) is the best selling Otome franchise currently on the market with a total of 7 games (2-3 of them being rhythm games, the others are dating sims), Drama CDs, music CDs, manga, and other merch. 

It's about Haruka Nanami, a girl who's dream is to compose music for her favorite idol. In the games, you play as Nanami and eventually start a romance with one of the boys. There are six main male characters, all of which have their own unique styles and personalities, and a seventh is introduced officially in Season 2. Later games, you can also branch out to their rival group for more dating possibilities.

Being a female anime fan, it's refreshing to see an otome game get it's own series and with all of the harem animes around, (which sure, I still love those too) it's a nice change of pace. I think the series can be summed up as female fanservice. The characters are relatively well developed, but it's entirely a girl's fantasy anime. 

I could be mistaken, but I believe the sales are incredibly high because they included concert tickets? It's something I saw said in another thread, so I don't know first-hand. I do know the franchise is very popular in Japan, and has somewhat of a cult following of girls and women. It wouldn't surprise me if they wanted to complete their collections of CDs, manga, and games with the anime series.

All in all, it's fun to watch and some of the music is really good. Having no previous knowledge of the franchise; Season 2 is a lot better than Season 1. 


>> ARTICLE
it's selling so well because the first volume has a lottery ticket you need to try and get tickets to the live event at saitama super arena

expect the second volume to sell less than half this figure
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. That makes a lot of sense.

>> ARTICLE
It's just so long lol.  I've watched bits and pieces of it on youtube and I'm intrigued I just don't know if I have the galls to binge watch a 100+ episode anime.  Thanks for the other suggestions tho.  I've been wary of Stay Night but I've had a few people recommend it so I'll give it a shot.    
>> ARTICLE
If you liked Fate/Zero, you'd probably like UBW. It's newer and has better animation (it's nickname is Unlimited Budget Works).

Should I watch Stay Night prior UBW?
>> ARTICLE
Nah. You don't need to.  It's a completely different story
>> ARTICLE
> I finished it in 3 days.

HOLD UP, seriously?  That's actually about 18 hours a day from my calculations... 
>> ARTICLE
I probably did it in 3 or 4 days too, can't remember the specifics.
>> ARTICLE
No regrets. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak to the others you dropped, but I watched 3 episodes of Steins;Gate and dismissed it for being slow and weird. I picked it up again a few months later and devoured it in a few days. So I'd say, try again - you might kick yourself!
>> ARTICLE
That's the main reason I dropped it.  The first episode had me where I was like "ok so maybe this girl gets killed because she goes back in time or something... then she's alive again... then maybe little girl that's the main characters "slave" is a robot..then the banana... then them washing clothes.. then he's giving nicknames... Then I stopped watching.  I force my self to watch an episode every once in a while (I think I'm not episode 6 now) but I just can't watch more than one or two episodes at a time.    
>> ARTICLE
Believe me, once you hit the episode (i think its somewhere between 7-9) everything just goes crazy. I was reluctant to keep watching it before that episode, but after that, I binge watched the entire thing in one night.
>> ARTICLE
I'm the same way with Bakemonogatari (which I would recommend). Being so diologue heavy it's hard for me to binge but I can't help but like it
>> ARTICLE
I'll check it out.  Thanks for the suggestion.  
>> ARTICLE
Just saying. It is most likely like nothing you've seen. It's one of SHAFT's early works so the art may look a bit off, but it is very interesting. Plus it is a popular one around here if that matters at all.
>> ARTICLE
Yea I looked it up and the art is a little ~ lol.  I'll read up on it though and see if the plot interests me.  
>> ARTICLE
Give Steins;Gate another chance. Once things go down, you're in for a ride
>> ARTICLE
I'll try man but I don't know...  
>> ARTICLE
It's worth it. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll try man lol...
>> ARTICLE
try watching up to episode 10 or 11. If you still don't like it by then, the show probably isn't for you
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the suggestion.  I'll try and give it a shot this weekend.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend Zetsuen no Tempest (has some romance, but it's not the main point of the show), Kara no Kyoukai, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and since I don't see it mentioned up there Code Geass as well. I'm gonna second the opinion of giving Steins Gate a few more episodes as well, it's definitely worth the watch.
>> ARTICLE
I'll try check out the ones you suggested.  I'll try to isolate myself from the world and give Stein's Gate another shot
>> ARTICLE
I agree with /u/_LFkrebs_ , especially Madoka Magica. That shit is gold, man. 
>> ARTICLE
Try the following: Dungeon ni deai motomeru, sword art online, future diary, absolute duo, angel beats, rokka no yuusha 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your suggestions.  I'll check all of these out. 
>> ARTICLE
I second everybody saying continue S;G.  Also, any reason you didn't move on to the rest of the Fate series?

You might like [Shimoneta](http://myanimelist.net/anime/29786/Shimoneta_to_Iu_Gainen_ga_Sonzai_Shinai_Taikutsu_na_Sekai) as well.  The synopsis will seem wack, but trust me, try 1 episode. :P
>> ARTICLE
I just heard negative things about Stay Night about how it was a little more "cartoony" than Zero.  I really enjoyed Zero and didn't want to tarnish it's memory I guess lol.  
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough.  Neither Stay Night adaptation was as good as Zero, but as far as anime go, they are still really solid overall.  Anyways, lots of good anime suggestions in this thread so you'll find something.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your contribution man.  
>> ARTICLE
If you like comedies like Prison School you might like Shimoneta. It's short and easily binge watch-able. I also recommend my personal favorite anime, Baccano.
>> ARTICLE
I'll do some research on those two.  Thanks for the suggestions!
>> ARTICLE
Watch Redline it's a pretty badass movie.
>> ARTICLE
Similar to Akira?

>> ARTICLE
Try Gate, School Rumble, Welcome to the NHK, Beck, Baccano (give it 3 episodes at least), Soul Eater, Shinsekai Yori, The Devil is a Part Timer.

Did you see *both* FMA 2003 and Brotherhood?  If not, do.

I haven't seen of those but FMA/B and Soul Eater.  Thanks for the suggestions broski

**Episode 11**

The famed [Banquet of Kings](http://i.imgur.com/LBDLcyR.png). One of the most memorable moments in Fate/zero, where [Saber](http://i.imgur.com/8cBgYwe.png), [Rider](http://i.imgur.com/a2E3JWZ.png), and [Archers](http://i.imgur.com/irP8hta.png) philosophies and ideas on kingship clash in a Grail Dialogue rather than in a Grail War. Three kings, three ideologies, three wishes.

&nbsp;

Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes, starts it off in the usual [flashy](http://i.imgur.com/ShdpY46.png) and [extravagant](http://i.imgur.com/hgLsF7k.png) manner, summoning [alcohol](http://i.imgur.com/miyrzxJ.png) with his [Gate of Babylon](http://i.imgur.com/xQFLTJH.png) (how over the top can you get?). Gilgameshs philosophy is simple: he is king, hes always been king, and always will be king, and as king, [everything](http://i.imgur.com/qgWkbZk.png) of [value](http://i.imgur.com/Rl8wM1K.png) in the world is his, because he [says](http://i.imgur.com/DUaFlIu.png) [so](http://i.imgur.com/sb9xV4J.png). For all the other mongrels of the world, you either submit or die. He doesnt desire the Grail, for he [claims it is already his](http://i.imgur.com/4GXhkvj.png). His only goal is to prevent the others from stealing it from him.

&nbsp;

Iskandar, the King of Conquerors, wishes to use the Grail for [true incarnation](http://i.imgur.com/O94Gaoi.png) in order to conquer the world from there. He doesnt want to use it to conquer the world, because that is not his way of doing things. Thats not conquest. Conquest is done by [ones own hands](http://i.imgur.com/WliGt29.png). 

&nbsp;

Arturia, the King of Knights, wishes to change Britains [Fate](http://i.imgur.com/EFrzsey.png). Her ideals are rooted in the desire to save everyone at the expense of herself. Sound familiar? Kiritsugu also believes in sacrificing himself in order to save the world, but Sabers ideals are fundamentally different from Kiritsugus ideals, which emphasize saving as many as you can for the sacrifice of the few. And so Emiya Kiritsugu and Heroic Spirit Arturia will never see eye-to-eye. 

&nbsp;

Upon hearing this, Iskandar [immediately refutes Sabers philosophy.](http://i.imgur.com/1fHsKPa.png) Sabers wish to change the past [disparages all past actions.](http://i.imgur.com/SvitDXV.png) Saber claims that the king should [sacrifice himself](http://i.imgur.com/LYlLdbd.png) for the sake of his people, but Iskandar says the [people sacrifice themselves](http://i.imgur.com/pzV3JLw.png) for the king. [Saber](http://i.imgur.com/s8a7ybR.png) would [die for her ideals](http://i.imgur.com/vGllKVm.png), as a king who must [stand alone](http://i.imgur.com/jqWSTjF.png), and is not allowed to [live as a person](http://i.imgur.com/AWjM5Mn.png). For this reason, Iskandar disregards her as a king, for to him, a king is one who [leads](http://i.imgur.com/K2Rl6Ly.png) and who becomes [something to strive for](http://i.imgur.com/qwDjnRE.png). Saber is [speechless](http://i.imgur.com/C8xT4H7.png) as she cannot find the words to [retort](http://i.imgur.com/6ucQyfq.png), and [wavers in her resolve](http://i.imgur.com/KZaZB6N.png), [remembering](http://i.imgur.com/0YRW7aH.png) [her past](http://i.imgur.com/shmudUE.png). 

&nbsp;

Finally, in order to combat [Assassin](http://i.imgur.com/HR6Stbp.png), Iskandar [shows](http://i.imgur.com/iVMdLqr.png) [off](http://i.imgur.com/To32oB1.png) his Noble Phantasm, a literal [manifestation](http://i.imgur.com/TwQ20tL.png) of his [philosophy](http://i.imgur.com/YXOOd3S.png) as a [king](http://i.imgur.com/ltVeD44.png) that derives his power from the ones who stand and fight with him. The Reality Marble, [Ionian Hetairoi](http://i.imgur.com/knZ13Si.png). Reality Marbles are one of the cooler Nasuverse concepts (Mystic Eyes of Death Perception being the coolest IMO), and they allow the user to temporarily materialize the landscape of their mind. Its an extremely rare ability, and Riders is even more ridiculous as his Noble Phantasm is literally *[thousands of more Heroic Spirits](http://i.imgur.com/2FiyGB8.png).* In the face of such an [overwhelming display of power and resolve](http://i.imgur.com/xg9y3ip.png), Saber [cant](http://i.imgur.com/pCwskgl.png) [argue](http://i.imgur.com/Qwcsv1v.png) [back](http://i.imgur.com/m0z9V6G.png). After the battle, Saber recalls a [knight](http://i.imgur.com/NuztGme.png) who left because of her ideals, and concedes that maybe shes been going about it all wrong the whole time. 

&nbsp;

The banquet explicitly laid out the philosophies of Rider, Saber, and Gilgamesh. So which one is right? The show seems to argue that Riders way of kingship is the best one since the bulk of it is him refuting Sabers perspective. Gilgamesh isnt refuted but thats because logic doesnt really work against his almost solipsistic point of view. Sabers ideals took the biggest beating, even though they are noble and pure, so the show seems to deny her self-sacrificing as the correct path. A lot of people have said that much of the dialogue doesnt really amount to anything significant or meaningful. I personally enjoyed it but Nasuverse media does have a problem with making characters mouthpieces for certain philosophies. 

One of the most talked about episodes, and arguably the best in the first cour. 

WOO SCREENSHOTS maybe I went a bit overboard though... Edit: cleaned it up a bit.

Edit 2: 

**Episode 12**

Tokiomis also planning on [screwing the rules](http://i.imgur.com/E0TnUYy.png) and attacking the others like Kayneth and Kiritsugu did, while the Caster hunt is still in effect. Kiritsugus also plotting. Plotting everywhere by everyone!

&nbsp;

Kiritsugu notes Kotomines errant behavior, realizing that hes been [going after him the whole time](http://i.imgur.com/83H6RDL.png), but he [doesnt understand why](http://i.imgur.com/k3kSB3x.png).

&nbsp;

[Irisviel x Saber OTP](http://i.imgur.com/fPQORZf.png). Irisviels homunculus body is [starting](http://i.imgur.com/PSAAss0.png) to [break down](http://i.imgur.com/AwNq868.png). The Einzberns sure love using [people as tools](http://i.imgur.com/gzARce7.png). 

&nbsp;

Gilgamesh says Kirei finds pleasure in thinking about [Kariyas fate](http://i.imgur.com/SK84cXI.png). He defines that something is pleasurable if you dont mind [wasting time](http://i.imgur.com/xTtSrlx.png) [thinking about it.](http://i.imgur.com/9bLSinC.png) Kirei rejects Gilgameshs words, claiming that [finding pleasure](http://i.imgur.com/wD1plef.png) in Kariyas life of [suffering and tragedy](http://i.imgur.com/mP20p6N.png) is [inhuman and sinful](http://i.imgur.com/spsr38O.png). And then Kirei gets his [Command Spells](http://i.imgur.com/lCzdlxD.png) back. Gilgamesh claims that Kireis use for the Grail is to find out what he [truly desires](http://i.imgur.com/lpgJUja.png), and tells him to [do what he wants from now on](http://i.imgur.com/ZsH0g2U.png), even if it means [betraying Tokiomi](http://i.imgur.com/5bXNkep.png). [Ominous](http://i.imgur.com/hucdaZ0.png).

&nbsp;

This episode is a turning point for Kotomine. As for whether the path hes turned onto is good or evil is yet to be seen. 

&nbsp;

**Episode 13**

Primarily Caster/Ryuunosuke and Rider/Waver scenes. Caster and Ryuunosuke are some sort of twisted psychopathic comedy duo, with really out of context lines each. Theyre so [over the top,](http://i.imgur.com/sFmq2jS.png) and I totally agree with the others who have said that they feel out of place. All their dialogue is saturated with hilariously out of place [irony](http://i.imgur.com/TVlBTjS.png) that feels really [forced and shoehorned.](http://i.imgur.com/mkXBVv9.png) Evil for the sake of evil is fine but these guys take it too far. There are parts where it seems [meta](http://i.imgur.com/6YbxKFh.png) even, when theyre talking about God(Urobuchi) and related junk. 

&nbsp;

In sharp contrast, Waver and Rider have [meaningful](http://i.imgur.com/52wZNBM.png) [interactions!](http://i.imgur.com/bc0X8rU.png) All of their interactions and dialogue give them [each](http://i.imgur.com/dDfX4gd.png) [more](http://i.imgur.com/kPugCmx.png) [depth](http://i.imgur.com/FVduV4K.png) to their characters. Wavers name really fits him, as his [insecurity](http://i.imgur.com/PUq0yHf.png) [and](http://i.imgur.com/Dqi4f3e.png) [immaturity](http://i.imgur.com/jVpuujj.png) show up [again.](http://i.imgur.com/Y8tsBjD.png) He, like Kotomine, is also [unsure of what exactly he wants,](http://i.imgur.com/otCuDP6.png) but he knows he wants to prove himself. I find him to be the most relatable of the characters, as even though hes a mage, hes still the most normal person thrown into the Grail War, and he often seems [out of his depth.](http://i.imgur.com/pk56N7Q.png) 

&nbsp;

Rider is a [great](http://i.imgur.com/aTyJwz1.png) [foil](http://i.imgur.com/nbw4Dyu.png) and [mentor](http://i.imgur.com/csupB9N.png) for Waver, living up to his ideal of what it means [to be](http://i.imgur.com/FjxDmTk.png) [a](http://i.imgur.com/HxMOqTM.png) [king.](http://i.imgur.com/F6BKZxG.png) Ever the [optimist,](http://i.imgur.com/hmnjmeC.png) Riders [charisma](http://i.imgur.com/vmEhLtz.png) and [confidence](http://i.imgur.com/W5hCOl1.png) continue to be refreshing and uplifting in the face of Wavers [doubts and complaints.](http://i.imgur.com/s9YCuZY.png) Rider has a healthy dose of [perspective](http://i.imgur.com/rKIppgw.png) that he [bestows](http://i.imgur.com/ZY7G3oD.png) [upon](http://i.imgur.com/MEf7U6N.png) [Waver,](http://i.imgur.com/fyVisol.png) and [reassures him](http://i.imgur.com/TjO6GVQ.png) that they are both just [two idiots in this huge world.](http://i.imgur.com/82S6mUO.png) 

&nbsp;

Caster summons Cthulu and does shenanigans. Saber can walk on water because shes a badass. I havent talked about stuff besides plot/story/themes but the visuals are amazing as usual. 

First cour finished! Onto the second, arguably even better cour!
>> ARTICLE
Nice work with all those screenshots. Did you have them saved somewhere?

An interesting aspect of this show is that it is subverting the standard hero trope. In a "normal" story, Saber's perspective would have been put forward as the right one. Here however, her view is being challenged from all sides. Gilgamesh's view would have been the view of a standard villain in a normal story, but here it is put forward as a official choice, and Gilgamesh can't be seen as a villain, since he is above that.

As you already said, Rider's viewpoint is presented as the best one. However, even his "simple and down to earth" wish seems to be hard to fulfill. 

Another point about the subversion of the standard hero trope is Kiritsugu. At the beginning, it looks like he'll be the main character and hero in this show. After one cour however, we can see that he is far from the standard heroic character. He works in the background, and uses Saber and his wive as decoys, which is again a challenge to Saber's ideals.

This is probably one of the reasons why I like this show so much, and the second cour will only be better.
>> ARTICLE
>Nice work with all those screenshots. Did you have them saved somewhere?

Thanks, I think I went a little overboard though. I took them while rewatching and picked ones that fit.

Yep, the whole Fate franchise is about the breaking down the idea of the "hero of justice" and examining it from different points of views. 
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 11:** This is probably one of my favorite episodes from the series. Saber: A king must serve his people. Rider: A king must lead by example so his dream will be his people's dream. Archer: I am king so therefore I am absolute.

Obviously Rider had the greatest persuasion in his point of view, and he had [Ionian Hetairoi](http://i.imgur.com/mqusJ9b.jpg) to back him up. 
Best Noble Phantasm.

**Episode 13:** [The other servants and master's aren't ready for the "COOOOL!"](http://i.imgur.com/G4mchHi.jpg) Here comes the battle against Caster, again. I hate his guts.
>> ARTICLE
11 is one of the best episodes of the series. It's a fairly interesting dialogue about king philosophy for the most part. It also involves the 3 servants that aren't one dimensional caricatures, which helps.

12 is just setup. It's interesting for those of us knowingly watching Kirei's character development, though.

13: Sigh.

The focus returns to Caster, to my dismay. They reiterate the same jokes about him and Uryu being LE EVULZ and go on to summon...Cthulhu?

UUUUUMMMM.

What the fuck? Do I even need to say anything?

This is the start of one of the most bizarre, unnecessary, and inconsistent with established canon battles in all of fiction. I do not look forward to the next few episodes. I do, however, look forward to getting to the other side of them.
>> ARTICLE
I think episode 11 is the best episode of the first half. The discussion of kings is a fantastic concept, and perfectly executed. This episode is the one that made me really like Rider and Archer. It was very entertaining to hear their ideas of what it is to be king, and I could actually sympathise more with Rider's or Archer's idea of being a king. 

Saber was shown her own flaws and limitations very clearly, and Rider's rant was completely on point. This episode served as a perfect view into the characters ideals and reasons to be here, and had some excellent development.

And we get a first look at Rider's ultimate noble phantasm, Ionioi Hetairoi. The first time I, as a major fan of ancient greek mythology and history, saw this I was almost having a nerdgasm. Ionioi Hetairoi is an amazing idea and it fits the Alexander in this story perfectly, and it firmly placed Alexander in the top spot for best character of this series.

Sabagebu and Hanayamata deserve higher ratings. I'm sure the fans will see to that once they're finished airing.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you. Pretty funny shows

>> ARTICLE
If you really want to know how the summer series are doing it's better to look at how their rating changed over time. This list doesn't discount early hype ratings and the many low ratings from people dropping it after 1 episode.

You can look at [this] (http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1217175) and [this with graphs] (http://anime.daanst.de/?page=topical) to get a better idea of peoples changing opinion.

I thought Sabagebu was doing quite well for starting off with a low rating until that random hunting part happened, it all went downhill from there.
>> ARTICLE
The Glasslip graph is exactly what I'd expect it to be
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... biggest disappointment of the season.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, i'd be surprised if Zankyou no Terror ends the year with that rating intact.  The show has taken a nosedive in plot quality in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Seeing as how it hasn't dropped yet I wouldn't be. MAL is known for having users way overrate anime.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Ever since "Five" took to the scene, it has become increasingly ridiculous, suspending the suspension of disbelief.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't watch last week's episode. So I guess it went from "unmemorable" to "wtf is this"?
>> ARTICLE
Not that bad. It just went from somewhat believable to bot believable at all
>> ARTICLE
I'd just like to make a note that the MAL ratings are a weighted collection of people's opinions.
>> ARTICLE
I don't even bother with MAL ratings because they're just so bad most of the time. I'm not a fan of the community of that website, as useful as it is, and their taste just isn't very good and they often way overrate anime and underrate more niche things.
>> ARTICLE
No, MAL ratings are very accurate. All of the top 30 anime deserve to be there apart from NGNL.
>> ARTICLE
And everything other than the top 30? AgK sure isn't an 8.19. ZnT has been taking a nosedive and really isn't an 8.5, more of a 7. Tokyo Censorship shouldn't be anything past 7 either. There's also the fact that 5 should be average, but on MAL a 7 is the par.
>> ARTICLE
Well, AgK has been getting better recently, although I didn't like how [AgK Ep. 8] (/s "Bulat's death was done")

It's still no where near an 8, especially when you consider 5 should be average.

A lot of my most favorite shows of this season are towards the bottom... Hanayamata, Argevollen, Locodol...

Sabagebu...
>> ARTICLE
The fact that Locodol is rated below Glasslip pisses me off to no end. I'd say it's worthy of *at least* a 7.

I gave it a 7. Cute funny, hasn't really done anything wrong, either

Locodol is really cute and funny. I rated it 8.5
>> ARTICLE
I thought SAO II would've been higher, but on another note does anyone else dislike ranking these shows when they aren't even finished?
>> ARTICLE
I think SAO 2 hasn't been good nor bad recently. It just hasn't shown anything interesting imo
>> ARTICLE
I thought it'd be higher bc of its popularity, I personally don't think it should be higher. I agree with you in that it's been ok. It's definitely better than the first season. 
>> ARTICLE
Naw, its SAO hate combined with a lot of SAO fans not enjoying the slower pacing.
>> ARTICLE
I find Tokyo ESP way too low. I don't know I enjoy it a lot. And from these 32 shows I am watching 27. So yeahhh
>> ARTICLE
I personally think ESP's too high, but different strokes.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I don't think SAO II deserves a higher ranking, its just that since it's so popular I figured it'd be at least top 5. I'm glad Barakamon is 4 and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is 6. And I like Sabagebu quite a bit higher than its ranking.
>> ARTICLE
SAO, Akame ga Kill, Aldnoah.Zero, Zankyou no Terror, Tokyo Ghoul, Barakamon are high in my list. from 10-9. This some has some good anime. In my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's better than last summer. Barakamon is great. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun and Sabagebu ended up being way better than I expected and are among my favs this season. Tokyo Ghoul's interesting, Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!? is solid. And there's a few more I'm enjoying.
>> ARTICLE
I kinda stopped watching Rokujouma around the third episode mark because I didn't see it going anywhere. Does it get better over time?

So you finished watching the short version, I suggest you move onto phase two next and watch ep4 onward.

It's been more of the same stuff, but it looks like there is a development coming in the plot.

I don't. I only rate a show if I have finished it.

Well, congratulations then.

Welp, my shit taste is confirmed. I'm pretty surprised and disappointed at how low Majimoji Rurumo and Jinsei are. Sabagebu is a bit higher but still pretty underrated in my opinion.

It's less your shit taste and more their shit taste. I mean they have ZnT and Tokyo Ghoul above an 8.

Well, Jinsei can only be watched on TV or by fansubs. That's why it's not very well known.

Well in my opinion it's not that far off, if it was solely based on my opinion there'd be few alterations but nothing major so I'm pretty pleased with this.

I've been looking forward to watching Glasslip after it finished airing because of how much I liked NagiAsu. It looks like I'm going to be disappointed though.
>> ARTICLE
It kinda is. I was fairly looking forward to it, and was even doing episodic reviews on my channel. After episode 5 I missed an episode. "Whatever, I'll get around to it." Missed another episode. Missed another. I have no motivation whatsoever to watch this show. It's not terrible, but it's incredibly generic and stale. I might end up forcing myself to finish it just because, but we'll see.
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna disagree with what everyone else says and recommend you at least try it. I like it at least.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I like the concept, and I love the characters. Sure, it moves slowly. Yet how many P.A. Works titles out there actually move quickly? Very few. And how many of them come from out of nowhere at the end of the season? Most of them. 

That's why I'm reserving judgement until the very end. If it disappoints me after all this, P.A. Works will still be ahead in the game as far as I'm concerned. RDG was a serious flop, but that's the only one on their scorecard so far. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly don't bother, I went into it thinking it would be another NagiAsu but it's just so bad, couldn't get past 4 episodes or so, was very disappointed

Don't let the ranking fool you. I haven't watched it myself, but first give it a try!

Not bad. Pretty fun so far, although the last episode did turn serious (I just want my beach episode they keep teasing).  

Wonder if it would get a third season, thats when the real Fate/ starts. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Glasslip and Sabagebu! are a little low, but that's just about right. Jinsei and Rail Wars! are exactly where they belong, if not a hair too high. Then again, I make it a point to not rate anime until after 75% of the season is complete.

It's too bad that MAL is a terrible site for rankings because 90% of the user-base just rates everything remotely good (and some not) a 9/10 anyway.

He didn't say it was bad. He said it was bad for RANKINGS, which is correct. As a place to keep track of your watched anime I find it fantastic.

Well, the site is the aggregate of the people involved, and the community is not the brightest bunch out there with the way they rate things

Half of what I'm watching this season is missing.

* Sailor Moon Crystal: 7.33
* Yama no Susume S2: 7.10

The Yama no Susume one is harsh (the first season is below 7), but I blame MAL being full of tedious people who feel bad giving SoL shorts high ratings.

7.33 is really too good for Sailor Moon Crystal. What a disappointment.
>> ARTICLE
Yama no Susume is definitely my favorite cute-girls-doing-cute-things show this season. Much better than Hanayamata in all aspects. I gave the first season a clear 8, and this season just might surpass it.

But why are you so disappointed with Sailor Moon Crystal? Except for the release schedule, that is. Every other Saturday really messes me up sometimes.

Yama no susume deserves at least 8.10, not 7.10. Sadly, no one is watching it.

I'm confused as to how Rin won best female character over Chiyo, but then lost best female main character to Chiyo. They're both main characters. Obviously I'd have liked Rin to win both because she's my one true love, but I'd also prefer Chiyo win both to what we got. This isn't really a complaint with the structure of the poll or the votes really... but it is odd, which you said to mention.
>> ARTICLE
They posted like 20 threads. People probably paid attention less in one of those threads.

It depends on perspective, atleast for me.. example: I like Rin more as a character, she's more interesting and has a deeper story to her.

But being a main character has different criterias and I find Sakura to fill the main character role a lot better than Rin does.

That's my two cents on the matter atleast.

I like One Week Friends as much as the next guy, but how did it end up over Ping Pong or NGNL (I didn't even like this, but I figured it was a shoe in)?

Haha, god damn it
>> ARTICLE
Just a smaller sample in votes, NGNL won anime of the year in the bigger poll, so I don't think it would lose in its own season.
>> ARTICLE
> Haha, god damn it

I mean when you have Parasyte(not even sci-fi in my book but whatever) and SAO competing for sci-fi Mahouka(a great sci-fi LN series with good worldbuilding in my book) is amazing by comparison.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte is a much better show than Mahouka, and it is science fiction. That's enough reason for it to win right there. And like many said, Space Dandy as well. 

I'm surprised Kill la Kill didn't take the top spot in anything, and I don't even think silver spoon s2 was a nominee! A shame, as they are both in my top 5. 
>> ARTICLE
>Parasyte is sci-fi

It's more paranormal than sci-fi. There is no real "science" involved in the story so I don't think it really counts for sci-fi. I personally enjoyed Mahouka more than Parasyte(seeing how the former wore out its welcome around the half-way point) but that's just my own view on both shows.

>I'm surprised Kill la Kill didn't take the top spot in anything

I didn't expect it to take anything besides best girl/boobs. The animation is lacking in comparison to KyoAni and Ufotable and the story is overshadowed by much better shows this year. The comedy wasn't even that good compared to other shows like Barakamon and Gekkan Shojo. At least in my eyes.
>> ARTICLE
You think science fiction genre need involve some scientific content? Wonder what kind of science is involved in "drowned world" by J.G.Ballard or Delaney's "Dhalgren".... You don't get to define genres as you see fit, by ignoring works that already influenced and shaped its history.

It is utterly implausible with the contortions the parasyte body can pull, without even acknowledging this needing any explanation, but still it chooses to frame its story in rather tropish SF way of an alien invasion by superiorly capable biological organisms (even the manner of doing so is rather reminiscent of old SF classics like Heinlein's "puppet masters" - with slug-like creatures, arriving in flying saucers, attaching themselves to peoples backs, taking control of their victims nervous systems, and manipulating those people as puppets.  -  or ofc of "Body Snatchers"), as opposed to phantasmal incursion, demonic possession or any other explicit invocation of the unnatural.
>> ARTICLE
I bet next things we should add to the sci-fi genre are ghost, the ring, vampire, zombie and other unreal shit.


Because "You think science fiction genre need involve some scientific content?"
>> ARTICLE
You are utterly ridiculous if you believe sf can only mean hard sf or be anything at all and nothing in particular, despite the glaringly obvious fact that it has continued to be a well defined genre filled with as you put it "unreal shit" for as long as it has existed at all. Consider say Bradbury's works like the martian chronicles, pretty much any part of new wave of science fiction you care to name etc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, do tell me your criteria to qualify a work as "sci-fi".

And don't tell me that "those are fucking magic and shit. Only things that are recently brought up can be considered Sci-fi. Those shits have existed a long time already. Magic and science are not mixed well because Index said so."
>> ARTICLE
my criteria? why would I bother making up my criteria -- winners of Hugo and/or Nebula awards are "my" criteria. literature courses on science fiction are "my" criteria. For I've pretty much only named commonly accepted staples and staple writers of the genre. Like any genre its defined by institutions, reference body of literature, conventions, publishers, editors, magazines etc. 

Point is parasyte is simply far too derivative of certain acknowledged classics not to be in the same genre as them.

I can't even parse your second paragraph. 
>> ARTICLE
So, you just superficially compare them and say "yep, sci-fi"?

If you take away "alien invasion" setting? will it still be sci-fi?
Because this looks more like "Ushio and Tora" than a sci-fi work.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte being the better show is merely your opinion and other people might think otherwise (but yeah I agree that parasyte anime is better than the Mahouka anime). 

In terms of science fiction genre though Mahouka has a far greater detail, world building and interesting stuff than Parasyte. Parasyte just has Parasytes whilst Mahouka has technomagic, super advanced weapons, a 'society of the future' etc... the poll was best science fiction anime so I consider the win legit.
>> ARTICLE
Well it was also competing against Space Dandy and Knights of Sidonia.
>> ARTICLE
Granted KoS was a pretty good sci-fi show as well(I don't know why people count Space Dandy as sci-fi, I count it more as comedy, but what have you) but loses to Mahouka greatly in terms of detail, worldbuilding, and characters.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest I doubt the voting leaned towards Mahouka because of anything you just said, I'd bet more on the fact that its very popular, and gets a huge boost from the /r/OneTrueTatsuya crowd, but I dropped it very quickly so I won't press it.
>> ARTICLE
True, the popularity of it had a big deal to due with, and only a small minority liked the worldbuilding, but I think one of the main attractions of it *was* the world(and by extension the magic system and the OPness of Tats)
>> ARTICLE
> I don't know why people count Space Dandy as sci-fi, I count it more as comedy, but what have you

It certainly is more of a comedy, but there are definitely sci-fi elements in it. Also shows can be more than one genre.
>> ARTICLE
I think the implication was that it's "main" genre was sci-fi, just like how SAO's "main" genre is sci-fi when its a more adventure-style story.
>> ARTICLE
Tbh SAO's main genre isn't sci-fi but more like action, adventure, harem and romance

I wouldn't it say its harem/romance(although it *is* a major element of it) but more so adventure and action.

So little votes....probably because the voting system was confusing (it would be nice if a link in the first body took you directly to a poll/bracket rather than another thread that then links to a poll). I can't say this is a good representation of r/anime. Maybe try again another time in the format that u/Jordy56 does with his best Girl/Guy contests. I really liked that format, and I think most people here would agree.
>> ARTICLE
> Nagi no Asukara

> Isshuukan Friends

Well that's a surprise.

> Best animation

Big summer blow out!

> Unravel best OP

Nice.

> Best sports anime

Ping Pong is last. That's all I see.

I'm okay with almost everything else, but somehow I doubt Tatsuya > Killua.

Hey guys, I forgot to include this in the main post, but [here's a link to the previous Anime of the Year thread, so you can check out all the different options](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2w7znw/ranime_awards_2014_anime_of_the_year_repoll/). Thanks for all the support, especially to /u/DrJamesFox and /u/ChinesetotheBone. Thanks :) Like I said in the post, I'll be posting the final anime of the year results on Monday. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad to have helped. :)  

Seeing everyone's participation over the past few weeks has been very fun.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty good list, Shirobako was the best anime of autumn though
>> ARTICLE
nah it wasnt
>> ARTICLE
Aside from Kiseijuu, Shigatsu, Bahamut and Akatsuki no Yona of course.
>> ARTICLE
1.  NGNL beat Ping Pong.  Based /r/anime.

2.  I can't believe Onii-sama won best "sci-fi".
>> ARTICLE
To be fair it *does* have the best worldbuilding out of any of the top 3 nominated.

Onii-sama*

Lol yeah.  Man I was out of it this afternoon.

> Best female character of 2014

>> Rin Tohsaka

I admit, I had lost hope in /r/anime during these past few days (/u/Jordy56 pls), but you have been proven to have good taste.

[Good Job](#heart-thumbs-up "You proved your taste /r/anime") 

Also, to the saberfags; [](#nerrr "Y'all have shit taste")

No, no I still see shit taste here.

I'm sure there are *much* better characters from literaly anything.

Neither of them deserved to win

Yep, they're both shitty self fulfillment characters, they suck and I'm just some casual who likes crappy tsunderes.

Rin tohsaka isnt bad as tsunderes go

yeah, but he prefers shitty tsunderes

We all know Rin Tohsaka can't be better than Kirei.

As much as I liked Isshuukan Friends, I voted for Ping Pong in the best Spring Anime category...it being the only anime I've ever rated 10/10 while it was airing. 

Mahouka won best Sci-Fi? I guess the only real competition out of the final 5 was Parasyte, although I personally liked Sidonia better it didn't make the cut...I suppose the SciFi aspects of it were good enough. This, however:

>Best Male Character of 2014
>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 252 votes!

Someone please help me understand this. I don't get it at all. And with nearly 1/3 of the vote, no less.

Kind of surprised to see Zankyou no Terror win best Original Anime after it bombed (get it? bombed? hahahaha I'm so funny) in the last few episodes. Surprised it won thriller too, expected the Madoka movie to fare slightly better (not win, of course, but top 3). AND it won summer too, over Barakamon and Nozaki-kun? ...I may have underestimated how much /r/anime liked ZnT...oh well. 

Overall, was nice. And dont worry /u/UgotMAL, I am *perfectly fine* voting Ping Pong the best of 2014 three times. Even though its (probably) not going to win.
>> ARTICLE
/r/OneTrueTatsuya thats why
>> ARTICLE
There must have been a mistake... surely that was the vote for worst character?
>> ARTICLE
All this time I thought /r/OneTrueTatsuya was satire. I mean, I'm pretty sure it was originally. But to think that you... *people*... genuinely like Tatsuya just fills me with rage. People give Kirito shit all the time on this subreddit, but Tatsuya is way worse and yet he wins the best fucking male character of 2014? Are you fucking kidding me /r/anime? You people disgust me. 
>> ARTICLE
You should know that most of the anime audiences nowadays are very young. So it's hard for them to appreciate any "artistic" anime they watched or will see in the future.

It's just how the industry works. Almost everything now aims at young age and show like Ping Pong is hard to find a place among the kids.
>> ARTICLE
You speak the honest truth. I think the people downvoting you are probably just kids who are butthurt over that first comment.
>> ARTICLE
said the guys who commented because they are butt-hurt by the result.
>> ARTICLE
I believe it's called salt for us.

[](#suave)
>> ARTICLE
You are being dwonvoted but i have to agree.
>> ARTICLE
The Stu was just too strong with this one, /r/anime couldn't fight it.
>> ARTICLE
Tatsuya is not worse than Kirito. He's a different MC. Kind of an anti-hero but not really. He doesn't fight for 'justice,' he doesn't do the right thing all the time. People think he's OP as fuck(which is true), but he trained to get that way. Plus he's not all bitchy/emotional.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, honestly, in any other anime I wouldn't necessarily dislike Tatsuya that much. What made me dislike him so much in Mahouka, and ended up making me drop the show despite really liking the action scenes, is the fact that half the goddamn show is just people fucking worshiping Tatsuya. And other various ridiculous shit, like Tatsuya telling the paramedics how to do their goddamn jobs. He's a shitty chuunibyou-pandering character who's only supposed flaws aren't even actually flaws. 
>> ARTICLE
u know, with his powers he could know immediately what damage did someone take for faster treatment, but probably u didnt know this since u dropped the series
>> ARTICLE
We stand united in the question of "How the fuck did Shiba Tatsuya pull that victory off?" in that category.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong won nothing, not even sports?  I guess people just don't like good anime.
>> ARTICLE
Just look at all the votes. Almost nobody voted, it does not represent anything. (that voting system is a bit confusing, so no wonder).
>> ARTICLE
> Best anime of Winter 2014: NagiAsu

Hey, I agree with /r/anime about something!

> Best anime of Spring 2014: One Week Friends

Ping Pong was robbed!

> Best anime of Summer 2014: Terror in Resonance

I would have gone with Barakamon

> Best anime of Fall 2014: Parasyte

Your Lie in April is the best of the fall and probably the best of the year for me.

> Best OP: Tokyo Ghoul

I would have given this one to Your Lie in April as well.

> Best Sci-Fi: The Irregular at Magic High

/r/anime is just trolling me now. How that show won anything beside worst anime of the year is beyond me.
>> ARTICLE
I share your love for Shigatsu. I also liked the OP more than unravel
>> ARTICLE
There's a reason Mahouka is one of the top selling LNs you know.
>> ARTICLE
Of course. Chuunibyou population in Japan increased. :P
>> ARTICLE
Whoa whoa. The Mahouka LNs are good. The anime adaptation is poor at best.
>> ARTICLE
Transformers is also one of the highest selling movie franchises of all time, using sales metrics is a poor way to talk about quality, but from what I understand the LN is much better than the show anyways.
>> ARTICLE
I mean it *is* a very good series with amazing worldbuilding and attention to detail. But you're right, sales isn't the best way to say something is good. But in this case, it is good. And yes the anime butchered a lot of the worldbuilding descriptions as well as the plot of the Seven Schools Tournament as well as the Yokohama Arc.
>> ARTICLE
Mahouka is a really good example of Sci-fi done well, I'm not saying the show is good because it's not, but the Sci-fi aspects of the show are good.
>> ARTICLE
Calling Mahouka good science fiction is like saying Pupa was a good example of the horror genre. It's just not.
>> ARTICLE
It has a great world with an intriguing futuristic setting and sci-fi/fantasy elements. I believe it's a great example of a sci-fi.
>> ARTICLE
Time of Eve is a great example of science fiction. Shinsekai Yori is a great example of science fiction. Mahouka is a great example of schlock.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't see Time of Eve but Shinsekai Yori is an amazing entry in the sci-fi world, but it wasn't a choice here so have to improvise.
>> ARTICLE
You don't call incest horrific?

Your lie in April is actually so good. Good ops, good eds, good characters etc.

I'm pretty pissed that neither Shigatsu nor Nisekoi won anything... And I really think Zankyou no Terror was pretty miserable in comparison to other 2014 anime! Darn, these results are making me salty!

T_T Nothing from Amagi, not even best boobs.
>> ARTICLE
how did shirobako take second place for fall 2014, was expecting fate stay night or at least shigatsu wa kimi no uso.
>> ARTICLE
People like cute girls doing cute things. Jokes aside, it gives some pretty good insight in the anime industry. I wasn't surprised when I saw it in the top 3, although I think Shigatsu should've been second.
>> ARTICLE
Say what you will about Kill La Kill but it really deserved to win Best Soundtrack of 2014.

[**Not salty**] (#not-raining)
>> ARTICLE
Wow I'm surprised at how well Zankyou did. I'm just starting it now, but I've seen a lot of people saying it was decent but could have been better.

Yeah I agree. The middle episodes kinda make the show so much worse. It could have been a masterpiece but it just... Wasn't.

Fucking why

At least Gekkan Shojo and Barakamon got 1st and 2nd respectively. That was a though choice.

Damn right.

Inou battle and nisekoi are about the same in terms of quality
>> ARTICLE
>literally the same in terms of quality

>Nisekoi is animated and produced by SHAFT

>Inou Battle made by TRIGGER

Now that's bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
Just because a certain studio makes it doesnt mean it better then other anime.
>> ARTICLE
You said quality. The animation quality, background design, and overall clarity/prettiness of Nisekoi trumps Inou in almost every way. Say what you will about its plot, but *is* a pretty beautiful show that is well animated and designed to be visually appealing.
>> ARTICLE
I voted Inou battle for its uniqueness over Nisekoi's generic-ness.  Agree that they are about on par for core "harem-dom".
>> ARTICLE
Based Isshuukan Friends
>> ARTICLE
How come the winners of Winter 2014 and Spring 2014 aren't even a voting option for best of the year?
>> ARTICLE
Because they were knocked out I suppose, I suppose the people who voted Nagi no Asukara and Isshuukan Friends voted something else on that thread.
>> ARTICLE
Fck yes!!! Nagi no Asukara :))
>> ARTICLE
_One Week Friends._ won?  Sweet!

[](#yay)
>> ARTICLE
I've been looking for a good Romance to get into.  Looks like I'll have to check out this Nagi no Asukara after White Album 2
>> ARTICLE
Nagi no Asukara and One Week Friends were not what I would've called as the best of their respective seasons... They weren't *that* good. But to be fair to NnA Winter 2014 wasn't a very good season so it didn't have much competition.
>> ARTICLE
>Isshuukan Friends. (One Week Friends) - 72 votes!

Total shocker.

It feels good to see Nozaki-kun everywhere. s2when?
>> ARTICLE
Seeing Tokyo Ghoul so high up for best first and last episode is great, but also disappointing since the whole series could've easily been that quality... That said, they did a pretty good job of season 1 with the limited episode number they had.
>> ARTICLE
Nagi no asukara has romance? 
>> ARTICLE
NagiAsu wins twice, I am relieved, however SAOs ED3 came third place, weird...
>> ARTICLE
From this contest I learnt that /r/anime has pretty decent taste... in anything that is not music.
>> ARTICLE
Someone agrees :D
>> ARTICLE
Considering I didn't vote I can't complain, most of these are either acceptable or expected.
>> ARTICLE
Salty about Ping Pong not getting Spring AotS even though it's easily AotY.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Ping Pong deserves even a top three finish in Spring AotS but hey.. that's me.
>> ARTICLE
wow   i couldn't be less salty, pretty much everything i voted for came first or in the top 3, it feels strange being happy with a contest here
>> ARTICLE
I suppose the difference between best ed song and best ed is the first being only music and the other being animation included?

I still don't get how Zankyou no Terror won that one. Yes, it fit well in the soundtrack. But a lot of other stuff in the list was better animation wise and/or music wise. It's probably  something about most people having watched the show and only voting on it because they remember the great soundtrack and immediately think the ED should win because of that as well... 

Whatever, as long as I can think well enough for myself humanity can survive.. 
>> ARTICLE
glad that esdeath won 'best boobs'

Is it just me or does this make no sense haha I don't mean this in a salty way just that one anime beats another in one catagory only to have it switched around in another similar one

A *lot* of people do not differentiate between animation and art style.
>> ARTICLE
One Week Friends beat out Knights of Sidonia and Ping Pong for best of Spring. Just wow. And Mahouka winning best science fiction over Sidonia? Both One Week Friends and Mahouka are the epitome of mediocrity. That they won anything is laughable. 


>> ARTICLE
I don't get it either.  I am not a fan of Sidonia, but Mahouka definately was mediocre.  Every other episode it seemed was bad.  And the main character was such a gary sue, it was terrible.  
>> ARTICLE
Personally I find Mahouka to be mediocre, but out of what we had to pick from I believe it pulled of the Sci-Fi aspects the best out of the crop, that being the reason I voted for it.
>> ARTICLE
Mahouka did a pretty good job with the sci-fi. I've heard that it's a lot more obvious in the LN's, but it seemed pretty clear to me during my watch that the anime had an actual world built around it with hints of explanations ('magic' as a form of energy, wave patterns, sequences and the use of technology, etc.), but I watch for that stuff much more closely than most on here, so you probably just missed it.
>> ARTICLE
It's not just more obvious, there's entire pages dedicated to worldbuilding in the Mahouka LN. 
>> ARTICLE
Voting Rin over Saber /r/anime truly has worse taste than /a/. These polls have seriously made me an even saltier person than I already was.

Enjoy your shit taste by not loving best girl Sakura

Sakura is second best.

Please.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe in the original F/SN or F/0, but the new UBW anime, is very Rincentric, and she has been the best character in that show.

Rin > Saber anyday of the week. Though I only saw the original F/SN, F/SN UBW Anime, F/Z and Fate/kaleid liner so I might change my opinion should I play the VN or watch Heaven's Feel.

**Best anime of Winter 2014**

>Nagi no Asukara - 76 votes!

>Kill la Kill - 71 votes!

>Log Horizon - 64 votes!

I can live with this... not bad at all in fact.

**Best anime of Spring 2014**

>Isshuukan Friends. (One Week Friends) - 72 votes!

>No Game No Life - 70 votes!

>Ping Pong the Animation - 64 votes!

WOAH! That was unexpected, still I'd rather this than have Ping Pong win.

**Best anime of Summer 2014**

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 72 votes!

>Barakamon - 53 votes!

>Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun - 51 votes!

Kind of expected considering most people who voted for the well written laid-back series Nozaki-kun and Barakamon split their votes between the two, Zankyou no Terror was still a worthy winner IMO though.

**Best anime of Fall 2014**

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-) - 128 votes!

>Shirobako - 66 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 52 votes!

A near perfect result, I'm surprised that Shirobako made it that high though but glad it did.

**Best animation of 2014**

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 320 votes!

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 62 votes!

>ME!ME!ME! - 57 votes!

That overwhelming victory.. still my runner-up finished second so cheers for that.

**Best OP of 2014**

>Unravel (Tokyo Ghoul) - 117 votes!

>Hikaru Nara / If You Will Shine (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Osu / Your lie in April OP 1) - 79 votes!

>Trigger (Zankyou no Terror / Terror in Resonance) - 66 votes!

I find This Game to be the best OP when you include animation but if you wouldn't include it even though that is further down my favourites would be #1 #2 and #4 so I suppose /r/anime doesn't have quite that poor music taste after all.

**Best ED of 2014**

>Dareka Umiwo (Zankyou no Terror / Terror in Resonance) - 103 votes!

>aLIEz (Aldnoah.Zero) - 84 votes!

>Shirushi (Sword Art Online ED 3) - 63 votes!

Mind if I retract my last statement?

**Best Comedy of 2014**

>Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun) - 148 votes!

>Barakamon - 109 votes!

>No Game No Life - 64 votes!

Well voted, the two most deserving got spot 1 and 2.

**Best Slice-of-Life of 2014**

>Barakamon - 140 votes!
 
>Isshuukan Friends. (One Week Friends) - 99 votes!

>Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken (I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying) - 84 votes!

So far all my picks has placed first for these... let's just hope they remain in the top 3.

**Best Harem of 2014**

>Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace) - 130 votes!

>Nisekoi - 111 votes!

>Monogatari Series - Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari - 90 votes!

Hooh? Inou-Battle was that popular huh? well Nisekoi still made 2nd.

**Best Thriller of 2014**

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 152 votes!

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-) - 131 votes!

>Psycho-Pass 2 - 76 votes!

While I do believe that Kiseijuu is the best of the animes we got to pick from Zankyou no Terror definitely pulled of the Thriller aspect the best and hence is the worthy winner here.

**Best Romance of 2014**

>Nagi no Asukara - 125 votes!

>Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April) - 87 votes!

>Golden Time - 83 votes!

Clearly not enough people appreciate the purity of Golden Time and it's amazingness, you should be ashamed! well I suppose it's understandable since Nagi no Asukara is quite the anime as well. I do believe it's a stretch calling Your Lie in April a good romance anime thus far however, it's good drama but the romance in the series is very undeveloped thus far... has potential though.

**Best Sports of 2014**

>Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season (Kuroko's Basketball Season 2) - 141 votes!

>Free!: Eternal Summer - 120 votes!

>Haikyuu!! - 107 votes!

Kuroko won?... and Ping Pong finished last?... HAHHAHAHA SUCK ON THAT PING PONG FANBOYS!! WHERE'S YOUR GOD NOW?!! FUCK YEAH!! (no but for real though I find Kuroko amazing and I love it so, so much but I did not think for a second it'd win the category... this makes me kind of happy.)

**Best Science-Fiction of 2014**

>Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (The Irregular at Magic High School) - 203 votes!

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu / Parasyte -the maxim- - 150 votes!

>Sword Art Online II - 93 votes!

I did vote for Mahouka, it does the Sci-fi genre the best out of these series, albeit it's probably the worst anime out of the bunch IMO.

**Best Action/Shounen of 2014**

>Hunter x Hunter (2011) - 197 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV) - 137 votes!

>Kill la Kill - 75 votes!

This is a surprise... I did vote for HxH but I thought it'd be a close standoff with Bahamut... clearly not enough people appreciated that series.

**Best Male character of 2014**

>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 252 votes!

>Killua Zoldyck (Hunter x Hunter 2011) - 111 votes!

>Yato (Noragami) and Wenge Kong (Ping Pong the Animation) (tie) - 69 votes!

What? for fucking real? I mean I'm glad Inaho didn't win this crap but I can only give this one to the circlejerk on someone cheating the poll... how is Tatsuya the best Male character? he's not even close to the depth or development to the others, in fact the only one I find him better than is Tomoda and Inaho out of all the contestants... just how?

**Best Female character of 2014**

>Rin Tohsaka (Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works) - 118 votes!

>Chiyo Sakura (Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun / Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun) - 74 votes!

>Asuna Yuuki (Sword Art Online II) - 61 votes!

Meh, all the mainstream ones got the votes, though I suppose Sakura and Rin at the very least are worth the votes they recieved, you guys don't have enough love for Hatoko though.^TensaiBeatNibutani!^Woohoo!

**Best Character Development of 2014**

>Meruem (Hunter x Hunter 2011) - 154 votes!

>Seishuu Handa (Barakamon) - 67 votes!

>Shinichi Izumi (Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu / Parasyte -the maxim-) - 54 votes!

Wasn't aware people thought Meruem had such good character development, I mean it was good but I think Handa Seishuu (my vote), Izumi Shinichi and Kong Wenge all had greater development.

**Best Male Protagonist of 2014**

>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 141 votes!

>Killua Zoldyck (Hunter x Hunter 2011) - 105 votes!

>Araragi Koyomi (Monogatari Series - Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari) - 55 votes!

Come the fuck on guys... Araragi was barely even in Hanamonogatari and fucking Tatsuya again?... well atleast Handa finished 5th.

**Best Female Protagonist of 2014**

>Chiyo Sakura (Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun / Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun) - 100 votes!

>Rin Tohsaka (Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 85 votes!

>Shiro (No Game No Life) - 54 votes!

Hmm.. I think I might've voted Akane here for how great of an MC I find her to be but Sakura was my 2nd choice so not salty about it.

**Best boobs of 2014**

>Esdeath (Akame ga Kill!) - 103 votes!

>Hana-chan (ME!ME!ME!) - 96 votes!

>Jibril (No Game No Life) and Isuzu Sento (Amagi Brilliant Park) (tie) - 76 votes!

You guys lack Suou Amane in your life, go play the Grisaia VN you guys! though I suppose the choices were understandable albeit subpar to the great fluffyness of big sister Amane.

**Best abs/muscles of 2014**

>Rin Matsuoka (Free!: Eternal Summer) - 82 votes!

>Mikasa Ackerman (Shingeki no Kyojin OVA) - 63 votes!

>Blank vs. Jibril (No Game No Life) - 81 votes!

Hmm?... maybe it's time to catch back up on Naruto... still though a bit surprised Lancer vs Archer in the prologue of Fate/SN didn't make it to a top 3 finish, the first time we saw that breathtaking animation was incredible.

**Best Animation Studio of 2014**

>Madhouse - 130 votes!

Not surprised Madhouse won this one but damn was A-1 close! a bit surprised about the low amount of votes recieved by Shaft though.

**Best last Episode of 2014**

>Barakamon - 107 votes!

>Tokyo Ghoul - 69 votes!

>Ping Pong the Animation - 66 votes!

I don't know... despite how much I feel like Ping Pong is overrated and doesn't deserve half of the praise it's getting around here it should have won this one because that last ep was amazing, Tokyo Ghoul could've also won this with no complaints but I'm not sure I can agree to Barakamon.

**Best Artstyle of 2014**

>No Game No Life - 126 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 81 votes!

>Space Dandy - 52 votes!

Yeah, I really enjoyed the art of NGNL albeit I enjoyed the excellent use of switches between artstyles in Nisekoi even more, on a sidenote I'm glad Glasslip made it as far as it did, I nominated it in the wild card because I find the art in Glasslip to be it's only redeeming quality and it seems people agree with me.

>Durarara!!x2 - 138 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel (Movie) - 137 votes!

I don't know, there was no character in Akame ga Kill I found to be very good, Slaine on the other hand was well written and is interesting to watch, Meruem was also a very well made antagonist.

Thanks man! I'm going to be posting two more threads for these ones still, one for anime of the year and one for 'wrap up,' and suggestions on how to improve for next year. So keep watch out for those two.

>> ARTICLE
Thank you! I appreciate it!

I liked tatsuya shiba for best male charachter. For awhile now anime studios doing shonen have been spewing out super flawed main charachters so that it's easy to give them charachter development. And then they just keep beating you over the head with their flaws and foibles. You just correct some of the hyper-unrealistic idiosyncrasies, and suddenly charachter growth. It feels very pandering, and is really annoying to watch. 

Tatsuya Shibas charachter is a big fuck you to all that.
>> ARTICLE
But at the same time he's so bland... he literally has 0 development and everyone in the show is a device to show how OP he is without him actually doing very much...
>> ARTICLE
> everyone in the show is a device to show how OP he is without him actually doing very much

Thats just a side effect of him being op as fuck whilst not being flashy/ keeping things secretive. Also the anime adaptation being pretty mediocre and not explaining anything.

I too was getting pretty fed up with main characters who was clearly inferior to the antagonist but just 'barely' winning by power of friendship/ justice/ willpower right, training for x time or, my personal hate, plot armour (fuck you Kirito). Tatsuya being op as fuck from the beginning, who just completely shat all over the antagonists (amusingly to the level thats a lot like how the main antagonists in shonens shit all over the good guys when they first see him) was a nice change. 

If it makes you feel any better I can only see the Divine Tatsuya worship dropping off in the future. No season 2 (atleast as far as we can tell) and season 1 has enough hate I think to dissuade people from watching it (atleast on this subreddit). There will always be a core crowd (people who read the books cos they are good imo) who will continue the worship but you get that with almost any anime. 
>> ARTICLE
True enough, I think it's not just a side effect though, if you look at Sakamaki Izayoi from Mondaiji, he's the same kind of OP that Tatsuya is but he has way more personality and the side characters are also of relevance and has personalities in comparison to the people in Mahouka.

Well being salty won't change the result.
>> ARTICLE
Both points are seen that way due to poor adaptation imo.

> True enough, I think it's not just a side effect though, if you look at Sakamaki Izayoi from Mondaiji, he's the same kind of OP that Tatsuya is but he has way more personality

This is in more detail in the books but basically Tatsuya is incapable of feeling strong emotions except being over protective of his sister due to magic lobotomy. Hence why he seems so bland in the anime. He shows a lot of his personality by thinking (since he generally doesn't speak much because its not worth the effort) but this isn't shown in the anime. Tatsuya has no problems with being bored. 

> the side characters are also of relevance and has personalities in comparison to the people in Mahouka.

Side characters also has a lot of relevance in the books but the anime didnt show it. There were prob too much to animate and not enough time. They cut out an entire volume which focused almost entirely on side characters only. Lots of the scenes involving side characters were just cut out (along with the pretty detailed technomagic babble at magic works). 

Personally drowning in too much salt from /u/jordy56's polls to care about this one.

The routes are like Shirou maturing to adulthood.

First route is realizing his ideal. Second route is rebelling against reality to defend it. Third route is him accepting that his ideal is not realistic.

It is like child, teenager, then adult.
>> ARTICLE
If by Saber being ["different"](/spoiler), you're referring to how [she wasn't yet dead (in her own time) when she became a Servant, that 
comes up sometime in the first route when somebody (I think Rin?) comments on how it's anomalous that Saber has memories of the previous grail war. Whereupon Saber goes on one of her spiels about how she needs to save her country and she's a failure as a king and so she contracted with the Servant system etc etc.](/spoiler)

Also, a note about the adult scenes in the VN - though they are hilariously bad (dialogue-wise; Nasu can't write erotica for shit), the first one in the third route actually contains a small amount of exposition that is relevant to the plot, if I remember correctly - [a hint as to Rider's identity before it's revealed in that fight at the school when she removes her eye-shroud](/spoiler). I might be misremembering, though. 
>> ARTICLE
On your point about Saber: [**Fate Route Spoilers**] [Yes, I was referring to how she's still alive, frozen in time. I don't remember it being mentioned in F/Z so I left it just as being "different" on the post. That is also the reason why she can't go into "spiritual form" like the other servants. Anyway, this may not seem important at first, but when you know how heroes come to become servants you will then understand what will become of her by fulfilling her wish.](/spoiler)

About the first ero-scene on Heaven's Feels: [It was a wet dream with Rin as a heroine caused by the influence of Sakura... I think?. I didn't get the point of that scene at all but that Dream Rin had eyes similar to those of Rider.](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
I'd imagine that that peculiarity of Saber isn't of particular consequence in F/Z, since [that's the first time she's been summoned, as far as we know. She certainly makes no reference in F/SN to any summonings prior to the Fourth Grail War. The future that awaits her if she completes her contract is certainly an important point in both Fate and UBW, but obviously doesn't come into play in F/Z, seeing as how she's furious that Kiritsugu Command Spell'd her into destroying the Grail then.](/spoiler)

If I'm not mistaken, the standard interpretation of that scene in HF is that [Rider is absorbing magical energy from Shirou while he sleeps. *That* magical energy. Dolphins and magical dragons and all that.](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
Then I think it's best to delete that sentence, to avoid confusions. Thanks for the chat, see you around.
>> ARTICLE
Very informative for new people, good job. 

The mirror moon translation of the VN should also come with a flowchart guide. It is completely optional but can help you pick the correct dialogue choices. Good for speeding through to the true ends or completionists trying to get all of the bad ends/taiga dojo stamps.
>> ARTICLE
Ok so i just finished the Fate route i cried so much beautiful.  I haven't started on UBW but how does this take off?  Is this in Rins perspective and Emiya?  and how would it start off? (between a certain time frame in the fate route is what i am asking)
>> ARTICLE
Skip or play until the night of the 3rd day. Then you will be given a new choice that wasn't there before.

[UBW Day 3 Minor Spoiler](/s "You can prevent Saber from hurting Archer by using a Command Seal.") 

That triggers the UBW route, which is focused on Emiya and Rin.
>> ARTICLE
Great post!
>> ARTICLE
I haven't played through the VN, but I did watch the F/SN anime. I thought that the movie was enjoyable with the knowledge from just the anime series.


Spoilers on the routes for those who can't/don't want to play the VN can also be found at the [Type-Moon Wiki](http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/TYPE-MOON_Wiki).

Can someone explain to me what happened in the Last Episode of Reatea Nua? Is it a continuation of the Best ending in Fate?

It's an Epilogue to the True Ending of the "Fate" scenario (the 1st route). It starts with a neat summary with the best lines and fights of the route. Then: [**Fate Route Spoilers**][We are shown what would be a reunion in some kind of afterlife between Shirou and Saber. Fan service indeed.](/spoiler).
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, that clarified a lot. Also great to see another person that appreciates Fate/Stay Night.
>> ARTICLE
Heaven's feel is so superior to the other two routes that I feel kind of sad when the other two are the only ones getting anime adaptions. The MC is much more badass in Heaven's Feel aswell, and the story is so much deeper.

Well, they'd have to clean it up a lot so it would probably be shit anyway..


>> ARTICLE
All discussions should be spoiler safe on this subreddit. It's a policy of ours. Just thought I'd note that.
>> ARTICLE
It might be because I'm not really familiar with stuff, but I feel like playing through the first three or so days of FSN has spoiled more of FZ than the first season of FZ did of FSN. FSN's implications of how FZ's Holy Grail War ended seems like it'll be a bigger deal than the backgrounds of some characters (though I imagine Sakura's... situation will be much less powerful).

As DeForrest Kelly would say: "Dammit Jim, I'm an Engineer, not a Defense Attorney!"

Although I *did* do Mock Trial back in high school. Fun times, but I was always frustrated by the lack of evidence to use. The NYS Bar was never as thorough as I wanted them to be with the cases. I mean, the current high-school level case isn't even an actual trial, it's a criminal hearing. And apparently the person from the Bar who co-ordinates the Mock Trial tournament wasn't even aware of that until I brought it to her attention.
>> ARTICLE
Ho man, thanks for reminding me of my high school trial

Shit was tight on my end. I feel like the limited evidence kinda made things a bit more realistic and made you have to focus more on inferences. 
>> ARTICLE
The focus on inferences thing can kind of backfire if the cases aren't constructed well, though. I remember one case we won the trial decision on where my summation basically did Phoenix's thing of using implication from the evidence to put the blame on one of the other side's witnesses. We won by points too on that trial, which was nice.

Still, my favorite moments were the ones where a witness makes a small error that invalidates their entire testimony. I still remember the trial where one of the prosecution witnesses, for a case where the crime was set in Queens, testified that she witnessed everything happen in Brooklyn. The next words out of my mouth after she finished her statement were "No further questions, Your Honor."

Guess what I brought up in summation for that trial?
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, fucking witnesses. One of the witnesses for the other team was a very inattentive stoner (who probably came to trial high) and literally couldn't remember his own name. I hope we won that trial...

I remember in another mock trial I was the shop teacher witness and I straight up looked up how to work some of the machinery mentioned (even though it was barely relevant to the case) just in case. The prosecution tried to ask me how to work it just to throw me off and I threw it right back in their face. It was beautiful. 
>> ARTICLE
> One of the witnesses for the other team was a very inattentive stoner (who probably came to trial high) and literally couldn't remember his own name.

You think that's bad? My first year, our top attorney couldn't remember the names of *any* of the witnesses. And apparently he had been doing that for the whole time he'd been with the team. Still won rounds though since apart from that he was a damn good attorney. And seeing witnesses turn the tables back on cross examiners is always tons of fun.

Yeah I'm wondering what they will do too. She was perfect for the role too
>> ARTICLE
She sure was.

Likewise, I wonder how they will deal with the fact that Matsuki voiced Lailah in Tales of Zestiria, which is getting a anime next year.

She died too young, with no one to replace her. :(
>> ARTICLE
I may have to stop playing it in English now, even if Lailah is Rom from Neptunia, Mami from Madoka, and Satsuki from Kill la Kill.

She's definitely missed :(
>> ARTICLE
Oh, she's Rom in the English dub.  
Neptunia is one of the few games I like to hear in English.  
IMO, Neptune's English VA kicks ass, and might be better than the JP VA. Compa too.  
Iris Heart though, JP all the way!

I wish Matsuki had a protog to take over her roles like Lupin the third's first VA, Yamada Yasuo had.  
He stated that he wanted Kurita Kanichi to take over the role if he died, and Kurita did.  
Kurita really sounds like Yamada did, so Lupins voice didn't really change much, which is good.

To add to your list, you should try Ourai no Gahkthun, an amazing Steampunk VN.  
The writing and TL quality is amazing in that one.  
And if you liked Yumiko from from Grisiaia, then you might enjoy listening to Neon from Gahkthun, they share VA. 

Btw, do you use VNDB? It has a lot of info in VNs.  
Here's the page for [Gahkthun](https://vndb.org/v11033).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah VNDB has some pretty good info. Saved me a bit of grief regarding 18+ titles on Steam.

Yeah Yumiko's route was fun, its always nice to watch the ice queens melt. Amane and Sachi's routes were probably my favorites though. I've been taking it easy on VNs lately though.. bad endings are some of the most disturbing things I've ever experienced, I get shaken up just thinking about them

Have you started Saya yet?  
That one requires being "okay" with really fucked up things.  
I totally recommend it though.

Visual novel is fucking amazing, much better than Chaos; Head or horrible anime adaptation of C;H. I really hope they don't screw up this one. In my opinion ;C even better then Stains; Gate.

[Tenkyou no Alderamin ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31764/Nejimaki_Seirei_Senki:_Tenkyou_no_Alderamin) is also adaptation that I'm looking forward to, because it's one of my favorite light novel, and it's cool as fuck.

>> ARTICLE
Do you need to know about Chaos: Head to understand the Story of it? 

>> ARTICLE
No, with exception of some references here and there they are pretty stand alone.  And C;H anime is kinda bad, don't watch it.
>> ARTICLE
**"Fairy Tail Zero" will be a next arc of Fairy Tail (2014), starting Jan. 9, at episode 91 (or 266).** So this will actually be an "arc" in the 2014 anime? Not its own standalone thing? Do i have to catch up to the 2014 version now or what?
>> ARTICLE
I think zero can stand on its own pretty well. Just if you haven't seen any fairy tail at all (at least some of the first anime) you won't know why some of the characters are important.
>> ARTICLE
Zero will be about the first master of fairy tail. Watch at least some of fairy tail to get what it feels like
>> ARTICLE
How many episodes will it be? 
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it, it's a prequel manga so if you've seen a good portion of the anime, youre probably fine. The current arc ends right before the start of Zero, and I saw someone post saying it's the perfect spot to put the adaption in as a flashback arc.

Should mean that the anime will have plenty of manga chapters to work with too, by the time Zero is done
>> ARTICLE
After the last episode for the preview for the next episode they had zero instead of the main story so definitely part of the normal anime and not seperate.

>Koe no Katachi 

Bullying is a ultra rare theme in anime i think, even rarer they try to spin a positive story with it as the theme.  Even rare KyoAni is behind it. I don't know how to feel about it honestly. could be bad or good 

>Teekyuu 7 

TIL there exists an anime that has survived to the 7th season. Is Teekyuu the gunsmoke of anime? (In duration of the series at least, you get it)
>> ARTICLE
Well Teekyuu is like the definition of chaos and insanity complete with references to everything, and who doesn't like a weekly 2 minutes of chaos and insanity (still including references)?

It also has ridiculously low production costs, if I am correct it is all drawn by one person.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't know KyoAni was behind Koe no Katachi. Was already interested but hearing KyoAni just skyrocketed it. Seeing how well KyoAni have done the last few years, it's safe to say they'll do pretty well with the material. 
>> ARTICLE
the animation itself might be pretty good but the material might flop. 

I don't know if KyoAni doesn't like it they will just butcher it to be more appealing as they do with most series. 

Honestly its either gonna be great or its gonna be shit. I dont think there will be a middle ground
>> ARTICLE
the source material is my favorite manga. i'm very interested in seeing how kyoani will compress 64 chapters into a movie. 

i get the feeling that the movie *will* turn out well, but people who enjoyed the source material will inevitably complain. They will have to cut out a significant amount of content simply because of time constraints. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure the movie will do great, they can definitely cut some stuff from the manga if I recall correctly it was somewhat slow sometimes
>> ARTICLE
Berserk 2016 this is gonna be good
>> ARTICLE
The manga is also going on hiatus till summer 
>> ARTICLE
At this point for Berserk fans hiatus is just a part of life
>> ARTICLE
True, but we did just get a short run of monthly releases. I think we expected the next one to be infrequent releases rather than a straight up 6 month hiatus. Miura givith, Miura taketh.

>high profile


>a crowdfunded 1 episode OVA

yeah no
>> ARTICLE
It's high-profile only because of all the backers who have lost faith in the project after all the shady shenanigans that went on with the production companies and the ~~hostile~~ takeover of Kinema Citrus over it while kicking Creative Intelligence Arts to the curb.

I still remember that huge-ass post on this sub by someone allegedly close to Creative Intelligence Arts bitching out Jiro Ishii and fingering him as the source of all the problems with Under the Dog.
>> ARTICLE
It's a significant show because it was crowdfunded. A show with basically no prior knowledge or fanbase was crowdfunded by people in the West. [The director ](http://myanimelist.net/people/6518/Ando_Masahiro) is also pretty significant and has worked on a bunch of other high profile stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Since kizu already get a fixed date. I think nanoha movie 3 will be the new "kizumonogatari". since the initial release date is dec 2014, and we have nothing until now

I thought I read somewhere that Tokyo Ghoul season 3 was coming out sometime in 2016 as well?

Seen a few rumors as well, I hope it does get another season, I'd be surprised if it didn't tbh. 

Even if it doesn't I've still got the manga to read :P

That news is most likely false.

At least put Dies Irae on the list if you're including something like Rewrite which is destined to bomb.

Don't forget the possible 2017 Legend of the Galactic Heroes remake.

First time hearing about Koe No Katachi and it sounds interesting. Can't wait for Makoto Shinkai's new movie, even though 5 cm/sec pissed me the hell off. Probably the only time an ending made me want to through my phone at a wall.

>> ARTICLE
Sword Art Online Season 3 should be on here too, release date unconfirmed but likely 2016.
>> ARTICLE
That isn't necessarily true.  By this time of year before Season 2 they already had Extra Edition announced and ready and it aired at the end of December if I remember correctly.  SAO: Ex then had the S2 announcement on it which followed in July of the following year.  First Season was announced in October the year before the Summer airing date.

So if they follow the same trend and announce SAO S3 at the end of the upcoming movie, you might end up waiting another 6 months afterward at least to get Season 3.  So unless the movie comes out real soon, there is a very high probability that the show gets pushed to either the end of 2016 (Fall season) or ends up in the 2017 Winter Season.

I would guess Winter 2017 is when SAO Season 3 is going to land.

Macross Delta is only getting a special preview screening on December 31st; the air date for the show hasn't been finalized and will most likely be later this year, with the earliest possible schedule in Spring.

Anyone care to explain what's all the hype about Hero Acadamia? What makes it so special?
>> ARTICLE
It's good.

* MC is not the typical *"will and friendship always wins over logic"* shounen MC, but a more logical one that doesn't underestimate his opponents. But, at the same time, he is not a flawless character.

* The author goes against tropes, makes characters interesting and unlike other shounen manga, he is not afraid to make the story progress.

* Things you would think would happen in the distant future (40+ chapters), end happening way sooner.

* Morally ambiguous characters and an interesting world add more flavor to the story.
>> ARTICLE
Seems quite interesting, I'll wait for the adaptation then. Thanks!

You really like playing the melody in octaves, don't you? :P
>> ARTICLE
The entire song is almost in octaves, so I apologize for that lol.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I don't mind it too much. It got a little jarring at points, but because of the transitions not using octaves, it wasn't too bad.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, there, could you say an specific example of that? I mean, I understand what an octave is, but I can't hear those jarring moments. I'm a self-taught guitarist so if there's anything about music I can learn, I'll take it without hesitating. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe jarring isn't the best word. It's just that with a 16 minute piece, playing melodies the same way for pretty much all of it can make it all sound the same and therefore get boring. Octaves do work in this case, but maybe it would've been good to switch it up with playing in fourths or fifths, or just the notes by themselves without harmony.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I see. I thought you were talking about specific moments where it didn't really fit, rather than it being a bit too reptitive. I can definitely agree. 

OP could have been a bit more creative with how he arranged the songs, but I guess that requires even more efforts, and since he admits himself not being the most best piano player out there, I can definitely understand going for such an arrangement as well. 
>> ARTICLE
That sounded awesome, great work.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you :D!
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely amazing, did you actually memorise the whole thing?
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! For me, when I transcribe/arrange songs and notate them, as I go along, the song kind of gets memorized, so when I finish, I pretty much already know it. Working on this for like 100 hours is similar, just that this entire thing was 17 minutes long lol. But a simple answer would just be yes, I memorized the entire thing xD.
>> ARTICLE
(from someone who struggles at memorising music) That is still incredibly impressive! Great job, an inspiration to us all. 
>> ARTICLE
this is sooooo coooool!!!

[](#excitedyui)
>> ARTICLE
son of a....
>> ARTICLE
Thank you haha.
>> ARTICLE
This is really damn good. And very impressive if you managed to memorize the whole damn thing.

Did you write/transcribe the sheet music for every song?  
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. I memorized it xD.

Yes I did. I pretty much knew Tokyo Ghoul ED already from a friend of mine, but Charlotte OP's scales were inspired by another friend Daniel Nguyen (PaintAMelody). If you find his TV Size version of Bravely You, he does something similar. Other than that, I might have gotten inspirations elsewhere, but I'm not aware haha.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit Kyoukai no Rinne actually got some love. Really good job dude.

>> ARTICLE
Haha, in my description I said I wasn't as good as marasy xD.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that's really impressive. I tried making my own piano medley once, and the transitions were hard enough for like 7 or so songs, so with one with this many it's really awesome. Mad props to you; it's not the most technical piece but sounds great which is the important thing. Also, I totally understand the mistakes, don't worry about it. It's hard enough to play a minute long song without messing up already, so a 17 minute arrangement is bound to have some errors. 

Consider me a fan!

edit: Really awesome job on the left hand octaves for the Yamada and the 7 Witches OP. Impressive stuff, man!

Thank you very much, and I'm glad you liked it :D!

Nothing spoiler-worthy is present in Kaleid, yet. I'd go as far to say that it conveniently stopped just before it would be considerably spoiler-heavy. Archer's true identity is definitely not revealed. 
>> ARTICLE
Great. As this is the main UBW spoiler I was worried about this specific thing being revealed.
>> ARTICLE
Season 1 of Kaleid is spoiler-free, but I stopped season 2 of Prisma Illya for precisely that reason. It gets revealed early in season 2 that [Fate/Stay Night and Prisma Illya](/s "Illya is supposed to be the Grail's vessel"). I don't know if anything else gets spoiled past that, but I'm not taking my chances. I'm almost done the Stay Night VN anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Oh. Well that's not an issue if she's seen Fate Zero. Good to know for other friends who want to get into the series
>> ARTICLE
I agree with everything else in that there is little to almost none spoilers in Fate/Kaleid for any other Fate universes.  It's very loosely connected.
>> ARTICLE
Appreciate the help, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
This is almost as bad as people who got into Nasu through Carnival Phantasm. Oh well, as long as she plays the VN eventually, all is forgiven.

Eh, I'd agree that CP is the worst way to get into Fate, I will say that nothing so far has been mentioned in this show that she hasn't learned already through Fate Zero and Fate/Stay DEEN.

The links are for me to keep track of some random things I feel like I could easily mix up. Also, some of the ranks seem to have changed slightly, so OP's list and mine won't match up on some places.

Censorship probably have no effect, sample size definitely had an effect.

I think I'll leave it there. Still, it's an interesting bit of data-crunching...
>> ARTICLE
IRRC the Anikore rank is based on popularity and not score, so I'm not sure how much it'll be directly comparable.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it will at least be including the total score number. And those at least seem to be following the rank number so far...
>> ARTICLE
The Bangumi rank is also slightly based on popularity.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, okay.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam War in the Pocket:

> bangumi.tv: Rank 44

> MAL: Rank 764.

China > West. 

Also the fact that all the GitS being rated so much higher says quality tastes.

Yeah I can get behind this list a little more (one piece is higher :D) 
>> ARTICLE
> 86 WALL-E

wat
>> ARTICLE
It's an animated movie, and a damn good one at that
>> ARTICLE
Yet again, Gintama within the top 3.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is fucking huge in China (pun intended)
>> ARTICLE
Im actually surprised Hikaru no Go is there, no one talks about it
>> ARTICLE
This is the first ranking Ive seen which puts Steins;Gate and FMAB that low. 
>> ARTICLE
This list isn't filled with hyped up shows like MAL is, interesting.

EDIT: I noticed the smaller number of people who rated these anime, which may attribute to the difference between it and MAL
>> ARTICLE
Yes, OPM isn't in this freaking list

[](#helmetbro)
>> ARTICLE
\#1 is Cowboy Bebop, I'm impressed
>> ARTICLE
They seem to like Mecha and Sci-Fi/Space more. Interesting.
>> ARTICLE
What's kind of interesting is that compared against MAL, you'd need to skew these scores up by 0.15 to 0.25.  I'm curious about their overall average score, and the number of anime on their list.

Some changes are nice, like not having FMA:B as an absurd 9.25.  But then again, Gintama is still up there, so wamp wamp.

Why is that even there?

Honestly I agree. 

But someone added it. So I included it.

Because people nominated it and then voted it above other nominations. Fucking disgusting, but that's just how the cookie crumbles.

Kill la Kill  
Isshuukan Friends  
Barakamon/Nozaki-kun/Terror (in that order)  
Parasyte (with an honorable mention for Danna ga Nani)

The biggest tragedy of this event will be if Ping Pong loses Spring Anime of the Season to fucking No Game No Life.

It is a popularity contest, not gonna be very surprising that the more popular anime wins. And, personally, i like/liked ngnl more than Ping Pong. And seeing as Ngnl is currently winning, it is safe to say that many others agree.

***Wild Card***

If something was wrongfully shunned and *not* submitted, add it as a reply to the second level comments below, each saying a season! The comment I have responded to this with will be the judge. If your nominee for the wild card is in the top ***5*** replied below ***AND*** above my comment in points, then it's in. 

This one is a little different, make sure that your anime ***ended*** in the season you're submitting it in. For example, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders started in Spring but it's only valid for Summer, because that's when it ended. Similarly, anything that's still currently airing but aired last year as well belongs in the *Fall* category. An example of this above is Naruto: Shippuuden.

Winter - 1. Hajime No Ippo:Rising, 2.Magi The Kingdom of Magic 

Spring - 1. Ping Pong, 2.Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou

Summer - 1. Haikyuu, 2. Tokyo Ghoul (side note: I recommend not watching the new season "A:" and instead reading the manga)

Fall - ( Best three of the year IMO)1. Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade , 2. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, 3. Parasyte
>> ARTICLE
Just a note on your comment on Tokyo Ghoul, the root a anime is also written by the author of the manga, isn't it? I mean, I still heard the manga is much much better, but I also heard they're totally different stories. 
>> ARTICLE
They are indeed different stories, The anime is going to have an original ending. From what I have seen the show is lazily done with no desire for the same flow the first season had. Its choppy and lacks any real story that I can see, just my opinion however.
>> ARTICLE
Winter 14 - Nagi no Asukara  
Spring 14 - Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka  
Summer 14 - Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun

So ya, spoilers in your post you may want to mark

1 - That's brought up in Heaven's Feel.

2 - I don't really recall this one at all. Possibly just not so great continuity

3 - If I remember, the time frame wasn't an exact 60 years each time, just around 60 years. The 10 years between the 4th and 5th war was because of something that happened in the 3rd Holy Grail War.

4 - It's not the same spear.
>> ARTICLE
1 - Read the VN

2 - I didn't remember something like this

3 - [Because](/s "4th war didn't end properly.")

4 - Same colors =/= same weapons


Oh you watched the DEEN anime?
[](#kyon-facepalm)

Now I feel like I'm baited...
>> ARTICLE
About the weapon - Yeah since both of them had the exact same effect i thought they would be same but apparently i was wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Those are not plotholes. Some of the answers you're looking for are Heaven's Feel spoilers.

[Here's answer #1 as an example](/s "Sakura did study magic and is the Matou heir. She is Rider's true Master and is only loaning her Servant out to Shinji. And of course she's keeping this a secret from everyone else.")
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Yooooo spoiler tag that.

[HF](/s "She feels apologetic about taking Shinji's place as heir (in truth, she really feels pity for him) and her daily physical and emotional abuse for the past 12 years has left her resigned to her fate even if she could do something about it.")
>> ARTICLE
[So if...](/s "So if Sakura is Rider's master, and Shinji did not have a servant, does Rider's death put Sakura out of the war? If so, what's the deal with the return of Gilgamesh? Also, if Gilgamesh has returned, whose servant is he? Sakura's or Shinji's? I've only seen F/Z and the Ufotable F/SN, so I'm not sure if these are also Heaven's Feel spoilers as well")
>> ARTICLE
[More spoilers UBW/HF](/s "Shinji is being permitted to act as the Matou Master in the Grail War because Sakura does not want to fight. Gilgemesh is noone's Servant. He's only pretending to be Shinji's Servant for Kirei.")


>> ARTICLE
> 1 -

Are answered in the VN.

Also, Diarmuid wishes he could be one tenth as cool as that "random douche".

Diarmuid would have been told to behave by his mammy or that "random douche" would come in the night to kidnap him for being bold
>> ARTICLE
1. HF spoilers

2. 2006 version error

3. 4th War didn't end properly

4. Gae Bolg and Gae Dearg are two different red spears; they're both Irish Lancers.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if trolling, must be right?

At least I hope so. If you're genuinely not, then I will or someone else can explain if you want it.
>> ARTICLE
Trolling because i am asking questions? Not everyone reads source material you know.
>> ARTICLE
It's the obligatory "if you haven't read every VN in the series, you're not allowed to comment, you filthy casual."
>> ARTICLE
Or accepting that its 1/3 of a story and you may not realise everything yet.
>> ARTICLE
The reason it comes across as as trolling is because you phrase it as "Look at all of these plotholes I found" rather than "Are these issues addressed in the source material?" or something similar.

And yes, #1 is addressed in Heaven's Feel, #3 is because [F/SN and F/Z spoilers](/s "the 4th Grail War didn't end properly.") For #2, I don't know about the anime, but in the VN [more spoilers](/s "we know from the very beginning that Rin's dad died in the last Grail War.")   
>> ARTICLE
I left my question at the very end of the post, and yes that is exactly what i thought them to be - plotholes - because they made absolutely 0 sense to me, a person who has seen FZ and FSN
>> ARTICLE
As much as I want to give my best of 2014 vote to Ping Pong, since Hunter x Hunter this year included Episodes 111-148 I have to give it my vote. Episodes 116, 126, 131, 135, and 148 are some of the best episodes of anime I've ever seen and Hunter x Hunter just blew me away. 
>> ARTICLE
**Best animation of 2014 : Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works**

Nothing surprising really. ufotable just does a great job at animating action scenes. The choreography of the fights are amazing as well.

**Best anime of Winter 2014 : Nagi no Asukara**

Beautiful visuals, amazing soundtrack and strong cast of characters along with good world building and great character development.

**Best anime of Spring 2014 : Ping Pong The Animation**

Didn't really expect this to be amazing. The art feels odd until you get used to it and the premise wasn't exactly interesting either. However, the character development was just perfect. The soundtrack is great and the matches were hype as fuck. It concluded very nicely as well.

**Best anime of Summer 2014 : Barakamon**

Very relaxing anime. The OP and ED kicks ass. The kids were adorable and Handa's development was great to see. It was funny at times too.

**Best anime of Fall 2014 : Parasyte -the maxim- (EP 1-12)**

I loved how it explained things logically and didn't feel "forced". The way it showed how Parasytes were trying to learn from humans is great too. It displayed Shinichi's growth very well and the emotional scenes actually had an impact on me.

**Animation:** Zankyou no Terror

**Winter:** Samurai Flamenco

**Spring:** Ping Pong the Animation

**Summer:** Zankyou no Terror

**Fall:** Kiseijuu

**Best of 2014:** Ping Pong the Animation
>> ARTICLE
**Best Animation: Fate/Stay Night UBW** (I think this ones undisputable, Fate/SN introduced animation quality that we've never seen before, it was just breathtaking watching the actions scenes.)

**Best of Winter: Nisekoi** (I find Nisekoi to have top-notch comedy and very interesting characters and as such warrants a very high grade, I had a lot of fun with Nisekoi and it had brilliant use of separate art-styles.)

**Best of Spring: No Game No Life** (People may say what they want but it's as hyped as it is for a reason, NGNL had very interesting plot-twists and an element of cool that none other did during it's airtime, it had a fantastic colour palette and the story went in very unpredictable ways several times during it's air-time, shout out to Mushishi for being a close second.)

**Best of Summer: Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** (I believe that aside from Tokyo Ghoul all of these nominees were brilliant but amongst them Nozaki-kun stands out, it had a unique twist of the shoujo genre and great comedy, coming out as a show with no expectations it truly turned out wonderfully.)

**Best of Fall: Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** (Parasyte is my personal AOTY, it has a great main character and a very interesting plot, I do wanna mention that it's premature judgement as the series is still going though. Also twintails wtf?)

**Best of 2014: Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** (As before mentioned this is my AOTY, I do believe I'll call Bahamut or Nisekoi my runner-up of the year though.)
>> ARTICLE
> Also twintails wtf?)

It was the only thing nominated for the wild card. So it made it through.

NagiAsu didnt go through best anime of the year. This must be bugged :(

Methinks there may have been some tampering with the results of the best of 2014.  Even if Hunter x Hunter was the standout winner, I'm very sceptical that it could receive over 32 times the number of votes that #2 gets.

Oh my god. That's not cool. I'll have to redo the poll.

I fear that there's not much you can do there. [The Hunter x Hunter subreddit has a thread that asks everybody in there to vote for HxH](http://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/2vzpku/you_guys_did_it_once_now_to_push_hunter_x_hunter/), and now that they're aware of this poll going on, I'm pretty certain that the results wouldn't change even with a repoll. Which is sad, because it should be about the best anime, not the most popular one.
>> ARTICLE
Still the best anime.
>> ARTICLE
While I agree with you, that's still for the voters to decide, not a single person.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I think I'll redo it once anyways though. Hopefully that one will be slightly more popular and everything else will at least have a fighting chance. 
>> ARTICLE
**Best animation of 2014**: Fate/Stay Night UBW Hands down, ufotable makes some beautiful scenes.

**Best of Winter 2014**: Space Dandy, honestly it came down to a comedy match between this and Kill la Kill. And Space Dandy had me laughing a lot more than Kill la Kill, though I may've enjoyed Kill la Kill more if the dub was out when I watched it. Everything else in that season I wasnt into.

**Best of Spring 2014**: Ping Pong the Animation, again I wasnt interested in any of the picks in that season except for mushishi and Ping Pong. I gave NGNL 3 episodes but honestly didnt like it too much.

**Best of Fall 2014**:This one was a tough one, I loved Parasyte, and I loved Fate/Stay Night. They both did what they did pretty well, but in the end I have to give it to Fate/Stay Night just based on enjoyment and I may be a little bias because i'm a type moon fan. 

**Best of 2014**: Ping Pong, I couldnt give it to anything else. The animation and art may not have been my favorite, but the characters were amazing and the story it was telling hooked me from the beginning when we see Kong. The soundtrack was also really great, and had no real issues from what I remember.

>best animation of 2014

>no Ping Pong

>No Game No Neutral Colors

Wow. I'm actually impressed by how badly you guys managed to fuck this up. 
>> ARTICLE
<puts NyaaFlame down for ME!ME!ME!>

Jokes aside, what do you think should've been on there instead?
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong, SAO II, Haikyuu, ME!^3, Madoka, and Nisekoi.

ME!^3 should win, hands down. I get it's a short but that animation is fucking god-tier, and we're not looking at how much money someone could throw into it or how much time it took, we're looking at animation quality.
>> ARTICLE
>I get it's a short but that animation is fucking god-tier

Absolutely. Got my vote at the very least.

(for some reason I thought Ping Pong *was* on there. :/)

Surprised by the SAO II and Nisekoi picks - not because I disagree but rather because I didn't expect them. Good choices.
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong, I fucking hate both the shows, but I'm not going to discount the fact that they're both very well animated.
>> ARTICLE
> Don't get me wrong, I fucking hate both the shows

Understandable though, and good on you for not seeing them as completely without worth like a lot of people seem to.

Sidenote: Monster Musume anime adaptation when?

^^^not ^^^soon ^^^enough
>> ARTICLE
I remember a couple months back crabman made a tweet asking followers what character they liked best and what scene they would want to make sure didn't get cut from an anime, and then he fucking left us hanging.
>> ARTICLE
[Here's an article on it.](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/09/15-1/monster-musume-polls-fans-about-anime-adaptation)

I hope them leaving us hanging doesn't mean that they decided against doing it. Miia best girl and she deserves to be animated. Hell, I'd be happy with just the first scene, with them in bed and her crushing him.
>> ARTICLE
>No Game No Plot

Uh, plot has literally NOTHING to do with animation. 

I am disappointed in the lack of Ping Pong in animation, but those three are actually my other top picks. The 4 you mentioned are my top 4.

Edit: before he had 'No Game No Neutral Colors' he had 'No Game No Plot.' 
>> ARTICLE
Ping pong's animation is awful, pleeeeaaase. #grrrr

In terms of animation, Rebellion or Unlimited Budget Works, no contest, with Zankyou trailing not too far behind. Both insanely high production values and it shows.
>> ARTICLE
In terms of animation ME!^3 wins, no contest. It has the advantage of being short, so it's got incredibly high quality animation to the point where none of the other shows in the competition could possibly hope to beat it.
>> ARTICLE
Me!Me!Me! has advantage of being a short, but Rebellion has advantage of being a very high budget film, the animation sequences especially between a certain fight beats that of ME!ME!ME! by a large margin.
>> ARTICLE
Rebellion might have sequence of high quality, but ME!^3 is 100% high quality. The entire thing is excellently animated and the margin even for that one sequence isn't that large.
>> ARTICLE
What i'm saying is, rebellion had consistently fantastic quality animation, like ME!ME!ME! however it had moments and scenes that clearly surpass that of ME!ME!ME! too.
>> ARTICLE
> no Ping Pong

Let's be real here. Animation isn't where Ping Pong shines. Art =/= animation.
>> ARTICLE
I thought people hated the art for Ping Pong, but that the animation was great? 

I personally thought both were good,  so I don't care either way. 
>> ARTICLE
I think everyone expected 2011 to win when the tournament started. That year was just so stacked with amazing titles. It was definitely my favorite year ever though 3 or 4 of my favorites didn't even make the team.

Thanks for voting every day. This tournament was much more well received than my previous Favorite Anime Movie Tournament. I'll probably think up a new tournament to be held some time during 2015.

Oh, don't forget to vote in the bonus match near the bottom of the original post! Can 2011 defeat every year simultaneously? >_>
>> ARTICLE
All I know is that 2007 is the best and no retarded mass popularity contest is going to change that.
>> ARTICLE
What from 2007 makes you say that? Gurren Lagann and Darker than Black are the only ones that really spring to mind.
>> ARTICLE
If you look at the running shows as well 2007 easily tops everything in quantity and quality. The titles are too many to list for now.
>> ARTICLE
...Are they too many to list? I am looking at them, what should be really standing out as hands down best year material?
>> ARTICLE
Their number and average scores easily tops everything else. Do I need to list them?
>> ARTICLE
If you can't even name them then don't comment.
>> ARTICLE
It's not hard to find them
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised you'd say that. What was so great about 2007? Out of the ones listed here none of them are among my favourites, even Clannad. Darker than black was fun but I thought it managed its plotpoints in a lousy manner(ending was really confusing).

Lucky star I just didn't like since it really has nothing happening in it. Gurren Laggen was fun but I actually had even more fun with Kill la Kill. 
>> ARTICLE
It has lots of less known shows most refuse to check out because they are older than 2 years

Go ahead and list them then or just a handful if there is too much.

Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica VS Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

**Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica VS Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.**

**WHY DO YOU DO THIS?**
>> ARTICLE
Madoka vs TTGL  
You monster....
>> ARTICLE
TTGL wins that hands down. Overall it's a more solid show and relies way less on shock value to carry it through.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, TTGL has a lot stronger characterization overall where the MC actually plays a role in the story before the last 2 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
to be fair though, you are comparing a 12 episode show to a 25 episode one. Gurrenn's characters are naturally more fleshed because they had more time available to develop them
>> ARTICLE
That's completely true. Honestly, they needed about 4 more episodes to develop their characters. 12 episodes just wasn't enough. TTGL and Madoka are similar in the sense that the MC's are useless until like 10 episodes in but TTGL actually has 15 more episodes to do more stuff.
>> ARTICLE
I expected 2011 to win purely because Steins;Gate always wins every tournament in this subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it won best ED.
>> ARTICLE
Which shocked the hell out of a lot of people, actually. In fact it got kicked out early.
>> ARTICLE
Its OP is so much better than the ED. And Warreta Ringo is amazing... That skip beat.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it shocked as many people as you think.  Everyone in the tournament comments thought the ED was shitty.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate does have a pretty boring ED. 

I didn't agree with the results of that contest at all though. I thought all the fun EDs got voted out way too early. 
>> ARTICLE
They did, and a bunch of good ones didn't even make it in.  HxH shouldered 4 of it's ED's in because the show had just ended.  It was such a disappointment that I don't even remember who won.
>> ARTICLE
Every time that's brought up. There ended up being three HxH EDs in the tournament, not four, the Guilty Crown ED got entered instead. I'm pretty sure the ED that would have replaced the extra HxH ED was the High School DxD ED, so you can fix the results with that ED in mind if you want.
>> ARTICLE
I totally forgot about that.  Anyway, I really do appreciate you running that tournament, but man was that nomination round poorly planned.
>> ARTICLE
Except a lot of people, including me, actually think HxH has some great ED's. Also, now the anti-circlejerk to S;G's ED has grown to the point that it is an exaggerated circlejerk. Lackluster, maybe, but shitty? Why? Boring visuals, obviously, but musically the song is really nice and quite fitting. Love her voice too. 
>> ARTICLE
I think most of you who liked the HxH ED's were letting the emotional attachments to the anime sway your judgement.  To someone like me who hasn't ever seen an episode of HxH it all sounded like generic shounen ED's.  If, as you say, a lot of people had liked HxH's EDs then they shouldn't have all lost in the first round or two.  There were so many more deserving ED's that didn't get nominations in time.

I wouldn't say it's exaggerated at all.  Not only are the visuals boring, but the song isn't unique either.  Not only that, but when something that standard is sitting next to Nujabes' Shiki no Uta or The Seatbelts' Real Folk Blues it's gonna look *really* bad.
>> ARTICLE
Most of that is subjective. I'm also a huge fan of HunterxHunter endings to the point that I watch them in full.
>> ARTICLE
I found the contest half way through and realized the [best ED ](http://vimeo.com/47352495) wasn't even a contender. 

And while Steins;Gate is probably my favorite anime, does not have the best OP or ED.
>> ARTICLE
There's a difference between fun and good though.
>> ARTICLE
Fun is subjective to the person that is voting though. Some of the 'fun' EDs might not have resonated as well with some people as the more traditional, serious EDs would have.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is, I don't really like s;g that much, but I think the ED's close to amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Sure you're not thinking of the OP?
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Don't care for the OP, but thought the ED was pretty damn great.
>> ARTICLE
What on Earth do you like about it?
>> ARTICLE
The visuals are pretty swell and the actual song itself has this feeling of indescribable scale. Like the whole universe is in danger. Honestly the ED was what hyped me up more than anything, because it gave me this feeling that the show was eventually going to get into things on such a grand scale that I couldn't even comprehend it yet.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe. But the general consensus around here is Steins;Gate wins EVERYTHING.

Damned if I know why. It's really good, but not THAT good.
>> ARTICLE
It's easily accessible to viewers (as in a lot of people can get into it).  That's literally the only reason every says it's so great.  Because so many people have seen it.
>> ARTICLE
nope, its just because its a flawless masterpiece
>> ARTICLE
>flawless

Yes, because shallow characters is definitely not a flaw.
>> ARTICLE
shallow? they are one of the most unique cast in the history of anime lmao. maybe in the eyes of an idiot who thinks steinsgate wins everything because many people have seen it when there are dozens of animes which way more people have seen. i dont think you can be that stupid though so i assume youre just butthurt that your favorite anime doesnt win jack shit :) hehe
>> ARTICLE
The reason it does well is because:

1. It is entry level (a lot of people have seen it)
2. It is strong enough critically to really appeal to the critical crowd
3. It is entertaining/generally enjoyable enough to appeal to the casual crowd

The same goes for FMA: Brotherhood, which is why it also does well. FMA is just more story focused while Steins; Gate is more character focused, which tends to do better around here. If there is an aspect that people don't like as much about it, that aspect won't do well in tournaments (aka the ED).
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is imo far from entry level. The first episodes are way too much for a lot of people to get through. After watching some stuff most people pick it up again and get through it perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still sad that Mawaru Penguindrum didn't make it to the 2011 lineup...
>> ARTICLE
true. I think nothing can top 2011 line up.  It was really a great year for anime.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, even if I can't reasonably expect it to penetrate the top shows of 2011 I think it's still significantly better/more deserving than the bottom 3 that made it.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, that show was in my top 10 for a while. It definitely deserved it.
>> ARTICLE
Wins/Losses for 2011

1. Steins;Gate - 3:0
2. Fate/Zero - 3:0
3. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica - 3:0
4. Hunter X Hunter - 2:1
5. AnoHana - 3:0
6. Mirai Nikki - 1:2
7. Nichijou - 1:2

4 undefeated titles, and every single title got at least one win.

2006:

1. Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion S1 - 1:2 
2. Death Note - 1:2
3. Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya S1 - 0:3
4. Welcome to the NHK - 1:2
5. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time - 2:1
6. Black Lagoon - 3:0
7. Gintama - 3:0

2006 was propelled forward by the power of their lower seeds. Their third seed didn't even manage one win for them.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that haruhi didn't win any of them is pretty Fucked up
>> ARTICLE
Pls don't tell Haruhi that.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe she will make a world where she got first. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow that is very sad. Haruhi S1 was pretty revolutionary for it's genre, IMO. 
>> ARTICLE
But it still makes sense, you either hate the show or love it.
>> ARTICLE
Plus it generally had really tough match-ups.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised Fate/Zero beat out Death Note  

Death Note had an enormous impact on me, but I suppose all the recent UBW hype has been trickling down to FZ
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how many people this applies to, but I had read Deathnote a while before the anime came out. When the anime adaptation came around I watched the first episode. It was word for word from the manga (not really a bad thing most of the time) but it was so boring to watch as I already knew what would happen so the thrill just wasn't there. 
>> ARTICLE
Hype or not, Death Note is still one of the most popular anime ever, and F/Z doesn't even come close in that aspect. I do think it deserved the win, simply because it was overall better, and it became one of my favorites of all time. You shouldn't instantly reduce all its merits to "hype".
>> ARTICLE
Most anime is terrible, people are easily won over by even mediocre quality. 

I think maybe because a lot of people struggle looking for adult content in what they think is a mature medium, when in reality the vast majority of anime is aimed at teenagers.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, if anything I'd pretty easily give the popularity advantage to Death Note considering just how ridiculously many people have seen it (it's by FAR the most watched show on MAL, for example).
>> ARTICLE
A few things worth considering. The people who watched death note years ago when it was popular may no longer watch anime and or may have never come to reddit.

The people who watched a lot of anime in the early 2000's are probably in their 30's now. Many may have moved on. With any population its natural that some move on, and new ones come to replace them.

So the new people, who havent seen anything bate fate, madoka and sao out number most likely, the few remaining people who liked death note heh.

I find the same thing when I think of eureka seven being so unpopular here. It was 8 years ago, but it was a favorite of mine when I saw it at first.
>> ARTICLE
I think most newcomers waiting UBW's end to watch Zero
>> ARTICLE
So, S;G, F/Z, and Madoka carried the team.  2007/2008 are two of the best years in anime we've had in a long time.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x hunter and nichijou? I'd say the whole year was filled with fantastic titles
>> ARTICLE
2004 is still the best year, in my view at least.

Gits SAC 2nd GIG, Monster, Gankutsuou, Samurai Champloo ect...
>> ARTICLE
whats really interesting looking at older anime is how good some of it looked, compared to how bad some stuff looks now.

Similarly shows in 2004 could either look like champloo, or star blazers from the 70's (no joke i thought noir was from the early 90's at least, and it was from 2001)
>> ARTICLE
Congrats to 2011! And thank you /u/PixelPenguins for this interesting tournament.
>> ARTICLE
Man, these competitions are sure bringing out the "ugh, Steins;Gate is *so* overrated" and "ugh, fucking casuals not watching anything before 2010" sides to a lot of people. The amount of salt here leaves a pretty bad taste in the mouth.
>> ARTICLE
Its like they don't realize that this competition is designed in such a way that a single anime cannot carry a year to victory. Maybe for other contests its somewhat justified, but for this it makes literally no sense.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what your talking about because I've seen none of those comments in this section so far.
>> ARTICLE
Well is there a problem or not? If plenty of people are saying it and plenty say what you said, then from a new guy's perspective I can't really tell. Look at the discussion threads, SAO, mahouka, and other low ball shows have twice as many comments and upvotes as anything else. The hardly anyone watches anything before 2010 deal seems at least partially true, considering how anime is moving into the "mainstream" of nerd culture. 
>> ARTICLE
(the fact that people consider anything pre-2010 to be older stuff boggles my mind - particularly when beginners' requests for recommendations result in mostly mid-2000s stuff and some of the pre-2000s classics)

People should absolutely watch more older stuff, but using that to have a massive whinge about how people who haven't seen as many pre-2010 shows ruin tournaments like this misses the point.

My main problem is with the assumptions people who are complaining are making. The "I haven't seen either" option is partially designed to counteract against forms of mass recency bias, which means that complaints against the more recent years assume that people who have seen more stuff from recent years are *disproportionately dishonest* (compared to people who have seen more from earlier years) when it comes to that option.

Plus if complaints about the popularity of more recent shows were accurate, you'd expect to see a set of placings that maps (with some leeway) from the most recent years as the most popular to the oldest years as the least popular. There is absolutely no hint at any trend like that (looking at both the seeds and the placings).
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. I honestly don't know how to feel about this. I have only seen a smaller selection of the shows, and usually I had shows that I liked on both sides. I think that because of the fact that I do not yet have an animelist in the hundreds I kind of ended up being more indifferent to this contest than I have previous ones on this sub. It was a cool and unique idea though, and I think it would have been really fun had I watched more of the shows.

Wow, Steins;Gate leads the way. Didn't see that coming.

I find it highly suspect that the "years chosen" since 2001 all ended up being exactly the last 7 years. Pretty much tells you that they were chosen not because they had the best shows, but just because most got into anime recently.

Or "animation bias" in that HD production started becoming prevalent around 2007, so they heavily weight towards that to the detriment of story/direction/etc.
>> ARTICLE
Too bad that nobody in this sub has seen anything released before 2010 which robbed the obvious winner (2007) of the easiest landslide victory ever...

I can't believe HxH beat Welcome to the NHK. Sure hxh is a good show, and much better than other shonens(besides OP) but to me personally, I have a hard time seeing how it is better. More popular maybe
>> ARTICLE
They're both in my top 5, but nothing tops HxH for me. Hard to compare such different shows though. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, while I think both are fantastic, I'd give Hunter x Hunter the edge critically. It's just generally more polished and the themes present (particularly during Chimera Ant, not as much the rest) are just as meaningful as those in NHK.
>> ARTICLE
HunterxHunter is not simply better than other shonens, I actually consider a lot of its writing to be toptier. That is especially the case in the later arcs. 
>> ARTICLE
>More popular maybe

Well this is a popularity contest, so yeah.
>> ARTICLE
People ignored titles like Suzumiya haruhi, Clannad, K On, Toradora, Angel Beats, Ano Hana... Come on i know Steins;Gate is awesome, but there are lots of equally awesome animes out there!
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you mate but it's not as if it matters. Nobody will remember this competition in a week.
>> ARTICLE
Sure they will.  They'll cite it the next time S;G gets close to winning something or when someone brings up that most users haven't watched many older shows.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't agree with the anime picked for 2007. How can you leave Dennou Coil and Ef off that team?! When They Cry would have been a nice edition as well. I'd definitely kick off Clannad. The only reason it's up there is because of its sequel. I'd probably kick off 5cm and Neon Genesis as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. 5 cm, Clannad, and LUCKY FUCKING STAR shouldn't have even sniffed the asscrack of the top spots for that year. Mononoke, Higurashi, and Bakurano didn't get on there? Pathetic.
>> ARTICLE
Mononoke is a well made anime, but it's not exactly the most entertaining show. I definitely wouldn't add it to my list of top 7. Haven't seen Bakurano.

The team I would have made: 

1. Ef: A Tale of Memories 
2. Dennou Coil 
3. Baccano! 
4. Claymore 
5. Summer Day's with Coo 
6. When They Cry 2 
7. Seirei no Moribito

This team would still lose to the team I'd make up for 2011 though. And it's not like I've seen that many more shows in 2011. I've only seen 8 more for 2011 than 2007.
>> ARTICLE
Claymore makes your list, but Code Geass R1, Gurren Lagaan, Mononoke (which I guess you don't like, but still), Darker than Black, Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei, and more don't?

I mean it should literally be no contest.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann's just not my type of show. I liked Mononoke, just not enough to put it on the list. It's a little bit boring in parts. Code Geass isn't even the right year. I'll get around to Darker Than Black eventually, but I probably won't watch Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei since I usually avoid comedies.

Edit: I put Code Geass in the 2006 list if it makes you feel better.

1. Simoun 
2. Code Geass S1 
3. Flag 
4. When They Cry 
5. Black Lagoon: Second Barrage 
6. Paprika  
7. Freedom

>> ARTICLE
Mine would've been:

1. Seirei no Moribito
2. Lovely Complex
3. Baccano!
4. Nodame Cantabile
5. Darker Than Black
6. Saiunkoku Monogatari S2
7. Genshiken 2

But it also would've lost to my 2011 team. And I've actually seen like 15 more shows from 2007 than 2011.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen none from that list of yours though Ef and Baccano! are in my PTW.  Actually after looking up the others Seirei is in there, too.
>> ARTICLE
Dennou Coil is also pretty damn amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I added that, Higurashi, and Coo.  Honestly, though, there's so many shows I "should" watch I'll never get to them all.
>> ARTICLE
How can you think that you're the only one who watched anime before 2010?
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I've seen many of both the 2007 shows that were picked and those that weren't and I really just don't think the shows are anything great. 2011 has several of the best shows I've ever seen on the other hand. Honestly I'd say 2007 was pretty easily one of the weakest years of the tournament for me (whether the teams were switched or not).
>> ARTICLE
2007? No one seen it? Most of the shows on that list are popular and frequently discussed.

Now if you were back further to 2001 or something, I'd agree with you.
>> ARTICLE
The last 8 years have been wonderful! I'm really excited to see what future anime brings.

Also enjoying these voting contests... I would be curious to see other ones, like favorite Studio Ghibli film.
>> ARTICLE
2008 is the best btw
>> ARTICLE
2010 in fourth place makes me sad. 
>> ARTICLE
I would like some older years represented if there was another one these. 

I would love to see more people discussing shows like trigun, berserk, kenshin etc. If anything, it could hopefully prompt newer anime fans to check out older series.
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats better than Disappearance? I'm heavily offended. It's not even comparable. One is the best anime movie ever made, and the other is... meh.

Still, 2009 must have been a really bad anime year, since Suzumiya season 2 made it there. Not that it is bad, but seeing as this entire list is so heavily biased...
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the NHK is better than Hunter X Hunter, I think Hunter X Hunter won because it is the more popular show. 
>> ARTICLE
Last one I suppose. A few surprising results, and 2011 would NOT be my top year personally, but..that's OK.

* Steins;Gate VS **Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood**: Tough choice, but FMA captivated me from the getgo.
* **Fate/Zero S1** VS Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2: Still not a contest.  
* Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica VS **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann**: .....damnit. How the hell do I vote here? TTGL. It had a stronger impact on me. But seriously that was HARD.
* Hunter X Hunter VS **Attack on Titan**: My dislike of super long shonen speaks for itself.  
* AnoHana VS **Fate/Zero S2**: Again, not a contest.   
* **Mirai Nikki** VS Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion S1: And here's where the downvotes come in (if not like HxH didn't do it). I LIKED Mirai Nikki. I'm like the only one.
* Nichijou VS **Angel Beats**: Rocket chair vs goat suplex. Rocket chair wins.  
>> ARTICLE
I usually don't tell people they have shit taste because I understand people have different preferences with different experiences.  I'm also not going to downvote you because you have a different opinion.  But AoT over HxH is shit taste and I did enjoy AoT so it's not that I'm hating on it.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. HxH is better in every facet.
>> ARTICLE
its a DEER suplex, deer suplex all the way!, also anohana losing to fate like its no contest? i do not agree. I will agree on the FMA:B pick though.
>> ARTICLE
>mirai nikki over code geass

*bruh*.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate VS **Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood**  
This is entirely personal preference across two different genres, and are nearly universally liked and critically solid.

Fate/Zero S1 VS **Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2**  
The incredibly strong ending sealed this.

**Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica** VS Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann  
TTGL was great in some ways, but, it had a really, really poor start and some weak episodes. Madoka Magica did not.

~~Hunter X Hunter VS Attack on Titan~~  
Haven't seen HxH, no comment

~~AnoHana VS Fate/Zero S2~~  


**Mirai Nikki** VS Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion S1  
I have yet to see anything remotely like Mirai Nikki, while Code Geass's start wasn't nearly as strong as it's end.

**Nichijou** VS Angel Beats  
I have never laughed so hard in my life as I did while watching Nichijou.

I lol'ed when I saw that MN lost to black lagoon, oh the haters, I love their tears.

I would have been incredibly surprised if Black lagoon lost there. I was actually surprised MN made the list at all. It was very poorly written.

Oh really? Why was it? Show me your wonderful skills on what makes good writing.

2006 was better

>**Steins;Gate** VS Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood

Easy pick. Brotherhood was really good but I really don't think it was anything more than that. I find Steins; Gate pretty easily superior critically and also far more enjoyable (arguably my favorite from a pure enjoyability standpoint).

>Fate/Zero S1 VS **Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2**

The weaker seasons of each. Close but would have to give this to R2 for the ending if nothing else.

>**Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica** VS Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

Love the hell out of TTGL (one of my favorites ever) but this is still not even close. The only show that I would probably have to think about having a chance against Madoka would probably The Tatami Galaxy and I feel like Madoka would still win.

>**Hunter X Hunter** VS Attack on Titan

Not even close.

>AnoHana VS **Fate/Zero S2**

Closer, but still not close.

>Mirai Nikki VS **Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion S1**

I actually really enjoyed Mirai Nikki but I still enjoy CG R1 more. Add in the critical side of things (where CG dominates pretty easily) and it's another easy choice.

>**Nichijou** VS Angel Beats

Really not a fan of either, and I actually put Nichijou on hold half way through (just never got around to watching the next episode XD) but I think Angel Beats is generally just a pretty mediocre show while Nichijou is at least solid for what it is.

I can't upvote this enough.
>> ARTICLE
Serious question: HxH ? Why? 
>> ARTICLE
Awesome cast of characters, A vast world to explore, great villains and the best character development imo.
The anime ended in a good place where if togashi writes more manga it could open endless possiblities for the show,
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched it and are questioning it? Or have you not watched it?
>> ARTICLE
I have not watch it and was looking for an opinion about it.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because HxH on 2014 had the best year-run of episodes anime has ever seen, with the ending of the anime and especially the ending of the Chimera Ant Arc, best arc in anime history hands down.
>> ARTICLE
If you are in anyway remotely interested or not put off by action/adventures with strategic battles and high episodes counts, I'd say give it a go. In fact I'd say give it a go anyway. 

Hunter x Hunter is a show that starts off good and only gets better with every episode. It's has amazing characters (in particular its villains) that carry an incredible story. There's an over arching plot line but really its "the little detours" our protagonists go on that makes HxH really special. 

I won't tell you what it's actually about because I think it's one of those shows best experienced embarking on the journey from episode one knowing nothing at all. Just a tip though, the second arc (Yorknew city arc) will make you mind up to whether the show is for you or not so if you dont like that arc, there's probably no point watching the next hundred episodes. 

Hope that helped and you decide to watch it. It's not highly acclaimed and AotY contender for nothing.


>> ARTICLE
Thank you. As I am right now picking a new series to watch the ones that have caught my eyes were Legend of the Galactic Heroes or HxH.

Both are lengthy so I didn't want to comit to a large series if it wasn't good at all.

Thanks for the opinion bhvgcf!
>> ARTICLE
would you meteor?
>> ARTICLE
You're welcome :) HxH is one of shows you just gotta share

edit: grammar yo
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching the show a few days ago. I'd say, at the very least watch through the Greed Island arc.  That was probably my 2nd favorite arc.  The Hunter Exam arc was my favorite.  But Greed Island finally starts to give you a taste of Gon's power.  It also has the best ED: "Reason".

The Chimera Ant arc is very, very different from the rest of the show, in my opinion, and dragged on for way too long. It ended extremely well though.

Overall, the show is great, the soundtrack is very good, and there are many cool characters.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. This is pretty much the exact opposite opinion of most fans. The Chimera Ant and Yorkshin arcs are overwhelmingly the most popular, and Greed Island and the Hunter Exam are generally the least popular.

If you really liked the Hunter Exam that much you might be interested in checking out the 1999 version of the show. While everything else may be up for debate, I think most would agree that arc was definitely better in the original.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Greed Island was by far the worst arc for me
>> ARTICLE
That's really interesting to me.

I really don't get why Yorknew is so beloved. I'd rank the Arena arc above that one. The Phantom Troupe had some interesting characters, but they were underutilized.  It revolved around Kurapika mostly, and Kurapika was honestly a pretty boring character to me, despite being voiced by my favorite seiyuu.

The way the Chimera Ant arc wrapped up was fantastic and really surprising to me...but it really changed the tone of the show for me, and it just wasn't fun for me for the first 20 or so episodes of the arc.
>> ARTICLE
YES! Everyone I've met loves the Yorknew arc, and while I wouldnt put it above Heavens Arena, it wasn't very fun. The only interesting parts were the auctions and the [Ep. 50-ish](/s "Kurapika vs. Uvogin fight.") Everything else was mediocre, but maybe that was because I had read up till the very beginning of Greed Island in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, 2011 Hisoka is the best thing to grace anime, without him what's the point?
>> ARTICLE
Greed Island was amazing. Currently on episode 114 (the narration-heavy episodes). So far the Chimera Ant Arc is my favorite. Initially I was put off by it's length and told myself that since it took up almost half the show, it better be pretty damn good. So far I haven't been disappointed. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude get off reddit. If you're on episode 114.. You must continue immediately.

Btw chimera ant arc is my favourite arc but I didnt really start to love it until the final 20 episodes, so if you love it already you're in for a wild ride mate.
>> ARTICLE
The assault was one of the most intense load of episodes I've ever seen.

"Only 30 seconds had passed" but we saw like 5 episodes, it was beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Everything I knew about good pacing prior to those episodes screamed "this shouldn't work" but the intensity and just all round amazingness that was taking place made me not care. Especially 116 onwards. Incredible.

I gave a quick scroll on the other comments, although I did not watch  Ping Pong yet, I feel confident enough to give my vote to Hunter X Hunter (2011), this revitalisation and also continuation really bought one of my favorite manga and anime series from my childhood back to life. Hisoka is still a creep perv though.
Honorable mention to Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season, one of the few "Sports" anime that is actually great, a step above Prince of Tennis in my opinion. Not sure if sports or battle anime though, the guys from KnB and PoT could easily be in a fighting genre anime with their powers.

Still haven't seen the second half of Wixoss, the first half of Fate, or the terror anime but I feel like those 5 are probably gonna stay in my top list. On my personal list I wouldn't put on Parasyte since it still airing this doesn't count and would add silver spoon instead, but since this subreddit has such terrible taste nobody added on silver spoon. 
>> ARTICLE
You can add Silver Spoon yourself. 
>> ARTICLE
This is such a hard choice, but I have to go with No Game No Life. It is probably in my top 5 anime (yes, I do have shit taste). My other picks would be F/SN UBW, KLK, and Akame ga Kill. Hunter x Hunter is also fantastic.

Edit: [](#mandom)
>> ARTICLE
Agreed! I would personally argue it's my favourite of the year, next to Nozaki-kun and WIXOSS.
>> ARTICLE
My top three are probably Barakamon, Ping Pong and Witch Craft Works. WIXOSS was unexpectedly good too, and Nozaki-kun was hilarious 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Ping Pong, but Witch Craft Works was a fun show as well. But I can't say it was among my favourites. It did have, by far, the best ED of 2014.
>> ARTICLE
You should try Ping Pong out. Especially if you've tried Yuasa's other works like The Tatami Galaxy and Mind Game. 
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is overrated, it was good but not that good.. that is my humble opinion at the very least.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, it has extremely well written characters, but almost everything else about the show is rather unremarkable. Or distracting like the art style and animation. The characters carry it to an 8.5  *at best* imho. Aoty for me is Parasyte; HxH had some great parts, but it also had terrible parts(overall probably close to an 8.5 as well). I cant even think of something to complain about Parasyte off the top of my head.
>> ARTICLE
If I were to complain about Parasyte it'd be something along the lines of the side characters being very one-dimensional and undeveloped, but all in all I agree, AOTY 2014.
>> ARTICLE
It's all up to the person if they like it or not, I've heard it's high on Character Development, which is what I want in anime.
>> ARTICLE
It did have impressive character development and the story was good but not even close to as good as people want to make it seem but it's pretty lackluster in the remaining areas, honestly I believe it to be the most overhyped series of 2014... not to say it's bad because it's definitely not.

Keep in mind that many people haven't seen Ping Pong, so it would still be understandable even if No Game No Life beat out Ping Pong.

They should have something to compensate for the dependency on having seen it.  It would be interesting if we could see votes and rankings for anime *after* controlling for what anime people had seen in addition to it.  My guess is that more people would pick No Game No Life over Ping Pong, but that if you *controlled for people who had seen both* it would be a lot closer.  That's just one of the demerits of these polls.

2014 felt pretty lackluster for me at least, very few anime above an 8/10.  

That being said Ping Pong and Mushishi were easily the best, if I had to pick a third it would probably be WIXOSS, I just loved the shit out of that series even with all the things wrong with it (more so in the second season). Parasyte deserves a vote from me too but I have a thing against voting for/putting shows in a top list when they aren't complete.

I feel bad voting on this because there were so many shows that I didn't vote for simply because I haven't seen them yet.

There's a big difference between not voting for a show because I haven't seen it and not voting for one because it wasn't good enough, and this poll doesn't capture that.

At the time of this comment, No Game No Life is just about taking the lead.

UBW is the second route of the visual novel Fate/Stay Night, it is NOT a sequel or second season to Deen's F/SN anime, nor Fate/Zero (that was a prequel light novel done by Gen Urobuchi, who did not work on the original VN; it also followed the third route of the VN more than any other).

The first two episodes are the prologue to the VN, before any real story kicks off. They're there to put the pieces in place for all three routes (and will probably be used for the upcoming Heaven's Feel movies), and introduce you to characters and make you question some things going on in the universe (i.e. [mild F/SN spoilers](/s "Rin seeming so distraught over Shirou being hit by Lancer; hint, it's not because she was in love with him"))

I also want to mention, the fights are meant to be almost DBZ-esque fast paced, as the servants actually were described as moving too fast to follow with normal human eyes. Be glad ufotable didn't sell us short and actually animate them moving, regardless of how fast they're supposed to be going.

FSN is a more relaxed show. It's not as frenetic. It takes time to actually show the characters in their daily lives and how they have to deal with being normal people of that city thrown into the war.

It also takes its time to let the characters interact with each other, whereas in F/Z you barely get anything that indicates the characters had a life beyond the war and being magi (or being a murderer).

If you don't enjoy that, I suggest dropping it because that's not going to change. 

Also it's not a second season to anything that exists.
>> ARTICLE
well in F/Z it starts off with the stakes very high for some of the characters and I entered FSN expecting the same level stakes that was probably my mistake
>> ARTICLE
Quick question, are you watching Unlimited Blade Works or DEEN's 2006 anime?
>> ARTICLE
Unlimited blade works 
>> ARTICLE
Ah good. Then just know UBW is a steady build up (oh, and you are missing an first entire season that sadly doesn't exist).
>> ARTICLE
Its technically not a second season lol. It's an adaption of the Fate/stay night VN that was written way before Fate/Zero. And lol, this adapation having budget issues lol.
>> ARTICLE
You're doing it wrong.
>> ARTICLE
It seems what is happening to you, also happened to me as well. Let me be frank, the adaptation your watching sucks. I know, because I watched it and thought it was average at best and it turned me off to the fate series when it came out. Years later I discover Fate/Zero and UBW and they blew me out of the park with their better animation and, as stated by a previous comment, MUCH better pacing. There are always people that aren't going to play the VN. I highly suggest you don't spoil the show for yourself and just wait until April so UBW can be fully released and skip this Arc.
>> ARTICLE
There is more exposition in the VN, so they cut some of it out and it's not like Zero didn't have a ton of exposition.  They actually cut out 2 important explanations in the first 2 episodes (reality marble and true magic talks).

The Holy Grail War is not the main focus of this show and you'll see why eventually.

Zero had 'flashy' stuff.  It had gilg on a freakin space ship thing just cruising around for christ sakes.

Why would they focus a lot on what happened 10 years ago?  Heaven's Feel (the third route) explains stuff about Zero and why things happened.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its a very dissapointing sequel to Fate/Zero. The pacing is a holdover from the erotic game which the show is based on, I didnt find the rest of the episodes to be much better, episode 3 is the highlight in terms of fighting, if you like SoL and humerous sections there is lots of that though, more so than there was in Fate/Zero due to the overall younger cast. I didnt find the whole first 13 episodes all that great but people assure me that the second part will be much better.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's really not a sequel to Fate/Zero, just a story that happens later in the same universe, but the plot and themes from Zero are quite different. 

I think Zero is better storywise than UBW is, although the story of FSN are the whole 3 routes, not just 1 of them. So, IMO you shouldn't expect UBW to surpass Zero because I doubt it will, that being said, Season 2 should be pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
FSN taken as a whole is a much more in-depth work than Fate/Zero, but I can see someone who doesn't know where it all connects thinking UBW isn't as good as F/Z, even though when reading it I was much more... uh, hyped with UBW than I ever was with F/Z.

I'm more of a Heaven's Feel man myself, too.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you that FSN as a whole surpasses Zero, but I don't think UBW alone will do it.

And I say that with UBW being my favorite route, even though HF's story is better, or I think it is, I prefer UBW simply because it's the route were almost every Servant and Master is important at some point. [UBW VN spoiler](/s "except Rider and Sakura, ofc. And I also missed a bit more of Kotomine.")
>> ARTICLE
Illya neither.

Shit, I can't believe I forgot her.

Whatstaunt is our resident satire bot. Just chuckle and move on

It switches into high gear pretty quick. Some absolutely gorgeous animation. You can see the money burning onscreen. I like it as a series. Not the greatest ever but not bad at all. That first episode is very slow and dull. 
>> ARTICLE
For future reference for anyone who wants it:
[AniChart.net](http://anichart.net/summer) lists all the upcoming shows and links to MAL, Hummingbird, or their own anime list site. Just select between the three sites at the top right under "current links". Then just click the picture or the title and you're good to go!
>> ARTICLE
Anichart sucks. The airing page is completely outdated. The seasons page would be better if they weren't ordered alphabetically and instead ETA to airing.

I still find MAL's upcoming filter way easier than anichart ever will be.
>> ARTICLE
That's what bothered me too, but if you click on their beta page http://beta.anichart.net/summer you can now sort it by next airing date.
>> ARTICLE
Oh dear lord it DOES link to MAL. That was my only complaint about anichart.net. You just made my day, dude.
>> ARTICLE
Here's a serious question, is AnimePlanet never included in these things because it's just not popular, or because there's some hate for the site in particular?

I use AnimePlanet purely for my show listings, what I've watched, want to watch, and what I am watching, but I've never posted on the forums, and only went onto the IRC channel once, so I wouldn't know if there's some kind of negative feelings towards them. Site seems fairly populated for an anime user review site, so I was just curious. Cheers to all who respond politely, I'm not trying to troll.

Also, a lot of the time I cross-reference the rankings of show's between AnimePlanet and MyAnimeList's rankings to form an overall aggregate if I'm on the fence about whether or not to watch a show. I think both have their merits. MyAnimeList is more to-the-point and factual, AnimePlanet is more flashily laid out. I think I just prefer AnimePlanet's format.
>> ARTICLE
I use anime-planet over MAL just because I like the interface more. I don't know if or why people don't like it here.

Dammit. I wish I would have known this.

Thanks :) Glad to know some people are using my list.

What i love most of Anichart, is the Timer.
>> ARTICLE
That timer is perfect. Just what I needed.
>> ARTICLE
not always accurate, though - sometimes will say an episode aired and start the countdown till next week when there was a delay or something
>> ARTICLE
Also I think the timer is based on Japanese air slots so even simulcasts will be off based on the timer

Great job, but am I really going to watch the new Sailor Moon?

As part of the anime community, I think it's a given. >.>
>> ARTICLE
the new sailor moon will last long time since it wont be every week.
>> ARTICLE
Yes... Possibly... I am.
>> ARTICLE
I am. I'll at least try it.

I have to.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, Sailor Moon wasn't the first anime I watched all the way (it was Cardcaptor Sakura)... but I believe Sailor Moon was right after it. What better way to remember where it all started for you than to watch one of the few shows that got you into it in the first place. 

I will be serious though... if they are thinking of a Gundam Wing remake... you have my money. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm looking forward to.
Majimoji Rurumo, Girls und Panzer OVA, Akame ga Kill!, Glasslip and some Slice of Life
>> ARTICLE
Is there anywhere where this list also comes with where we can watch these anime? 

also. Border 3.. Can't wait.

I could edit in some links. I'm on mobile right now, but I'll put some in soon.

Thanks a ton for putting this together <3
>> ARTICLE
No problem! I'm glad everyone's enjoying it, here and in /r/animesuggest
>> ARTICLE
Ah, hell yeah, Space Brothers! I hope the show starts up again after the movie release, it's easily one of my favourite animes of all time.
>> ARTICLE
For the first time in a long time I have more than 2 shows to watch this season. (11 shows. So many. ; - ;) Gunna be great!
>> ARTICLE
You're the greatest, this really helps me get my Watching list in order on MAL.

I'm so excited, following 14 shows this season (possible more later), it's gonna be crazy :D
>> ARTICLE
Hanamonogatari starts at August? does  it replace something? or a new time slot is set specifically for it?
>> ARTICLE
It's only 5 episodes long. It was originally supposed to air after Nisekoi, which is why Nisekoi was only 20 episodes
>> ARTICLE
It was delayed but all episodes will be broadcasted on that day
>> ARTICLE
Psycho-Pass re-air starts July 10th, by the way. Also, still unsure whether I should watch the original or wait for the reairing. Does anyone else have any input, or know what the differences are?
>> ARTICLE
A lot of the stories are 2 parts long, so the re-air, to my knowledge, just puts the 2 parts together, pretty much halving the episode count. As far as I'm aware, they aren't adding anything new, so you would get the same effect just by watching part one and two of a story back to back. I'd say just dive in now, saves waiting every week when you could get the same show now. It's an awesome show too!

Edit: Just researched a bit more, it appears there is going to be a small amount of new footage. I'd still recommend not waiting, but it's up to you.
>> ARTICLE
It is a re-edit. The new hour long episodes will have the same story as the original with some extra footage.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, Sabagebu has already strated
>> ARTICLE
That was a Niconico pre-air, not the actually ordinary airing, IIRC.

Edit: Also 480p!  Ew.
>> ARTICLE
Still great.

All the more reason to watch in HD!

Wow. Quick reply!

This one wasn't, though!

Can someone tell me any must watches for summer? 

I watch anything usually so recommend anything :)
>> ARTICLE
/u/UgotMAL isn't wrong, but if you're caught up in the Monogatari series... then **HANAMONOGATARI***!!* I am SO beyond hyped for this anime, I can't really put it into words.
>> ARTICLE
/r/anime seems hyped for quite a few shows, including, but not limited to:

Aldnoah.Zero

Akame ga Kill!

Glasslip

Sword Art Online II

Terror in Tokyo
>> ARTICLE
I think the creator of the Aldnoah.Zero is the same who write Madoka, Psycho-Pass, Suisei no gargantia and Fate(i think) so is a must watch for me.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Gen Urobuchi, writer of Madoka and Psycho-Pass is writing ALDNOAH.ZERO as well. I'm not sure if he wrote Fate/Zero but I'm pretty sure he was involved some way
>> ARTICLE
terror in tokyo is called resonance of terror and it starts on the 11th, not the 4th.
>> ARTICLE
I personally like the name Terror in Tokyo better, and I have it under the 11th. I can change it if necessary 
>> ARTICLE
ok but that's not the name of it any more..
>> ARTICLE
Isn't it Terror in Resonance? 
>> ARTICLE
literal translation is "echo's terror", but yes 
>> ARTICLE
Ooh I like Echo's Terror too. 

I think I'll make everyone happy and change it to Zankyou no Terror
>> ARTICLE
Where am I able to watch Zankyou no Terror, or is my only real choice torrenting?
>> ARTICLE
I think it's going to be on Funimation. Also possible it will be on Crunchyroll, it starts tomorrow and they could announce tonight yet or maybe even tomorrow. They announced a simulcast for Akame ga Kill like three days after it was up on the website. 
>> ARTICLE
you sir forgot kiss x sis ova hehe
>> ARTICLE
I probably forgot everything like that. I'm not surprised really :p

Plus I didn't include OVAs on this list at all
>> ARTICLE
Any recommendations for new series?
>> ARTICLE
If you haven't seen cencoroll you should really check it out. I know its not new but cencoroll 2 is coming out this summer so if you like the first one you'll have something to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
>  cencoroll 2 is coming out this summer

allegedly.
>> ARTICLE
even if its later we know its coming out soon which is good.
>> ARTICLE
Well, none of them are out yet so I can't really say which ones will be good, but here's what I'm looking forward to. 

[Akame ga Kill!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22199/Akame_ga_Kill!)

[Terror in Tokyo]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/23283/Zankyou_no_Terror)

[Aldnoah.Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22729/Aldnoah.Zero)

[Glasslip](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23079/Glasslip)

[Persona 4: The Golden Animation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24075/Persona_4_The_Golden_Animation) This can be watched standalone.

[Space Dandy S2]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/23327/Space%E2%98%86Dandy_2nd_Season)

I'll also probably give a bunch of others a try, mainly [Sailor Moon Crystal](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14751/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon:_Crystal) and [Tokyo Ghoul](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22319/Tokyo_Ghoul).
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul manga is soo good! Can't wait for that show. With Akame ga Kill! and Terror in Tokyo is one of the animes I am the most hype about this season.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Love Stage!! and more Kuroshitsuji good for you
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks bud this helps alot didn't realise ARISE already was already out, can anyone tell me if ARISE is straight to Blu-ray or is actually aired on TV at all?
>> ARTICLE
It's an OVA. It airs in the cinema and has a Blu-Ray release shortly after, there is no TV airing. They also sell advance copies at some cinema's too.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Free! was airing on Wednesdays? 
>> ARTICLE
It's Wednesday for everybody west of Japan; Free airs just after midnight.
>> ARTICLE
According to the MAL link in the post, it's starting July 3, which is a Thursday. I guess it's possible that it will switch, but I was just going based off of that.
>> ARTICLE
I understand! It's just strange since the endcards always say "see you next waterday" which is a translation of the Japanese word for Wednesday and, of course, Free! + water. It may be an error on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
Waterday seems like it's a pun for Saturday, but maybe not. Also, this isn't out yet, so how do you know what the endcards say? :3
>> ARTICLE
The endcards from season one say "see you next waterday".

The spelling of wednesday in Japanese is "" and the first character, , means water. 
>> ARTICLE
The thing with the dates on MAL is that they put the time the show airs in Japan. So for free, on ani chart it says that it will air 1 day 23 hours from now which will be Wednesday morning for me, but Midnight (Jul 3) in Japan.

It's the same with a lot of other shows as well. Most anime air between Midnight-3am in Japan, which for America would be Mid Morning - Early afternoon.
>> ARTICLE
This sums my thoughts

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Blzptkw9xo
>> ARTICLE
Just got around to watching this right now, and just want to say that it seems like you're judging most of these by their pictures and that's it. I'm not saying its a bad thing, and actually it's why I've put off watching Clannad for so long.

Also, yeah Persona 4 the Golden is definitely a cash-grab. The list of the content in the Persona 4 series is crazy. Persona 4, Persona 4 Golden (both the games and the anime), Persona 4 Arena, Persona 4 Arena: The Ultimax, Persona Q (crossover of Persona 3 and Persona 4), I think there was even a Persona 4 Pachinko machine in japan.
>> ARTICLE
If the picture and the PV are not enough to tell you what the show is about, they are doing a bad advertisement.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. A PV should definitely give you a jist of what the series will be about. A picture is a little different though. All I can see from those is a bit of the show's art style. 
>> ARTICLE
"Hanamonogatari"

Hanamogatari.

Amazing description indeed lol
>> ARTICLE
Well it is kind of impossible to reasonably describe the Monogatari series IMO
>> ARTICLE
Flower story?
>> ARTICLE
Or, Nose Story.
>> ARTICLE
If you are planning to watch Hanamonogatari, you better fucking know what Hanamonogatari is right?
>> ARTICLE
Do I have to watch Bake, Nise, Loli, *monogatari in order to watch Hanamonogatari? ._.
>> ARTICLE
Why did no one else notice Loli, hahaha
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend watching them before watching Hanamonogatari, because it's all one continuous story (although not told entirely in chronological order). Hanamonogatari probably won't make sense at all since it will assume you know all of the characters already.


>> ARTICLE
I think it's okay to watch them in Release order, it's how I watched them and made the most sense to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah I've been wanting to get into the series and have no idea myself lol
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Wrong, its nise then neko
>> ARTICLE
you think they would release kizu tho?
>> ARTICLE
Kizu is the movie right? IIRC it's coming later this year.
>> ARTICLE
All I want is shinobu movie. 


That's all I want. 
>> ARTICLE
That's was Kizu is all about. ^I ^hope
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it's a whole movie based around the full history of Shinobu and Araragi's attempt to return to being a human.

I think...
>> ARTICLE
The order is actually Bake -> Nise -> Neko -> Second Season

Bake is actually 15 episodes, but for some reason only 12 are licensed, so you may have to torrent the last three. The rest are all up on legal streaming sites.

I highly recommend watching them before watching Hanamonogatari, because it's all one continuous story (although not told entirely in chronological order). Hanamonogatari probably won't make sense at all since it will assume you know all of the characters already.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you
>> ARTICLE
You would need pages of description to scratch the surface.
>> ARTICLE
Aldonoah.Zero and Akame ga Kill hype!
>> ARTICLE
ALso don't forget Terror in Tokyo!!!
>> ARTICLE
these kind of posts should be stickied every season.
>> ARTICLE
I appreciate the work but holy fuck when I opened this with RES it all auto-played at once, scared me a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's been killing me too. And if they start playing, sometimes even closing the post just restarts the videos, it's ridiculously annoying. And to think it all comes from an addon that was supposed to make things more convenient :(
>> ARTICLE
You can disable it in the options (for exact location look a few comments  above this one). Imo it would be better if it was off by default though.
>> ARTICLE
The problem isn't the autoplay itself but rather, say I look at a video. Afterwards, when I click to close the post, sometimes it closes and the sound just plays from the beginning in the background of the page, basically. And oddly enough it doesn't happen in all subreddits.
>> ARTICLE
My main problem was that whenever there was more than one video, they just started all playing at once. Especially nice if someone posted 4+ videos and you have to stop all of them.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know how to get res to stop doing that?
>> ARTICLE
known bug that's being worked on apparently
>> ARTICLE
Go to RES settings console -> UI -> Inline Image Viewer -> Turn off autoExpandSelfText.
>> ARTICLE
thanks
>> ARTICLE
Akame ga Kill. I alredy said enough. Just SO fucking hyped for this!
>> ARTICLE
>A boy time travels to the Sengoku Era and must become Nobunaga Oda, the famed warlord that conquered all "historical" anime plots.
>> ARTICLE
I was SO worried we wouldn't have a show revolving around Oda Nobunaga this season. Thank goodness Nobunaga Concerto showed up!
>> ARTICLE
I think the Sengoku Jidai is the thing that saddens me the most to see overused with a billion shitty plot twists. Meanwhile, there's hardly any serious anime related to it. Maybe Rurouni Kenshin but that takes place afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
Nobunaga was mid 1500's, and died before the Tokugawa Shogunate even started.  Kenshin is set after the Meiji restoration, more than 300 years later, after the fall of the Shogunate. :)
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I know, and that's exactly my point. The only remotely "serious" anime(in that it has its serious parts) is only tangentially related and that is sad. There was Hyouge Mono but I never saw more than a few episodes, at least that was original(if still not serious)
>> ARTICLE
Could you please bold the titles so it's easier to pick out from the list? Thx

Much easier, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
> DRAMAtical Murder

The original material is actually a yaoi visual novel.

> Momo Kyun Sword

Is a web light novel adaptation.

> Nobunaga Concerto - CG.

Fuck, I was hoping that would be something.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, my expectations for these three is pretty low.  I thought Nobunaga Concerto had a chance of greatness from the synopsis, but that preview killed my hopes.
>> ARTICLE
It's Ao Har**u** Ride, not Ao Har**a** Ride. It means "Blue Spring Ride". :)

And it's going to be amazing if they don't mess up the adaption. It is a (girly) romance though, and it has quite a lot of drama, so if you don't like that kind of show then Ao Haru Ride is not for you.
>> ARTICLE
I'm looking to expand my tastes, and seeing a sweet romance weekly will probably make it a more pleasant experience than binging it.
>> ARTICLE
Glasslip looks like it's going to be really good. The animation and music already have me pretty hype, high hopes for this one. 
>> ARTICLE
Lookin forward to Aldnoah Zero, Akame ga Kill and Tokyo Terror. Though Ill also look into Railwars could be quiet fun.
>> ARTICLE
Can't say I fully agree with your predictions (Rail Wars for *Anime of the Century*) but this is a good list either way, thanks for this :D
>> ARTICLE
Just a quick correction: Seirei Tsukai is a light novel adaption, the manga is an adaption of the books.
>> ARTICLE
Sabagebu!

The bullets bother me...
>> ARTICLE
Well, looks like it's the perfect time to pick out what I'll be watching for the next season.

* **Bakumatsu Rock:** God, even after seeing the lackluster preview, I still want this to be the most fantastically bad thing ever. I mean, it's Studio Deen, so it's quite possible that this series could achieve that status--OH MY GOD I JUST REALIZED THAT THE OFFICIAL TWITTER ACCOUNT HAS THE HANDLE OF **[@BAKUMATSU69](https://twitter.com/bakumatsu69)**. THIS MIGHT JUST BE THE BEST OR WORST THING EVER.
* **Argevollen:** Eh, I'll give this a shot. On the negative side there's not a whole lot of info about the series and the animation studio is Xebec, but at the same time I'm curios if Xebec can actually pull something off that isn't fanservice-reliant. Of course, this could just end up like another *M3*, but I'll give this a couple episodes.
* **Rail Wars!:** Because of *Rail Wars!*, I incidentally learned that there's a parody of *Initial D* featuring trains. I think this series deserves at least 24 minutes of my life because of that alone. Also, the listed PV looks pretty good despite the fact that this is coming from a first-time studio.
* **Tokyo Ghoul:** Even though some have been unimpressed with the previews for this series, I'm actually quite excited. Anime needs more horror, and even if *Tokyo Ghoul* is leaning more towards being action-oriented I still appreciate any attempts at portraying proper horror.
* **Aldnoah.Zero:** To be honest, I'm not caught up in the hype. However, I just have this inherent assumption that *Aldnoah.Zero* is going to be good, regardless of anyone's doubts. I mean, the talent behind the project points to everything about this series being good. I have no reason to assume that this is going to be bad, and thus I assume that it's going to be good.
* **Sword Art Online II:** And so we must brace for the second coming of the apocalypse. At least the animation will look pretty...
* **Akame ga Kill:** Despite everyone being hyped for this show and with what appears to be a legitimate reason ("The manga is awesome!"), I'm skeptical of this one. I guess it's partly a reflexive judgement brought on by the hype, but I'm also not seeing anything much different compared to a standard action-driven shounen series. I'll give this a try, but my optimism is in check.
* **Jinsei:** When I first read the synopsis for this show, I though, "that would be cool if they took it seriously." Needless to say, the preview didn't enhance my confidence in the show. Regardless, I'll give this series a try. The premise seems ripe for highlighting character differences and as a fellow megane warrior I appreciate the glasses-kun main character.
* **Re - Hamatora:** I'm not going to lie; I'm watching this out of some sort of non-existent obligation. Unlike *Swort Art Online II*, I have a feeling that we'll all be able to sweep it under the rug and not lose our (collective) cool.
* **Tokyo ESP:** Eh, looks like it could be fun. I'll give it a few episodes and see what it does.
* **Terror in Tokyo:** Yes, I'm still calling it that. (It's such a good name!) Regardless, this is looking to be great. The animation showed off in the preview looks awesome, it's directed by Watanabe, and I'm always up for a thriller. Much like *Aldnoah.Zero*, it's hard for me to see this series *not* be good.

So, that's 11 shows in total, with several of them probably going to be dropped. That's a good amount.

Also, as a side note, did anyone else find the 3D in the *Nobunaga Concerto* preview to be surprisingly good? Granted, some of it looked off, but for the most part it looked very acceptable.

Question: Some of the many season charts out there list Kantai Collection as a summer show, but others don't. Does anyone know what's going on with it? Has it been delayed?
>> ARTICLE
It's not happening this summer. I don't know why AniChart still has it, but trust me, if it was going to air this summer, there would be quite a bit of art and PVs out already - KanColle is huge. Oh, and it would probably have a confirmed timeslot by now.

>Tokyo Ghoul

A horror anime? That PV was awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Is the sailor moon one going to be different from the original anime?

>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the compiled PV list!

I'll be sure to check out Ao Hara Ride/Akame Ga Kill this season along with my must watch Glasslip and Aldnoah. I'm still iffy about SAO2; it looks cool because guns but they ruined SAO for me during that Elf world thing. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't possibly be more hyped about Zankyou no Terror. My favorite director, my favorite setting, my favorite tone, my favorite genre.

Argevollen, Glasslip, Barakamon, Rail Wars and Aldnoah.Zero are going to be given a good try (3 episode rule, unless the first one is spectacularly unpleasant).

Jinsei, Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!? and Sword Art Online II I'm going to give at least one episode.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you, was looking for something like this

Damn, there are so many shows I'm watching this season, especially in comparison to the last season. Space Dandy S2, Hanamonogatari, Glasslip, Aldnoah. Zero, Zankyou no Terror, SAO 2, and a bunch of other shows that weren't on this list. So excited.

> /r/anime at its finnest i guess

at least we are good at winter warfare
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how or why this trend of being obsessed with female characters started (okay, I guess I can have a small idea given the main demographic of this subreddit and the anime community in general), but to be honest I find the VAST majority of the best anime characters to be males, so it's a bit sad when they are overshadowed due to shallowness.
>> ARTICLE
Part of it might be because a good amount of male MCs are boring, generic self-inserts or the occasional whiny Shinji-type. Of course they're not all like that, but I'm sure this also contributes in some way.
>> ARTICLE
Most popular shows have many more female characters than male (SAO, Akame Ga Kill, Steins; Gate, and the entire 'harem' genre come to mind) so theres  significantly more competition in the female character bracket.

Edit: After I posted this I started thinking of all the immensely popular shows with predominantly male casts, so allow me to modify my statement: Most shows which are popular *on this sub* have more female characters than male.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is that it's usually the females that are the "gimmick" or more unique in those series. There are simply more fun female archetypes that they are willing to play around with compared to male archetypes.
>> ARTICLE

As much as I praise Gilgamesh, he hasn't done anything yet in what's aired of UBW.

Wild Card test

Edit: here's a little more info. This is specifically for the people that didn't see the nomination thread. Basically, I'll be doing this for the rest of my threads. Each thread, I will have a maximum number of wild cards (for this one, it's 5). The top 5 (or other amount for another thread) will get a second chance and be in the final vote which will be held sometime after the end of the other polls, which is Wednesday, February 4. I'll probably end up posting it the 7th or the 8th. 

TL;DR, if you want characters added, comment them here.

Finals - Personal opinions

**Best OP** - I'm pretty undecided on this one, actually. There are four main ones that I really like. Here they are:

>**Ambiguous** - *Gamidelia* from Kill la Kill - The song in this is great. I really like the flashing of the different costumes the characters all wear in the beginning too. Towards the end of the OP, it gives me a feeling that something epic is going to happen, which fits really well with Kill la Kill. Also, boobies.

>**Database** - *Man With a Mission* from Log Horizon - This one seems to be a fan favorite, not surprised that it's in the finals. The song is fun, the visuals in each of the openings with this song are great (especially the first one) and I feel like it sets a unique tone for the show. 

>**Hikaru Nara (If You Will Shine)** - *Goose House* from Shigatsu wa Kimi no Osu (Your lie in April) - I really like the song and the visuals in this are great as well. The only reason I'm wary on this is that I haven't watched any of the show yet, so I don't know if it fits the show well or not. Either way, it's great and I might vote for this regardless. 

>**Trigger** - *Yuuki Ozaki* from Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - While I didn't like the show as much as most because of Five, the OP is great. The song is great, the visuals are great and there's just not much more to say about it. The lyrics kind of make me feel like it was written for the show, since they seem like they're extremely relevant. 

>Honorable mention - **Tada Hitori** - *Bakudan Johnny* from Ping Pong the Animation - I can't believe this didn't make the finals. One of the best from this year for sure. OOOHHHHH YEAH!

**Best ED** - This might actually be one of the easiest decisions in the entire event for me.

>**Innocence** - *NoisyCell* from Barakamon - The song is just amazing, and the kind of hazy/foggy visuals mixed with the watercolor animation just looks amazing. I don't know how to describe my feelings about it. /u/DrJamesFox showed me a short write up he did about it, but I can't find it right now. I remember one of the words he used to describe it was 'nostalgic' and I can't say I disagree. Even just watching the ED makes me tear up sometimes. Such a good ED. 

>Honorable mention - **Walk Like An Egyptian** - *The Bangles* from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders - The bizarre song choice and extremely colorful style in the ED really work well together, making it a combo that rivals Roundabout, but falls short by just a little. Either way, this was unexpected, but surprisingly still great. 

**Best ____ anime of the year** - I'm going to just name my anime next to the genre below.

>Comedy - **Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** - The premise is interesting, and the execution is just perfect. Has some of the best comedy I've ever seen in an anime, and the scene where they play the visual novels is probably my *favorite comedy scene* in **any** anime I've seen.

>Slice of Life - **Barakamon** - The premise, again, is interesting. I really liked the whole show, how Handa grew up when he moved to the island, and how it made him see what was important. Every character is unique and each one has great characterization, really combining to make something special.

>Harem - **Nisekoi** - So many best girls, so little time. If absolutely nothing else, the best girl wars make this the best. So many arguments between Chitoge, Onodera, true best girl Tsugumi and the other girl who no one cares about because she came into the anime too late. 

>Thriller - **Tokyo Ghoul** - Awesome premise, and the execution is good enough that I enjoyed the story. Unique to see someone cope with what Kaneki had to cope with, and seeing him [](/s "getting used to eating human flesh") was awesome. Also had one of the best last episodes last year. 

>Romance - Abstaining - I've only seen two shows from here, so it would be next to no contest.

>Sports - Abstaining - Only seen Ping Pong.

>Sci-fi - **Psycho-Pass 2** - Even if it didn't bring much new stuff since Psycho-Pass pretty much established the system, the new things they brought in were super interesting and cool.

>Action/Battle Shounen - **Kill la Kill** - Well, who doesn't love a great anime with great battle sequences? Not me! This show was great and the action scenes are just fun, even if they are a tad repetitive.

**Best Male character** - **Jurai Andou** from Inou-Battle - Shout out to /r/gayforandou. But seriously, as much as I wasn't a huge fan of the show, Andou carried it on his back, which is saying a lot for an MC, let alone one of a harem anime. You can really tell that Andou really cared about all of his friends in the show. Also, he's a total chuuni which is cool too.

>> ARTICLE
> so I don't know if it fits the show well or not. Either way, it's great and I might vote for this regardless.

I can assure you the OP captures the show perfectly. You really need to watch this one soon...but I guess you have a pretty long list of shows you really need to watch soon eh? :P

>showed me a short write up he did about it, but I can't find it right now. I remember one of the words he used to describe it was 'nostalgic' and I can't say I disagree.

I could link to it but it's unnecessary. Basically the lyrics of the song are recalling a very important time in the singer's life. A time that made him both incredibly happy and changed him. For Handa, that time was living on the Island and realizing what is important in life through his interactions with Naru and the other Islanders. The ED reflects the emotions in the song and the anime with it's watercolor art-style. It feels nostalgic because the art-style gives the ED a feeling of it being a memory. You know how when you think about any memory and details are kind of blurred? Same with the ED. The watercolor artstyle blurs the details of these fond memories. 

Oh and sorry if I've given you the impression that I've been ignoring you. I haven't been doing that intentionally. Stuff has been real tough at work and I'm working long hours to make up for people who have been laid off. I've been drinking a lot and immersing myself in manga when I'm not working to escape from these difficult times. Because of that I haven't really been in the right frame of mind to help you with your threads. I'm not looking for any words of encouragement, just letting you know why I didn't respond to some of your messages. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, no dude don't worry about it. Let me know if you want/need to talk about anything. /u/ugotmal is always here for you, s-senpai.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for that, but I try to use the internet as an escape from IRL problems. My having gotten fairly close to you and a couple of other redditors on here has caused the lines to blur a little though. I just let you know those bits of information because I didn't want you to get the wrong impression from my lack of responses. 

Oh and I think you asked about House of Cards, right? Shit is next level television, but you've got to pay careful attention to it or it'll go over your head. I consider my knowledge of US politics and government to be well above average but there were still several plot points that were difficult for me to follow. Amazing show though. 

And I saw you mention Tokyo Ghoul in your previous post as one of your favorites from last year. You should definitely consider picking up the manga if you haven't already. The anime is headed towards an anime original ending which I can't imagine will top the manga's beautifully epic ending. I started from Ch. 70, which is where I read the anime began to branch off from the manga. 

The new sequel manga, Tokyo Ghoul:re, takes place 3 years after the ending of Tokyo Ghoul and is looking *very* interesting through 15 chapters. 

Also, you calling me senpai gave me a good chuckle...thanks for that. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, well if you ever change your mind, I'm all ears. I know what it's like to have a stressful day. 

I did ask about House of Cards. I don't really know much about politics, should I just pass on the series then? 

I don't know if I'd consider Tokyo Ghoul to be one of my favorites from last year, but I enjoyed it. I'm gonna get into the manga eventually. I actually bought the guest volume and then when it came in the mail it was in Japanese... I was pretty upset. And btw, when you say that RE is very interesting, do you think it could be better than the first part of the manga? That would be great. 

And I'm just glad that senpai finally noticed me! Lol. 
>> ARTICLE
>I did ask about House of Cards. I don't really know much about politics, should I just pass on the series then?

I think you should probably watch a couple of episodes to see how it feels to you. The second season is much more politically complex than the first though. It felt too high level for me at times, and like I said, I feel like my understanding of politics/US Govt is better that average. 

>when you say that RE is very interesting, do you think it could be better than the first part of the manga?

I began reading the manga at Ch. 70, which is where I was told the anime began to diverge. So I can't answer that question. I'd say RE is interesting because of the timeskip and the effects it has had on the characters. If you like Tokyo Ghoul because of the characters, RE is *extremely* interesting. If you like Tokyo Ghoul because of the world building and action, then RE is just okay. 

>And I'm just glad that senpai finally noticed me! Lol.

I might check a few episodes of HoC out. But even if I like it, 2d 4 lyfe.

May I recommend you either vote or watch and vote for our lord and saviour [Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time) for the romance genre?

Romance: Golden Time...Its the only one I watched

Sports: Haikyuu

Action/Battle: Noragami

Really want Haikyuu to win best sports; It's against Ping Ping though so I dont see it happening



>> ARTICLE
Agreed, I do believe Haikyuu!! to be better than Ping Pong though.
>> ARTICLE
My OP and ED choices would've been slightly different if it wasn't including animation and art but now that it is.

**Best OP - This Game by Konomi Suzuki**

**Best ED - Tokohana by Yanagi Nagi**

**Best Comedy: Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** (I can imagine it's between this and Barakamon for the win).

**Best Slice of Life: Barakamon**

**Best Harem: Nisekoi** (Was considering Monogatari but honestly I found Nisekoi to be superior to Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari and it'd be unfair judging on the past seasons).

**Best Thriller: Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** (Zankyou no Terror close second though).

**Best Romance: Golden Time** (Most realistic romance anime I've seen, can't help but loving it).

**Best Sports: Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season** (I find Ping Pong to be the most overrated series of 2014 on this subreddit honestly, Haikyuu!! is probably the most worthy winner though, I'm just a Kuroko fan.)

**Best Sci-fi: Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei** (I'd place this 4th amongst the series in terms of how much I liked them but it's undeniably the best out of the 5 when it comes to Sci-fi attributes IMO.)

**Best Action: Hunter x Hunter (2011)** (Honestly I don't see anything that can come close to touching Hunter x Hunter for rank 1 here, possibly Bahamut).

**Best Male Character: Izumi Shinichi** (Real hard decisiong between Izumi and Archer, I swear to shit though that if Inaho wins I'll flip a table or something.)

A question though, scrolling downwards it seems to me like people voted with their favourite of the shows in mind, am I the only one who voted for whichever series I found pulled off the category in question the best? (aside from the sports category).
>> ARTICLE
Best OP: Unravel (Tokyo Ghoul)

Best ED: Shirushi (SAO II)

Comedy: Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun)

Harem: Nisekoi

Thriller: Haven't seem most of them so I can't really judge.

Romance: Shigatsu wa kimi no Uso

Sports: Kuroko no basket 2

Action/Battle: Fate/SN UBW

>> ARTICLE
I'm a little bit shocked that Barakamon's OP didn't make it to the finals, but ED did. OP is sooo wonderful, still listening to it a lot.

**Best OP:** - Hikaru Nara by Goose House then.

**Best ED:** - Innocence by NoisyCell

**Best Comedy:** Barakamon, I laughed like crazy while watching it.

**Best Slice of Life:** Barakamon, no comments, my love 2014 :)

**Best Harem:** Monogatari, Araragi has it right!

**Best Thriller:** Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu.

**Best Romance:** Golden Time - it's the best romance out of that choices.

**Best Sports:** I really hope Haikyuu!! wins, it was truly awesome. I told about it to my non-anime watcher friend, and he marathoned it and then even rewatched. It's just great.

**Best Sci-fi:** Aldnoah.Zero - the most sci-fi out of these ones.

**Best Action:** Akame ga Kill - really loved battle scenes here (and haven't watch HxH yed :D)

**Best Male Character:** Kanye FTW!

Best ED:Your song  
Comedy: Nisekoi  
Harem: Inou-Battle wa Nichijou no Naka de  
Romance: NAGI NO ASUKARA<3  
Sport: Kuroko no Basket Season 2

>> ARTICLE
Best OP - Shiver by Lucy Rose from Mushishi Zoku Shou - this fucking song man, so fucking great. Probably my all time favorite OP. 

Best ED - Walk Like and Egyptian - The Bangles - Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders - if you haven't guessed I like it when a show has some English songs as the OP or ED. 

Best Comedy Anime - Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun - It was between this and Amagi Brilliant Park, and both were funny, but nozaki Kun was much more clever and didn't give us an asspull ending, so it gets my vote. Also, dat catchy ass OP. 

Best SoL - Barakamon - I didn't see all of them, but all I hear is good things from Barakamon, so I'll pick that. 

Best Harem Anime - Monogatari Series - the answer is always Monogatari. It's the best harem, period. That isn't saying much and I don't particularly like the series, but il give it credit where it deserves it. 

Best Thriler Anime - Parasyte the Maxim - Parasyte is a damn good show, and the rest of these shows are meh to okay. 

Best Romance Anime - abstain - of the few romance anime I tried, I hated them all. And I didn't see the rest yet so I can't give judge. They all look like shit anyway. 

Best Sports anime - Ping Pong the Animation - again, the only right answer. Best sports anime ever, and much better than the rest of the shit we got this year. 

Best sci fi - Parasyte the Maxim - again, it's a great show, while the rest are either bad or average. 

Best action/battle shonen - Hunter x Hunter - I thought Kill la Kill would be my choice, but Hunter x Hunter just barely edged it out. Both are great series, and if I could pick both I would, but if there can only be one, that one needs to be HxH. Chimera ants FTW. 


>> ARTICLE
Best Op: It was hard choosing just one case their are so many good choices. But I had to pick Tokyo Ghoul because I listen to that song constantly when I first heard. 

Best ED: This was a toughy a pick from either Log Horizon or Barakamon. But I had to go with Barakamon. This ending made me tear up everytime I stayed after the show to listen to this beautiful song. Don't know what it was but for a song to do that is pretty great.

Best Comedy: Barakamon again cause I don't think I have laughed so hard in my life after watching that show.

Best SoL: Barakamon again lol

Best Harem: Nisekoi

Best Thiller: Tokyo Ghoul

Best Romance: Golden Time

Best Sport: haven't watched any of them so I picked Haikyuu!! since that looked the most appealing to me.

Best Sci-fi: The Irregular at Magic High School

Best Action: Kill la Kill 

Best Male Character: Jurai Andou

>> ARTICLE
Personally I love Unravel, best song of the year IMO, but due to the fact that I absolutely adore the art and animation in the NGNL OP and that I like the song a lot as well I had to pick that, I'll save Unravel for when it's judged purely on the music :3.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no I understand I Love NGNL op too but i like [this version better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRQbVNzmCK0)
>> ARTICLE
Best OP - Shiver (Mushishi Zoku Shou) I haven't even watched Mushishi but I love this song and I now am a fan of Lucy Rose.

Best ED - It's the right time (Kiseijuu) This song is always a good come down from all of the intensity of the show.

Best Comedy - Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, this was actually a huge surprise for me, I expected it to be nothing special and it was so much fun with a great cast and some of the funniest scenes I've seen.

Best Slice of Life - Barakmon, truthfully I never finished it but it was always a nice relaxing show to break up all of the action shows that season.

Best Harem - Monogatari Series, I love this series, not really much to say.

Best Thriller - Kiseijuu, the first half was really fantastic with some of the most tense moments from last year.

Best Romance - Nagi No Asukara, I just wish best girl won :(

Best Sports - Ping Pong, this is my pick for the best show of last year, everything about it is fantastic.

Best Sci-Fi - Kiseijuu

Best Action/Battle Shounen - Hunter x Hunter (2011), I haven't quite finished it yet but its been a real ride, I didn't expect to like it at all but it has some really great characters and moments.

Best Male Character - Kong Wenge (Ping Pong) since my first choice of the Ping Pong boys (Peco) didn't make it, I have to go with Kong.  His development from being an arrogant asshole looking down on others to a real team player/team captain was really quite something.

(Best OP nobody saw:[AMAZING BREAK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxgBRVt9dHU))
>> ARTICLE
Best OP: **Kimi ja Nakya Dame Mitai** (GSNK) There were a ton of good OPs this year but this one is just bursting with energy and creativity. It really portrays the mood and atmosphere of the show well.

Best ED: **Dareka Umiwo** (Zankyou no Terror) I think the quality of this song is a major part of why I was so disappointed with ZnT. It's haunting, the visual metaphors are really well done, and Aimer's vocals are god-tier.

Best Comedy: **Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** As /r/anime is sick to death of hearing, this show was just fantastic. The fact that a completely irrelevant character from a single scene is on the best guy list speaks volumes for how memorable this show is. Even mention Tomoda and someone, somewhere, will respond with TOMODAAAAA!! guaranteed. He doesn't even have more than one drawing.

Best Slice of Life: **Barakamon** This show is just so touching and happy I flit back and forth between smiles and tears, sometimes both.

Best Harem: **Nisekoi** Shaft really did an amazing adaptation with this. Complain all you want about plot progression, this anime *satisfies* visually and comedically. The VAs are all amazing and fit their characters perfectly. Monogatari is definitely going to win, but whenever Nisekoi comes up, it always devolves into a best-girl argument. *That* is what a harem comedy is all about.

Best Thriller: **Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** This show took a little while to get going, but when it did, holy shit. You really feel the repercussions of the debatable actions Shinichi takes. The last episode, my jaw was dropped basically the whole time. It's suspenseful, violent, and tense.

I don't really have input on sports anime, but Ping Pong will definitely win.

Best Sci-Fi: *Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** again.

Best Action: **Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis** This was just unlike anything I've seen. It just oozes cool. When the MC uses a shortsword and *revolver-crossbow* you know you're in for a treat. Every character was great, I especially liked how Kaisar was handled.

Best Male Character: **TOMODAAAAA**

I'm about to go full hype mode, so you should all prepare yourselves for such ridiculous amounts of hype that you re-watch an entire series just to control it.

**Time to get hyped**

Do you anticipate BOOSTO the most? NO YOU SAY? Let me tell you why you should.

Issei has a fucking dragon hand. **DRAGON. ON HIS HAND.** Do you even realize how fucking awesome that is? It fucking talks and everything.

Issei powers up using tits. He is our lord and savior. None of this onii-sama bullshit, he kicks ass using the ecchi we all know and love. There is nothing more heroic than fighting for the tits of your loved ones.

"B-b-but it's just a typical harem romcom, it's gonna be shit!"

**FUCK NO IT AIN'T**

DxD has a world that constantly develops and grows. The three factions of Fallen Angels, Devils, and Angels have a unique power dynamic and internal struggles, and the world itself is arguably just as interesting as the tits. Further the story just gets better as it goes on, because with each new novel the stakes become higher and the antagonists are fleshed out and become a real threat. Vali, one of the main antagonists, actually has a goal he's fighting for, and you learn a lot more about him.

"B-b-but, the characters are shit!"

**FUCK NO THEY AREN'T**

Each of the characters get development that fleshes them out further and helps us empathize with their personalities and motivations. Also we got the arc of the male best friend 2nd. You know how ballsy it is to put the male bestie in line for character building before the harem? Really fucking ballsy. G fucking G DxD. Bonus points to the fact that the Koneko arc is next. That's right, fucking Koneko characterization time bitches.

"B-b-but I hate Koneko, how else can I get hype for this?"

You remember the ratings games? That's right, they're not dead yet. We've got bigger and better shit coming for this. **The Dress Break train has no brakes mate.**

"B-b-but Issei is such a fucking wanker, regardless of the dragon hand. I mean he had to basically hack his Sacred Gear that one time!"

**DO YOU LIKE TRAINING?**

**DO YOU LIKE BOOSTO?**

**DO YOU LIKE [spoilers](/s "FUCKING DRAGONS? PREPARE YOURSELF FOR FUCKING DRAGON TRAINING. THAT'S RIGHT. DRAGONS TRAINING DRAGONS AND YELLING BOOSTO.")**

"Wow, that sound fantastic! Why the fuck wasn't I hyped for this before?"

Because you were a lost little lamb, but I'm here to show you the way.

Follow me to oppai and character development. Follow me to Highschool DxD BorN.

Repent for your sin of lacking hype by voting for BorN.

I would assume so. There's also the possibility of a shafty filler episode which could actually be good since (from what I've heard) the manga seems like filler itself.

Actually rest of the list are also full of my anticipation but these 2 are probably the ones worth skipping my dinner for.

Did the same. But to be honest, I even preferred the first part of the manga too. I need Touka.

**My picks: Most anticipated anime of 2015**

This one is tough, because you never know what's going to be good and what's not. These are all great choices in my opinion, but these two stand out to me:

**Ninja Slayer From Animation** - The trailer looks like a lot of fun, and the fact that Trigger is doing it just makes me happy, this could be great. Although after this and LWA2, I hope they do an original series again, Kill la Kill was great.

**Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka (Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?)** - The premise sounds good and based on the Key Visual, the art seems good too (although that could just be from the poster). The premise seems like it could go either way though, from great to bad.

And here's my runner up:

**Psycho-Pass Movie** - The fact that they got Urobuchi back on board for this makes me think that it will be amazing, and also that it will have a solid conclusion. [Psycho-Pass and Psycho-Pass 2 spoilers](/s "The return of Kogami also makes me happy, P-P2 was good, but it wasn't the same without him. Pretty happy with that.")

Pyscho Pass movie is gonna be the best thing ever!

My most anticipated series isn't even on this list, pretty hyped for Charlotte, P.A. Works with Jun Maeda again...should be amazing.

I was surprised it didn't get many votes. Probably because it's an original 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how Aldnoah.Zero S2 doesn't win this one.  The /r/fuckslaine bandwagon alone causes the S2 to be the most anticipated 2015 show.

Beyond that, I've never seen Heaven's Feel, so that will be new and I'm keenly interested in it (unlike UBW which had the movie release).

Then there's DxD BorN, which is a must-watch.

Nature of the beast...

I'd personally like to see 2002 and 2003 replace 2012 and 2013, but I'm squarely in the minority.
>> ARTICLE
I agree on 2013, but I actualy really like 2012. Shinsekai yori and Psycho Pass are some of the greatest scifis in the past 10 years, and Kokoro Connect and Sakurasou are amazing SoL's/Drama/Romance. Not to mention the monogatari hype, even though Nise is probably the weakest instalment (I don't count Neko). There's also sao, which isn't great but it actually did a lot for anime, in my opinion, considering how many people started watching anime with sao. This got a bit long, but I really like 2012's lineup, something for everyone there. (Haven't seen F/Z so I can't comment, but I'm pretty sure the consensus is that it's amazing)

may i ask why 2002 ? i just checked all the anime relased that year, seems rather weak except for "full metal panic" and "ghost in the shell"

personally i'd watch the 2013 roster over the 2002 any day
>> ARTICLE
I'm speaking my own biases here, but I think I also speak on behalf of fans of older shows too that the 2002 roster trounces the 2013 roster all day every day, and probably the main reason 2013's up there is recency bias. Let's examine some shows now.

[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex](http://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex): One of several shows that trounce every show in 2013 by a long shot. This would have been the equivalent of the Attack of Titan back in then because it was far reaching to western audiences. 

[Princess Tutu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/721/Princess_Tutu): It's kind of sad how people consider Madoka a proper deconstruction when it really isn't. Truly proper deconstructions should ideally work with the assumption that the viewer has little to no familiarity of what the genre has to offer. Madoka jumps in with the assumption that we all know how the magical girl gig goes, but Princess Tutu handles it differently with how fairy tales are supposed to go. It approaches the story with a level of elegance few "deconstructions" ever show, and a deft hand with storytelling to deconstruct its genre while maintaining its intrigue. 

[Haibane Renmei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei): This is my favorite of 2002 and I'm pretty sure it's a bunch of other people's favorites of the year too. As I've heard another reviewer put it (I've forgotten who it was), Haibane Renmei is one of the most unique slice of life anime in that it can balance the line between the lighthearted nature of slice of life without losing its presence as a metaphorical narrative of exploring its more serious themes, especially that of self-discovery. It's really hard to put into words why this show has connected with me at such an emotional level, but I can say that nothing in 2013 comes remotely close to matching the quality of Haibane Renmei. 

[Azumanga Daioh](http://myanimelist.net/anime/66/Azumanga_Daioh) is one of the pioneering anime of contemporary slice of life, and not only does it hold this influence, it's actually pretty darn entertaining to watch. Compared to things you've seen in the past 3 years, Azumanga Daioh is tame in its portrayal of "cute girls doing cute things" and is mostly funny because the content is funny. Also Kiyohiko Azuma is a genius and it's got this [awesome opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBU5EUoW6q0).

The rest that I'll list are ones I've heard very good things about but have not had the time to watch them because they're very long and I don't have enough time in my life to watch that much (although I do have enough to type up this long, spontaneous comment since you were curious ;) )

[The Twelve Kingdoms](http://myanimelist.net/anime/153/Juuni_Kokuki) are what some people have called the epitome of high-fantasy drama. It builds up a detailed world and carries a scale impressive enough to match its 45 episodes. Shows like these are classics among anime, and hardly something that should just simply be ignored.

You mentioned Full Metal Panic yourself already, so let's also mention something with a lot of good rep: [Full Moon wo Sagashite](http://myanimelist.net/anime/122/Full_Moon_wo_Sagashite). Like some of the classics of this genre, it's not only popular, but from what I've heard, it's pretty damn good. 

Other notable titles include Makoto Shinkai's debut short [Voices of a Distant Star](http://myanimelist.net/anime/256/Hoshi_no_Koe), [RahXephon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/165/RahXephon), and probably some others I missed.

Oh ya, I forgot, an OVA for [Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/976/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kikou:_Quiet_Country_Cafe). If you don't know what it is, within the niche slice of life community, Yokohama's reputation rivals that of Aria as the pinnacle of slice of life. 

If you've read this far, bravo. My point in providing you with this response it to tell you that although it might seem at a glance that the more recent shows are "better", it's better to probably to do a bit of snooping around to see if 2002 really has nothing to offer and is thus a weak year. It doesn't really take more than 10 mins of your day to look at some of the big titles that year and see how they've been received in the community to get rid of the assumption of, taking a page out of Daniel Kahneman's book *Thinking: Fast and Slow*, WYSIATI (What you see is all that is).

Finally, please do keep in mind recency bias. Although these shows do seem relevant now, come back in 5 years. Looking at 2002, it has over half a dozen titles that are still remembered as classics among the anime community that takes the time to watch shows older than 5 years old. This in itself signifies an amazing year. Looking back at 2013, I can really only see Attack on Titan and Kill La Kill making notable impacts, with the second season of monogatari (since it's always difficult to remember 2nd season years) and SNAFU possibly being minor talking points brought up every once in a while 5 years from now.

Hope this helped!

>> ARTICLE
Me too, actually. 2013's squad is so weak compared to its seeding. 

But the people have spoken, haha. I'm excited for the tourney. :)
>> ARTICLE
I actually like a lot of the stuff from 2013... but yeah, the team is really weak in comparison to a lot of the other things. However much I like Attack on Titan it will probably never get my vote in terms of the other first shows and the same is true for most of the other levels as well.
>> ARTICLE
2013 seems a bit top-heavy. Attack on Titan and Kill la Kill are both incredibly strong competitors and Monogatari "Second" Season is big on this sub. Oregairu and Maou seem like a really weak 6 and 7 though.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari SS is just big in general. It was the 2nd best seller in 2013, after AoT. I'd actually say this sub actually has a small bias against Monogatari.
>> ARTICLE
Where are you getting this sales figure? Is it for the American market or the Japanese one? It makes a difference, as English and Japanese speaking anime fandoms are very different. I'm a little out of touch with the greater pulse of the English-speaking anime fandom, so I may be underestimating it. At AX this year I saw a million KLK cosplayers, a sizable number of AOT cosplayers, and virtually no Monogatari cosplayers, so I was judging overall popularity on that.
>> ARTICLE
http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1vfiyo/2013_tv_anime_sales_rankings_update_nonbiyori/

I think this is global, but it's probably heavily heavily skewed toward Japan if it is, as the Japanese tend to be muchmore spendy on BD/DVDs.

I probably also think that the cosplaying community is probably different from the rest of the community. Monogatari really have character designs that tickle the cosplaying fancy either (IMO anyway).
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, Monogatari has a pretty distinctive and colorful school uniform, especially when compared to how bland a KLK Mako costume is, and Mako was pretty common at AX. Those numbers are also from before KLK had finished airing, so there might be a bias there too, and it's not clear (at least in the linked parent post) where those numbers come from and what audience(s) they represent. 

Monogatari is definitely a lucrative franchise for Shaft, but I've kind of got the impression that it's bigger in Japan and on here than it is in the larger English-speaking anime community. Not to say that it's small in the fandom as a whole, but that it's not necessarily a *huge* force like it would be in this community. As I've said though, I may not be the most informed person for this kind of judgement.
>> ARTICLE
Mako defies all logic. 

> huge force like it would be in this community

Somebody missed the note banning Kaiki from the best girl contest. But really, Monogatari just doesn't really have that HYPE train that everybody bandwagons on, so it's mostly just *there*, instead of being in your face all the time.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone who's watched it seems to love Maou, though, so it might be stronger than you'd expect.  I think it beats all its lower-seeded six spots.  Hell I haven't even seen it but I'd vote for it over Haruhi and Index.
>> ARTICLE
Maou-sama i spretty good, but over Haruhi and Index? Are you nuts?

Also it can't possibly win against big game like Mirai Nikki.

EDIT: Now that I realise it this contest is pointless... is there any doubt that 2011 will win on this sub?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not a K-On! fan, but I know that it does have a fairly strong following.

Haruhi will probably lose because people are still suffering sodium OD after endless eights.
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty mediocre tbh. It succeeds as a comedy at the start, but quickly just becomes a romance slice-of-life.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually out of everything in the 2013 lineup, the only thing I like more than Maou is LH. It was a lot of fun and I really hope they make more.
>> ARTICLE
Maou, so good. so good
>> ARTICLE
My teams for the years that didn't make it:

2001: Spirited Away, Millennium Actress, Princess Arete, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, Read or Die, Metropolis, Lupin III: Alcatraz Connection - I've seen almost no anime from this year...

2002: 12 Kingdoms, Princess Tutu, GitS: SAC, Haibane Renmei, Macross Zero, Azumanga Daioh, RahXephon - Great year! Deserved to make the tournament.

2003: Planetes, Kino's Journey, Last Exile, Gunslinger Girl, Tokyo Godfathers, Scrapped Princess, Full Metal Alchemist - My favorite year that didn't get included.

2004: Fantastic Children, GitS: SACII, Aishiteruze Baby, Samurai Champloo, Howl's Moving Castle, Paranoia Agent, Mind Game - None of top favorites come from this year. Kind of forgetable.

2005: Mushishi, Kamichu!, Aria the Animation, Noein, Pani Poni Dash, Honey and Clover, Mahou Sensei Negima!

This made me realize I need to watch more things from 2001. My list is literally all movies. Must have been a slow year for series.
>> ARTICLE
I really think 2003 deserved to be on there as well, though 2002 and 2004 were both great too. 

2001 doesn't impress me much and it doesn't seem to impress anyone else either; I think digital animation was still working itself out. 2005 had a few awesome things, but 2006 was rightly more impressive overall.
>> ARTICLE
2002 and 2003 are definitely top tier for me. Planetes and RahXephon are both some of my favorite shows. Azumanga Daioh is great too; a better version of all these cutesy high school girls doing cute things shows nowadays. I'm sure if more people on this sub watched Azumanga Daioh they would love it. It seems to fit the general tastes of this sub pretty damn well.  Most of those shows are fairly obscure however. At least to today's crowd.
>> ARTICLE
> Azumanga Daioh is great too; a better version of all these cutesy high school girls doing cute things shows nowadays. I'm sure if more people on this sub watched Azumanga Daioh they would love it.

I watched it (and read the entirety of the manga) and personally I'd say the manga is far superior. If I was choosing to recommend it, I'd recommend the manga. The pacing of the show is just a bit odd, and some episodes felt like the extended 3 panels of the manga to an entire episode. Maybe I'm not really the kind of person for the show, but I loved the source material so I'm not even sure about that. I enjoyed it, but I don't really get why people have so much love for it. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess my personal feeling is that it seems very similar to some of these generic school life comedies. And most of them do a really bad job in recent times at least from what I've seen.

I had an "anime to nominate" google doc ready for all the years. This isn't necessarily a team of 7 for each year, but here's what I had prepared for the years that didn't make it:

2001: [Spirited Away](http://myanimelist.net/anime/199/Sen_to_Chihiro_no_Kamikakushi), [Millennium Actress](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1033/Sennen_Joyuu), [Jungle wa Itsumo Hare Nochi Guu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/253/Jungle_wa_Itsumo_Hare_nochi_Guu),  [Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven's Door](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5/Cowboy_Bebop:_Tengoku_no_Tobira), 
[Hellsing](http://myanimelist.net/anime/270/Hellsing), and [R.O.D. Read or Die (OVA)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/208/R.O.D_OVA)


2002: [She and Her Cat](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1004/Kanojo_to_Kanojo_no_Neko), [Haibane Renmei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei), [The Cat Returns](http://myanimelist.net/anime/597/Neko_no_Ongaeshi), [Voices of a Distant Star](http://myanimelist.net/anime/256/Hoshi_no_Koe), and [Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/306/Abenobashi_Mahou_Shoutengai)

2003: [Tokyo Godfathers](http://myanimelist.net/anime/759/Tokyo_Godfathers), [Cromartie High](http://myanimelist.net/anime/114/Sakigake!!_Cromartie_Koukou), [Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem](http://myanimelist.net/anime/731/Interstella5555:_The_5tory_of_The_5ecret_5tar_5ystem), [Gungrave](http://myanimelist.net/anime/267/Gungrave), [Diary of Tortov Roddle ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1205/Aru_Tabibito_no_Nikki), and [The Animatrix](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1303/The_Animatrix)

2004: [Paranoia Agent](http://myanimelist.net/anime/323/Mousou_Dairinin), [Mind Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/875/Mind_Game), [The Place Promised in Our Early Days](http://myanimelist.net/anime/433/Kumo_no_Mukou_Yakusoku_no_Basho), [Genshiken](http://myanimelist.net/anime/240/Genshiken), [Samurai Champloo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/205/Samurai_Champloo), [Yakitate!! Japan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28/Yakitate!!_Japan), [School Rumble](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24/School_Rumble), [Elfen Lied](http://myanimelist.net/anime/226/Elfen_Lied), and [Howl's Moving Castle](http://myanimelist.net/anime/431/Howl_no_Ugoku_Shiro). I was also going to try and sneak in as one entry the music video trilogy that is [Portable Airport](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3821/Portable_Kuukou), [Space Station No. 9](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3820/Space_Station_No._9), and [Soratobu Toshi Keikaku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3818/Soratobu_Toshi_Keikaku) but I wasn't sure if you would accept that (not that it would have any chance of making it past nominations into voting). As you can see, this year had the most on my list, and with Paranoia Agent being my favorite TV anime and Mind Game being my favorite non-Miyazaki non-Kon anime movie (it gives Miyazaki and Kon a run for their money, but it'd be hard to bring myself to say I like it more than Porco Rosso or Paprika) this is absolutely a strong year in my book.

2005: [Honey and Clover](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16/Hachimitsu_to_Clover), [Paradise Kiss](http://myanimelist.net/anime/322/Paradise_Kiss), and [Dore Dore no Uta](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4158/Dore_Dore_no_Uta) (if music videos were to count)
>> ARTICLE
I probably would have killed the short music videos if by some miracle they made the top 15 nominations. It's funny how close our 2001 lists were. Some interesting choices for 2002. I enjoyed Abenobashi until the last episode, which then preceded to ruin the whole show for me. Cat Returns is probably my least favorite Ghibli show besides Ocean Waves. I'm guessing you're a big Daft Punk fan with that Interstella nomination, huh?
>> ARTICLE
Abenobashi was a show that I loved to death in High School but which I suspect I would dislike if I were to rewatch now even though I would probably get more of the jokes. The end was a major tonal shift that was internally inconsistent with the rules and message of the show, but I really liked it back then. I would probably be nominating it more for nostalgia than anything else.

The Cat Returns is my second favorite Ghibli movie that was not directed by Miyazaki after Pom Poko. It's sacrilege to say this, but Grave of the Fireflies is by far my least favorite Ghibli, and in my overall bottom 5 movies I've ever seen, not just anime. 

It's funny, I love Discovery and I've enjoyed all Daft Punk's big singles, but I've never really felt the urge to expand my Daft Punk listening beyond that. I wouldn't call myself a big Daft Punk fan overall, but it's fair to say that I am a big fan of that album.

edit: for the record, /u/PixelPenguins, I've noticed in the course of this thing so far that your favorites tend to be shows I've always suspected would be up my alley but which I've never gotten around to watching. Kinda funny.
>> ARTICLE
2001 had Hellsing? Didn't realize it was quite that old now. Still that year could probably be 4th or 5th for me just by virtue of Hellsing and Spirited away. 2004 is really stacked too. Genshiken, School Rumble, and Elfen Lied(not a favorite but it was my first show)? School Rumble stands to this day to be my favorite high school anime by miles. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, original TV Hellsing was 2001. It's fallen out of favor with the Hellsing Ultimate OVA which is pretty much universally considered better, unlike original FMA which still has a lot of staunch supporters. I still thought it was worthy of a mention, as I thought it was pretty strong in its own right. 
>> ARTICLE
I much prefer the original Hellsing but I'm well aware that I'm the minority for that. I adore the original series dub and prefer the way they did a bunch of the characters. OG Seras Victoria had such a fantastic british accent T_T. Also really disliked most of the comedic elements of Ultimate. Ruined the bad ass vibe of the whole thing which is really what Hellsing was all about for me.  Not to mention the whole ending of ultimate makes little to no sense.

No Eureka Seven in 2005? This seems unforgivable.

i love how everyone forgets Monster exists, even though its considered a  classic. why isn't it on anyone's lists???
>> ARTICLE
I love Monster as a manga. The show is incredibly faithful to the manga, but to me it still felt like something was lost in the transition. I felt like the pacing was thrown out of whack and the show end up a little too slow. Also, the visuals felt a little stiff and had less of an emotional impact. Overall it's still fairly good, but I gave it up partway in and decided to reread the manga instead.
>> ARTICLE
i guess it's because you read it before, but I'm going through it for my first time, and i am on the edge of my seat even for the most mundane moments. The pacing is slow, but i feel as if every moment is extremely significant no matter how boring it seems at the time. Its really up there with Hannibal, Breaking Bad, and Fargo in terms of story telling. I really hope they go through with making it a live action show.

2001....that year almost feels like ancient history....only read or die and spirited away sound remotely familiar

It's probably going to be my favourite year in the contest anyway - those top three are some are of my few 10s on MAL - but damn, if Usagi Drop and Chihayafuru had gotten through it would've beaten every other year with ease for me.

I'm not surprised for the most part by what got through, but I at least thought that those two I mentioned would've been above Nichijou. I see them mentioned everywhere and pretty much universally praised, while Nichijou only seemed fairly niche for a KyoAni show and got a mixed reception. Is there just a big difference of opinions between /r/anime and other fans, or has the popularity of these shows suddenly changed at some point in the last few years?

No Chihayafuru is a real shame. That first season was incredible.

Yeah, I thought that this was a contest that had already been decided, 1998 is impossible to beat!
>> ARTICLE
This board is skewed heavily toward newer anime, so I didn't think there'd be any interest in the 90's. Even I would have trouble listing 7 good anime from each year of the 90's, and the list of anime I've watched is much longer than most users here.

Someone could hold a 90's version of this contest if they thought the interest was there.
>> ARTICLE
We messed up because we didn't vote for a year that we couldn't even vote for?

This contest is only for 2001-2013.
>> ARTICLE
And to OP:
Yeah, because the 90's would've rocked most of these anime; it wouldn't be a fair contest.
>> ARTICLE
I counter with Urobutcher.
>> ARTICLE
One series every once in awhile.. while Urobuchi is great, not enough to topple the 80's/90's.
>> ARTICLE
2011: Madoka
2011: F/Z
2012: Psycho Pass

That's fairly consistent. I know a lot of people didn't like Gargantua (I liked it), and A/Z is... eh.

From the 90s, going through wikipedia's list the only stand outs are:

Ghost in the Shell movie

Utena

NGE

Serial Experiments Lain

Cowboy Bebop 

That's from an entire decade. Like that barely trumps 2011's lineup in my book (except maybe AnoHana).

Plus anything from this decade has an unfair half point advantage (on a purely imaginary 10 point scale, every series I've listed basically is undefined/10) on digital animation quality for me. 
>> ARTICLE
> every once in awhile

I meant that because it was every year or two, although he apparently hasn't really stuck with projects often lately.  Meh, I'll give it to you, he has been consistent the past 3 years.

Clearly you weren't around during the 90's... there were a LOT more series than that that trump a lot of current anime... even 2011. And if you really judge a show based on the quality of animation/graphics, you have some minor judgment issues.  The characters and stories back then tend to be significantly better than the current ones.  While some are good, a lot are... not... even close.

Granted upon further research, my nostalgia stretches more around the mid-late 90's to the very early 2000's.
>> ARTICLE
>Clearly you weren't around during the 90's... there were a LOT more series than that that trump a lot of current anime

Like I need some names. We'll go with 1995, probably the strongest in my book, notable series:
Evangelion, Gundam Wing, Sailor Moon... and nothing.

Like those are some pretty good shows, but literally everything else from that year I wouldn't really watch.

> And if you really judge a show based on the quality of animation/graphics, you have some minor judgment issues.

It's a part of the show, and technical execution is still part of art. I can't help if I prefer the crisper aesthetic of digital animation. They also weren't as experimentive with art style back then either IMO, look at something like Madoka. Aesthetics are important to me, it's part why I watch animation as opposed to live action shows.

> The characters and stories back then tend to be significantly better than the current ones. While some are good, a lot are... not... even close.

You are aware the 90s had its fair share of shovel shows? We're comparing the best of the best. (Although I disagree with reddit's taste on some shows). Like a lot of current shows also have  strong writing.

Early 2000s had some pretty good stuff, are you lumping those in?
>> ARTICLE
I can understand how animation is important to anime, and creative animation is great, but putting a large emphasis on it seems silly.  For me, it's like saying a game is bad or good depending on how good the graphics are.

But to each their own there.  Plus, on review of your comment, actually your grading on the animation is reasonable.  I apologize for misunderstanding what you intended.

Yeah I am aware of the amount of shovel shows.  Which is why I put "my nostalgia" because I recognize that a lot of this is because of rose-tinted glasses.  Which is analogous to the extra-hype that follows more recent series.

I do agree that a lot of /current/ shows have strong writing.  However, considering shows like SAO which have HORRIBLE story-telling, etc, and are incredibly popular, it's hard to really go "yeah, the current shows are so much better or on par."

Even Madoka, while being interesting, kind of bore me the first few episodes.  I'd probably enjoy the mid->end parts but the beginning is boring.  The most interesting was when the yellow chick died.  The main character is really annoying though, and not even in a good way.  She has a wish... why not wish for her new friend to be alive again?  Jesus...

But this is all largely preference and probably largely based on age.  I think the current years are being a little over-hyped to be honest but that's how it usually works.

And yeah, I was lumping the years around 2000 around, I didn't realize that they were started closer to the millennium.  My memory is a little off it seems.  So again, my judgment is not as valid anyway (which I mentioned in my previous comment).  So let's end this debate with "it is what it is; people's preferences are just different?" 
>> ARTICLE
Also we've had shit shounen shows forever, SAO isn't exactly the first of its kind.

With regards to Madoka, Homura was always stopping her from making the wish in the current timeline. If she failed, then that wouldn't be the timeline of that the viewer would follow.
>> ARTICLE
Sure, there's a lot of preference. I do think increased number of shows in recent years might lead to more shows that I think are good. Like we get as many shows in a season as the 90s did in a year, so it's a little unfair to ye olde times.

I guarantee you that many people will skew their ratings to that their favorite show's year will win. Regardless, what if I like other shows from, say, 2007?

If we vote we'll be able to vote for a many or as few of the match-ups as possible, right?  I'd feel bad voting against a show I hadn't seen.

No, The (2011) is a remake, it starts from the 1st chapter of the manga. I've seen more than 400 anime to date. 
HxH is in my top 5. Its really good & quite unique. For ex, it has changing arc themes: video game arc, revenge arc, battle arena arc, training arc, monster arc, politics arc, etc so things never get boring. 
That's not something you see often in other anime. Well worth the watch. =)

That explains it, thats fucking stupid. You just get hundreds of biased users to vote on it, and absolutely destroy the point of the poll. Its for /r/anime users not /r/hunterxhunter users, though if they also used /r/anime there wouldnt be a problem. If I decided to post this to /r/fatestaynight that would be just as unfair, or if i posted it to /r/killlakill or /r/Parasyte

Implying most of /r/hunterxhunter, /r/fatestaynight and /r/killlakill users aren't already /r/anime users.

I don't get why this was downvoted, because this is actually true. Only a fairly small percentage of the regulars in /r/hunterxhunter are also regulars in /r/anime, and I assume it's very much the same for /r/fatestaynight, /r/killlakill, /r/typemoon and /r/stardustcrusaders.
>> ARTICLE
Uhh...how do you know that?
>> ARTICLE
Because I'm lurking a lot on /r/hunterxhunter and usually look through the posts that users made who post there frequently, since I'm curious where else they post. You never know what kind of interesting subreddit you might find that way, really.
>> ARTICLE
I don't see the problem here, I actually dislike how people treat those guys from /r/hxh or whatever as inferiors or unable to vote. If they are users of that subreddit, it implies that they classify of HxH as their best/one of their best anime adaptations. I don't see the problem in their participations, the some goes with an eventual involvement of any subreddit users as long as they have a decent knowledge of different animes.

It would make sense if a poor anime wins the poll just because "it comes from a certain franchise" (Imagine Evangelion OAVs, it may be an insta-win here), however it's not the case here since HxH (2011) with its [](/s "Chimera Ants arc") is a decent, if not amazing work.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with that though is that it gives a significant advantage to the anime in this poll that have their own sub, turning the poll into even more of a popularity contest.

you may be true here, i can't imagine what would happen if naruto's and OP's subreddits hijack the best guy contest.

Good point.
>> ARTICLE
I'll copy my post from the previous thread!

As much as I want to give my best of 2014 vote to Ping Pong, since Hunter x Hunter this year included Episodes 111-148 I have to give it my vote. Episodes 116, 126, 131, 135, and 148 are some of the best episodes of anime I've ever seen and Hunter x Hunter just blew me away. 
>> ARTICLE
So 5 episodes in 37 were notable. That doesn't seem like a very good ratio when there was also Ping Pong (and Mushishi, honestly how did it not make it to this poll?) and other consistently solid anime last year. Even if those 5 episodes were the 5 best you've ever seen, is it fair to gloss over the rest of the anime? Seasonal anime don't have the luxury of 6+ build-up episodes for every important event that happens.
>> ARTICLE
>So 5 episodes in 37 were notable.

Have you watched HxH? He means 5 eps in 37 were transcendental of all that is pure in this universe. The remaining 32 episodes were "Notable", though that's depending on your stance regarding the use of narration and pacing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently watching but not at ant arc yet. I'm sure it's following the manga perfectly but it seems to take too long explaining and building things up. I can only imagine that's how the last two arcs do things as well.
>> ARTICLE
Every episode I mentioned is from the Ant Arc, we'll have to talk about it after you get there.
>> ARTICLE
If you're at the York New City arc and feel that way, then I think you might just not really be a fan of the show's process of narrative buildup. Which is okay, it has other elements that you can enjoy, but I doubt your opinion on that note will change much unless you're still in the Heaven's Arena arc or earlier.

No, it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to figure that out. I'm not sure what that guy was thinking.

This is what happens when you take out Shirou's important thoughts and the viewer misses things about characters.

>Although the setting is interesting, it's not explained very well, and the world building is weak. The show relies to much on exposition and lazy info-dumps, which for the first episodes were unbearable.

Yep they should have left major things that needed to be explained left out.  There were still two important things in the first episode alone that they left out. (that will be in the BD)  Nasu is known for his world building, if you want world building read the VN.

>The pacing is bad, and it feels like there's no real progress in the show. Each episode is pretty similar, with Shirou/Rin talking, some flashy fight occurs, nothing of consequence happens, everyone goes home.

It's a VN, the pace is fine in a VN but can be bad in an anime when you can't binge every episode in 48 hours.  It might be better to not watch VN adaptations week to week because it's really not going to change much.

>The story is weak, and the show feels inconsistent in tone. There's supposed to be this dramatic Grail war going on, but at times the show feels like a romance/SOL, with a lot of boring dialogue between even more boring characters.

It sounds like you don't even know the story or where it's going, and you really shouldn't know where it's going at this point.  The romance/SOL is used to build character relationships.  There is a reason characters do things.  Do you think the date was pointless?  Nearly everyone that complains about the date completely misses the point of it.

>The characters are extremely bland and one-dimensional Rin is basically a tsundere, Saber has almost no character at all, Shirou I'm told gets better in the next cour, but so far he seems like a very generic shounen protagonist with ridiculous amounts of plot armor. Archer is pretty decent and carries the show, but the side characters are so bland they are almost nonexistent. There's just a real lack of depth to the characters.

She is Tsundere go to tvtropes and type Tsundere.  There's a reason for her to be that way though.  She struggles to not show her human side to other people.  She acts like the cold perfect magus for most of her life.  Now Shirou is starting to open her human side up.  Plot armor?  You should know what he has if you've watched Zero and if it's plot armor for him it is for Iri and Kerry too.  There are three routes some things are unexplained in one but you could get a hint about something and connect it to another route.  The side characters aren't supposed to get a lot of depth.  This is a story about Shirou and his ideals period.  Fate/Hollow Ataraxia is a fan disc that goes into the other characters and some of the characters that are 'unlikable' become fan favorites.

>They fight a lot in the series, but none of the fights carry any tension whatsoever. One reason is because of the insane amount of plot armor for Shirou, but also because of how little the characters seem to care about the war. There's been a lot of chances for people to kill servants/masters, but they don't seem to care at all. Why even bother joining the war if you're not gonna use your chances? On that note, I feel the Fate-series benefit greatly from having adult characters like in Fate/Zero, and not the stereotypical high school teenagers.

I'd love to know about all this plot armor, if anything UBW is the route he relies the least on the one major 'plot armor' he has.  The same thing happens in Zero.  There where chances to kill master's/servants that are taken, if you're going to criticize one lets be sure to do the same thing to the other.  Personally I prefer the 'stereotypical' high schoolers over the man-children we find in Zero.  You're just expecting Fate/Zero 2 when that was never going to be the case.

>A lot of people say that you have to read the VN to understand a lot of things, which is a flaw in the adaption. A lot of things go unexplained, and people say you just have to read a 60 hour VN to get it. If it can't stand on it's own it's a flaw in my eyes.

You don't need the VN to understand some of the things you've missed.   There are only a few 'major' things that could go unexplained in this route, but there is still time to reveal them.  This adaptation is not spoonfeeding you information like the VN will so people have to actually piece stuff together.  The adaptation does benefit by having read Fate beforehand though because some of the required foreshadowing for certain events would not be needed.  The anime chose to explain some things after the fact just like Zero did with origin bullets and Kerry's stuff.


>> ARTICLE
I can't say I agree with judging individual parts of a show that happens to air within two different years because then we have to consider a situation in which both parts of the show win both years. That wouldn't be fair because no anime deserves to win multiple "Anime of the Year" awards. However, I can see why you would choose to do so if we were talking about different seasons rather than different segments of a season.

It's strange to see you rate Parasyte a 3.5/5 yet you wouldn't mind if it wins anime of the year. Was 2014 a fairly weak year of anime to you?



Parasyte:
1. I try my best to avoid using "realistic" as a pro when it comes to describing a character's development or overall characterization because there are so many factors that can determine and explain a person's actions, whether they are reasonable or questionable. Besides, it is overused and usually never explained by people. Personally, I think Shinichi, Migi, and Reiko are the only good "realistic, well-developed characters" in Parasyte. [Character Spoilers for the anime so far:](/s "It was interesting to witness Shinichi transform from a regular High School student to a cold-hearted character who resembles closely to the parasites. On the contrary, Migi and Reiko become more 'human like' as the series progresses. Of the three, Reiko would probably be my favorite character in the series because Shinichi's transformation is the only thing interesting about him (he's more like a test subject in an experiment than a character I should be caring about) and Migi primarily exists to contribute to Shinichi's development and explain the bodily functions and mindset of parasites. Even so, Reiko's character conclusion could have been better. I can see why she changes her face to look like Shinichi's mother but it would have been better if Reiko reserved her original form and gave the baby to Shinichi."). The dialogue in Parasyte is pretty standard when it comes to narratives found in anime but it can be quite annoying to listen and read at times because of what people are saying (example: "Are you really Izumi" x 5, "my shining white knight" (or something along those lines from Kana)). Reiko's lines are the most engaging to read and listen to since she is a fairly unique parasyte who likes to remain observant and practical among her group of parasites.

2. Madhouse did a great job showcasing Parasyte in a modern style because much of the issues and overarching themes found in the anime (and manga) series are absolutely relevant today. The story is very promising as well and it has a lot of potential to engage anime watchers into a horror-like anime with prevalent social and moral issues. It's too bad that Parasyte's presentation is lacking in polish and this can be easily noticed when you recognize the declining animation quality and mediocre shots of animated scenes. Consider this, the opening scene for the first episode of Parasyte reveals the parasites as monsters that can morph into disfigured and horrifying abominations (the parasite that ate the lady's head and the dog-parasite thing). Now, the animation quality of parasites morphing into combat forms or anything else is only decent and the show slowly loses its body-horror elements (Reiko splitting her head into two in front of a couple). While Parasyte may not try to be a body-horror anime, it could have been one and it would mix really well with the themes it has going with it (monsters being humans and humans being monsters).

3. As you can tell, I am fairly disappointed with Parasyte. Now don't get the wrong idea, it is a good show and I look forward to watching it every week. However, Madhouse had the rights to animate a manga series with a lot of potential yet they still haven't properly animate and reveal Parasyte as a meaningful anime series.



Fate/Stay Night:
1. I personally thought an appropriate amount of information was given to the main character during scenes of exposition (when it comes to anime as a medium). The biggest example of exposition and "info-dumping" I can think of is in episode 2 where Kirei explains the Holy Grail War to Shirou. Although I am fully aware of and understand the circumstances and rules of the War from Fate/Zero and other Fate works, it is understandable for Kirei to "dump" this information to Shirou because he knows absolutely nothing about it. This is "realistic." And much of the exposition and info-dumping people recognize is nothing more than dialogue between two or more characters. This is pretty standard in most action anime but it is somewhat more prominent in Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay night (Big 3, Noragami, Gurren Lagann, etc.)

2. You may have to elaborate more on why you think pacing is bad. I can't fully comment on that. I have to disagree with you on progress and consequence in the series so far. [As of now](/s "Rider is dead, Saber is a slave to Caster, Shirou's survivor guilt colors his character even further, etc."). You can use the same argument of similarity with Parasyte in such a broad manner ([in Parasyte](/s "Shinichi meets parasite (Migi), fight happens (dog and parasite who cuts his own arm. Shinichi meets parasite (Reiko), fight happens ('A' or 'B' or whatever letter). Shinichi meets parasite (mom), fight happens (mom). Shinichi meets parasite (guy who later gets his face burned), fight happens")). You're oversimplifying the set-up of an anime series when you can do the same thing with most anime series. Most of these common set-ups (this happens, then that happens) are pretty standard in anime nowadays and it is understandable because any other set-up would usually break narrative consistency and flow.

3. The 'inconsistency of tone' you pointed out with F/SN also exists in other anime series (like Parasyte- these monsters are killing and eating humans but Migi turns into a dick => hahaha that's funny because it's a dick). A better way to describe this inconsistency is calling it comic relief. As a storytelling standpoint, comic relief has its uses so long as it is used effectively (it doesn't make sense to use comic relief in a Greek Tragedy and Fate/Stay Night is by no means a Greek Tragedy. Neither is Parasyte).

4. I agree that the characters are not the best aspect of F/SN. I was quite disappointed to see the lack of depth in characters, especially since I watched F/Z before F/SN UBW.

5. I'm not too bothered with Shirou's plot armor because there is a reason why he can recover quickly after battles (if you watched F/Z, [minor spoiler:](/s "remember how Iri was able to recover quickly and easily after Kirei stabs her with numerous daggers at the same time?")). Shirou still receives major injuries after participating in battles so it is not as ridiculous as other action anime. You can say that Parasyte also suffers from a main character who has apparent plot armor but that is explained in the episode right after [spoiler:](/s "Shinichi's mother stabs him through the heart"). The 'plot armors' found in both series are justified, yet they are still ridiculous to watch.

6. A major criticism I have for F/SN UBW is that some of the scenes require people to play/watch/whatever the VN beforehand. A big example can be found [during the fight between](/s "Shirou and the teacher. After Shirou successfully projects Archer's swords, he was capable of fending off the teacher's lightning fast attacks with a fighting style similar to Archer's. People who read the VN told others that projection magic allows its user to use the same skill as the thing they are projecting from or something along those lines yet this vital information was not shown anywhere in the F/SN UBW anime. I like to interpret scenes from subtle nuances and minimal action sequences but this is just blatantly poor adaptation of a seemingly important scene").

I sometimes I feel like I'm in a very small group of people that doesn't really like Parasyte. :/
>> ARTICLE
No, there are lots of people with shit taste so you aren't alone lol. 

The first time I voted I think I picked HxH over Oarasyte for the simple fact that it was finished and they both hit similar themes and were overall pretty similar (and equal). But since it seems HxH will definitely win, I'll pack Parasyte this time just cuz. Still those are the 2 best shows of the year by far IMO.

Oh, cool...

Yeah that's true. It's alright but I think it could be so much better.

I do think you're delaying the inevitable. Hunter x Hunter is currently #4 Highest-Rated Anime (Of All Time) on MAL. It won on several other polls on other anime sites. And it was top on several reviewer's 2014 top list I saw. I can't imagine it not winning here. Togashi is truly one of the best storytellers in the anime/manga world.
>> ARTICLE
No, I agree. I just want it to be fair. This poll is already more equal than the last one was. 
>> ARTICLE
Lets hope /r/hunterxhunter wont ruin this again by getting their biased voters in.
>> ARTICLE
There is no way that it wasn't tampered with from the outside. Getting over 900 people from a sub with 9000 subscribers vote on a poll where Kill la Kill has only amassed 30 votes as the 2nd place entry... don't make me laugh
>> ARTICLE
I've seen both Kill la Kill and Hunter x Hunter.. and I still voted for HxH. You can't even compare the two. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree, my point was that this sub loves Kill la Kill and there is no way that HxH could get 900 votes in the same amount of time that Kill la Kill got 30.
>> ARTICLE
They will. Trust me on that, they will. As much as I like HxH, it's fanbase is pretty terrible in that regard.
>> ARTICLE
This game is called getting all your subscribers in a subreddit to make a biased vote I mean cmon /r/hunterxhunter
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, the consensus on there seems to be that they thought a lot of other subs were doing the same thing so it wasn't that wrong. They didn't realize that they have one of the larger and most dedicated fanbases out there though.
>> ARTICLE
What does the * mean by some of the titles?
>> ARTICLE
Oops,  it means it's a wild card entry. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
I'll stick with my Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, thank you very much. 
>> ARTICLE
Now that D-Frag didn't make it to the final 20, I think I have to vote for Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun too. 
>> ARTICLE
And I'll stick with my Barakamon :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh, Barakamon is up there. I'll definitely give it that much. I'd place it in a massive tie with Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and Shirobako. Alas, my beloved Gin no Saji had a fairly weak season and dropped to around third with Nisekoi and Kill la Kill.
>> ARTICLE
Out of all those I've only seen Kill la Kill,  Barakamon and Nisekoi. So I can't really agree or disagree. :p
>> ARTICLE
Such a shame, although I loved Tokyo Ghoul if it was adapted properly (without censorship and followed the manga completley) it could have easily been a top contender.

I hope this series gets the brotherhood treatment so much.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who binge-read the manga last week, before Thursday's episode, I have to agree with you: had it been adapted properly, Tokyo Ghoul would've been a strong contender for AotY.

I can assure you that Akame ga Kill! would've, too. They cut the best parts of the manga to rush the anime-original ending. So much wasted potential.

i dont mind hxh winning as long as is not monogatari series

Once more my vote lies with Kiseijuu.

Ping Pong has to win...Otherwise /r/anime has shit taste.

^Looking ^at ^the ^Aldnoah ^people...
>> ARTICLE
I've seen Ping Pong. It was a hard choice but I voted for HxH. I'm not surprised if Ping Pong won't win. A lot were turned off by the art. 
>> ARTICLE
One show that wasn't very popular but was very good winning isn't a sign the place has shit taste. Ping Pong was an amazing show but I didn't pick it, I picked Parasyte. Next up would have been Hunter x Hunter then Ping Pong, followed by Gin no Saji and Kill la Kill. Honestly, if any of these shows won I would say /r/anime doesn't totally have shit taste. The problem is there are a lot of shows on the list that aren't memorable or do anything different or special, yet get nominated because they are good or entertaining. I like Nozaki Kun but anime of the year? I don't think I'll ever pick a run of the mill comedy rom com as a best if the year (even though it does subvert the genre and all that jazz, I'm not taking away the merits of the show). There are lots of shows on the list like this, good shows that I honestly don't deserve to be in the same rank as those shows that truly do something different and groundbreaking instead of just changing a few things from a well established formula. 
>> ARTICLE
Agree. Saying people have shit taste because you're anime didn't win sounds like sour grapes to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling hunterxhunter is going to win, they have a lot more fans and this is really just a popularity contest. As opposed to Ping Pong which is also pretty great but doesnt have as many fans.

Cross Ange. 

But actually Nozaki-kuuuuuuun

Oh god, they may start coming back. The hunter x hunter are being pretty trashy.

I'm not too worried about it, but I responded to both those comments just in case.

I guess since Yuuki Yuuna is not up for voting I'll go with Kill la Kill. Second place would go to Ping Pong, but I prefer mindless fun over thoughtful story and artsy...artstyle.

Some of these anime series haven't finished yet. Is there a reason why you included them?

Because they aired this year.
