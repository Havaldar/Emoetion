I really enjoyed reading Aqua and Aria, it was the first manga I've ever purchased! I never really could get into watching the anime, maybe I'll have to join in on this re-watch!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the shoddy quality that's available right now (first two seasons arent even full screen let alone 720p) doesn't help too much, but you get used to them. 
>> ARTICLE
It's also reader bias, where I'm used to "listening" to them in the voice I think of when I read, rather than their voice actors. The scenes in the anime seem much more drawn out and slow, which isn't really a problem per se, it just makes it harder for me to get into it.

The OST more than makes up for that problem, though.

True, the OST is amazing.

I will take every opportunity to watch Aria.

duuude. just finish the whole aria anime. man feel like sharing all my thought here. You know I started monday and just finished it yesterday , for my 7th rewatch ~ sorry; and yups ,that is crazyyyy. you can tell how bad my mental really is by my english. ugh.

---

My thought:

well The Animation still too heavy for me. so I take 3 in the morning , 3 at the evening. And I've gotta wake up early morning , such suicidal moves. But I don't care. [err](/s "more actually")

The Natural is the most comfiest among the other. But I finish it at wednesday night , 6 episode straight. I can't barely think anything. But I'm really confident with my faith and recover 2 hour later.

So to rank them , I would put Origination as the baddest of those 3. Because I can't believe that I watch all of the episode along with picture drama , without brake.

---

I'm still in denial , well. currently looping avvvenire over and over until september come (maybe), some already suggesting me to pick up tamayura. but not yet , not yet. Until I can forgive Alicia for everthing. Why? because I'm so mad at her.


---

**the madddening before realization**

IF you compile through rewatch , the other fairies(just 2) done A LOT than alicia. not just to their junior , to both 3 of them. and for akira , it is 5!!

but that before the snow episode that you realize how big is alicia's dream. and you then realize that undine is not even close to what she wanted.

but thats still not enough to make up for the hatred. Then 3 hours ago , I picked up both aqua and aria (manga). Then I ,realize. How big alicia's contribution really is. Because everything get altered in anime , tbh akari is (considered)overpowered in anime compared to manga(since in the manga she is more human than she is in the anime). Im still in the middle of aria(manga) , and currently pissed at how much things changed in the anime. But I take it to another level by watching and read the episode and chapter side by side. Kinda surprising , they did everything right. I lose cause to get all mad over small things. And it motivate me to read aria(manga) as someone who know nothing about aria.

---

There are so many episode that I felt like rewatching within this weekend(if I manage to finish the manga). Most of them from origination though.

---

**ending**


I have strong feeling that they will continue avvenire where they left us at. Because first part of the avvenire pv we clearly saw ai is still have both gloves at her hand. Then the next cut is when she only have one gloves. But who cares?(JK) I only hope that Alice's junior is older than her , because she deserve the awkward senior-junior relationship. 


I have SOOOOOO much to talk , but I don't want to spoil everyone or get shadowbanned - rather wait a proper thread to burst out. BTW , GL HF guys. Have a safe trip , splash splash.

3 things for my personal experience watching my favorite show of all time:

1)I fell asleep like 20 times watching the first few eps of Aria. I don't mean that it was bad, but just the sheer nature of how relaxing it was in addition to me not really caring too much about what's actually going on probably made that happen.

2) I marathoned all of season 2 and 3 in I believe two or three days. It's not that I found it suddenly more engaging or that I believe it's best watched in one sitting by any means. I think I was suddenly hooked on the euphoric feeling induced by watching the show. Rather than just relax I wanted to revel in it.

3)It's the only anime that's ever made me cry without tearjerky sadness and deaths. It was the first time I've ever cried out of happiness for someone and the fact that a fictional story about a character could do that made it something special for me personally.

I think its ability to invoke a sense of beauty and wonder we can find in our real world through a rather unrealistic setting is what makes it so exceptional. It's not just a tour of different aspects of this specific location, but a tour of how we can appreciate different aspects of our own world. I think it gives you a new lens and perspective to viewing the most fundamental themes that we see in our lives.

That said, I don't think the show is necessarily for everybody and that's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't agree more with the first 1. There were nights where this show just made me so relaxed, that if I got comfortable in bed anyway while watching I would be out in the next second. haha. Funny you mention being hooked on the euphoric feeling of the show that it made you marathon it....I got that vibe and made sure to NOT marathon it...cause I have a tendency to marathon the life out of shows, and I was afraid it wouldn't be as special if I did. However that being said, there are plenty of shows that I have marathoned that are some of my favorite shows ever. haha. I will say, however, that 3 could not be more true. Ive had anime get me teary eyed on something sad, or something just very wonderous that hit me hard...but Aria, just from me being in a state of pure happiness, made me cry....really hard. haha. Beautiful that a show like this could do that.
>> ARTICLE
A part of me thinks it might have been better to take it slow as far as how fast I got through the show, but I think it's fine either way. The third season would have been overwhelming either way I think, and that's fine! I think life itself is meant to be erratic and overwhelming at times. It felt really difficult to keep up with all the changes happening so fast and I think I was meant to feel that way.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely think either way is perfectly fine. I personally just decided to do it episodic...except when Origination totally reeled me in and decided "you're gonna experience the fuck out of this, and you're gonna like it".  And yeah things started moving at a scary pace towards the end. Just goes to show you can't anticipate everything that might happen in life. :3
>> ARTICLE
I see we're feeling poetic today... I guess Aria can do that to people.

Overall I pretty much agree, though. Nothing about Aria is particularly exciting or ground-breaking, it's just a *really* well-executed feel-good kind of show.

Cute, but doesn't try to be a comedy. Sentimental, but not really dramatic.  It's an episodic slice-of-life through and through, but it tries to appeal to people in a completely different way, compared to shows like *Kiniro Mosaic* and *Non Non Biyori*.

Anyway, glad you enjoyed it. I would totally watch another season centered around [(spoilers)](/s "Ai-chan's training at Aria Company.")

EDIT: Oh, also... embarrassing posts like this are forbidden. --Aika
>> ARTICLE
Haha Im very quite in real life so theres no other way for me to express myself except through written words. I dont doubt, however, that ill probably look back at this post in a day and get a sense of "oh god did I write THAT?" Anyway, I would love if they did another season, but I also feel like if they didn't...I wouldn't even be disappointed. It was a great ending. 

oh and... Ehhhhh? -Akari
>> ARTICLE
Ara ara... Ufufu - Alicia. 

Speaking of which, if you're looking for an anime like Aria, or even a manga that gave you the same feeling as Aria, then I suggest you look at Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou, or anything else written by Hitoshi Ashinano. 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! It looks interesting. haha. Ill definitely check it out and see who it goes for me. Same with other Hitoshi Ashinano stuff. Anything to give me Aria feels. :3

Don't forget to download the OST of Aria! Choro Club is so soothing...

Hell yes! Its so good. Ive just been having my playlist of all 3 soundtracks on shuffle constantly for the past couple days. :3

> Nothing about Aria is particularly exciting or ground-breaking, it's just a really well-executed feel-good kind of show

I don't quite agree with that. Not because I don't think it's well-executed, but because I *do* think it is ground-breaking. I feel that it even changes what the expectations of "ground-breaking" should be. It's not disorienting, it doesn't fundamentally disrupt or establish new tropes, it isn't even necessarily surprising. However, what it does achieve I think is actually more significant. It achieves a gorgeous harmony of themes that are brought up in anime constantly - history and mythology, nature and artifice, romanticism and everyday life - in ways that most other anime still can't grasp.

For example, Neo-Venezia is a complete replica, a copy, fundamentally a fake. All its residents know this and all the Undine tour guides point out how Neo-Venezia relates to the history and landmarks of the original Venice. Most other representations of such a condition would tint it with a sense of loss and melancholy, as if the real thing had fallen away and Neo-Venezia is just a veneer to compensate for the loss of the 'real' Venice. But in Aria it is precisely because Neo-Venezia is a complete copy that it creates its own romanticism - it is fascinating, mysterious and individual, it creates its own history and hides its own mythology, and (as you note) instils a sense of poeticism. What is ground-breaking about this aspect of Aria is that the concept of a replica is not dealt with cynically (it isn't even dealt with as an existential, Kaiki-like, fake making meaning for itself) but with a sense of pristine soulfulness. Neo-Venezia takes pride in being a copy, but also takes pride in being new - it is open to the future, not nostalgic. Akari's love and sense of wonder is for Neo-Venezia, not the old Venice. All these issues are rendered aesthetically, thematically and technically in the seamless creation of the anime's world.

For me, this kind of therapeutic poeticism and gentle romanticism - both in themes and in feeling - is what really defines the essence of the *iyashikei* genre (not "it makes you feel relaxed"). In that sense, I feel it is ground-breaking, even if not in an obvious or systematic way (like when we see a trope get violently reversed, or a weird new kind of story is told).

But yeah [](/s "AI-CHAN WORKING AT ARIA COMPANY SPINOFF NOW PLS")

EDIT: ...spelling
>> ARTICLE
Architect here. Aria got me thinking a lot about the ethics of historical landmark restoration and the eternal debate about "fakeness" and the importance of scenery in human psyche.

I came to the conclusion that culture is something not necessarily bound to a distant past. Traditions are born anew all the time. And as such, the architecture doesn't reflect only different time periods. It reflects the very fabric of cultural values a society wishes to express.

So, more than being a scenery for tourists to see. NeoVenezia, and maybe other "fake" towns at it's core, reflect whom it's inhabitants long to be. The values they feel, and wish to show it in their buildings. This by itself, influences newcomers and creates culture and traditions anew.
>> ARTICLE
I'm looking forward to seeing a architect (you) in the future getting asked of their inspiration for designing a building, and then talking about Aria. :P
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, That would be kinda weird, but funny nonetheless.

Aria really had an impact in the way I see architecture and a few things in life, "catharsis" if you will. Great works of fiction really have this way of changing a person, or at least get them thinking.
>> ARTICLE
It is really crazy what Aria have done(and can do) to some people. It really is quite special.

And it's really cool how it can affect people in very different ways whiles not looking any different from one to the next.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. They do a fantastic job of making the viewer fall in love with not only the characters, but with the city and its inhabitants. Plus, they do it in a very gradual way by looking at each of the young characters's lives and how they grow older throughout the story with their individual choices. I think that achievement cannot be said of alot of animes out there that focus mostly on simple and shallow character development. 

Also, I believe the final season was amazing. It was incredibly hard saying goodbye to everyone in Neo-Venezia and seeing all the changes that were occurring in their lives.
>> ARTICLE
I think going along with what you said, by creating its own sense of romanticism in what is actually not a historical city on its own, I think the show gives a strong reasons to feel a powerful sense of belonging and bonding to a location. For tourists who's only getting a taste of the city, I think a huge emphasis of the undines' job was to convey a sense of belonging and the sense that the tourists are welcome there.

By doing so, I think it sends the message to us that you don't HAVE to be on Aqua to appreciate these things, but more that you can find these things to appreciate in the world around you, wherever you may be.

What an outstanding show. The moment when [Origination](/s "Alice sung her canzone and was promoted to Prima") especially hit me on an emotional level, as well as the four-leaf clover and the snowman episode. The aftervoid has been immense for me as well, and it's been months since I finished. Every episode's little theme made me sit back from each story with a "lesson learned" combined with the feeling of my daily stress draining away.

Simply a masterpiece of the slice of life genre in my eyes.

EDIT: mixed up my Italian breads
>> ARTICLE
That scene in Origination hit me hard. I did not expect it at all. haha. I didn't really marathon the show until last night where I did about the last 5 or 6 episodes that finished it off. Its gonna be hard finding another series that made me feel the way this one did. hahah. 
>> ARTICLE
> ~~calzone~~

~~*snicker* I believe you mean "canzone"~~ EDIT: Don't worry, I always mix up breads and songs too.

But yeah, I have to really, really, really, focus to not watch the series again and again and again. I just finished it a month or two ago and every so often I'm *compelled* to watch the last seconds of Origination [](/s "with grown-up Akari smiling at Ai-chan"). I don't know how I manage to resist.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even notice it said calzone. :3 Im tempted though just as you are...except I finished it not even 2 days ago so I'm horrified that if i even look at something Aria I'll cry. haha. That end scene that you mentioned made me so happy. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I totally feel you there. I have the whole OST now on my computer and I just have it playing constantly now, regardless of what I'm doing. I too didn't want to leave the world of Neo-Venezia, but I agree that the ending was perfect. It made me happy that it had happened and not that it was ending. 

Oh and sure thing. Assuming your in the US, I bought the DVDs from Rightstuf. They're really great. I link them all here.

Something you wont hear often about this series: Read the manga. I think it's much better than the show. Although I love the show for completely different reasons. Main reasons being: The soundtrack, the atmosphere, the voice cast. Now that you know what the series is going for, read the manga while playing the OST, and you'll be taken to another world. I read the manga in Venice.  To completion. It was the coolest thing I have ever done. 

The art is incredible, and Kozoe Amano's writing is something I have fallen in love with. You'll find many new stories in the manga, and several stories are done differently from the anime. In my opinion, you need to complete both, as they're both incredible. Start with Aqua.

In my opinion, Aria is the best manga ever written. Or one of them. Ok, top 3. 

Also, when you're done with the manga, read Amanchu!!  It's Kozoe Amano's other manga that is currently publishing. It's about sea divers, and the setup is almost identical to Aria.  It's not as good, but it's still more of the same kind of thing, and her art quality is improving. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah okay cool, Ill definitely check out the manga. Thats incredible that you read it in Venice though. Like...super awesome. I can't imagine how relaxing it was. haha. That or how emotional it was.  But yeah thanks for that....ill check it out, and Ill also check out Amanchu! :3 haha.  
>> ARTICLE
For other anime to watch I recommend:

Natsume Yuujinchou 

Non Non Biyori (looks like typical moe, sort of is, but it's like drinking happiness through a straw. Very relaxing and fun.)

Haibane Renmei
>> ARTICLE
Nyan-pasu~ haha. Non Non Biyori was adorable. :3 Ill definitely check out Haibane Renmei and Natsume Yuujinchou. Thank you!
>> ARTICLE
Aria is far and away my favorite anime of all time.  I watched one episode a night, and it was always a great way to round out the day.

Aria is the only anime I can think of that actually changed me as a person.  That show turned a judgmental, narcissistic prick into someone who tries to consider every angle and actually learn about a person before judging their character unfairly.

This may have also been part of the normal growing up process, time rounds us all out after all, but it would be ridiculous to claim Aria had nothing to do with it.

The animation was beautiful, the soundtrack was *phenomenal*, and the theme of the week style and lovable characters made the show something truly special.  I'm glad to meet others who appreciate this anime so much.

What was your favorite episode?  Favorite ending/opening theme?  Character?

I loved Origination episode 5.5 and Natsumachi was definitely my favorite ed. 
>> ARTICLE
I totally feel you on that one. I use to overlook so many things, but I feel that watching Aria has given me the opportunity to be able to just sit down and appreciate a lot of stuff. 

The whole show just had this perfect vibe going for it, and it executed everything perfectly in my mind...music, animation, and everything else. 

My favorite episode...thats really difficult. Probably [Aria Spoiler](/s "The last 2 episodes honestly. Seeing Akari take her exam was beautiful, and just knowing that it was coming to a close made those last two episodes really special for me. The final episode though destroyed me. Especially when Alicia reveals that Akari could've passed the exam a long time ago, but didn't want to miss out on the opportunities to make precious memories with her. That was like a brick in my face mostly because") my favorite character is probably Alicia. As for favorite OP...I'm probably gonna have to go with "Undine". The first OP. That one is beautiful and I loved how [Aria Spoiler](/s "They used it as the last episodes ED") Ill agree with ED though. "Natsumachi" was probably my favorite. That and "Kin no Nami Sen no Nami". :3
>> ARTICLE
Aria is one of a kind in my opinion.

The things I got from Aria can't really be described in words. But I know it made me a better person, even if only by a bit.

Satou Junichi really hit it out of the park with it. And he kept going with Tamayura. While not as good, one can feel the similarities between the two series.

Instead of Aqua, we get Earth. Instead of Neo-Venezia, we get Takehara at the Seto inland sea. And, instead of gondolas, we get cameras.  
Not bad, but I really liked the cast of Aria more than Tamayura.

I like to call three anime, that being Aria, Tamayura and Mushishi "visual muscle relaxants" or "the visual medecine". You are mostly guaranteed the calm down and relax whiles watching one of the previous three anime. I'm sure that there are others that are relaxing, but not as much as there.  
>> ARTICLE
Truly one of a kind. I feel ya there. Ill have to check out Tamayura. Ill probably wait a bit though cause Im still in like...this trance from finishing Aria. The setting sounds cool though albeit not as cool as new space venice on mars. haha. Ill have to check out Mushishi too since I haven't seen it either. Anything that is a visual muscle relaxant is well appreciate. :3
>> ARTICLE
Ah, Aria. They should play it in mental hospitals and psychiatric wards, I think it's one of those rare shows that [heal the soul.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iyashikei) Remember the scene where Alice sings [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uggnwtmxCI0)? First and only time I produced joyful tears. Great show.
>> ARTICLE
If you enjoy series like Aria, then Mushishi and Kino's Journey is what I'd recommend.

Of course there are other series like Non non Biyori, Kirino Mosaic, GochiUsa, K-on!, Hidamari Sketch come to my mind, so if you haven't watched, check them out.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Aria is a great anime to just chill and take it easy. If you want anime similar to it I suggest you watch Kaleido Star and Tamayura. Junichi Sato was the director for all of them. Kaleido Star came before Aria and Tamayura after it. I feel like those 3 series could do something to your brain but I just don't know what.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you Ill definitely check those two out! Ill figure out what happens to my brain after watching them! haha.

I think that was actually a crpe. It certainly looked like it when the guy walked past Athena. Then when she's eating here, it seems to be larger at the top than the bottom, like a crpe rather than a pizza slice.

That Episode Nine... I'm glad we got to pause after that one, because I wasn't able to create coherent thoughts for a while afterwards as I swung across the emotional range. Going from "Yay! Alice-chan gets her Single test!" to "Wait... Is this a Prima promotion?!? Nah, it can't be... *ITISOMGOMGOMG!*" that quickly was pretty much mind-blowing for me.

It is episodes like this that make an anime go from a 9 to a 10, you know...
>> ARTICLE
With episode 9, you can really see how Alice has changed even in the post-graduation scene at the start of the episode. Back in episode 3 of The Animation (I've started re-watching again from the beginning) where we're first introduced to Alice, she has two girls ask her to sign their magazine and she blows them off. Here, she indulges the girl who asks for her second button.

I really loved that in that gondola ride with Athena she's acknowledging all she owes to other people, being able to smile from Akari, her commentary on landmarks from Aika, and then her singing from Athena.
>> ARTICLE
I thought nothing could top episode 9 when I first watched it. 

And then episode 13 happened lol. 
>> ARTICLE
The trouble is that I've already been casually spoiled for Episode 13, so I already know approximately what to expect. This? This came out of *nowhere*.
>> ARTICLE
My biggest anime regret last months is not joining Aria rewatch... I've been meaning to watch it forever, and this would be the perfect chance!
>> ARTICLE
If I had a dollar for everyone that said this during a rewatch group, I'd probably be able to afford the import CDs of the Aria soundtracks. 
>> ARTICLE
Unlikely, as there's a lot of Aria CDs. If you include the Drama CDs, there's actually 44 different CDs that you can buy (counting sets as a single CD only).
>> ARTICLE
Prepare for the void.

u___u
>> ARTICLE
You don't need an excuse to watch Aria.
>> ARTICLE
I'm confused. The last season only has 13 episodes, not 14. Also it would have been *excellent* to end this week's discussion on episode 9 with Alice's story.
>> ARTICLE
The [Episode 5.5 Special](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4772/Aria_The_Origination:_Sono_Choppiri_Himitsu_no_Basho_ni...) was included in this week's festivities. So this week's watching actually *did* end with Alice's promotion.
>> ARTICLE
lol i skipped that episode because i thought it was a recap or something. 

BRB watching it. Also the OP really should have specified that because it is VERY confusing and unintuitive. 
>> ARTICLE
uhh I did specify it in the OP. And how is it unintuitive exactly? I'm just doing it according to what Hulu is showing to not confuse the people watching from there.

>> ARTICLE
I've gotta say, these last few episodes were the ones to hit the hardest. They truly cemented the series as an absolute 10/10 imo. I can't wait for the new ovas and hope it somehow sparks even more aria material somehow, as it's a series that is highly deserving of it. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm super excited for the OVAs. The anime did a really good job of showing us that nothing will ever separate our girls but I really want to see if they were also able to build a solid relationship for Ai's generation as well. I kinda want to see Atora and Anzu be successful in their own endeavors.  

Though I'm gonna be sad that Athena likely won't have a roll in it due to her VA's passing.

Yeah, I would also like to see more of the characters that were introduced when Aika was training.

Yo this stuff's dope. 
>> ARTICLE
Once again I come late to rewatch. I doubt this will be read but that's of no real importance. I will leave my final thoughts on the whole series for archives of time, or for me to return to see my own reflection on my first viewing. 

I have yet to say a word in any of these discussions, as for most I was behind. While I started the series a month before the rewatch began as I had eyed a particular interest after seeing the third season so well ranked on MAL. Anyhow I lulled along and completed the final episode today. It was by no means a rush as it was relax only time when the mood was right. However my interest was grasped tighter mid way through the Natural, I could hardly put my finger on why, just that Aria had clicked and that watching the daily lives mattered more than what ever I had to watch.

This last season, god I only really stopped to think about it around episode 4. This was by far the biggest wake up call to me. Akari shows up with join others who have far more practice in rowing these 2 person passenger boats and she blows it out of the park. Its all under played. It done so well with whats right around the corner. For the first time it dawns on me that other undine who appear to be less experience, or capable at least are all at least on the edge to be Primia. At this point I stopped and series thought about how overdue it was for Alice to be promoted to at least a Single? I really considered what I wanted out of this show and where it as going.

It makes scene in each of their Senpai's own ways as to why the wait was longer than it was needed for each of their promotion to Primia. I was by far taken away the most by Alice being promoted first. The second glove; the wave of emotion as it came off. I must say the whole idea of removing their gloves became so real with the show having done so little but build on the idea of it. Manly tears were shed. Similarly more tears on the other girls promotions and Alicia's retirement. 

Ai-chan joining under Akari was the perfect and met every expectation in every parallel drawn in the short but memorable conclusion. Time on Aqua passes but land and people don't. Its almost in its own timeless bubble. I can hardly put into words what I have felt from watching Aria; although I do know that I am better because of it. The subtle changes in character from episode to episode. In the end I can only look back and see the same jokes lined along the way, but the has been a subtle but noticeable change, positive, that pulls me to rewatch the show again. I will return to Aria when time has passed, but for now it has imprinted something on me.

My scouring around lets me see others who from what I can see have felt the same semi-indescribable emotions had by similar watching this adventure. The depth of the hole felt in my sole is real. The emptiness of no episodes. A satisfied conclusion but at the same time a longing for more. I am now beyond longing the announced 'Aria the Avvenire'. Its going to be an amazing Christmas treat with it coming out on the 24th of December. Can't bloody wait. 

Thank you everyone for commenting in the rewatch discussions.

A mess of thoughts:

* It's a shame they didn't/can't add the EDs, the one for the Origination is lovely.

For anyone on the fence, watch it. It's worth it. Y'know Non Non Biyori? This is pretty much what inspired works like that.

It's one of the kings of the slice of life genre and it's well deserved. It's an anime classic. Take it in small doses at a time, just watch 2-4 episodes in one sitting. It's at it's best when you draw it out because it's so relaxing.

> If you have any tips on how to improve on writing this i would welcome it.

Try to use more of formatting and tags, they may help you to organize your material better and it will simply look more tidy and attractive. Use highlights before every new section of text. Check up some other users [WT!] threads to see how it's usually done.

And sell it, sell it more, tell us it's a wonderful journey like nothing else, back up the words of 'beautiful scenery' with some screenshots and 'fitting music' with a link to some piece of soundtrack on youtube, just make us more interested in the anime you're talking about. Also comparison to the other shows helps since people tend to pick up 'similar' things with greater pleasure.

Edit: [here](http://redd.it/2xkvpx) are some recent [WT!] threads that deserve your attention, for example, /u/lukeatlook 's  threads have very clean and crisp design.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the mention :)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for that i will definetly take care of that stuff in the future.
>> ARTICLE
I think the simplest way to improve is keep in mind the "why" when writing the WT! You did a good job of describing why, but I recommend emphasizing the most important reasons. For example:

>how every episode made my entire day better and made me look on the brighter side of life.

For me, this was the most convincing reason in the entire post for why I should watch this series. Yet it was hidden inside of a paragraph as more of an after thought. That should be the focus of the paragraph, not just another sentence in it. 

So think about "why" and come up with your best reasons and then build your argument around them. 

[Here's my WT!](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2xhvo1/wt_kon_how_this_is_the_pinnacle_of_happiness_in/) Notice how at the end of my introduction I have the bolded sentence:

>K-On is focused on one thing and it does this one thing better than any other anime Ive seen; making the viewer feel happy.

This is the "why" I built the entire essay around. Every bolded sentence after that is an important reason why K-On succeeds at making the viewer happy and the paragraphs are constructed around elaborating on those important reasons.

This is just my methodology for writing though. There are many great ways to convince someone to watch something and I've seen some creative yet effect methods employed for WT! threads. 
>> ARTICLE
I started this series because I wanted something calming to watch after my grandfather passed. It fit the bill exactly. I spent most of the week, which was also my reading week, that happened curled up on the couch with a glass of brandy and Aria on the television. Now that school's started up again, I haven't had the time to watch much more of The Natural, but when I find time I'll be finishing it. It's so calming I found the OP almost putting me to sleep. It's as slice-of-life as it gets.
>> ARTICLE
You are in for a real treat with The Natural, because it really picks up the overall story, has character growth and a lot more healing moments than the first season.

Sounds like just what I'll need after this midterm tomorrow. Well, that and a glass of Calvados.

The only downside is that they cut out the EDs for some reason which is a shame since Aria [has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJRZN522t9Y) [solid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1hGtQxHvs) [endings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMls0LLjAiU).

Thanks OP for calling attention to this wonderful series!  To this day, Aria's characters are very dear to my heart.  Aria also rekindled my childlike sense of wonder and imagination.  The world-building was so well done that it always left me in awe of Neo-Venezia and curious about what other marvels lay just around the corner.  The stunning artwork and emotional soundtrack full of guitar and piano solos further immersed me in the world of Aqua.

I especially agree with your advice to watch 1 episode a day.  Aria is definitely meant to be savored.  :)

I did! Mistakenly, I might add. When going through the series, the end came up as "Episode 5.5," and I was at first very much confused. :P

It was good nonetheless. I'd watch an entire season of nothing but Akari walking around, being happy by every little thing that happens around here. :3

I enjoyed the OP. Cannot really say much more since I have not seen Aria. Seems like after reading these reviews this should be higher on my priority list. So this is the end? Until the next season or whatever comes around?

Ha, yea. I made one of those "Don't Break the Chain" rules on myself in terms of writing: write something once a day and release something once a week! My deadline is always 11:59pm Wednesday, so I made it in time. :P

> I enjoyed the OP.

This OP is easily the worst of the three. :(

> Seems like after reading these reviews this should be higher on my priority list.

So, the only real "difficulty" is getting through the first season. I found it to be slightly above average, but everything afterwards is very well done.

> So this is the end? Until the next season or whatever comes around?

Correct!

I think the consensus right now is, "What are they going to do?" Because realistically, they brought such a nice end to everything with this season, that going back and tampering with what they've done would seem like a mistake.

But I'll reserve judgment for when it is actually released. :3

> Ha, yea. I made one of those "Don't Break the Chain" rules on myself in terms of writing: write something once a day and release something once a week! My deadline is always 11:59pm Wednesday, so I made it in time. :P

Really? Interesting. I usually write whenever I feel like it. Which is uncommon. Then I just spend a whole day zooming through it, getting second opinion, rewrite and wait a day to publish. The wait a day thing is to prevent a catastrophic "long-sessions-of-writing-syndrome-that-is-just-made-up" messing things up.

> So, the only real "difficulty" is getting through the first season. I found it to be slightly above average, but everything afterwards is very well done.

Uh.. if I have survived Steins;gate, Attack on Titan and TTGL's first dull-slow-sleepy half, then I am sure I can survive the first season. :P

> This OP is easily the worst of the three. :(

ARE YOU CRITICIZING MY MUSIC TASTE!?

> I think the consensus right now is, "What are they going to do?" Because realistically, they brought such a nice end to everything with this season, that going back and tampering with what they've done would seem like a mistake.

Ah, I hope they will do it well then. Always a touchy subject to continue something that has ended on a good term. That is probably why there is not a K-On! continuation.
>> ARTICLE
> The wait a day thing is to prevent a catastrophic "long-sessions-of-writing-syndrome-that-is-just-made-up" messing things up.

Ah, yes.

"Did *I* write that?" I've done that a few times myself. :3

> ...then I am sure I can survive the first season. :P

Ha, fair enough. Just don't expect anything stellar from the first season, and you're good to go (however, you can think that for the next two seasons afterwards! :3)

> ARE YOU CRITICIZING MY MUSIC TASTE!?

Never! I don't criticize anyone's perspectives on anything; I honestly and truthfully love to see various views on the different anime we watch. Differing opinions are always awesome to see. :)

I'm not sure, but this *is* anime; there's bound to be an H-doujinshi out there for you somewhere if you are *really* hankering for some Akari x Aika material. :P

If you felt silly before almost crying over a gondola, I bet you felt even sillier when the object(s) at hand was/were [](/s "glove(s)").

Once again I think you stated everything that needed to be said. Origination's mild departure in tone and message builds into a rewarding end for both its characters and the viewer, especially if you can identify with the complications that come with transitioning to a new stage of life. That weird mix of anxiety, happiness, and sense of a lost routine is something I've gone through and [may have rambled about a bit](https://np.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ufmnt/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/co806v1). The emotional impact of the finale. The lingering feeling of assurance. The persistence of happiness even when finding yourself in a new place, even if not necessarily physically new. **[Spoiler]** [We'll all find our comfort and prosperity, guys](https://i.imgur.com/dbsgaZU.jpg).

Thanks for the read yet again, Banjo, and I'm glad that you enjoyed Aria and it's cozy little world. I hope I'll get to see you in Avvenire's discussion thread(s)!

Haha, that darn gondola! Don't remind me, I have enough sad memories to relive over and over at the moment. :P

Gahh! Alice's was surprising, Aika's was funny, but Akari's...Alicia, hold me! :3

If *that's* rambling, that what am I doing?! :P

What you say in that link is great, and something that always saddens me; that feeling of having to "move on" despite all of the fun and happy times that were had is something that always irks me, in a good way. And it happens here, not just once, but multiple times over.

> We'll all find our comfort and prosperity, guys.

I knew *exactly* what they were doing when Ai put the fork in her mouth! :)

And it's pretty amazing that [AtO Ending Spoilers](/s "just by making Akari's hair longer and giving her some eyeliner, combined with Alicia's pose, makes her look infinitely more mature than she has ever been.")

> Thanks for the read yet again, Banjo, and I'm glad that you enjoyed Aria and it's cozy little world.

You're welcome, parameterized. But I should be the one thanking you. While I didn't particularly find the first season to be anything too special, these last two most certainly were. I wouldn't have been able to experience them without your suggestion, and for that, I'm very grateful. So with as much sincerity as I can muster through online words: thank you very much! :)

As for "cozy," it definitely wasn't feeling that way for the second half of this season!

> I hope I'll get to see you in Avvenire's discussion thread(s)!

Two things: I'm not going to lie, I'm scared with what they are going to do. They really, really don't need to touch this series; its ending and resolution is just too good to make any attempt to go back to, even if its popularity warrants it.

And nowadays, I try to stick away from the discussion threads, so that my reviews are "pure" with my own thoughts and interpretations. Hanging around in them for some fun times here and there is okay, but too long and I risk picking up what others think before making an analysis of my own. :3

> Bonus traghetto gifs...

Now that you mention it, I wonder why the three of them (Akari, Aika, and Alice) never used one together. :3
>> ARTICLE
There's a lot of chapters here and there, that weren't adapted. As long as they just adapt those, and don't try anything new with the story then I'm fine with it. Like an Aria Season 2.5.
>> ARTICLE
niea!

> Like an Aria Season 2.5.

Ahh, okay. Thanks for the clarification.

Although, that still makes it seem as if it isn't going to be as purposeful. But that's probably to be expected, given its apparent placement within the story.
>> ARTICLE
Aria is an iyashikei, it's purpose is to heal. Not necessarily developing the plot. More healing would mean it did in fact serve it's purpose.
>> ARTICLE
Except Origination did definitively end the anime, as it essentially followed the end of manga chronologically, and to the letter. Iyashikei anime is meant to heal, but Kozue Amano did have a set end for the manga that is replicated beautifully in the anime. You can hardly deflect any concerns about the continuity and how appropriate an addendum is to a decade-old franchise (with no updates for over 5 years) with a generic dismissal of the importance of plot in iyashikei anime in general (it's generally episodic, and is meant for healing, but it would be like adding a chapter to the end of YKK. It just doesn't work that well, because regardless of the genre, an end is an end). 

Given the title of the upcoming season, I will be relieved if it's just a short filler/OVA episode, like the Picture Dramas for Origination. At least that means most fans can laugh and chuckle at the general ridiculousness of them (minus the last one) and will reserve the addendum as merely a bonus to a great series. 

If it's an actual series, quite a few people will question the need for it, even if Amano is helping with the production (because let's face it, given her recent work, Amanchu misses the mark when compared to Aria, so she might as well be a one-hit wonder).
>> ARTICLE
If they stick to adapting the chapters they didn't adapt the last time around, and don't try to write new material then I don't see the problem. It won't change the ending. It'll mean more Aria for those who want more, and a longer experience for those who haven't watched it yet. Think of how many "unaired episodes" are released with BDs these days. Take Sora no Woto as an example. 2 epsiodes, and one of them was episode no. 7.5, meaning that another episode was added after the story had concluded. It wasn't a problem. This is very common nowadays. Aria is a lot older, so it's a more extreme example, but this whole thing wasn't as common back then. I do have to wonder why they're doing it though, and if it means some kind of new other Aria products.
>> ARTICLE
While Aria is no stranger to N.5 episode additions (I completely forgot how seamless the transition of Origination 5 to 5.5 was, even though the latter came out with the DVD), I still remain cautiously optimistic as to how much more they can add from the manga into Origination.

As seen here, quite a few of the unused manga chapters are at least partially adapted or edited. I will assume those chapters have been modified/condensed too much to fix in a simple retcon with Avvenire. Many of the other chapters involve Cait Sith, which requires a rather important thematic shift, because CS is much more important in the manga than the anime. I hope they don't try to badly adapt those chapters, as CS feels like an arc of its own in the manga. The few chapters left toward the end of Origination-time in the manga could be adapted well, but again, cautious optimism at how they can balance effective adaptation with time away from the series and pacing issues with the original 13 episode timeline of Origination.

http://tsleyson.github.io/aria_table.html

And then, even with all this, the title of the new project is Aria the Avvenire. With that meaning Future, the logical choice to me is that they'll try to make (relatively bad) original content which extends beyond Origination's plotline chronologically. The anime has been rather hit and miss with anime-original stuff (though Arietta was absolutely fantastic), so that's another issue too.

Or maybe I'm thinking too much into it and it'll just be some special to be bundled with the BD box, as with Origination's Picture Dramas and Episode 5.5.
>> ARTICLE
I'd really like some more Aria that I can plonk in between the other seasons when I rewatch the series, but if they try to make a cohesive 'story' out of the leftover chapters then I think there's a high chance of faliure. I do agree that CS doesn't really work in a release like this. My hope is that we'll basically just get a small collection of N.5 episodes with no connection. Just like a bunch of OVAs, since a lot of Aria can work as selfcontained stories. The name is worrying me as well. I really hope they don't try to do something set in the future, like a time skip. I doubt that would be the case though, because Aria was never about the goal, but the journey, so skipping the journey would just be plain dumb. Still kind of afraid though. The anime Art Book was called Avvenire too right? Not sure what the connection might be though.
>> ARTICLE
> More healing would mean it did in fact serve it's purpose.

True, but its ability to "heal" may be hampered by its 10 year hiatus, awkward placement within the series, and "resetting" of its characters.

Granted, the slice-of-life nature of its presentation, and the fact that only those who have seen the series will most likely be watching it, lessens the impact of these negatives. But I'll still remained worried for now.

At least, until I start watching it! :3
>> ARTICLE
I recommend the Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou manga if you want something similar to Aria. A few chapters of it was adapted into a couple of OVA episodes (that [shares the music creator](http://myanimelist.net/people/6379/Choro_Club) with the Aria anime), but the 14-volume manga is the real deal. It's something every SoL fan should read, as I think it's pretty much the pinnacle of the genre (and has some stunning artwork).
>> ARTICLE
Definitely agree with this. Apart from other strengths, YKK is unique in that it is set in a pastoral post-apocalyptic world, with many mysteries that are never fully explained.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if you know this, but the manga author's [current work] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/31771/Amanchu) is getting an anime adaption this summer. If the manga is anything to go by, it's going to be just as soothing and pleasant as Aria.

Edit: And just as [pretty] (http://i.imgur.com/lOLIeFT.png)

The anime backgrounds aren't as impressive since you can only see them in SD at the moment. They're still quite good given the limits of SD. The new OVAs are impressive in 1080p, though.

I look forward to Amanchu in HD this summer.

Hazukashii serifu kinshi!

But honestly, Aria is probably my most favorite SoL anime along side with Non Non Biyori (in case if you haven't seen this, go check this out right now). Aria offer a relaxing and refreshing atmosphere, it's very peaceful. And yes yes it's best to watch it before bed, "serve" the show with a biscuit and a cup of hot tea. 

Take it slow, one episode at time, sit back and spectate the beauty of Neo Venezia, following Akari's footstep to explore Aqua's culture and its people. It's a wonderful world. Just imagine yourself siting on gondola, seeing the clear sky, the blue water with Venice like architectures and scenery, and then your Undine starts to sing ... Seriously [Aria OST is god-tier.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIPFonjNIKA)

At some point, I wish the story would keep going, going and never end, because I just love the show, the characters and Neo Venezia so much that I didn't realize I had already finished ARIA the Origination. I'm really jealous with who are about to see the show because it will be one of the best experience they will ever have in anime, please treasure every moment Aria offers cause you won't know how much would you miss Aria when it's over.

Holy shit, the moment second 29 hit, I am like FUCK I KNOW THIS, IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE OST HOW HAVE I NOT WATCHED ARIA YET????????!

Love this anime, you can always just pick a episode whenever you're bored and it's always something special. What was your favourite episode?

Also, keep an eye out for Amanchu later this year. It's a manga that will be adapted into anime, by the same author and director, and after reading a few chapters I think it's going to be great.

Favorite episodes were Those Orange Days... from the Animation and That Shadowless Invitation from the Natural. Especially the latter. The music in that episode was just immaculate.

Those Cait Sith episodes were really something else, I liked those a lot. I think 'Those Orange Days' was really the point I started to love the series, it was such a warm and kind episode from start to finish.

A bit late, but I had saved your comment for when I was gonna watch Aria. I happened to see that there's someting called Aria the Avvenire, do you know when it comes in in the watch order?
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Avvenire is an ova that takes place after Origination, so you should watch it after Origination
>> ARTICLE
Thank you \^^
>> ARTICLE
Just wanted to add that Aria the OVA: Arietta should be watched after the Natural, since the events of the OVA are referenced in the Origination.
>> ARTICLE
It's unfortunate that the streaming sites always seem to put Arietta at the end of the Origination's playlist. Even if you buy the seasons on iTunes it does the same thing.
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see you had a good time with it OP. It truly is the best SoL of all time and did everything it possibly could perfectly. Whether that was story, soundtrack, character development, or atmosphere.
>> ARTICLE
Aria is seriously the best.  Far and away the best slice of life show I know of.

And yes I cried a ton watching this anime, probably more often than any other honestly.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Origination has one the best ED of all time and other ED and OP are just Amazing as well as the anime itself being Underrated as fck and easily one of the best Sol of all time only after Uchuu Kyoudai xD
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget that [Amanchu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31771/Amanchu) by the same manga author and director is gonna be coming out soon.
>> ARTICLE
You've probably seen it already but if not, check out [Tamayura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9055/Tamayura?q=tamayura).

It's made by some of the people behind the Aria adaptation, mainly with same person behind the script (Reiko Yoshida) and the director (Junichi Satou). In many ways it's a moe version of Aria, with the same purpose: healing. It's really heartwarming, check it out!

Edit: Oh, and get hyped for Spring anime [Haifuri](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31500/Haifuri) which looks to be similar as well. Reiko Yoshida is behind the script *and* series composition, it's an anime original just like Tamayura, not to mention the original character design is by Atto, the author of Non Non Biyori.

Don't know why I put Tamayura on hold, fml! Thanks for reminding me.

>> ARTICLE
They're up there. They're about $30 each on RightStuf, although there's two parts to The Natural that are each $30.

RightStuf also has the manga that have been published in English (Aqua and the first six volumes of Aria). The last six volumes of Aria aren't published in English at all.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I found that out the hard way. I ended up buying them in Japanese. 
>> ARTICLE
Some people (including me) have asked Seven Seas about the possibility that the Aria series would get the rest translated and they've said that it's unlikely because it failed twice.

I'll probably end up buying them in Japanese as well.
>> ARTICLE
The Japanese isn't that complex, if you know some basic vocabulary and grammar you could read it reasonably well. Ordering it from Japan is definitely worth it if you think you'll be able to read it somewhat.
>> ARTICLE
I'll definitely be ordering it, I just can't afford it at the moment.
>> ARTICLE
The final season felt like evey episode should make you cry.  
>> ARTICLE
And almost all of them accomplished it.
>> ARTICLE
The series isn't up on YouTube anymore. They have a few episodes up, but not even a whole season. Nozomi tends to cycle through series on YouTube. They'll put them up in stages, keep them up for a while, then take all of it down and start the process with something else.

For US viewers, I think they're on Hulu and I know they're on Viewster at least in Canada.

Nozomi does have Sketchbook up on YouTube. It's by the same director of the Aria series. I recommend it for anyone who liked Aria (or Tamayura). Nozomi is pretty much licensing as much by the director of Aria as they can.
>> ARTICLE
My bad, I saw a few on there and read some comments about how they had been previously and just assumed.
>> ARTICLE
Great post!  Aria was a very emotional series for me, too, and it's one of my all-time favorites.  You might also like Haibane Renmei.  It sometimes has a much more ominous tone than Aria, but it has a similar approach to world-building and character development and is very peaceful and relaxing most of the time.

Nice. Now go watch Non Non Biyori.

Aria should be the standard for SOL shows in my opinion.

It's so relaxing there's no way you can be in a bad mood after finishing an episode.

Personally I think the best way to watch it is by watching 1 episode a day. I made a habit of getting home from school, grabbing something to eat, and watching an episode to unwind after a long day and it was incredibly rewarding.
>> ARTICLE
People keep recommending me this show whenever I mention how much I love Hanasaku Iroha. And yeah, I had Aria on my radar for awhile and now knowing that it's free on YouTube I might just give it a go sooner. Nice WT!

Great write up, was considering writing one myself, but you beat me to it. 

Personally think it's one of the best examples of what the anime industry/SoL genre can offer at its absolute best. There's a certain charm to it that makes it irresistible once you get into it. 

Also think you could give the main OST a bit more credit. The OPs and EDs are something else, but the things like [Aqua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzoKxSY1FeY&ab_channel=AquaCelesteCompany) were just astoundingly fitting for the setting. 

But yeah, the series as whole is a definite 10/10 for sure.

Definitely one of the best SOL anime

Aria still is the very best piece of media I've ever consumed. 

I have re-watched most of the episodes, but have yet to finish the show because I actually won't know what to do with myself afterwards.

>> ARTICLE
Rainbow and Kin no Nami Sen no Nami are both excellent EDs, but I gotta rep [Nasumachi](https://d.maxfile.ro/tlovvavmzo.webm) from the Natural. It just blends perfectly with the finale of each episode. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a really close call over here between Rainbow and Kin no Nami Sen no Nami, but I think the edge still goes to Rainbow. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude are you actually me. Origination's ED is also my favorite lol. Such a majestic tone. 
>> ARTICLE
Rainbow is still my favourite.
>> ARTICLE
Aria, more specifically the Origination is steadily fighting it's way into all my favorite lists. I can't get enough of this series.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 4 is arguably one of my favorite episodes of the entire season and I want to see more adventures of those girls in the traghetto. Really nice designs and personalities too.

I felt that episode really opened up the world of the gondola/public-transportation business and how it actually works in Neo Venezia.
>> ARTICLE
I would argue that it's not your favorite episode.

:P

(There's no arguing with your own opinion, lol. If you said it was arguably "the best" instead of "your favorite" then it would make sense. No hard feelings, I just felt the need to nitpick.)

:)
>> ARTICLE
True! The show has so many great episodes (all three seasons), I kind of switch my faves at times.
>> ARTICLE
The reaction faces are one of the things I love the most about the Aria series. It adds that extra element of playfulness.

Episode 4 is really great for Akari because we regularly see her compared to Aika and Alice. She doesn't have the discipline of Aika and she's not a rowing prodigy like Alice. She comes across sometimes as kind of flighty (sort of like Athena), but in episode 4 we see that she really does have skills.

I'll admit I broke down and read both Aqua and Aria (I really wish we could get a full series of Aria published in English). After that, there were things I really wanted to see so I've now finished the season. I'm going to go back and re-watch it along with everybody, though. But first, I want to watch episode 1 for the introduction of Ai as that's an anime original thing. Akari's letters in the manga just go to a "penpal".

Akari seems to have some elements from both Alicia and Athena. While she's not the prodigy Alicia is (that's Alice), she does have Alicia's kindness and temperament, but she comes across as flighty as Athena can. We've seen just how that works well for her as she's very friendly and can quickly befriend people from all walks of  life.

Oh ok. I see how it is

As expected of /r/anime's taste

I TAKE OFFENSE TO THIS

7 is the 5th letter of the alphabet confirmed.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't be less surprised at the top 9.
>> ARTICLE
more like top 30
>> ARTICLE
Only 2 that are slightly surprising in the top 30 are Jojo and NHK.  Neither are really "mass appeal" type of shows.
>> ARTICLE
What's surprising is that the Oregairu circlejerk didn't manage the top 5.
>> ARTICLE
I'm shocked it got as many votes as it did
>> ARTICLE
I'm not, this sub loves sucking oregairu's dick on every fucking occasuin
>> ARTICLE
Lighten up bud. No need to get so upset about something so meaningless.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much this. I'd prefer to see less Oregairu hype myself, but I know that it'll die down eventually. Why worry about something that will fix itself?
>> ARTICLE
Both jojo and nhk are very popular on /r/anime, though.
>> ARTICLE
Remember that time Dio lost to *Raku* in the best guy contest? Because that happened.
>> ARTICLE
> Overlord #71

...It hasn't even finished airing.
>> ARTICLE
That's just how good it is.  The LN is even better.  
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's just *that good* in the opinion of those who have it in their list of favourites.
>> ARTICLE
This show won't even be remembered in two years. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just how this goes for a lot of unfinished LN adaptations that aren't standout shows. 
>> ARTICLE
Haha, someone wrote one punch man, the first episode came out like today
>> ARTICLE
not so crazy now huh
>> ARTICLE
No accounting for hype
>> ARTICLE
It's also been in the Top 50 on MAL ever since its announcement.
>> ARTICLE
Well, maybe a reader? :O
>> ARTICLE
Anime adaptation doesnt really reflect its manga. Example, Gate: 
>> ARTICLE
Anime and manga both are adaptation. Gate: is a novel.
>> ARTICLE
Oh TIL.  So, comparing the manga to its novel how far the violence got diluted? 
>> ARTICLE
Violence getting diluted doesn't really detract from the story for me. Spice and Wolf for instance has Holo on her wolf form just running around and people fall to the ground just because when they're in the sewers. On the LN, a lot of people got ravaged on that scene.

I mean, that rarely ever affects the story, so why bother?
>> ARTICLE
/r/anime

lmao
>> ARTICLE
I know, but still, someone CAN actually be so addicted to the manga to go the stretch and say it'll be good no matter what... right? I mean, if they announced a season 3 for S&W it probably would be an auto-include on my 10 list because of the content of the LN :D.
>> ARTICLE
I mean you can but you shouldn't,
>> ARTICLE
not even the first episode, it's a nico nico web exclusive. The actual show doesn't start til october.
>> ARTICLE
10/10
>> ARTICLE
>Revolutionary Girl Utena 4

>Sakura Trick 4

I take personal offense to this.
>> ARTICLE
I love all yuri shows equally!
>> ARTICLE
Sakura Trick obviously needed more /s
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong almost cracking the top 20. Nice. Too bad its characters, aka the best part of the show, can't get into any of the contest brackets... 
>> ARTICLE
Rurouni Kenshin not even on the list o.0
>> ARTICLE
Indeed, many conclusions can be drawn from it not appearing. Not that I'm trying to imply anything.
>> ARTICLE
Well, wait until a similiar remake like hxh 2011 comes out, shits going to hit the fan (ova's did a good job, the tv animation not so much)
>> ARTICLE
Madhouse could do well with Rurouni Kenshin, provided they can get permission to remake it. They're good at adapting old manga in a modern way.
>> ARTICLE
12 Kingdoms/Juuni Kokuki got 4 votes! We demand representation in the top 100!
>> ARTICLE
Needs number 1 spot.
>> ARTICLE
12 Kingdoms is probably one of the best underrated coming of age anime ever to exist.
>> ARTICLE
I would have voted the shit out of that show. Best historical fantasy anime of the 00's.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's one of my favorite shows!
>> ARTICLE
Oh I might have listed them as 2 separate shows by accident
>> ARTICLE
Why are Melancholy and Disappearance (Haruhi) split, but GitS and SAC combined? 
>> ARTICLE
The only explanation I can offer is me being stupid while counting the votes :[
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually surprised Hunter x Hunter is second on this list, especially when it lost to Spice and Wolf in the Best Anime bracket. I feel like it's always mentioned on this sub but it isn't overly hyped up which is interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
> but it isn't overly hyped up which is interesting. 

Really? People talk about CA like it was the pinnacle of fiction.
>> ARTICLE
I meant it doesn't have a huge circle-jerk going for it to the point where it dominates every bracket.

And I've never seen the CA arc brought up without a mixture of praise and criticism. 
>> ARTICLE
Its kind of the same with Steins;Gate and FMA:B, I don't think that people rave on about it too much because they are very secure that they are regarded as good shows, they don't need to convince other people that it is a good show just to reaffirm their belief. I fucking loved HxH, but I anit gonna preach the shit out of it and put people off, not what I want to do at all.
>> ARTICLE
This is what initially turned me off of HxH, that and the episode count.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much everyone who watches it ends up loving it, but a lot of people are turned off the either its length, art style, or beginning that make it seem like it's an anime for kids. It is pretty damn hyped in the comment sections, but that's simply not enough to boost it above other really popular anime with broader appeal in contests that have thousands of voters.
>> ARTICLE
It was a 9/10 for me... until the ant arc. The change in tone, ridiculously slow pacing, overpowered (dues ex machine) enemies ruined it for me. It took like 40 episodes for anything to happen and once it started it was so over narrated and over explained ever little detail. Until that point everyone  was strong because they trained and earn their power. The ants also felt so cartoony and out of place in what had been a dark Shonen. The mc's anger felt so forced and blown out of proportion.

/end rant 

Edit:Downvote isnt a disagree button. 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree with everything you say lol. A lot of people think the ant arc was the best.
>> ARTICLE
There's many that considers it the best arc of any shounen.
>> ARTICLE
did you watch the show while it was airing or after it finished?
>> ARTICLE
I watched it after it was finished and thought the ant arc was the best by far, albeit it started off rather slow.
>> ARTICLE
If you watched it while it was airing, you would realize how bad and slow the pacing was. They basically copy pasted the manga, they showed whats going on, AND the narrator explained it. Which imo is bad in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Animes are much better when you can binge watch them though, chimera ant arc might have been really slow when it was airing but it would have had an extremely different feeling if you had been able to see everything at once, I was watching 40 episodes a day so this made it definitely one of the best arcs of any shounen to me.
>> ARTICLE
that's my point, many people ignore the terrible pacing of shows because they binge watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Aren't the majority of anime created to promote the source material anyway? I'm also sure a good portion of the people that watched it (including me) didn't even touch the manga so it was a new experience to them. As far as the pacing, I already admitted that I also thought it was pretty slow, but the second half more than makes up for it imo.
>> ARTICLE
the second half is where it was slowest, 6 episodes for 3 minutes. Also that isn't an excuse to have godawful pacing, they promoted the manga by completely ending the show in a satisfying way so for the people that want more, they need to read the manga (even though there isn't much material).
>> ARTICLE
When it was finishes, and i'm used to shounen pacing. I loved it from the first episode as i knew it was going to be an epic journey. I'm glad they did it after the manga, that's the only way anime should be done.
>> ARTICLE
which "dues ex machine" are you talking about?
>> ARTICLE
The people who comment on shit are different from the people who'd upvote shit. People who've watched HxH will have very strong opinions about it
>> ARTICLE
This is true. There are >300,000 subscribers here, but I'd say there's only around 500-1000 of us that regularly comment. What we tend to think of as "the /r/anime community" is only a tiny sliver of it. This is also a big part of the reason you'll see a tremendous outpouring of love for certain characters in the contests' comment sections only to have them get absolutely mutilated in the results.
>> ARTICLE
So basically MAL.

if Gintama was less known

I don't like the list that much but better than MAL.

But still in top 13

I dunno. It was hyped enough to be one of the first anime I heard about when I was getting into anime. Maybe most people just don't think its good enough to be one of their favorites.  I liked it well enough, but I wouldn't call it a favorite.

All of those were mentioned like once or twice, and I stupidly lumped ghost in the shell with ghost in the shell: stand alone complex

Yuyuyu #97 hype!

I'm not stats guy, but I think the latter 50 suffers a bit from low sample size

I don't think it's necessarily the sample size, cause there were hundreds of comments I used, but that when you get past the top 15 or 20 picks you're going to see less repetition. Frankly I'm surprised stuff like Sakura trick even had enough people choosing it

Darker than Black 66... what the fuck guys.
>> ARTICLE
that's much cleaner. Thank you!
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda of curious on what makes Steins;Gate that good. I finished it last week and it was really good, but I feel it's a bit overrated. Maybe I was a bit overhyped on how it was going to end, but the ending left me kinda underwhelmed. Intro and outro songs are really awesome, I like the lyric change at the final two episodes and what the lyrics of the intro have to say, real interesting and ties in well with the story. 
>> ARTICLE
 Steins;Gate has various elements/genre in it, the characters aren't all that interesting but the amount of human emotions mixed in, all the feels, driving each one to their own desires, characters development. I'm assuming that you have watched both the OVAs and the movie, you would only not like it if you don't understand jack shit. I personally don't find anything lacking in Steins;Gate. 

But yeah overhyping it might be a factor, when does the real thing meets your expectation when you overhype, really?

ANWS DONT YOU FEEL THE PAIN OKABE IS GOING THROUGH


>> ARTICLE
Tu... tu... ruu
>> ARTICLE
I'm not talking about /r/anime folks but the general Steins;Gate audience: If you think from the perspective of a random adult you'd run into on the street in the Western world, Steins;Gate is the only show they might like out of the top 10 shows. The other 9 are extreme levels of "okay wtf am I watching?" to those outside of fantasy/fiction/anime culture.

For that specific non-anime audience, it would be a toss up between Steins;Gate, Cowboy Bebop and Death Note. Steins;Gate would win the popularity contest because the other two are older series.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on the same boat. I recently watched, too. And enjoyed but overall ranking in mine is not so high. I also wonder what makes it to the top. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Steins;Gate is a lot better when it's the first anime you've seen because it's more accessible to a western audience. It was the first anime I ever saw and I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread; I recently *rewatched* it a year after being introduced to anime and whilst I still thought it was great, it wasn't as incredible as I remembered it being. 
>> ARTICLE
It has good character development, a time travel mechanic that makes sense and is explained well, and isn't based on magic. 
>> ARTICLE
[We also had a Best Anime bracket just a few months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/32yq8d/ranimes_favourite_anime_of_all_time_and_the/)
>> ARTICLE
Yep, and I did this anyway since the results could be different due to that one being a head-to-head tournament kinda thing and this just being raw favorites.
>> ARTICLE
It's nice seeing Higurashi, Mawaru Penguindrum and Great Teacher Onizuka on this list. Looks like r/anime's taste isn't so bad after all. 

How many votes did each of the Fate series get individually OP?

>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure, I was too far into it before realizing I should have kept track of them individually. I think it was about 40% F/Zero, 30% UBW and 30% F/SN
>> ARTICLE
>30% F/SN

That doesn't seem right... Maybe it would get like 5% vote if we were just talking about favorite in the Fate series, but favorite anime, on /r/anime? Nah, no way man.

EDIT: Okay i've decided to count up all of the Fate votes using Ctrl f.

Fate/Zero - 54 (I searched for "Fate/Zero" and "Fate Zero" and "F/Z")

Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works - 14 (I searched for UBW, Unlimited Blade Works, Fate/Stay Night and Fate Stay Night)

Fate/Stay Night - 2 (Although one didn't specify if UBW or DEEN.) and (I searched for Fate/Stay Night and DEEN)

There was also one vote that said "Fate Zero/sn" so I don't know who to give that to...
>> ARTICLE
Well at least I knew zero was more popular than the others :P haha
>> ARTICLE
Because it's by far the best.
>> ARTICLE
Prisma illya says Hi 

Also the fights in Prisma illya>>> Fate/zero Batcave and Unlimited flashy works final fight. Ufotable can learn from Silver Link.
>> ARTICLE
But don't people usually say the popular stuff is shit, like sao or naruto? So shouldn't that mean that fate/zero is actually the worst, because it's so popular?
>> ARTICLE
popular irl =/= popular on r/anime


>> ARTICLE
If anyone dares to say anything about ufotable's Fate adaptation I'll punch them hard
>> ARTICLE
Just occasionally something becomes popular because it is actually good. And it's not as if fate/zero is mainstream.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it kinda is.
>> ARTICLE
Not Naruto and SAO level, the stuff that even people who hardly watch any anime at all know about.
>> ARTICLE
That's true, but when someone wants to watch more anime after AoT/SAO, Fate/Zero is often recommended (for good reason, but still)
>> ARTICLE
Disappointing that Space Dandy didn't make it onto this list. :(
>> ARTICLE
Because it was too episodic
>> ARTICLE
Anything that has the hand of Shinichiro Watanabe on it should be a contender for best anime.
>> ARTICLE
As much as I love it, I don't see that many people naming it their 'favourite anime' sadly : /
>> ARTICLE
proud #95 represent!
>> ARTICLE
I am just happy that Hajime no Ippo made it onto the list. That shit was the first anime that really changed me (for the better, clanned changed me in the sense that it fucked me up).
>> ARTICLE
 I'm surprised Zankyou no terror ranked so low I liked that it. It was pretty good or atleast to me it was haha
>> ARTICLE
It is pretty good it's just that 5 is a very bad character that made a lot of people dislike the show.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh ok I can see that. She started out as a villian but was really a spiteful gf -__- haha
>> ARTICLE
Whos 5? I don't remember any 5 character. Zankyou no Terror was pretty much flawless. Shame it was only 7 episodes long.
>> ARTICLE
Good point! I'm probably thinking of another anime. I would like a sequel to know what happens to 9 and 12.
>> ARTICLE
It still made the top 100. There are thousands of anime out there, so that's really good.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I've only completed 3 out of the Top 10, but basically watched everything from 18 to 36. Interesting, but if I had to make a guess it's because the top one's tend to be quite long.

+1 for naruto
>> ARTICLE
I don't see how Steins;Gate can be considered #1. It's great but it has serious flaws. There are much better anime ranked way lower on this list (Madoka, Tatami Galaxy, Mawaru Penguindrum).
>> ARTICLE
You'll be able to dig out flaws in every show if you look for them, and besides, when has a list like that ever been more than a popularity contest, anyway? It's not as though anyone's claiming that Steins;Gate's a flawless masterpiece. 
>> ARTICLE
maybe a lot of people had it on 3?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, steins;gate was more commonly 2 or 3 than 1
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the list would be more accurate if you had counted 1) thrice and 2) twice.

That would have been a lot of work though :O
>> ARTICLE
A weighted system, like CFB AP/BCS rankings instead of just a "mentions" poll. 
>> ARTICLE
That's subjective. I enjoyed the show a lot and loved the characters, and imo the pacing was good for me. I liked it more than Madoka, and Mawaru. No one's claiming it's flawless, but that it's a fantastic show (I mean it's #2 on MAL).
>> ARTICLE
That feeling when the top 3 are in you're too 5 (or will be when I see the last few episodes of HxH)
>> ARTICLE
Well from what I put in that top 10 thread the other day only one of my top 10 aren't on this list.  And it's a stand alone movie, so...
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see my favorites (Kino's Journey, Aria the Origination, FLCL, FMA:B, Toradora) all represented, as well as a few of my favorite lesser-known titles (Uchoten Kazoku, Cross Game, Planetes).

And apparently I've seen 79% of the listed titles. Interesting.

Firstly, nice work in compiling the data together (manually, I assume?)

In terms of feedback, I have two things: one, when reporting the results, identically numbered items should be tied in rank with each other. So instead of having the shows with count of 4 being ranked 76-91, they all would be ranked as 76th (or 76th-91st if you want to be technical about it.  
Second, I think that a weighting system would be more ideal for doing tiebreakers if you wanted to bother (but then you would have to list those results to show why they ended up separated in rank).  
So the "sort order" if you will, would be Total Count > 1sts > 2nds > 3rds. Rank by Total Count, if group tie, rank within group by 1sts, and so on. I know it's a quite a bit more work for the all of the inevitable ties, but more transparency ~~will muffle the salty /r/anime users~~ is always awesome.

what i find funny is that the 1st ep of hxh and steins were pretty boring but the shows turned out so well
>> ARTICLE
People are usually responsive with great fervor when others bring it up but I can't help but ask:

What's so good about Steins;gate? I watched it and it was good; I rated it 8/10. But it really wasn't anything above that for me. 

The drama (character death(s) or separations) did not give me a suspension of disbelief, meaning the writing behind it wasn't the best. I'll explain what I mean: in the best works of fiction, the setting and characters are presented in a way that can get the viewer invested in the events of the series despite being aware it's fiction. Like in Hunter x Hunter, Meruem and Komugi; or in Anohana, most characters. I won't spoil them, and you'll understand what I'm talking about if you've watched. I never felt like I cared about the character(s) dying or being separated from Okabe in Steins;gate.

Speaking of characters in Steins;gate, they are interesting to the point where they are **not** a bore to watch. That's fine if the goal is to be just a decent anime. But they really weren't anything deeper than that. The character development was more about their individual circumstances, and less about how it affected their mentality, as I would have liked. For example, the unfortunate distancing between Feyris and her father. Sure that's kind of sad, but we don't see how it affects her character by having that problem. She's the same with and without the circumstances. Maybe she's good at hiding her sadness via a facade, but at least give the viewer an idea of what ways it affects Feyris's mentality. A great example of such a thing being done correctly is from Hunter Hunter: the childhood flashback of Gyro (the NGL king/druglord) and his alcoholic father. You're clearly shown what kind of devoted child Gyro was, and the events that made him change to who he is. This is just a side character and Togashi gave him such a powerful backstory. Netero's training in the mountains for his change was also superb. An argument against this is, Steins;gate was too short-running to develop its characters much. Then you can compare it to Cowboy Bebop or even Toradora, both of which give a lot of emphasis to why characters became how they are.

I have issues with the plot, although those complaints are more subjective than the above (I was annoyed that Okabe spent the entire "death repeat" arc learning there are consequences messing with time, only to be able to change the past as he pleases in the end with **no** consequence; what was the point of his learning then?!) . Some people may prefer a happy ending at the expense of abandoned development, so I can't criticize the anime on that part.

Overall the show was enjoyable, but I'm very confused how people treat it as a masterpiece. People imply it's a very cerebral show, like western television's The Affair or Mr Robot, but it's really not. It's a show on the level of things like Code Geass or Afro Samurai. It's a fun watch for many people, but none of the plot or characters are anything beyond that. 


>> ARTICLE
I find it odd you mention Feyris. The effects on her mental state are very clear. [spoilers](#s "The change from the loss of her father literally warps Tokyo. She loses herself to the moe because she has no other way to escape the guilt. It is not until her interaction with Okabe that she is ever able to accept it and move on.") Mind you, they don't explicitly spell this out for you. It is what you infer from her actions and the affect on the environment.

What it sounds like is you just don't like the characters. That is the common breaking point when people don't like the show as much. People who love the show are also the ones who adore the characters. This is personal preference more than anything. I watched a lot of Hunter x Hunter and I never got invested in the characters. But I didn't like them much in the first place, so it colors my opinion. Same thing, different show.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really care about Steins;Gate characters at all, I rated it 9/10 for the excellent and original plot. Maybe if you think about Steins;Gate as a pure sci-fi show, it would be much more enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is my top anime, I disagree that the characters need to be deeper than they were in the show. To me I really like smaller scale stores that are about the characters in circumstances, this is what makes the show shine to me. The amount of anime that just scale out of proportion compared to the start, or even from the beginning, cause me to lose interest. Love the characters, well thought out plot, for me it was well paced and held my attention. Further on wanting deeper characters, a lot of people like how they don't all just have some dramatic backstory that shaped who they are but are just friends only just finished school.

I don't know what could be number one that would make everyone happy because no show is perfect, I don't think all the people who have it at number 1 think of it as a masterpiece just their favorite show. What show would you even call a masterpiece and expect people to agree with? Do you expect everyone to like something more than just the enjoyment they have from watching it? 

I think maybe your just expecting the number 1 for most people to be more than just the show they most enjoy, and expect the audience to want more than just enjoyment of a show. A lot of people just enjoyed watching it the most and don't care about appreciating some show because its a classic, or has some deeper level to it.

Is HxH really that good? It's on my plan to watch but ep count kind of makes me put it off every time I check to see what to watch next.

Does it have fillers and meaningless episodes like other long, fighting anime or is it more like FMA where every episode has meaning to it?
>> ARTICLE
HxH doesn't have any filler (except for 2 recap episode, 13 and 26 I believe) and you should skip those. It's praised mostly because it breaks the shounen mold of bullshit powerups and other things.

It's way less about the fights and has a really good story (especially the chimera ant arc), but the fights are still great and well animated anyway.

Just don't go into it with too high of expectations because it'll ruin it (along with literally any other show ever, assumptions ruin things).

>> ARTICLE
We actually already had a [contest for this](http://animebracket.com/results/-r-anime-s-favourite-anime-of-all-time/?group=finals)
>> ARTICLE
The results for that were utterly different from this though.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it also included a larger amount of people which would explain why it was different.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that is how it works. The sample size is large enough to consider it a reasonably accurate.

Brackets operate differently to just straight up voting for your favourite anime, HxH didn't do so well in the brackets, but is no.2 over here. Brackets are more 'do you like anime A or anime B more?', people that may like anime A may REALLY like it, but people that like anime B more may just, *kind of* like it, while this is a straight up, what is your favourite.

A good example is AoT, ranks 33 on this list, but it beat out Toradora in the contest whilst Toradora ranks 20 on this list. Admitedly, results come out simular, but they are taking different types of data here.

edit: Too simplify it, this is taking a tally of how many people consider each anime their favourite anime.

Anime bracket did a vote of how many people liked anime A over anime B, not what was their favourite. 
>> ARTICLE
That's not a good argument, simply because of how the brackets are organized. The way it works is that the entries with the highest seeds go against the entires with the lowest seeds first. Meaning the ones who were voted in more, go against the ones who were voted in the least.

Besides, we can just look at the seeding for each show either way to nullify that argument.

1. Steins;Gate

2. FMA:B

3. Code Geass

4. FMA

5. Gurren Lagann

6. Fate/Zero

7. Toradora 

8. NGE

9. Kill la Kill

10. AoT

Considering the contest had a larger amount of people, rather than just regulars of /r/anime I believe the contest more. The problem with the OP's list is that its literally just people giving their top 3, and a lot of the time it wasn't even just that, they would list their top 10. Shows like Toradora and Hunter x Hunter have proved time and time again that their audience is just a vocal minority, in the contests they always get knocked out and aren't seeded as high as you would believe on /r/anime. However, shows like Steins;Gate, FMA:B and Monogatari have consistently gotten to the top in every type of contest with a large amount of people here. Then you have shows like Attack on Titan or Dragon Ball Z which have fanbases larger than you would imagine, given how poorly /r/anime will talk about them sometimes.

Though keep in mind i'm not saying that contest voting is the best way to gauge what a group of people think is the best, but I believe its more accurate than the way OP tallied up the votes- no offense.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just pointing out this is a different type of Data that has been collected here. 

If you had to answer what was r/anime's favourite anime, then the bracket would probably be your best bet, it is a mash up of everyone's opinion from r/anime.

If you had to answer what is the most common anime people consider their favourite anime on r/anime, this 'tally' would be more accurate. This is a different, there is no better or worse system between the two.
>> ARTICLE
My top two are the exact same as r/anime in the same order, I must have good taste.

Clannad? Wait what? I hear NOTHING but how much people hate that show, but it's top 10?

Why do people still stop at 1080p?

This is the world of 4k!

Even 1080p images look low res on my PHONE.
>> ARTICLE
Because size reasons. 4k is ~4 times the size of 1080p. Downloading 1400+ images in 4k resolution would most likely blowout all of my internet allowance, and my internet isn't fast either so it would take several days to download. Heck, most of the anime I watch is in 720p, one for internet reasons and two because honestly there isn't a huge difference between 720p and 1080p,  it is more than clear enough to see what is going on in each scene.
>> ARTICLE
For video, yeah.

For wallpapers? That's ridiculous.

Also, internet allowance? that's a thing?
>> ARTICLE
By 'internet allowance' I meant data cap, which is very much a thing in a lot of countries (I'm in India, for example).

Something I forgot to mention about your first comment. 1080p cannot possibly look low resolution on your phone, in comparison to 4k. Unless you are scrolling dozens of times without looking at the whole picture it will not be in 4k resolution. Even on my laptop, which is 1080p, without zooming out I see 4 different images and if I zoom out it would look no different from the 1080p version as my screen can't magically increase in resolution or size.
>> ARTICLE
No, I mean when applied.

My phone is **1920x1080** in horizontal.

In vertical is **1080x1920**.

Phones are generally used in vertical orientation.

this means the image needs to be stretched nearly 2x to fill the screen. Making the image need to be either made for phones (cutting out it's application as a desktop wallpaper), or be **3413x1920**.

 That just makes it odd, so let's round it to up to 4k at **4096x2160**.

And that really sucks about data allowances. I used 2gb a day on my phone alone.

#### Other Lists

I used my data set to create some other lists. I figured some of them may be interesting, though most of them turned out not to be.

###### [Weighted Favorites](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=969058587)

[One person who used favorites in the past](http://animetics.net/2015/01/15/fun-with-numbers-myanimelists-sequel-problem-should-and-can-be-fixed/) used a weighted favorites score rather than the favorites percentage that I use. This system treats each favorite as an additional score worth 11. This system takes advantage of the *MyAnimeList* score, but I don't like it because it does not get rid of the extraneous sequels on the top list.

###### [Most Scores of 10](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=225861329)

Anime with the largest % of scores worth 10. This list ends up closely mirroring the [regular *MyAnimeList* top anime list](http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php) (the highest ranked series would naturally receive more 10s).

###### [Most Scores of 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=234535405)

Anime with the largest % of scores worth 1. At a brief glance, it seems like there are a bunch of anime that are known for being bad (anime that people love to hate), e.g., [Mars of Destruction](http://myanimelist.net/anime/413/Mars_of_Destruction/stats).

###### [Avg. of Scores from 2 to 10](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=725274167)

The mean of scores from 2 to 10, excluding 1 votes. I include all votes from an anime's "Stats", including [scores that normally wouldn't count](http://myanimelist.net/info.php?go=topanime). I figured that a lot of 1 scores are overreactions (and are there people downvoting sequels just to clean up *MAL*'s top list?) and wanted to see what would happen if I exclude them.

###### [Most Planned To Watch](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=332780832)

Ends up being cluttered due to upcoming releases that people are looking forward to / recent releases which haven't yet been subbed. There's no good way of automatically filtering out these released-but-unsubbed ones without doing it manually.

Perhaps a list of only TV series would be more interesting. The top planned to watch TV series are *[Myriad Colors Phantom World](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31442/Musaigen_no_Phantom_World)* (remember the data is from Jan. 6, before this winter season got rolling) -- *Kyoto Animation* projects are generally highly anticipated -- and *[Aria the Origination](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3297/Aria_The_Origination)* -- it probably has a lot of planned viewers because of how highly-rated it is, but most people don't actually get to it because there are two prequel seasons which are fairly difficult to get through.

###### [Most On-Hold](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=1990281603)

Seems to have a bunch of longer-running series?

###### [Most Dropped](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=77782877)

Not sure what the pattern is.
>> ARTICLE
Shit, Mushishi Zoku rises 22 places if you remove the ones.

> it probably has a lot of planned viewers because of how highly-rated it is, but most people don't actually get to it because there are two prequel seasons which are fairly difficult to get through.

I didn't really think Aria the Origination was much different in quality from the first two seasons. I think Aria just tends to drop *a lot* of people along the way.
>> ARTICLE
People who drop the *Aria* series are likely drop it after *Animation*. If you can get past that, then you're much more likely to eventually get through *Natural* and *Origination*.

That's why *Natural* benefits so much from the sequel effect. It has a high score yet a low number of favorites.

However, *Origination* has both a high score and a high number of favorites, so people legitimately think that it's great compared to the rest of the series (myself included). Assuming your *MAL* is up-to-date, you haven't finished *Origination* yet -- you might just revise your opinion once you finish the series.
>> ARTICLE
K, you caught me, I got to Origination, saw no difference in quality, and put it in hold. I don't really see how it can change, it's episodic and every next episode is more or less like the last.

When it comes to sequels, I think people tend to conserve their favorites by reserving it for the last session of the series, to cap off the series.
>> ARTICLE
Aria is all about the characters slowly changing. The Origination is about them really striving to become Primas and you can see the change once you look back from the end of the series to the beginning. There's a scene with Alice in Origination that's similar to one from the first season but she behaves very differently.

There's definite change in the The Origination and a rough plot, especially in the second half of the season. It's not the same as the other two.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on episode 10 and I'm still not really seeing any major changes in quality. You're right that there is character development that gradually occurs, but the core nature of the series is not changed.
>> ARTICLE
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. For me, episode 9 (10 on Hulu since it counts episode 5.5 as 6) is a truly spectacular episode and so are episodes 11 through 13 (12 to 14). The plot becomes evident around that episode, but started much earlier.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 8 and 9 are spectacular, especially since I'm a Alice fan.
>> ARTICLE
I think Episode 9 is one of the great episodes of anime. Episodes 11 through 13 really tie everything together and wrap up the series beautifully.
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait to watch the rest of it. But I'm taking it slowly, an episode a day or less. I've been watching this for months.
>> ARTICLE
> K, you caught me, I got to Origination, saw no difference in quality, and put it in hold. I don't really see how it can change, it's episodic and every next episode is more or less like the last.

That's like saying "I got to *After Story*, saw no difference in quality [since the first few episodes of *After Story* are similar to the original *Clannad*], and put it in hold. I don't really see how it can change."

> When it comes to sequels, I think people tend to conserve their favorites by reserving it for the last session of the series, to cap off the series.

This is demonstrably false either way you look at it:

- For series where the TV sequels don't finish the series (e.g., *Gintama*, *Mushishi*, *Natsume Yuujinchou*), only the first season receives a high number of favorites, and the following/final series receive almost nothing.

- For series where the TV sequels end the story (e.g., *Kuroko 3rd Season*, *Fate/Zero 2nd Season*, *Unlimited Blade Works 2nd Season*, *Code Geass R2*, *Bakuman 3*, *Higurashi Kai*, and many more): the first season always has the highest number of favorites.

People do not "conserve" favorites for the final season. If they like a series, they'll tend to favorite the first season.

The only exceptions are stuff like *Clannad: After Story* and *Aria the Origination*, indicating that they're better than the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
After Story is not an episodic slice of life with no real changes in quality between episode or overall story. Since you're being an asshole and are utterly immune to reason, this is the end of your conversation, you don't deserve to have me read the rest of your comment, I'm disabling inbox replies, and blocking you via RSS.

From the first 30.

5 are "girl shit". Anime made just for girls, most MAL users are male.

7 are "kiddy shit". Nobody really wants to watch an anime meant for elementary schoolers any more than they want to watch Nick Jr. (3 of them are forever long as well)

14 are "shit". Mixed bag between shitty CG, no existent story, wut budget, and boobs-just-for-they-hey.

2 are "no homo". Manly man shows about men doing man stuff. Probably a good show for your Harley-Davidson riding uncle.

The last two are Heroman--an American made story for Japan. Stan Lee you can't make anime. Just stahp. And Saint Seiya Omega which I call "dem rose colored glasses finally fell off lol".

aria in the top 10 where it belongs. 

Great list btw, brings a fresh perspective to the beaten to death top 10 lists. 
>> ARTICLE
Your system placed LoGH on the #1 spot. For that alone, this is leagues ahead of the current one.
>> ARTICLE
It helps that the show is not just something someone picks up unless they know what they are getting into. It's not like picking up a 12 or 24 episode show. I'm sure many people have had moments where they pick up a 12 or 24 episode show based on something small like seeing a gif from it or hearing about it from a friend but I think it's safe to say that's not enough to convince them to dedicate themselves to ~100 episodes.

This is why the top 4 are all really long shows. People who watch(ed) it either knew what they were going into or have followed it for several years so it only makes sense that there is a good ratio of favorites. Ranking by favorites is ruined by the flaw of having long running shows as they will almost always have a strong fanbase.

I picked up ranma 1/2 (anime, 161 eps) from a single manga panel, but I've never had issues with long shows.

Not saying it's true for everyone but I think we can agree that it's probably still true generally.

as a major ranked list nerd, I love you for this
>> ARTICLE
Personally I only have 4 anime listed under my favorites because I only want to include the best of the best, but other people use all 10 of their slots and as such their tastes would be more strongly represented than people like me. Unless of course you assume that people who use all their favorite slots have statistically identical taste to those who don't it, which seems unlikely. I doubt this could easily be rectified, perhaps assigning less weight to favorites from people as they have more favorites would fix the problem but that would also make the task of composing such a list much more difficult.
>> ARTICLE
I think the best way would be to adjust the weight given to favorites by the percent of shows a person has listed as their favorites (and allow people to mark unlimited favorites). This could also somewhat address the drastic rise of some of the hugely popular shounens (or if they don't actually drop, it would address the criticisms that would be placed against their place on the list).
>> ARTICLE
That's an interesting way to use it. I always thought everyone used the favorites spot as a personal top 10 list.

>Movies suffer. Great movies like Spirited Away, Wolf Children, and Princess Mononoke drop 329, 251, and 308 places, respectively. People seem reluctant to put movies in their Favorites list, probably preferring to use the limited number of favorites for TV series instead.

Personally I think this is because movies tend to be more universally liked, so if I cram my favorites with 5 Ghibli movies that doesn't really say much about my personal tastes compared to having 5 different series. So in my mind I just ignore movies in that sense. Maybe MAL should have a separate favorites list for them.

You have quite a lot of 10s, so I'll just throw this out there to you as an experiment:  if you were to rank all of your 10s by however you're currently ranking your favorites without regard to limits or displaying taste, how many of your top 5 would be movies?  

I'm asking because I'm wondering if the length of a series versus the length of a movie (particularly because a series will mostly not be watched entirely in one chunk) leads people to feel more strongly about them after it's over.  Say, if you loved Spirited Away, well, that was two hours that you were sitting there, it's done, and you rate it.  But if you loved Nagi no Asukara, you were watching it, going to bed, thinking about it a bit til you could keep watching it, growing more attached to it while you were still in the middle of watching it, then you finish it a few days later and rate it.  So when you think about what to put on your favorites, you were wrapped up in NnA for much longer.  

Just spitballing, I dunno.  
>> ARTICLE
>You have quite a lot of 10s

I mean, not really. I have less 10s than 9s, 8s, or 7s and about the same as 6s.

Hmm well you make a good point there. While I feel really strongly about my top 2, Clannad and Nagi Asu, probably due to the attachment over time (also because I think they are just incredible works of animation) I would at least put my favorite movies in the next two spots, like Nausicaa and Wolf Children. 

I think these share at least a little bit of the attachment factor because I've seen Wolf Children 3 or 4 times now and Nausicaa has an incredible and much much longer manga which I've read twice so I think I'm more fond of it by association. 

>then you finish it a few days later and rate it.

Implying I didn't finish Nagi in under 2 days flat... :P

Thanks for your thoughts.  

> I mean, not really. I have less 10s than 9s, 8s, or 7s and about the same as 6s.  

All about perspective here, I guess, what with my 1 10 out of 233.  Basically what I was getting at is that you had more 10s than favorite slots.
>> ARTICLE
Well it seems to me like you are trying you keep your scores on a Gaussian/Normal curve.... however logically this is not a correct thing to do because you don't sample anime randomly. Instead, you watch series that look good to you or are well-rated. If you watched every single anime that came out every season, naturally it should follow a normal bell curve because most will be average, but no one does that. 

However if your rate purely for your own reference, rating them in relation to each other, not caring about their scores in relation to every other anime released, then of course it makes more sense to do this. 

Personally I care about how an anime compares to every other anime that I have or haven't seen so I rate accordingly. In this way it makes perfect sense to have many highly scored series, since I chose and watched them with those expectations. 

Although even with a Gaussian distribution, you should still have more than one 10 out of 233 so I think you are just being overly critical. 
>> ARTICLE
To be clear, I didn't intend my comment as a criticism at all - people use whatever scale is a best fit for their goals.  

Rating discussion gets really navel-gazey really easily, so sorry in advance.  That said, here's why I think my scale developed as it did:

* Months or years after watching, it's much easier to properly rescore shows to compress the scale if needed (in order to say, push everything up to accommodate stumbling across a new low that's much worse than any other 1) than to expand it if it turns out to have been too compressed (e.g., turning 10s into 9s and 10s).  
* Using the entire scale at any given time makes my preferences as clear as possible for purposes of e.g., recommendations.   

I am not aiming for any given kind of curve at all - it just happened that way.  If you look at my last edited dates, I virtually never rescore after the fact (I can think of three examples offhand, two of which were pushing 10s to 9s, excepting my original very early expansion to the whole scale about 3 months after I started when I had about 30 total entries) and if you look closely enough at the distribution it's pretty lumpy at points (say, 1 vs 2).  My only thought process at this point (and it's been this way since I filled in the last of the 10 numbers with my 41st entry) is "which set of anime (at a given score) does this anime fit best next to, as far as my enjoyment is concerned?"  I'd say that 4 is my standard for "liked and disliked this equally".

I'd love to be lucky enough to watch only 5+s forever.  But I can't predict things that will *definitely* hit that with any reasonable accuracy (outside of a one specific type of anime, which is limited enough, has enough episodes in any given entry, and has few enough subtitled entries that I don't want to overload myself with it all at once, particularly because I won't appreciate it quite as much that way).  I never watch something that I don't anticipate enjoying (though I'll leave contracts open to that possibility in the future).

Also, I tend to watch more movies and short OVAs than most people, as far as I can tell, and I'm willing to take more chances on things that short - I never expected to like my 10 *that* much before watching it.  My average score on those is significantly lower than my average series score.  

As far as my 10 specifically goes, the end of the scale gets really tricky, particularly without a series currently there, but it's so rarefied that I just don't think anything else measures up enough to Angel's Egg that it'd belong there rather than with my 9s (which I still love a lot, obviously).  I deeply loved every bit of about 83% of my strongest 9, whereas for Angel's Egg it was more like 96% of it.  So I'm content leaving it alone for now.  

Finally, I'm really not sure I agree with the idea that the population of anime will converge to a normal or Gaussian curve.  If there's a reason you think it really does, we can discuss this more in-depth, but "90% of everything is crap" is a common saying for a reason, and as far as anime specifically is concerned, people love to complain about "generic LN adaptations" or whatever dominating a given season.  So if I'm pulling from a population with a ton of would-be-very-low-rated entries based on my preferences, then the shape of my curve makes a lot of sense.  
>> ARTICLE
This is exactly why I decided to use the % of favorites as my metric. Scoring systems vary too wildly between different users, but at least the favorites vary a bit less.
>> ARTICLE
>because you don't sample anime randomly

Even if you *did* sample anime randomly, the Central Limit Theorem doesn't apply, so there's no strong reason to expect a normal distribution.
>> ARTICLE
Why does it not apply? 
>> ARTICLE
For it to apply, there have to be a large number of independent variables with E[X]=0 (in that they factor into the rating positively or negatively, and are expected to factor into the score in a neutral way) that are summed to form an anime "score."  This doesn't really apply (at least, I would not expect for most people).  For me, I don't take off for "flaws" at all (what matters is that *something* works, and hopefully really well, rather than that everything works).  Other people can't talk about anything except "flaws."
>> ARTICLE
For this purpose, I'm assuming that it doesnt matter exactly *how* people rate shows, rather that *people* are doing the rating and that the variables of people's specific tastes and the varying quality of anime in general are going to combine together to create a normal curve. 

Lets look at engalleon's distribution- http://graph.anime.plus/engalleons/ratings,anime 

Whether he intended it or not, its almost a perfect Gaussian distribution. Even if we look at [the global stats](http://graph.anime.plus/s/globals) it follows a normal curve shifted up about a sigma or so, which is expected. 
>> ARTICLE
>Even if we look at the global stats 

Ahh, but the CLT *does* apply to global stats, because individual user rating events *are* independent and have a consistent E[X].

>Whether he intended it or not, its almost a perfect Gaussian distribution.

Suppose "quality" is exponentially distributed (motivated, say, by that awful too-often-quoted law).  Suppose further that a user only watches a show if its expected quality is above a certain threshold (say, E[X] >= 5) but sometimes they're wrong (but not that often).  From a distance, their score distribution will "look" normal, but it's not actually.  Engalleon's distribution has a much fatter upper tail than lower tail, which is something you'd expect under my model, but not under a normal distribution.
>> ARTICLE
>More importantly, there are a handful of sequels which stand head and shoulders above the rest of their respective series. Clannad: After Story is a prime example -- even people who dislike Clannad generally love After Story, so it makes sense to treat the sequel as its own, separate piece of work.

That was my problem with the combined list. If the entire Clannad series were combined, I would still "favorite" it. The ending was that good. I don't think it's fair to try and take the average of my S1 and S2 scores and use it to judge my score for the entire series - if I were looking at the entire franchise as a whole, I would take a more holistic view of things. Yeah the first season isn't up to par with the second, but it's necessary to understand Tomoya's character.
>> ARTICLE
Kind of off topic, but I actually pretty heavily disagree with the comments on Clannad. Pretty much all the character development necessary for the emotional moments in After Story to work is *in* After story (and not just after story but the portions after Tomoya exits highschool which starts around episode 9 iirc). The rest of the background is somewhat necessary to set up the story, but I don't think anything significant would be lost by condensing it immensely (to say, 5-6 episodes from the current amount of ~30 episodes, removing all the side arcs and just setting up Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship). 

I also find it interesting that you say the ending is 'that good', as while many of the portions before it are highly praised the ending is often heavily criticized.

I mean the whole final 15 episodes.

Looks like I haven't put Aria high enough on my PTW list.  

Also adding The Rose Of Versailles.  Thanks for this, OP!
>> ARTICLE
*Aria the Origination* is actually my favorite anime series of all time, but I have to **strongly caution you**. The series is not at all easy to get into. The *Aria* series is the slowest paced series I've ever seen, and that causes a lot of people to drop the show. It's a series that can/should take months to finish.

Also, keep in mind you'll need to get through *Aria the Animation* and *Aria the Natural* before going on to *Aria the Origination*.
>> ARTICLE
Good to know that it's a slow pace, I'll remember that, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
To give some more insight how long it can take to watch this:

I've started watching Aria the *Animation* on the 21st of December 2014 and now I'm 15 episodes into Aria the *Natural*.

Then again I really want to keep this show for as long as possible, just so I can watch it whenever I'm feeling down.
>> ARTICLE
When you eventually finish Aria, there's Tamayura and Sketchbook to try. I'm on my third re-watch of Aria. There's some episodes of The Origination I think are amongst the best episodes of all anime.

I'll probably restart at The Animation once I've finished Origination. It's nice to have a show like Aria that you can turn to.
>> ARTICLE
I've already seen Tamayura, except for the most recent OVAs, and Sketchbook goes right onto my plan-to-watch list, thanks for the recommendation.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't actually watched Sketchbook yet, I've just heard about it and I plan to watch it soon, so I thought I'd share. I heard it discussed in the same context as Tamayura and Aria so it's a good bet that I (and possibly you) will like it too.
>> ARTICLE
Great work.  A few thoughts:  

> People seem reluctant to put movies in their Favorites list, probably preferring to use the limited number of favorites for TV series instead.  

I feel like a more important factor here is that people are a lot more likely to watch (and score) a movie that they don't like than to watch a series they don't like long enough for their score to count, particularly because a lot of people don't score their drops, regardless of how many episodes they watch.  

> Popular anime do better in this list.  

The 20% rule for scores also goes a long way to explaining this difference.  Those series aren't just popular, they're rather long.  You'd need to watch 74 episodes of Bleach to show up in its denominator under this measure.  
>> ARTICLE

I disagree.

Yes, it's true that people drop movies less than TV series. However, if people don't like a movie and finish/score it, then they'll score it lowly, and this should be clearly reflected in the *MAL* score. Yet so many movies score extremely highly and rank in the top 25, so these people who dislike a movie but finish and score it are not having that much of an effect.

If you take a look at the distribution of scores from something like *[Spirited Away](http://myanimelist.net/anime/199/Sen_to_Chihiro_no_Kamikakushi/stats)* vs. *[Your Lie In April](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/stats)*, you'll notice that the distributions are really similar; *Spirited Away* actually has a higher distribution of votes than *Your Lie In April*, yet *Spirited Away* has a much, much lower percentage of favorites.

If anything, having more people finish and score a movie would result in a *lower* score because there will be more people who dislike it scoring it low, whereas people who dislike a TV series would drop it early and not have their scores count.

> The 20% rule for scores also goes a long way to explaining this difference. Those series aren't just popular, they're rather long. You'd need to watch 74 episodes of Bleach to show up in its denominator under this measure.

Yes, it seems like being long-running has some effect. I doubt this is the main reason, however. appu1232 suggested accounting for the 20% rule by including dropped and on-hold members, and I suspect long-running series like *Bleach* will still do well.

I think it's more a matter of just being popular / something that a casual viewer is more likely to see. I like the explanation in the [first half of this comment](http://animetics.net/2015/01/15/fun-with-numbers-myanimelists-sequel-problem-should-and-can-be-fixed/#comment-8676). Note that popular series like *Attack on Titan* and *Sword Art Online* also have a high proportion of favorites, but they are of a standard length.
>> ARTICLE
I misinterpreted/misread your comment about movies, I guess.  What you're saying here makes sense.  

On the popularity side, I agree that that both the length and the popularity are factors - though as far as your examples go, Attack on Titan barely benefits (up 5), and Sword Art Online, as a polarizing series, will naturally benefit from this method of analysis regardless of its massive popularity.  School Days is one example of a less popular thing that benefits similarly due to the polarization.  Angel's Egg, despite being a one-shot OVA, also gets a huge boost here (though see below for another factor).  I'm not hugely familiar with polarizing anime beyond those, though, so I can't look much further.  

Another interesting thing I noticed, just eyeballing it, is that this works against recency bias pretty well (possibly indirectly through relative obscurity).  Even something as short, as not particularly niche, and as not particularly polarizing as, say, Honey and Clover benefits pretty strongly here.  This makes sense, too, in that people are a lot more to watch a given thing from 2015 that doesn't hold massive appeal to them than they are to watch something from 2005, and so the average H&C watcher is a lot more likely to really dig it than the average watcher of much of anything from 2015, even though the H&C watcher will (generally) have more anime competing for those favorite slots.
>> ARTICLE
It's cool that a lot of relatively niche genres (mecha, mahou shoujo) get a better representation in the top 100. I'm also surprised to see Armoured trooper VOTOMS at #42, I should probably prioritize watching it now.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently makes #197 on the critics' list too. I haven't seen it myself, but part of the reason I made this list was to find series like this.

Do be careful though, because something being high on the favorites list doesn't mean you'll like it. As you said, there are a lot of niche shows on the list, and it's likely that they're somewhat polarizing shows and will appeal to only a small number of users (but enough to get a high proportion of favorites).
>> ARTICLE
Votoms is pretty fun! It deliberately changes itself every cours or so which is interesting, too.
>> ARTICLE
I think one important thing to note about this is that the reason shows such as LoGH, One Piece, Fairy Tail, Gintama, etc. are so high on the list is because of the shear number of episodes. It's not hard to imagine that only people who know what they are going into will watch a long running show. It's not like picking up a 12 episode show because you saw a gif of a cute girl from it or something. People who watch these anime are very likely to end up liking and favoriting it.

Personally, I think it shouldn't just include the people that scored it, but also the people that put it on-hold and dropped it too. The long shows are still going to be higher, but it wouldn't dominate the top 5 entries either I'd imagine.
>> ARTICLE
That's a good idea. I'll try that once I have time later today. I suspect that it won't make much of a difference though -- something like *One Piece* will still have around 13% favorites.

I believe that it's more due to the series being popular, so casual viewers are more likely to watch it (and thus favorite it, since they haven't watched as many different shows). I like the explanation in the [first half of this comment](http://animetics.net/2015/01/15/fun-with-numbers-myanimelists-sequel-problem-should-and-can-be-fixed/#comment-8676). This also explains why shows like *Attack on Titan* and *Sword Art Online* rank so highly in the favorites list even though they have a standard number of episodes.
>> ARTICLE
The reasoning for using favorites seems off to me.
>    More intuitive: Saying that something scores a 9.2 is pretty abstract, but saying that something is your favorite is a lot more natural, not relying on any arbitrary scale.

Favorites aren't any more or less arbitrary than a rating; they are just binary.

>    Consistent across different users: One user may never give a 10, believing that nothing deserves a "perfect" score, while another user may give 10s to any remotely entertaining series. However, a favorite is an idea that's generally consistent across different people, no matter how they may score a show.

Again, people will value favorites differently.

>    Limited number of favorites: Each user has a limited number of favorites to dole out. Since you cannot spam favorites, each favorite is somewhat valuable, and people will generally only favorite something that they genuinely like.

Just looking at a fringe case here: everyone's 11th favorite show could have a 0 "favorite" rating even though it is only slightly behind 10th.

>> ARTICLE
>Favorites aren't any more or less arbitrary than a rating; they are just binary.

There's psychological evidence that we're better at processing smaller numbers linearly than numbers >4. (See: the subitizing range for humans and the Weber-Fechner law)

>everyone's 11th favorite show could have a 0 "favorite" rating even though it is only slightly behind 10th.

The law of large numbers is a bit of a counterpoint to this.
>> ARTICLE
>Popular anime do better in this list. For example, One Piece, Fairy Tail, and Bleach rank 58, 187, and 536 places higher, respectively. Here's one possible explanation saying that casual viewers will weight popular series more highly. Then again, these series do have legitimately fantastic moments, like the Soul Society arc in Bleach.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, It seems to me that there is another bias in that shows on the opposite side of the spectrum would also benefit from this kind of list. Shows that are more of 'cult classics' with small dedicated fanbases are also going to have their rankings skewed upward (as evidenced by Tatami Galaxy, Utena, Rose of Versailles, etc. which you mentioned). As much as I personally agree that these shows should be higher up, intuitively it makes sense to assume the percentage would lower somewhat as the total audience increases, so adjusting for this would give a more accurate list.

These biases could be counteracted somewhat by adding in two things:

1. A dampening effect on the percentages of shows with small popularities (similar to how MAL's current weighted formula does) - this would help counteract the pretty drastic rise of cult shows.

2. Another dampening effect on the value of favorites by the percentage amount of shows listed as favorites on a particular viewers list (lower percentage is more valuable). It'd be difficult to figure out how to formulate this, though, and it'd require we allow unlimited favorites to make things more accurate. This way when a person that has only listed 5 shows lists 4 of them as favorites (which seems to be part of the assumed reason massively popular shows within casual audiences have risen so much), those favorites are not valued as much as someone who only has 1 out of 200 shows listed as favorites. This would, however, obviously require access to the backend of MAL so it's not like we can actually make a list with this attribute.

It'd also be helpful if series were combined within MAL to begin with for favorites - this could make the data for lots of series more accurate (like Gintama, Monogatari, etc.), but it would again require full access to the backend of MAL. It would also be somewhat difficult to completely determine what should be grouped together, I imagine practically everyone would be fine with something like Gintama being all combined, but what about other series? F/Z and F/SN are related, but I think most would agree they should each have separate ratings (though their seasons should be combined within each). There's also some even murkier territory, like Madoka. I'd imagine determining whether rebellion should be considered as a part of the original series would be pretty divisive (it would probably be possible to separate things into the movie series and the original TV series here, but there are almost certainly similar cases where there isn't an obvious way out). In general, combining works of the same series will be actually much more difficult than most realize and might inspire significant disagreements (which is probably why MAL has decided to ignore the prospect).

>> ARTICLE
>intuitively it makes sense to assume the percentage would lower somewhat as the total audience increases, so adjusting for this would give a more accurate list.

I see absolutely no evidence for this claim, except for the surprise at the inclusion of these entries.

In fact, over the past year, The Tatami Galaxy has been climbing in a statistically significant way, not falling (I'm slightly annoyed by this fact).
>> ARTICLE
It's the trend for most shows in general but especially 'cult classics'. Sure, Tatami Galaxy might be an exception (though, it's only barely in the category to begin with), but there will always be exceptions and it's a pretty well known concept. People that like a particular kind of show will be the first to watch it, so they are more likely to end up rating it highly. As a more general audience watches it, it's likely that the average rating will, therefore, fall. Shows with less scores are therefore generally skewed upward a bit. It's the exact reasoning that basically *every* site that has a list with highest average ratings weights said ratings by popularity (and MAL is no exception as seen by their [formula](http://myanimelist.net/info.php?go=topanime)). 
>> ARTICLE
The number of voters on MAL are large enough that regression to the mean doesn't really apply like it would if a series had ~1000 votes (since the margin of error is really low).

>it's a pretty well known concept

I don't doubt this is the case for *average rating* but I'm not sure this carries over into favorites.  It contradicts my data from last year compared to this one for sure.

EDIT: Wait, I take this back.  It's hard to separate "recency bias" from this "small, cult fanbase" effect.

>It's the exact reasoning that basically every site that has a list with highest average ratings weights said ratings by popularity (and MAL is no exception as seen by their formula). 

No, the reason they *should* rate by popularity is because of regression to the mean, which is formalized quantitatively by stuff like [Wilson scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval).  It's also a way to appease a userbase by pushing popular stuff up higher.  That said, MAL is not a huge offender at all, unlike IMDB, where m is over 10,000.
>> ARTICLE
>The number of voters on MAL are large enough that regression to the mean doesn't really apply like it would if a series had ~1000 votes (since the margin of error is really low). 

As far as MAL's formula goes, I can tell you for sure that the shift does *very significantly* matter. Take 'The Tatami Galaxy' for instance, since we already happen to be talking about it anyway. Taking the weighted mean of it's listed score counts gives us ~8.9866. I'm sure you can recognize that it's listed score of 8.65 is pretty damn significantly lower. That is exactly the effect described, working as intended.

Regression to the mean isn't exactly the phenomenon I'm describing, anyway (at least in its most general form where it applies to basically all data sets). I'm talking about the phenomenon I described above where "people that like a particular kind of show will be the first to watch it". This is a pretty obvious concept if you think about it - people will try out shows they think they will like and tend to stay away from those they think they won't. Thus, it stands to reason, that as a show begins to exhaust it's initial base (that is likely to favor it), a greater portion of those that newly view it will have more centered or even negative views on the work. Therefore, the average rating will also become centered over time (and the exact same logic holds for portions of favorites). There will certainly be exceptions to the rule, as The Tatami Galaxy seems to be from your data, but that doesn't mean the logic for the general case doesn't hold.
>> ARTICLE
I know this is an old thread but that's actually incorrect. 8.98 is the average when taking (votes from the stats page)/32,822

The number of votes recorded on the stats page is actually 34,354, making the user average rating ~8.58. However, the problem with both of those numbers is that only voters who have seen at least (#of episodes)/5.2 are included in the v that the MAL formula uses.  

In the case of The Tatami Galaxy this means at least 11/5.2  2.2, or 3 episodes, need to be recorded as being watched before a score is counted. In other words, only 32,822 people who have rated The Tatami Galaxy have actually watched more than 2 episodes.

The formula used on MAL is: Weighted Rank (WR) = (v / (v + m)) * S + (m / (v + m)) * C

* S = Average score for the Anime (mean).
* v = Number of votes for the Anime = (Number of people scoring the Anime).
* m = Minimum votes/scores required to get a calculated score (currently 50 scores required).
* C = The mean score across the entire Anime DB.

Assume for now that we know C. Let's say we want to know how many votes V an anime needs for the formula to have  x impact on its score. Looking at |WR - S|  x we get V = ceiling(m * (|C - S| - x) / x). Since it depends on the score, we can't use it to determine a general minimum voter count. Interestingly, when |C - S|  x we always get |WR - S|  x.

However, a more general minimum voter count can be found by looking at the weighting term m * C / (v + m). We can look at when this term  x, which gives us V = ceiling(m * (C - x) / x).

Now earlier I said to assume we knew C, but that's not true. Because of the minimum votes to count issue, it's incredibly hard to determine C accurately. According to [this thread from 2014](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1294711), C = 6.573, but that may have changed. For the sake of argument I'll look at the worst case scenario (the biggest impact this term could possibly have) by taking C = 10.

If we want the weighting term to be  0.1, we have 50*(10-0.1)/0.1 = 4950, which is pretty low. To have it  0.01 we only need 49950 ratings. We can look at this the other way round, too. The Tatami Galaxy has 32822 ratings, which means this term has an impact of ~0.015 on its score, an incredibly small difference (assuming C = 10, a much larger score than is likely).

If we redo these with C = 6.573, we instead get V = 3237 for it to have an impact of  0.1, and V = 32815 for an impact of  0.01. With these numbers, the impact for The Tatami Galaxy is ~0.0099.
>> ARTICLE
>Taking the weighted mean of it's listed score counts gives us ~8.9866.

Whoa, I had no idea that MAL was such a bad offender with this.  What is your source on this?

>This is a pretty obvious concept if you think about it - people will try out shows they think they will like and tend to stay away from those they think they won't.

The grounds for saying it be most pronounced with a small number of voters are really weak though.  People will be self-selecting anyway.  I might have a model where the sorts of people who watch airing shows are generalists, whereas someone watching a show years after its aired has selected it very specifically.  In this model, you'd see the exact opposite effect--a show will rise as it accumulates more votes, not fall.  Or maybe I have a model where the first people to rate a show will be especially harsh, whereas people who rate afterwards take score cues and feel bad if they're giving a highly rated show low marks.  Under this model, you'd also see scores rise over time.

So no, I don't think this level of weighting is justified by any statistics at all, if the variable MAL is trying to adhere to is actual quality.  Now, if they're most concerned about appeasing people by filling their top chart with popular stuff that people have seen, then their strategy makes a lot of sense.
>> ARTICLE
>Whoa, I had no idea that MAL was such a bad offender with this.

Yeah, they probably go a bit overboard to say the least.

>I might have a model where the sorts of people who watch airing shows are generalists, whereas someone watching a show years after its aired has selected it very specifically. In this model, you'd see the exact opposite effect--a show will rise as it accumulates more votes, not fall. Or maybe I have a model where the first people to rate a show will be especially harsh, whereas people who rate afterwards take score cues and feel bad if they're giving a highly rated show low marks. Under this model, you'd also see scores rise over time.

But what are the backings for those models? I don't have any hard data on the model I proposed (which is why I initially used the word intuitively), but I'd be willing to be hard data would back it up. Why would the people who watch a show while airing be generalists? The idea that people that are interested in the kind of show something sells itself to be while be the majority of those trying it still holds. 

I do agree that people 'seeking out' a show are more likely to like it, but that fits in exactly with the phenomenon I'm describing (more on this below).

>So no, I don't think this level of weighting is justified by any statistics at all, if the variable MAL is trying to adhere to is actual quality.

I don't think the aim is actual 'quality' - if our goal was to represent quality a binary 'favorites' system would be incredibly ineffective compared to 1-10 scores (particularly since favorites don't even *imply* that a person should be trying to decide critically). As to what the actual goal is, it's hard to specify - maybe something like 'a list ordered by how likely the average viewer is to end up loving a show'. That fits in with the favorite system proposed (and the favorites system would do a better job of it than 1-10 ratings because of the critiques that have already been given about 1-10 ratings, such as variance in rating meanings).

This goal leads directly into why I say those 'seeking out' shows fits with what I'm describing. Take the very concept of a cult classic: a work that is very well liked by a smaller group but generally would not be considered to perform as well with a general, randomized audience. Such a work would have a really small base of voters, but a very high average score. If you were to randomly select people to view and then rate the work, however, the average of those would likely be quite a bit lower (precisely because they are average viewers and not people that would seek the work out). Thus, with our main goal in mind, such shows should be centered toward the mean somewhat in order to account for that.
>> ARTICLE
>But what are the backings for those models?

I was just proposing alternate models.  I have no idea, but I don't think that relying on intuition is actually all that useful here.

>I don't think the aim is actual 'quality' - if our goal was to represent quality a binary 'favorites' system would be incredibly ineffective compared to 1-10 scores

Only insofar as the margin of error might be higher for binary scores, but this actually is within 1% when N > 1000.

Sure, there's a lot of nuance here as far as what favorites or a rating "means" psychologically.

I've never actually seen any evidence of a "cult premium" that you're describing.  It is a plausible model, sure, but I doubt it's an accurate one.  If anything, people's preferences seem remarkably *regular* in the aggregate (it's rare to find a movie with a significant number of votes where there's a large ratings divergence between men and women in IMDB demographic data, for instance).

Data point 2: https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/icheckmovies+-+most+favorite/

Does this look like a cult film list to you?  Does it look like a film list focused on "entertainment"?  I wouldn't expect either, really.  It doesn't have any of the usual films that are "cult films" (except Aguirre, which is hugely critically acclaimed).  It looks like a critic's list, although a very strange critic who happens to also be into anime, J-dramas, and random movies from all over the world.

Actaully wanted to see this type of ranking for the manga too but there is something strange going on there.

It got over 200%? This screenshot is from this manga: http://myanimelist.net/manga/57051/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken
>> ARTICLE
Yup, that happens. There's always a vocal fanbase, even more so with media from popular series where some people will go out of their way to favorite and rate everything highly (even if they haven't consumed the media themselves).

JoJo is a fairly popular series with some vocal fans, so even though that manga is something not many people have read, a bunch of people probably favorited it without ever reading it at all.

You can see the effect in my data set as well. When I pulled the data in early January, Kizumonogatari had not yet been released, yet it already had 161 favorites with only 10 scorers, resulting in a 1600% favorited ratio.

This is why I excluded shows with fewer than 1,000 scorers. The more people there are, the less a small fanbase can skew the data.

Not really surprising.  This is just for Gintama': Enchousen (2012).  Gintama (2006) Is rated 46 or something in popularity.  When people add shows to their MAL, they don't always take into consideration that additional seasons in MAL often get added as separate entries.

I would think not a lot of anime watchers are into something like boxing. When you count over 100 episodes with all the series combined that adds to it also. Hajime no Ippo definitely one of my favorite series of all time though.

I guess that's sort of the reason but I don't even like boxing and Hajime No Ippo is in my top 3 easily.

Same here. I find myself watching a lot of sports anime when the only ones I follow are Cricket and to a lesser extent Football(Soccer)
>> ARTICLE
Definitely on my top list, but I feel a sort of dissonance when I tried watching an actual boxing match, it just didn't feel the same. The author and artist did something to Ippo to make the series spectacular.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because the manga and anime has to make every match insanely good, as intense as a boxing match can be, it's a battle shonen series afterall. Obviously only one in a thousand real pro matches can get close to it. Same with any sport.

One day, [Sora No Woto](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To) will be on a list like this.  
[Until then...](http://i.imgur.com/bFYqoLb.gif)
>> ARTICLE
It might be too late for our trumpet girl as the anime's been out for quite a long time.
>> ARTICLE
Most likely never going to reach a decent scoring unless MAL somehow resets them (even so, it probably won't affect much of anything).

But for those wondering, Sora no Woto is a spectacular SoL series located in a very interesting post-apocalyptic setting. The show definitely has a very cute cast of characters, but it's not afraid to venture into a more heavy scene as the show progresses. Accompanied by the musical talents of Kalafina & Yuki Kajiura, the show has one of the best OSTs from a SoL. 

It is not at all a K-On clone like many have assumed it to be. The only drawback this show has is the fact that the world it takes place in is left devastatingly unexplored. I would've loved to learn more about the world this anime takes place in.

Give it a chance.

EDIT: A phrase.
>> ARTICLE
Nitpick: Sora no Woto's OST is by the unparalleled Ooshima Michiru (Xam'd, Tatami Galaxy, Zetsuen no Tempest). While I will disagree with you on the worth of the show as a whole, the soundtrack is a work of art. 
>> ARTICLE
Seems I've screwed up a little bit.

Perfectly fine if you don't hold it up as close to the candle as I do. Even if people don't agree with how great of a show it is, it's still a fine military SoL.
>> ARTICLE
Sold, added it to my plan to watch queue. Even though that means I still will probably never get to it but it's closer.

Also the statement about resetting the scores seems odd. Is there some reason that resetting the rates would bring the score up? Like was there a bunch of hatred for this show at one point and was given crap ratings. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not too sold on the idea that resetting the scores would bring up the score by much either (despite mentioning it). That's just the only solution I could see possibly working that would raise it's current rating. Sort of just threw the idea out there since the chances of MAL getting a score reset is unlikely

Then again, I'm not sure what the reason was for the initial dislike the show received when it had aired. I'm just assuming the general consensus now is that it isn't deserving of it's current low-ish score. And I agree with it. 

Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.
>> ARTICLE
>Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.

Pretty much this. haha. I don't know what could be done so that the scoring was meaningful. Just hope someone recommends and speaks out for those diamonds in the rough so you get a chance to experience them.
>> ARTICLE
Scoring will never be a useful tool for reviewing without some form of commentary to go along with it. All my scores on my MAL are only meant to be useful for myself.

Thankfully there are always a few reviews on MAL & other websites that give me a little bit more than just a score.

It's because many of them extra seasons.

To get to Book of Circus you have to watch two seasons (many put off by the second), Hanamonogatari three seasons and Nekomonogatari kuro and for Mushishi Zoku Shou you need to watch the first season.

Mushishi is a set of loosely connected histories. One could easily skip right to season 2

Similar case with monogatari, new seasons and films aren't all released in proper, chronological order

I watched part of it before, but it was too depressing and soul crushing for me that I dropped it.  Lately I've been toying with the idea of rewatching and then finishing it, but before I do, I'd like to ask something.  Does it have a happy/at least semi-happy ending?  If he ends up just being a slave or dying or something it won't feel like the watch was worth it at all for me... so I'd like to know beforehand not to watch it if there's a bad end.  I don't want any in depth spoils, just a yes or no @_@.

Kudos to Cross Game for having the saddest first episode in a children anime.

Does Cross Game actually deliver instead of pussying out after two or three episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Please, dont think that cross game is anything like Kotoura-san. Its Adachi's most accessible and easy to watch/read series, and easily one of his best.

Adachi is the master of nostalgia high school sports, mixed in with somewhat opaque romance and usually a touch of tragedy. Its a brilliant mix, and hes been doing it for the better part of 30 years

Comparing the two is an insult to Cross Game.

Yes.

What. Did you just call an Adachi (possibly his best in many ways) series a kids show?

What would you say is the target then? The anime basically aired during a time slot that was appopriate for a younger audience.

its shounen sports that borders on sienen at times.

But adachi doesn't write your normal shounen sports ala slum dunk style, he has his own unique style

It also frequently opened with a drawing song and displayed pictures submitted by viewers at the end of the episode. That means it is, at least in part, targeted towards kids.

Let me tell you about what happened on Tuesday. I made one of the worst decisions of my life, concerning anime.

So, I had Cross Game on my PTW for a while now. Tuesday night, before I hit the hay sack, I decided to watch the first episode before going to bed, thought, "Might as well start it". 

I think you can guess what happened next...No sleep for me for 2 hours, stayed up watching 6 more episodes...Godammit...

I've got casual anime friends and colleagues who watch a series solely by word of mouth, or on recommendation only.

Really, there's no other prerequisite to watching anime than watching anime. We're all fans here.

No. Some are fans of what's popular. Others are anime fans and do try to know more about something they like.

I'm pretty sure most "anime fans" say they're fans but only care about watching what's popular, which is only a small fragment of what anime is.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, anime has much more depth than what's popular, but honestly, if people are enjoying themselves, then there's no harm to it. Popular shows are good for socializing and community, anyway. I feel that's a much stronger part of what we are than if we were to view anime as art, and it's where anime cons, doujins and even this sub draws strength from.

So it's only better for us if we were to be excellent to everybody here :)

One of my personal favorites. It's more psychedelic and trippy than SHAFT shows, but its a show about psychiatry, so it's very fitting. Highly recommended if you like dramas. The show I think it's closest to in initial impressions/structure is The Tatami Galaxy.

It is episodic in nature, but every episode runs concurrently over the same 2 week time period, so they all interweave in subtle ways. Each one is about Irabu helping people with their mental problems, and it's consistently funny and touching.

In terms of production values, Irabu's VA lifts the show up 10 points alone, OP/ED are both great, music's wonderful, the art is excellent, and I hope you like live-action elements in anime, since this goes full Aku no Hana every now and then, (probably to cover up that there's very little animation in the thing).

I'd call it a 9, as it might have benefited a little more from a stronger overarching narrative, but the individual arcs are all fantastic.

I'm thrashing through LotGH at the moment. It's absolutely enthralling. Really can't stress how little it matters that it was made in 1993.

The only anime I can compare it to, in terms of how high a regard it holds its themes, is Monster. They're about completely different things, but the essence of how they deal with the real issues surrounding humanity is similar.

> Revolutionary Girl Utena

What is wrong with you people? This is one of the greatest anime ever made. 


>> ARTICLE
> What is wrong with you people? 

Nothing *wrong* with these people per say... but you forget that the majority of people on /r/anime and MAL are basically the same age as Utena.  If it's 15 years or older, most people haven't seen it unless it's mainstream.

Also, most people here are guys, and won't necessarily get into things ostensibly for girls.
>> ARTICLE
I was being sort of facetious. The thing is anime is way more popular as a whole than when I was getting into the scene. There are way more of us now than there were 15 years ago. 

Anyway thanks for making me feel weird. /s It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.
>> ARTICLE
> It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.

I always found this funny.  Watching anime in general is already a niche that's, at best, looked at strangely by the general population.  The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing.  Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).

Funnily enough even in its home country. 

> The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing. Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).

I think it goes without saying that our society is geared against folks that don't identify with the general norm. I read manga/watch anime for the art, the story and the characters but despite having all of those I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(
>> ARTICLE
> Funnily enough even in its home country.

Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

> I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(

Sure you are, do what you want!  I watch crap for kids and adults; crap for guys and girls, it doesn't matter.  Quality and artistry doesn't know gender.  Let the haters hate.  Besides, this is the anonymity of the internet too, so:

1) Who cares what other people have to say.

2) You'll find a lot more like minded people here than you would have assumed.
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

Oh definitely, tho there is rampant homophobia as well it just manifests differently (like being gay is considered a phase that kids go through in Japanese culture). But the stigma in Japan for anime in general is a lot like the stigma for watching cartoons over here in that its still seen as something primarily for children.

I wasn't quite saying that I personally would change what I like, I've been watching what I like for damn near over a decade and a half now, just critiquing the dominant view. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm at episode 12 from 39 and to me it seems like the plot is just starting, while Ping Pong, the masterpiece of anime, already finished an episode ago. 

I'm definitely having fun up to this point and it'll probably blow my mind by the time I'm finished, but the show is taking it's time. And shojo's of the 90's look weird. NGE looks way better.
>> ARTICLE
You're almost at one of the best arcs ever made for any anime period, the Black Rose arc, look forward to it. 

Trust me, by the time you finish this, you'll be a believer. Just be glad you didn't get the movie four years before the series like those of us way back when. :p Also shjo, at least in manga, has not really changed since the late 80s except males have become skinnier, it's only in the anime adaptations where utena eschews a more shnen look for keeping the shjo flowery approach. 

NGE is my favourite anime ever, and yes it looks good, but so does Utena in a different way. 
>> ARTICLE
Just stumpled upon this thread and by now I have finished Utena. Still don't relaly know what to think. It definitely well done, but at face value it does so little and I am not all that good with symbolism. It had some really hilarious stuff. That's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck is wrong with you?
>> ARTICLE
Well rheumatism, arthritis, demen-wait what was I talking about again? /s
>> ARTICLE
It can be pretty painful to watch. I mean how many times must I see the stair climbing montage? Only to be outdone by the elevator taking montage. 

Also, plenty of times throughout the show I wanted to scream "What the hell are you trying to tell me?" So it can be a frustrating show for people that are driven by plot as opposed to themes and symbolism.  
>> ARTICLE
Man the stair-climbing/elevator-taking are when things get real in an episode, they serve an important point. Repetition is a huge focus for reinforcing themes. Remember Utena is about growing up, the stair-climbing, elevator-taking are symbolic of going from lower to higher, that is becoming an adult. 
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea how Utena is so low (comparatively) in terms of ranking, both popularity and score-wise. How have more people not watched this show? I've met people who've watched a ton of anime who've never even heard of it. Is it because it's a magical girl series (kinda)? Is it because Utena's a girl? Are most people really that unwilling to watch anime that's more than seven years old? People on here talk about Penguindrum fairly frequently, and obviously a lot of attention is on Ikuhara with Yuri Kuma Arashi. I wish that there'd be more discussion about Utena beyond it being mentioned as a classic because it has so much depth to it, it easily deserves threads on the level of, say, the NGE rewatch. 
>> ARTICLE
I got bored after 14 episodes and quit watching. I can't relate to anyone in the show they are all so backwards.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly there actually were rewatch threads on here for Utena a few months ago. But only like two people posted in them.
>> ARTICLE
It's odd because all throughout the late 90s - early 2000s Utena was hailed as a masterpiece even if half the people watching it didn't understand that it was largely a coming-of-age story. 

But really Utena is to shjo what NGE is to mainstream anime, remembering that shjo while influential on the mainstream is largely resistant to the mainstream as well, an endpoint to a bleak era after the economic downturn of the 80s-90s. It was a clean break between the themes prevalent before and after. I think there are enough of us around to create a decent discussion thread. :p

Is the 'Aria' series worth pursuing? 
>> ARTICLE
it is my second favorite series behind hunter x hunter
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. I watch very little slice of life because I often find the majority of them to be mostly pointless apart from them making you feel comfy. I noticed that the Aria trilogy was quite often referred to as best SOL out there so I decided to give it a shot and it turned out to be one of my favourite shows.

 It is a coming of age story what gets better with each series and ends perfectly in my opinion. What made me love this series so much was how the main character Akari viewed and interpreted the world around her in such a beautiful way that I couldn't help but feel warm and fuzzy inside. 

The OST is also great at making you feel relaxed and comfy, here is one of my favourite songs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1hGtQxHvs 

I can't recommend this series enough, the only negative I can think of is that I found the cat's voice a little annoying initially but like the series he grew on me very quickly.
>> ARTICLE
It's an episodic slice of life anime about rowing gondolas on terraformed Mars. There is an overall linear progression, but it's mostly about the development of its characters. There's no denying it's hard to get into for most people, but it's charming and soothing, and it ends on a conclusive high note.

I would say that a large amount of the sequels could have been taken out, as they typically have viewers that decided to watch based on the first season, giving them unnaturally higher ratings. 

Edit: You may also want to think about removing those with scorers around the 12,000 mark and above, because quite a few of them are well known (At least on reddit (as it seems to me))

> Top 100 Madhouse anime according to MAL

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
Big Windup! is one of my favorite sports anime so I'm glad its getting the recognition it deserves
>> ARTICLE
Dennou Coil is a masterpiece. It really is just about perfect. 

It has an interesting and well thought out world. Characters are likeable and relatable. The story has a well pacing, is interesting and actual works out. The soundtrack, while nothing really special, is used very well, always fits and underlines the atmosphere, but also knows when to be silent.

But I'm sad X, Arjuna or Giant Killing didn't make it. At least X could've managed to get it. Clamp manga animated by Madhouse? It should've been popular. Arjuna has Yoko Kanno's best work, but a weird story. I like it.

**BUT** how in fuck did Inu Yasha get in there? Judging by the 120 episodes I watched before droping it, it isn't a contender for top 100.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen InuYasha, but this is the second season. To get there you must have already went through 167 episodes, and judging by the description, it seems to be much faster paced (covering 21 chapters in 26 episodes compared to 35 in 167, from my understanding), which must contribute a lot to its high rating.

I was disappointed not seeing Cross Game in the top 100 earlier now i feel better
>> ARTICLE
There is quite some stuff on that list that I adore(Cross Game, Chihayafuru, Kaiji, Gin no Saji, ...) but it makes sense.

I got to most of those through checking the Top MAL scores and not because they got recommended or written about.

But there are also a lot of em that seem to sit on my ptw list forever, since there is always something "more important" to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen quite a few of these shows mentioned here but haven't watched them yet, I should really get around to that. The attach rate is interesting, most shows are below .6. It would be interesting if MAL included that stat itself so we could compare shows by what percent of  people dropped/finished it more easily.

Considering Mushishi, Utena, Tatami Galaxy and Chihayafuru are some of my all time favorite anime I find this list depressing. Watch these shows damnit! Especially Chihayafuru because I want a season three!

I love how the the top ten illustrates everything you need to know about anime. There's a semi-educational Engrish sketch show, a show about two rabbits in a Soviet prison, an epic space opera, a show about giant robots that fucks with your head, a show about magical school girls that fucks with your head, and a high school romcom featuring ghosts, gods, titties and wordplay. 

Anime gives you everything you need to laugh, to cry and to curl up in a little ball and wonder just what it is we're all doing here in the first place.

And to top it off you get thirty minutes of a guy getting his little sister off with a toothbrush.   
>> ARTICLE
Nah, the Best Anime Ever is way below the top 10.  The anime world needs to get over its emo streak.

Sorry for my stupidity, but I'm not sure I fully understand this list. Could someone help me understand this? For example, is this list of lifetime sales of these titles, and do sales reflect what was sold internationally... or what was sold domestically in Japan? Also, what is the source of this information? Lastly, how do I read this list using the information at the top of the page? (Considering there are no ranking...Speaking of which, how do I tell those rankings? >.>)

Appreciate the help in advance. Again, sorry if I'm just being stupid, but I'm just interested in this information is all. I want to try to understand it the best I can.
>> ARTICLE
Average BD/DVD per volume sold domestically in Japan, which is where everything matters. Also it's based on Oricon data which isn't 100% accurate, and then it's based on the volume releases which means it doesn't account for boxset releases afterwards. But it's fair to say that every title on the list can be considered a massive success to some degree.
>> ARTICLE
List doesn't factor in merchandise, which imo is a metric we should def look at as well.

Like the gundam series. They prob make more money in merchandises than from the anime
>> ARTICLE
We look at disk sales because it's the only dataset readily available to the public.  What you want simply isn't available outside of the [odd press releases](http://wiki.fdiary.net/animesales/?%BB%D4%BE%EC%B5%AC%CC%CF%A1%A6%C1%ED%C7%E4%BE%E5) and unreliable estimates by [CharaBizData](https://www.charabiz.com/) (research group).

I know. I'm simply just stating there are far more factors into a series success outside of disk sales.

Precure probably doesn't sold that many disks relative to its time slot, but massively makes up for them through merchandise that not many other series could achieve.

Yeah, if you're going to combine Gundam series at least stick to just the UC stuff.

We just need like 10 more seasons of monogatari, then we can truly compare the sales differences.

So how is Girls and Panzer? I've heard about it a few times but to be honest I didn't think it sounded very interesting. Anyone here that has seen it that can tell me his opinion on it?
>> ARTICLE
The first episode does a great job world building. The characters are tropish, but cute.

If not seeing much practice in K-On, an anime about music that doesn't involve playing much music, bothered you- be prepared to be irked that they take the easy way out, and never show them learning or getting better.

There is next to zero character development, which is unforunate. They could have really slowed down the pace of the show to make it more interesting from the main character's perspective. 

The show starts with a massive amount of annoying exposition. This could lead you to turn off the show.

The battle scenes are quite good both in design and execution. 

Definitely a short turn-your-brain-off and have fun anime. Maybe just put it on a backlist, for when you're bored?
>> ARTICLE
No, don't listen to this guy.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for having an opinion.
>> ARTICLE
It's an earnest underdog sports story of cute girls driving/commanding historical tanks in an inter-school tournament. It has an absurd setting but plays it totally straight, tankery really is a popular all-girls sport and you just have to accept that. The rest of the show is either friends hanging out together, planning for tank battles, or the genuinely exciting tank battles themselves. If you're into World of Tanks or historical tanks, it's an absolute must, but even if you're not (like me) it's still absolutely endearing.

Oh, and it doesn't have pandering fanservice, which is a pleasant change. Yes, the character designs are quite "mo", but you won't catch a single glimpse up any skirts nor any breast-size jokes. About the only scenes a westerner would consider questionable involve communal bathing, and there's like... two of such scenes in the entire show, which are both literally and metaphorically clean unless you find bare shoulders and backs *too lewd*.

Honestly, give the first two episodes a spin and see what you think.
>> ARTICLE
i do think you see miho's butt in one of the bathing scenes but taken in context it's definitely not pandering.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds alright, guess I'll give it a try soon.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, and it has some amazing "camera" work throughout.
>> ARTICLE
it's fucking great.  it takes the utterly ridiculous premise of "tankwando" as a feminine art and runs all the way to the finish line with it.  the main character is a "thinker" - she bucks tradition and comes up with her own way of doing things (like lelouch or light) in order to succeed.  on top of that, there are **32** characters in the main cast and every one of them is uinique.

it's 12 episodes and 2 recap episodes (5.5 you can skip, 10.5 you should watch), and every time the girls have a tank fight, there's a good reason to get invested.  there are some side stories but they aren't made the focus; rather they're used to bring the characters themselves into focus.  it's really a mastefully done, triumphant, jubilant and heartwarming series.  and it's short enough to marathon in a day if you really can't pace yourself (like me).  go watch it.
>> ARTICLE
>tankwando

Tank-fu, Tankery, and ***[PANZERFAHREN](http://commiesubs.com/your-face-when-we-won-da-panzer-vor/)*** are acceptable substitutes. Tankery is my go-to one for talking about the show, but when it comes to actually watching Madchen und Panzer, only glorious Commie subs are accepted.
>> ARTICLE
i got tankwando from the deadfish sub of OVA 2...  i watched the show with horriblesubs.  aren't horriblesubs/commie both just ripped crunchyroll?
>> ARTICLE
Horrible's crunchy. Commie does half crunchy half other stuff - and in the case of Girls und Panzer, they put their own fantastic spin on it. To not ruin the surprise for anyone else: [Commie GuP](/s "is unique because it uses gratuitous German to replace common phrases - 'Arigatou' (thank you) is subbed as 'Danke', 'Hai!' (yes) with 'Ja!' or 'Jawohl' etc. - it forces a strange trilingualism, the ability to hear Japanese, read German, and understand in English. Since it's pretty much only used for set phrases anyone who's been watching anime for a year or more could recognize, and the German translations should be similarly familiar to anyone with even a cursory knowledge, it's not inconvenient, and often humorous.")
>> ARTICLE
Oh that is xlnt. If my data cap were more forgiving, I would definitely re download for that. 
>> ARTICLE
>there are 32 characters in the main cast

That worries me a bit, doesn't a lot of characters mean that each individual character loses a lot of depth?

Apart from that the show definitely sounds interesting, I'll be sure to give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
Some of the tank crews get grouped to the point that you could class them as "one character". This includes the First Years and the Disciplinary Committee - if you watch closely you'll notice they each have their unique points, but in terms of narrative, they're basically 'herded' together and work together to have an individual's worth of impact. It's appropriate, given the collaborative nature of operating a tank.
>> ARTICLE
you'll actually be very surprised.  

actually, i don't think the words are good enough to describe the cast heirarchy.  there's one girl who is obviously the "main character", and there are the girls in her tank who all get backstoried, and then there are the rest of the girls on the tankery team who are all unique and well-characterized but don't get much time spent on their backstories.  they're all "main cast".  

then there's the MC's tank team's families, and the team's opponents, who i would say make up the supporting cast.
>> ARTICLE
Its more of a sports anime to be quite honest. There is your typical underdog team and other sports tropes. Except the sport in this anime is tank paintball. And the tanks are so very detailed and lots of historical Easter eggs thrown in.

Now go watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a moe slice of life series pretending to be a sports anime, the whole Sensha-do is too ridiculous and the girls don't take it seriously enough for it to be considered a sport. It's cute but also pretty silly, and also hidden right wing propaganda that more people should be disgusted about.  
>> ARTICLE
the only right wing part about the show I find meh is in the OVAs and that's because of the use of the rising sun flag (which admittedly it's not just in anime Japan has a poor record of). 

So what on earth are you on about?  
>> ARTICLE
Also in the OVAs, they gloat about how Japan has the best tanks in the world.
>> ARTICLE
That too. 

Imma hazard a guess and maybe the person is talking about how there was that JSDF video narrated by Yukari. I honestly cannot think of anything else 
>> ARTICLE
Yea I think so, mentioned how the Type 89 has some revolutionary design feature. 
>> ARTICLE
>Hidden right wing propaganda....

Lol wut...

They at most reference the actions of Meiji/Taisho era Japan (the whole Yuki no Shingun part is the only thing I can think up) who's hands may not be completely clean, but are saints compared to what actually happened during the war. 

Not to mention prior to the 2nd World War, the IJA and IJN were rather civilized (given proper incentive of course, i.e. sucking up to the Western powers).

I would buy Girls under Panzer to add to my collection, but I'd have to get it through Sentai and they removed the Pravda song since they couldn't get the copyright. Honestly that's what initially got me to watch that show in the first place.

Even though it's licensed by them, they sell it hybrid so it'll have the subs anyway.

Lol just buy it. Support the industry 'n' such. Or import the original.

GuP is probably one of the only series I would considering importing other than an immaculate adaptation of the Muv Luv Trilogy. 
>> ARTICLE
That's something done on the Japanese side as evidenced by the difference in animation timing/editing. It's likely something done for the international masters, which is something we can't blame Sentai on (for once).
>> ARTICLE
I know it's not Sentai's fault. They couldn't get the copyright so there is nothing they can do about it. It's a shame, though, since that insert song is pretty awesome.

You mean Katioucha/Katyusha?

Yup. Kinda made Pravda my favourite school outside of Ooarai. Russian singing sounds really cool in my opinion.

Apparently the World of Golden Eggs is an american style cartoon, with 15-minute episodes. It's a children's anime and also is priced more normally (only $55 per season, instead of $300) - maybe that's why it has so many sales. 
[Amazon JP link](http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%87%E3%83%B3%E3%82%A8%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B9-World-GOLDEN-%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%83%B31-DVD%E3%83%9C%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9/dp/B0019JJ4NU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1390438781&sr=8-1&keywords=The+World+of+GOLDEN+EGGS)

Only seen two episodes and I'm liking so far, though the heavy usage of CG on the characters is a little jarring but I'll get used to it.

I'm glad a CG heavy show got such good sales. Hopefully it'll lead to more CG shows, leading to an improvement in CG animation. Driving down production costs, meaning more seasons of things and potentially cheaper BD/DVDs.

Absolutely. I was certain it would suck, but it was actually great. Roll on season two.

Yep, thats pretty much it. Best SoL series ever...

Definitely check out [YKK](http://myanimelist.net/anime/975/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kikou) (too short but it compliments the manga well) and [Tamayura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9055/Tamayura) as well.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget about the Arietta OVA, or the Picture Dramas if you haven't watched them already. The OVA is among the best single episodes of the entire series there is, in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I think I watched the episode where [ ](/s "Alice graduates") like 4 times straight. One of my favorite shows ever.

Edit: So that's how spoiler tags work.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the [](/s "Alicia's farewell - it's just so-o touching.") even more. Overall the last episodes are just pure gold.
>> ARTICLE
Go listen to the glorious OST to relieve your favorite moments. Also, congratulations on finishing Origination, you just had the privilege to finish the best SoL ever made period and possibly one of the best conclusions you'll encounter in the anime medium. 
>> ARTICLE
Do listen to the OSTs indeed. When I travel and I explore the new city, I just put it on on my phone and walk around - and the city feels a bit like Aqua a bit. Confirmed in Stockholm, Groningen, Prague, Krakow, Wroclaw..
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same way. I've yet to watch the last episode as I am resisting the end. It's the most beautiful show I've ever had the great fortune to watch. 
>> ARTICLE
Also: don't forget to get all the OST's.
>> ARTICLE
I love Aria dude. I guess I won't spoil anything, since you didn't.

But god damn, the last like 6 episodes in Aria the Origination were some of the greatest and most satisfying moments in any anime I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Aria, together with [Tamayura](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=8234) are two of my absolute favorite SoL anime. And it does help that both Aria and Tamayura are directed by [Sato Junichi](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=creator&creatorid=3611), the director of the original Sailor Moon (and more).

52 episodes, give or take(since we have OVAs, specials and picture dramas), really makes you connect the the characters in a way that, IMHO, you can't do with characters in anime that are only 13-26 eps.

One anime that ain't really *that* similar to Aria but still feels a bit like it would be Sora no Woto, or as some call it, K-on girls in the military. Though it's way more that k-on in wartime, it's really good too.

PS, [AkarixCaitSith OTP](http://i.imgur.com/jPQcOBV.jpg)

PPS, the music is really fucking good, OK?!I love the OPs and EDs, and ofc the other BGMs, I "got" the **Aria the Box** soundtrack thingy, so many good and nostalgic tracks.
>> ARTICLE
I love the music too :)

Tamayura has been on my PTW too, I'll check it out soon.
>> ARTICLE
I'm big on VAs, so I was really glad when I heard Akari's VA in Tamayura, since she ain't on anything eles, sadly. Akari's VA totally made her.   
Honestly, if some one else less good voiced her, I might not have liked Akari as much as I did.

Don't expect Tamayura to be Aria 2.0, while made in a similar tone, it's not the same, but I think that is a good thing. It's still really good.

PS, I looked a bit on your MAL, we have 75% on anime, I like your tastes bro :P SSY, Bakemono, S&W, Toradora and Hanasaku Iroha!  
And fucking HakoMaria!
>> ARTICLE
> I'm big on VAs, so I was really glad when I heard Akari's VA in Tamayura, since she ain't on anything eles, sadly

Hanamaru Kindergarten, dude.

HakoMaria was great, still want to re- read those novels once, if only it got an anime.

And of course I won't expect another Aria, but I'm still excited for it. I'll start on it right after I finish Usagi Drop. Glad to hear our MALs are similiar, that means you must have great taste too! Hehe. I'm on mobile now, but I'll take a look at your list later too, maybe I'll find something fun.

[*Yokohama Shopping Trip*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kik%C5%8D).

I've long held that it's set on Earth ("Man-home" is just what the residents of Aqua call it) at the same time as *ARIA*.  

Trust me on this one.  There's two two-episode OVAs out there, and the manga should be available as well.  Give 'em a watch/read.
>> ARTICLE
Never heard of it, it looks interesting. I'll make a note of it that I watch it soon, rather than forgetting it on my PTW.
>> ARTICLE
Of the 300-some anime that I have finished I'm sure something will catch your eyes.

When I got to the end of the 6th novel I was a bit angry, dammit Maria! WHY? Why did everything have to go that way? 
And to think that we have to wait for the next LN to be written and then translated... :(  
It is pretty damn good though, and I too, hope for an anime adaption sometime in the future.

I'll drop a comment on your profile on MAL since I have HB here in my reddit flair.

Alright, cool. The translator seems to be looking forward to a new novel too, so at least we'll pretty surely get a translation, when it's written.

I just finished Origination myself [over the weekend](https://np.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ufmnt/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/co806v1) and have been [evangelizing](https://np.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2q4dls/recommendation_tuesdays_week_of_december_23_2014/cn2t2ws) it [a bit obnoxiously](https://np.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2op7yo/recommendation_tuesdays_week_of_december_09_2014/cmp8sxp) throughout my watch.

Fell in love with its romanticized, positive outlook and ability to express itself within its more tender moments. Every story, while simple, was nudged gently in an unexpected direction to increase the emotional weight of any given "encounter". It has some of the most powerful exchanges between characters I've come across [Arietta](/s "like Akari and Alicia's spur-of-the-moment trip to the Campanile where Alicia expresses how her confidence as an Undine stems from the knowledge that she helped foster the growth of an apprentice as wonderful as Akari.") And yeah, the finale was something else.
>> ARTICLE
I like the bit you wrote at 'evangelizing'. You said what I wanted to say in a great way.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I like that little blurb too. I find that it's much easier to write about things you really enjoy with the aim of showing that emotion. That's something that I see in your original post as well :)
>> ARTICLE
Yea, you must savor Aria. That's pretty much why I only watched the first season and I'm looking for the right moment to start the next. 

I'd also recommend Haibane Renmei. It was as relaxing as Aria and at times profound & symbolic. 
>> ARTICLE
Adding that to my list too, looks like I'll have a bunch of SoLs to watch at night anyway, even after Aria is finished. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
It's my [number three series of all time](http://wonderduck.mu.nu/wonderducks_favorite_anime_series_of_all_time_number_three).  

The greatest episode in all of anime is in the final season [ARIA spoiler](/s "here's a hint... gloves.") but it doesn't work if you don't watch all the preceding 40 or so episodes ahead of it, and if you have no idea what's coming.  

I was cheering like the Cubs had just won the World Series and crying the same way... please note: at the time, I was a 40 year old man.  

So, yeah, it's a magical ride, truly one of the great shows of history... and **at least** half of everybody who watches it will think it's too slow paced, dull or boring.  *ARIA*'s greatest blessing is also its worst curse.  It's not for everyone... I'm okay with that, though.

And so, I suspect, are the people involved with the show.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. Yes, the show is slow, but that doesn't mean it's boring. It's calm, relaxed and if people don't like that, it's fine, because I'm sure that the people who made the show feel the same as those who watch it. From the sound effects to the city, they put so much work into this. Just like the three main characters, they worked hard and did their best every day (was there ever a bad episode?) and in the end, they created a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
> (was there ever a bad episode?)

I could have done without the "supernatural"-influenced episodes (the series didn't need them!), but even most of those were good... and the railroad ep is one of the best in the series.

But were they *bad*?  Nope!  I think the only one I didn't like was the final episode, and that was because I knew after it was over there wouldn't be any more *ARIA*.
>> ARTICLE
Aria has been one of my top 5 shows for a long time.  I own all 3 seasons and have several of the songs on my ipod.  This show may not be the first or the most popular SoL, but I do believe it was the one to perfect it.  I am honestly surprised it isn't high up on the "best show of its genre" thread.
>> ARTICLE
I think it should be, it's also ranked in the thirties on MAL, rated around an 8.8. I don't think there are many real SoLs that high up.

>And if you've already seen it, what did you think?

Origination is still my most loved show. About a month after I finished it I went to Japan and started my figure collection. It didnt take long for me to amass this [Aria collection](http://i.imgur.com/XC3YpYK.jpg?1) (and I just realised that I don't have a picture just of my Aria shelf...) Im not sure if I want to get the rest but maybe. I might one day. [Here's a close up album](http://imgur.com/a/sM5uj) (I didn't have the 1/6 Alice figure then though).

So yeah, I love this series!

It's been a while since my last SOL. This sounds like a rather good return.  Cheers for the suggestion.

Great to hear, I hope you enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I remembering binge watching this the first time and enjoyed every moment watching it. Recently I rewatched it again and had the same feeling happy and warm feeling when I first watched it.

I absolutely love these types of SoL shows such as Tamayura mentioned and Hidamari Sketch.
>> ARTICLE
I also plan to watch it again, but it looks like I have plenty of other Slice-of-life shows to watch as well, thanks for the suggestion!
>> ARTICLE
It's one of those anime I always come back to re-watch random episodes of, as one of its greatest strengths is the sheer diversity of plotlines and stories it tells without detracting from the main plot of becoming a Prima. If anything, these are life lessons which help Akari develop as a character, as well as point us viewers in the right direction of life as well. 

Don't pay attention to the MAL ratings, especially with regards to the first season. When it comes to show such as Aria, where there is less of a plot and more of a journey, impatient, spoon-fed viewers of today who value fanservice over everything else (looking at you, KyoAni fanboys) will never understand its subtleties. 
>> ARTICLE
I just used it as a bit of a reference, that people who started it but didn't like the first season rated it lower, but the people who liked it enough to continue, really loved it and rated the show much higher. I know the MAL ratings don't give a good view of a show, but it does give a bit of a general idea.
>> ARTICLE
I tried to watch it a long time ago but it wasn't my cup of tea back then, I thought it was too boring so I dropped after 3 episodes. BUT, back then I also watched and dropped Hidamari Sketch because it was boring, and after I gave it another try it became by favorite SoL anime (I noticed that you haven't watched this yet, definitely give it a try), so I guess maybe I should rewatch Aria.
>> ARTICLE
You could always try. Keep in mind that it keeps getting better, it starts with mostly introductions.

I've seen it mentioned before, Hidamari Sketch, I will definitely check it out later.
>> ARTICLE
I freaking loved the show. I binge watched though, and afterwards felt like it ended way too soon... like my happiness was taken away from me. I could easily see myself feeling the same had I stretched it out though...
>> ARTICLE
US-Shows are normally success-based. They run as long as there are enough viewers. A completly pre-designed story mostly never exists.

Japanese Shows on the other side have normally a complete designed story and run for just one season. Of course there are also exceptions for that, mostly if they are based on a still running manga/novel. And there also such endless-series like one piece, naruto or fairy tale, which have probably some planed ending, but still run from success to success until some side get bored.
>> ARTICLE
I think one of the main differences in the US  TV market and the JP market for anime is on home video sales. In Japan they air a series and at/near the middle of the season they start releasing the show on video. Depending on the sales of that they'll pick it up for another season or move on to something else. Many times they have to wait a few months to air the second season so they have time to animate it because the decision to go ahead was a last minute thing after seeing the home video sales. 

This isn't the case in the US. For a TV show in the US the decision to renew a show is made long before the home video is released and is mostly based on ratings for the show. In contrast to Japan, the DVD/BD is released only a little before the new season comes out and is used to build up hype more than gauge interest. 

*At first blush* the JP anime market looks like they have a more succinct stories because they know if the show is ending or not sooner than their US counterparts and can write in a real ending. (Not necessarily a good ending, just not a two episode "holy shit we're ending" wrap up.)
>> ARTICLE
> Depending on the sales of that they'll pick it up for another season

That's a different case. It's a fairly new strategy used for budget-relevant series. Those have either a finished story, that simply get animated, or it's a still running story, and they plan to create several season as the base-story progress. But the important point here is that the anime is just the second version of the story. The original is often a manga, novel or sometimes even a game. So the story is not success-based writen, but mostly independant from the anime.

> they know if the show is ending or not sooner than their US counterparts

Indeed. That's a cruical point. Normaly you can roll up the story before it ends, even if it just a fast ending with one chapter/episode, or an aditional ova/movie. US-Media are just finished after it's over. One great exceptions here was Firefly with it's Post-Series-Movie :)
>> ARTICLE
>But the important point here is that the anime is just the second version of the story. 

The story for adaptations is certainly success based. Every adaptation is changed either slightly or significantly to make it flow better on the new medium and give the show a better chance of success. If it fails and gets canceled they often have to create a hasty ending.

Even the original material is written for success. If your manga isn't pulling in the readers you're likely to get canceled or your light novel won't get published.

>One great exceptions here was Firefly with it's Post-Series-Movie

I was happy to see it got some closure. Stargate SG1 did the post series movie thing as well but it wasn't as major as Firefly's. They only created story arcs that could be wrapped up if needed every year up until their last season when they finally decided to start a longer arc and then got canceled when they only had 3 episodes left to film in the season. Had to wrap it up quick and put out a straight to TV movie to tie up some loose ends. 
>> ARTICLE
> Every adaptation is changed either slightly or significantly

Normaly they don't change the complete story. They write along what's existing already.

> Even the original material is written for success

Of course. Because of that they often plan the complete story just after the breaking point, and begin with something more generic to see if it will have success. But at least they have at one point story and planning, and don't write from chapter to chapter. But well, of course that only counts for story-based series.

> Stargate SG1 did the post series movie thing as well

But those were planned from the beginning. They ended the series with the movies in mind. They know about them since they started plans of the last season. That's better than most other cancelations.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to be a differing opinion here.

I honestly feel like anime tends to have worse endings.  Now, there's a lot of information I have to preface this statement with.  Bear with me, please:

   1.  First off, what *American* TV shows are we talking about?  Are we talking about shows like Dexter's Laboratory, which are episodic in nature and not really driving towards anything, or are we talking about TV like Dexter, Breaking Bad, Lone Star, Lost, etc. which drive/are driving towards a very clear conclusion?  (My answer was clearly based on the latter assumption)

   2.  To expand upon my first point, I used Dexter's Lab (an animated series) vs. Dexter (live action) to demonstrate, how varied the forms of media are available, when talking about American TV.  You can't decide that anime, in general, has better endings without first deciding the parameters of this comparison.  And, if we're honestly comparing anime with **any** form of American Television, I think *American TV endings* has an obvious advantage in sheer numbers of satisfactory endings.

   3. But ok, even without considering the form of American TV, what makes anime endings more susceptible to fault, compared to the American counterpart?  You must also keep in mind that many anime that you may not even watch (but, for the purpose of the question, still exists) are/were based off on-going manga.  This results in anime adaptions with either horribly rushed endings, or abrupt changes in pace near the end of the televised run (e.g. **Gantz**, **Ao No Exorcist**).  Sometimes, the show even gets halted/cancelled due to the manga author suffering from injury, or just being plain slow (e.g. **D. Gray Man**, **HOTD**)

   4. Now, I mention the idea of cancellations.  This is a very tricky subject.  Do they count in OP's perception of American TV or Anime endings?  Since many American TV shows are episodic and inevitably get cancelled, this gives the advantage to Anime, which tend to be shorter.  That said, for the purpose of this question, I did not consider cancellations of Anime or American TV as *true endings*, since they are not willed by the actual writers and are controlled by the studios.


Lastly, I just want people to realize when you talk about anime endings vs. American TV endings, don't just think of your favorites.  In all honestly, it's more effective to think of the worst endings, and compare them to worst American TV endings you can think of.  And if you don't feel like you've seen enough of either, don't feel pressed to pass judgement.

Note:  Did not mean for this to be so long.  Sorry about that.  Just trying to mix things up.
>> ARTICLE
An ending is an ending. Cancelation is always something you need to keep in mind, and if the ending stills sucks, than that's it. Argue about how *true* or *not true* an ending is, is just delusion. The only things really worth to call for an untrue ending would be heavens intervention, like an important people dies. The point about an ending is what feeling the viewer get's from it. And the reason for it is more or less unimportant.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm ok, still doesn't change my answer though.  There are many shows that end completely unresolved too.  But I guess funding is funding, in the end.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you on this look at how the anime claymore was ended completely rushed and pointless I believe it's this way do to studio design obviously since the manga is still on going.I believe American tv shows that span many seasons should follow in house's shoes and have a end near the top of its greatness.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, I consider good anime endings a rarity, especially in the genres fantasy and sci-fi. Most of them become weird towards the end and partially lose the appeal that they had at the beginning. That's why romance is one of my favorit genres - there's nothing much to do wrong; even for the Japanese.

Because of my last line and your comment on Toradora I have to add this: Toradora is one romance anime with a wierd ending. [Everything](/s " was resolved and wonderful but no - Taiga decides to risk it all for no reason.") It was just stupid. Still, one of my favorit anime overall.

As I don't watch western TV series, only movies, I can't really make a comparison though.
>> ARTICLE
[I agree with your opinion on Toradora's ending.](/s "It was fitting for her to go back and try living with her mother so she could prove that she wasn't just using Ryuuji as an emotional crutch, but for her to disappear without a warning was lame and unnecessary drama.")
>> ARTICLE
> especially in the genres fantasy and sci-fi.

For example?
>> ARTICLE
Redline, Mai-HiME, Summer Wars (granted, this one was kinda random from the beginning), Gundam 00, Death Note, Darker Than Black (was that weird or just boring?), Macross Frontier, Symphogear, Romeo x Juliet, and many more which are on the tip of my tongue. BTW, I gave all of these a pretty good rating. Good shows that could've been great with an ending that they deserved.
>> ARTICLE
I think any other ending would have hurt Redline. [Spoiler](/s "The MC wins, the romantic sub-plot is completed, and the government assholes were defeated. What more could it need?")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Redline should be compared at all. It is a movie, not a tv series. Movies are by definition singular and non-continuous, thus the endings _have_ to make sense.

Series are a totally different ball of yarn, sadly enough.
>> ARTICLE
Add Vision of Escaflowne to that list. I loved the show but that ending rubbed me the wrong way. Some new, interesting material appeared but they had to end it.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if we were watching different shows or something, but for me, Death Note's ending was fantastic.

I will grant you however that Gundam 00, kinda jumps the shark a bit with the latter half of the second season, but the final showdown [](/s between Ribbons and Setsuna) pretty much redeemed it for me. Good thing they never followed up that series with a movie though. I imagine it would have been terrible and involved aliens or something stupid like that...
>> ARTICLE
> Good thing they never followed up that series with a movie

They did.
>> ARTICLE
No they didn't. No such horrid mistake exists. Nope. Not in my world.
>> ARTICLE
Well, on Death Note it depends a little on how broad we define the term ending. The way how Light fell by his narcistic overconfidence and his final moments were presented greatly and are indeed among the most memorable moments in anime. But the set-up felt somewhat forced and didn't work for me. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't thank that they have bad endings. Well, except for Darker than Black, which is AFAIK unfinished, or so. It's more that they all have generic or average endings. Just the kind o story that leads there.
>> ARTICLE
I never said "bad" either. Just "weird"
>> ARTICLE
You said it yourself, you don't have the experience with American TV (or bad anime) to see that, really, they're the same. Most shows have mediocre endings with a few that venture into really bad/good. 

Twelve Kindoms for example. One of my favorite anime of all time with a fantastic story right up until it stops. There is no ending, just a last episode. A higher up and important person in the production of the anime got sick and they halted production and never picked it up again.

EDIT: Just ready this back and it sounds kind of snarky, don't mean to offend.
>> ARTICLE
Was that written like this somewhere (the 'a higher up and important person in the production... got sick and they halted' bit).

Juuni kokki was the anime that bought me back to anime after a loooong hiatus and the sudden stop was a tad baffling. Never found out at the time what happened, just that it stopped. :(

Years later I figured that since the original novels by no Fuyumi were/are quite different they kinda ran out of ideas or couldn't fit the rest of it in and thus stopped. 

Afaik even the novel doesn't really appear to be finished because as soon as something from the author is heard about 'going back and continuing an older novel that's still not finished' the Twelve Kingdom fans as well as the Ghost Hunt fans start hoping. XD
>> ARTICLE
The original don't really have Youko as the main character. She was the focus of her story but the novels covered several stories. The anime tried to work her into the other stories so the audience had some consistency and caused them some headache in trying to make it all work. Taiki's story was completed in the novels but is where the anime ended abruptly, you can read on fansites or from the novels what actually happened to him. 
>> ARTICLE
Like most subjective questions of this nature, any media is filled with tons of garbage and a tiny amount of gold. I don't think anime has fewer or more good endings than other media. 


If I had to guess, I'd say anime endings have probably gotten worse due to the prevalence of adapting the first few volumes of unfinished LNs. However, even many of those manage satisfying endings. But this is anecdotal and doesn't really mean anything.
>> ARTICLE
>I am woefully uncultured when it comes to good TV shows, movies, books, basically things that aren't cute girls doing cute things

You need to watch/read more, you're missing a lot
>> ARTICLE
>I am woefully uncultured when it comes to good TV shows, movies, books, basically things that aren't cute girls doing cute things, so I feel like I'm far too biased to answer my own question.

This is one of those things that make me realize how much tougher it is to come up with an ending for something with a serious atmosphere as opposed to something without. Moe/fujoshi/harem/slice of life endings gets constant praise everywhere I go, but any other genre people will go more in depth when picking their favorite endings.

>> ARTICLE
I can't really say if Anime endings are better or worst since I enjoy them both. But I can definitely say Anime endings are more unpredictable depending on what genre you are watching.  When is the last time you saw a tragedy ending in a western romance show/movie? I can't even remember one.  But I can name a few that I watched in anime in just the last month.  When I watch a drama/romance from the west I already know pretty much how it's going to end, I just enjoy the ride. When I watch a drama/romance anime I'm always on the edge of my seat because I just know somebody can get run over by a car or get cancer or some weird disease at any moment. That edge does definitely add a lot of entertainment, but it does take time to get used to that sort of ending if you are new to it. I can't even count how many times Anime has ruined and ending for me "

I do have to agree with others here that it's difficult to compare since a lot of shows from the west just keep going on and on and on forever. It's not like we get a bunch of new 12 ep series several times a year like we do with anime.

Edit: Since we are talking about endings, I just wanted to take this opportunity to give [Kare Kano](http://myanimelist.net/anime/145/Kareshi_Kanojo_no_Jijou) a big Fuck You. It's kind of a ritual of mine whenever endings are brought up.
>> ARTICLE
Oh Karekano... this anime suffered from too much creative misunderstandings, Masami Tsuda didn't like the take of Hideaki Anno on her story and the series was cut short. You should give Kare Kano's manga a try, the ending is a lot superior! 
>> ARTICLE
The reason I hate it so much, it's because I was really really loving it, then the last few episodes just took a giant crap on everything.
>> ARTICLE
One thing anime shows are severly lacking is twist endings.  You know, giving us an ending int he last episode or 2 that no one expected.  Most endings are too warm, fuzzy, and predictable for my taste.
>> ARTICLE
they are of the **same quality** as endings in other media.


From what I hear, Lost was just as disappointing as your typical thrown together anime ending.


Who remembers Seinfeld's dumb ending?

Plus, how many anime had dumb cop-out non-endings like the Sopranos did.

The difference between that and . . .say. . .Deadman Wonderland is Sopranos was THEE ending. There's no novel series or what-have-you that it's based off of. Deadman Wonderland just wasn't going to continue in anime form (the manga is still running).


Oh, you know what American show will end the way the original Full Metal Alchemist did if it ends anytime soon?
 The Walking Dead. . .the comic isn't over. That's why they arent' following it exactly.


 See, anime and American TV have less chance of closing well if whoever is involved isn't allowed to tell their full story.

 Burn Notice apparently has one more season to go, as does Sons of Anarchy and Breaking Bad. . . none of those are getting cancelled. 

 Durarara, what happened, they didn't get funding for another season? Someone said that was what happened to Deadman Wonderland.

 On the other hand, Lost, form what I am told TERRIBLE ending. . .and that was one of those shows they didn't have entirely written before it started. 
 The TV version of X. . . CLAMP said every version was going to end differently some time before that was made. You still got that stupid cop-out ending they had.
>> ARTICLE
I watched every episode of LOST except for the last one. I watched them as they aired, every week for however many years the show was airing. I didn't watch the last episode because I knew it would be bad. The issue with LOST is that they had an ending but it was doing so well that some exec told them to push two (maybe three?) more seasons out of the show. Writers had to change the ending and bullshit two seasons. Not-so-coincidentally those were the worst seasons where the plot really derailed.
>> ARTICLE
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh


that explains so much

 not to mention THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH DRAGON BALL Z (the manga)

 Toriyama meant to end that thing way earlier than he did.


 makes me wonder about naruto
>> ARTICLE
I feel that this question raised by the OP involves a bit of generalisation. How does one measure endings of media forms as being better or worse than the other The question itself is asking for a comparison of two categories pertaining to over thousands if not millions of individual items. A person may respond using examples but if anything these are more than likely shows that they have seen. Each person's answer will probably be limited to what specific media forms they have personally experienced. Media forms such as anime, films, tv shows are in essence interpretative texts which of course means are highly subjective to each individual. This is  reinforced by the fact that 'endings' aren't something that can be taken by face value. It is context dependant. I can assure that if you went to watch any ending to text without watching all the events leading up to it, the 'ending' will have little meaning.

For example, using LOST as an example, yes it did have its problems with writing, and yes the writers did say they were basically making stuff up as the show progressed and yes people did say the ending was bad BUT there were also people who were satisfied with the ending considering its sentimental value. 
There is no accurate way of determining if an ending is bad. It can be factored by many variables such as poor writing but at its core, is still something that is subjective and interpretive. eg. See Twilight and 50 shades of grey.


No offence to the OP but your question is flawed considering you are calling for an unfair comparison between various media forms by asking an overly generalised question. So any response you read here, please take with a grain of salt (including mine).

However if you really wanted MY OPINION to your question then I would have to say that from what I have experienced I found that Animes to be less impressive than other forms of media. Need that I remind you that my answer is limited to what I've seen, read, played. I always felt the endings to any text is affected by the context, so more often than not the plot leading to the final 'end' is what I take into consideration into determining where I like it or not.


 For instance, Code Geass is one of my favourites, every episode ended in a cliff hanger that made me feel tortured waiting an entire week for the next episode. I was intrigued by Lelouch as an anti-hero who started with noble intentions who began to exploit the people he sought to protect as he gained more power. Through the entirety of S1 and S2, I was like.. "Lelouch is such a bad guy now but I'm still rooting for him" and then when the ending happened..[Code Geass SPOILER](/s "Lelouch was actually still the same good guy from the start sacrificing himself and his relationships with the people he cares about for the greater good of the world") It was like a massive mindfuck moment for me.. So actually I kind of felt that the ending was not about what actually happened in the ending but rather the emotional response that it gave me. Clannad S2 was so heart wrenching until the very end in the final moments that my severe depression transformed into the happiness of a 5year old kid receiving a giant banana split. To me, the endings are all about the emotions of having to say goodbye to a show after all the 'feels' experienced on undertaking the journey with the characters.


In my experience I have felt that there have been more texts that have achieved this than animes have. To name a few without going into depth into (considering the length of my post).

* Breaking Bad (series)
* Game of Thrones (series)
* The Walking Dead (series)
* The Walking Dead Game (Ep 1-5) (videogame)
* Battlestar Galactica (series)
* The Road (film)
* The Dark Knight (film)
* Band of Brothers (mini series)

>> ARTICLE
I've seen many TV shows (more form US than the UK) that end with unfinished or rushed/bad endings. Some have ending which try squash all of future plot into the last episode, for example Caprica (The last 5 minuets showed really interesting plots that led up to BG).
>> ARTICLE
not to defend the ending of caprica or anything.I think they really wanted wanted to extend the series for more then one season, but when it got canceled they just threw everything in to the last episode =)
>> ARTICLE
I know that but it is really their fault they didn't get another season. They after episode 1 every episode was slow paced and pace and scale only got to an interesting level (for US audience) near the end and by that time most people had tuned out. Seen as it was a prequel series that would only be watched by Bg fans they should have catered it for them. Caprica made exactly the same mistakes as Stargate Universe.  
>> ARTICLE
hmm.. you have a point. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, they are at least on par with 2012's video game endings.  AC III, ME 3 and FFXIII-2 all really shit the bed in terms of endings.  One was lazy, the other missed the point, and the last was just one big fuck you.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair to 13-2, it really was just a giant set up for 13-3.  So hopefully Square can pull that together nicely.
>> ARTICLE
I would say worse if it wasn't for the Coen brothers.
>> ARTICLE
>though anime and video games is obviously apples and oranges.

Anime is oranges. Oranges are better than apples. I like oranges.

And to answer your question, a lot of the American shows I watch don't really have endings. They kind of just... end. So yeah, I prefer anime endings to no endings.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like most animes have planned endings... The writers end the story when they want to. The endings to US shows are usually more of "Ok, we got cancelled, end it now," and are more thrown together due to necessity.
>> ARTICLE
From my experience, Anime endings tend to be on the less satisfactory side. They are almost always open ended and tend to leave lots of questions hanging. Worst of all, they always seem to end with a positive happy ending. It's not a bad thing to have good endings, but when it conflicts with the material or emotional impact of the story just so viewers don't get sad I don't like it. 

US TV shows tend to keep all the sad/bad/tragic moments and have fairly satisfactory endings. It's not all happy endings, and you get the feeling they are moving on in life instead of "we go back to our normal ways day after day".
>> ARTICLE
Better- Code Geass. That is all
>> ARTICLE
Compared to the american TV shows, for sure.

Some Anime have horrendous endings *cough school days cough* but thus far I haven't seen one American TV show that has an ending I think is good.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure what you mean when you say horrendous. Did you mean the ending itself was horrendous, or what characters did is horrendous?  Eitherway, I approve of School Day's ending b/c it's ending is mainly what made it memorable.  If the main guy picked a girl and lived happily ever after, it would be so dull and unoriginal, like the 80% of other harem animes out there.  For an ending to be popular enough to generate a meme is a successful ending imho. :D
>> ARTICLE
Well the series starts off fine but few episodes in to it everything starts dropping vertically.

In the end, I felt like carving out my eyeballs and stabbing myself until I stopped moving.

Sure, the ending succeeded in doing what it wanted, not denying that. But it's just beyond awful. By far the worst series altogether I've seen thus far.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, you don't like dark stories, huh? XD
After watching Higurashi, I started enjoying horror/dark drama stories.  I suggest you never, and I mean NEVER watch an anime show called Saikano.  School days is rainbows and bubbles compared to that show.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I love dark stories. The way School Days went was just astonishingly idiotic.

Higurashi I didn't watch completely. My friend watched it while he was staying over at my place so I listened and took peeks every now and then, I didn't really like it that much. It got up and became better towards the end but the first half was pretty bad.

By the way, Saikano is in the top 10 of the shows I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Lol, so my impression about your taste was dead wrong. :p And I'm happy that you like Saikano that much.  Though i was pretty depressed after watching it, I would say its in my top 10 too.  

I knew i was getting into some deep shit when at the end of the episode 20 or something, the translator team put a big warning sign telling us to stop watching here if we want to stay happy. rofl

Oh, and both higurash and School days's "horror" is reliant on its shock value, or the WTF-ness of it.  I know it's abrupt and makes very little sense, and that's why you didn't like it I guess.  
>> ARTICLE
For me it seems like with a lot of anime it either ends with a tear running down your cheek or you flipping over your chair, filled up with adrenaline from such a bad ass extreme ending. With normal shows that I watch on television it seems like they base a lot of the story on plot twists and deception every 5 seconds.
>> ARTICLE
As with everything, it depends on the show.

Metalocalypse has great season endings, in general, as an example.
>> ARTICLE
Anime actually HAVE endings, US tv just sort of goes until the producers realize it can't make anymore money, so they give it a half-assed conclusion.

So yes.
>> ARTICLE
Evengelion's ending was the movie, episodes 24-26 never happened! Those episodes never happened. this is not the end you were looking for.
>> ARTICLE
...those episodes are an integral part of the series, they just shouldn't of been the end, 24-26 fit well with the tone of eva, but didn't give a satisfactory conclusion.

All those poor people getting shipped empty boxes...
>> ARTICLE
I was very confused about this list until I reread what this list actually is. These aren't the all-time best selling TV anime sales, these are the all-time best selling TV anime **average** sales.

So, although older anime series like Evangelion might have had the highest total number of sales, those sales *per month* (or whatever time period this chart averages) have tapered off over time, causing it to fall off the chart. So, this chart will tend to show higher rankings for newer series.
>> ARTICLE
No, that's wrong. Those sales number are total average tracked by [Oricon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon) from the day the BD/DVD is released up until now, it usually stays the chart for only 2 or 3 weeks since most of the sales come from the first week so there're no such thing as 'per month' sales. And Oricon is established in 1999 so this list is only limited to post-2000 anime (that's why there're no Evangelion)

There's a list for pre-2000 (Anko-chan posted it), but i'm not so sure about its accurateness.

>> ARTICLE
Seems a mistake in titel: To aru Kagaku no Index.

It's either 'To aru Kagaku no Railgun' or 'To aru Majutsu no Index'
>> ARTICLE
I noticed this as well. Pretty sure Index does not classify as "scientific". It make me chuckle. Usually I see the opposite and people write "To aru Majutsu no Railgun".
>> ARTICLE
Am I missing something? Shouldn't Evangelion be on top? Or at least on the list?
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty niche anime, to be frank, and not everyone that watched it understood it or liked it. That's not to say it wasn't well done, though.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the movies would sell well, because of all the ads and publicity stunts we see in convenience stores and whatnot.  Maybe US anime fans have an unrealistic perspective when it comes to seeing Japanese promos for Evangelion movies.
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion, as I understand it, was a pretty big success. Not the biggest, but it had good reviews. But it just wasn't accessible to the mainstream. It is, after all, a mech series at it's core, and very into sci-fi beyond that. Throw in some daddy problems and a dash of odeipus (sp?), and you have a series that a select few will love, but most will not understand. They'll just see giant robots.
>> ARTICLE
>Not the biggest

Except that it has the highest BD/DVD sales out of any anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Then why isn't it on the list? It does say "all-time."
>> ARTICLE
It's been said in the thread multiple times already. The people collecting the data starting in 1999 so all of the anime are from 2000+. EVA is from 1995. EVA has sold 170K+ copies, more than Bakemonogatari, which is at the top of the list.

This list only has anime that came out in 2000 or later; the data for older series is less reliable, but Evangelion is the series with the highest per-volume average.

I'm guessing that this list is just a copy of the post-2000 data from [here](http://www.mania.com/aodvb/showthread.php?p=2010466#post2010466), although I don't know why Golden Eggs isn't listed there.

>> ARTICLE
You can say that for Nise, but Bake didn't really have that much fan service.
>> ARTICLE
Just because Nise has way more fanservice than normal doesn't mean Bake didn't have its fair share.
>> ARTICLE
That's also not counting Nisemonogatari with it. 
>> ARTICLE
Goes ros show that Girls Und Pamzer is a force of nature.
>> ARTICLE
Not very involved in the anime community so I had no idea that disney apparently does anime. 
>> ARTICLE
*Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Brotherhood* should be listed as either *Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Fullmetal Alchemist* (Japanese title) or *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* (English title)
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero!!!!!!!! Yeah I got all the blu-ray and figures
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure most shows at the top don't really fall under "mediocre" (except Destiny with its near universal dislike in the west)
>> ARTICLE
Tom and Jerry fucking rules. Was my favorite cartoon when I was little. Made me smile to see it up there.

>FLCL in the top 100 vs low 400s on MAL

>NGE in the top 10

>All that GiTS

[](#gintamathispleasesme)

I do wonder how much censorship and sample size (only a few thousand votes) play a role though.

The links are for me to keep track of some random things I feel like I could easily mix up. Also, some of the ranks seem to have changed slightly, so OP's list and mine won't match up on some places.

>> ARTICLE
Censorship probably have no effect, sample size definitely had an effect. 
>> ARTICLE
thanks for going through MAL

Nvm, going back and forth up and down I mixed up the GiTS you had.

I think I'll leave it there. Still, it's an interesting bit of data-crunching...
>> ARTICLE
IRRC the Anikore rank is based on popularity and not score, so I'm not sure how much it'll be directly comparable.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it will at least be including the total score number. And those at least seem to be following the rank number so far...
>> ARTICLE
The Bangumi rank is also slightly based on popularity.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, okay.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam War in the Pocket:

> bangumi.tv: Rank 44

> MAL: Rank 764.

China > West. 

Also the fact that all the GitS being rated so much higher says quality tastes. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I can get behind this list a little more (one piece is higher :D) 
>> ARTICLE
> 86 WALL-E

wat
>> ARTICLE
It's an animated movie, and a damn good one at that
>> ARTICLE
Yet again, Gintama within the top 3.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is fucking huge in China (pun intended)
>> ARTICLE
Im actually surprised Hikaru no Go is there, no one talks about it
>> ARTICLE
This is the first ranking Ive seen which puts Steins;Gate and FMAB that low. 
>> ARTICLE
This list isn't filled with hyped up shows like MAL is, interesting.

EDIT: I noticed the smaller number of people who rated these anime, which may attribute to the difference between it and MAL
>> ARTICLE
Yes, OPM isn't in this freaking list

[](#helmetbro)
>> ARTICLE
\#1 is Cowboy Bebop, I'm impressed
>> ARTICLE
They seem to like Mecha and Sci-Fi/Space more. Interesting.
>> ARTICLE
What's kind of interesting is that compared against MAL, you'd need to skew these scores up by 0.15 to 0.25.  I'm curious about their overall average score, and the number of anime on their list.

Some changes are nice, like not having FMA:B as an absurd 9.25.  But then again, Gintama is still up there, so wamp wamp.
>> ARTICLE
Fumoffu at75, everything is right with this list
>> ARTICLE
I don't see Trigun on here, but other than that all my favorites made it.

How does an anime like The World of Golden Eggs even get that much sales? 

Furthermore, how does this go for more than $10 with what seems to be a low budget web series?
>> ARTICLE
Probably tells you just how insanely niche anime is in Japan.
>> ARTICLE
What I wanna know Is wtf is it that it got released in 2005 yet is beating Eva in sales

Shaft shafting it up with 4 top 10 titles :D  
Those lists always remind me of how eastern and western interests in terms of anime differ.

With the gap between Monogatari S2 and Attack on Titans closing, what's the chance of Monogatari taking over as the best selling series of 2013?
>> ARTICLE
It probably won't take over, unless Titan crashes. If I understand analysts correctly, Monogatari will be extremely consistent, i.e. it will probably hover around pretty much the same number until the end.

However, and on that note, it's not guaranteed that Titan will be consistent. If everyone suddenly loses interest in it, the average may drop enough to allow Monogatari to take over, but that's very unlikely.
>> ARTICLE
It's the other way round, Monogatari will be extremely inconsistent sales wise. Kabukimonogatari will outsell Nekomonogatari: Shiro by a huge margin but Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari are set to sell not that well. So Monogatari will almost certainly outsell Titan temporarily when the Kabukimonogatari sale results are out, but in the end the numbers will probably be not that far from its current numbers.
>> ARTICLE
Your analysis got me curious, so I did a little digging and compiled the data and chart to comparing the two.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ajj_IfkmgvF0dEdXS1JXUG5qUlFVSG5XdVNWN3h6QWc&gid=10

Looks like your analysis is mostly on the mark.  The biggest issue hurting Monogatari's chance of a late come-back is the lack of a longtail (BD Multipler Monogatari 1.1 vs SnK 1.4).  There's a good chance that Monogatari S2 will end up winning the BD average, but its lack of DVD sales dooms any chance for the overall BD+DVD average.
>> ARTICLE
>but Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari are set to sell not that well

This is a case where the stalker is unreliable.  I know for at least one of the arcs, their volumes were at rank 2/3 during their first week instead of 1/2 because there was something else high profile that went up for pre-order around the same time they went up.  There's a huge difference between consistently 2nd and consistently first for a week points-wise, but it doesn't necessarily means the sales were that different if at all.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, thanks for the correction.

I should've remembered that the fact that it's split into arcs will cause some volumes to be more popular. I just went with the fact that v1 seemed to be extremely well predicted.
>> ARTICLE
Some surprises for me: I enjoyed Bakemonogatari but didn't expect it to be so high up on the list. When I think about it it sorta makes sense. It's one of the few harem shows that successfully convinces the viewer that the protagonist is justified in having an entourage of girls. Also, the dialogue sounds intelligent. Bascially it's wish fulfillment for a lot of otaku.

I didn't expect Madoka to be so high up either, but I guess it's due to Urobutcher's stellar writing. And, other than Nanoha, there's really no other show like it. It really filled a subgenre void.

Also, I thought Kyoani's powerhouse shows would be higher up on the list... which got me thinking, how would these shows fare if you included non-dvd sales like figurines?

Toshokan Sensou made it onto the list? I thought the show was charming but not compelling enough to rake in sales. Perhaps the work of the Fujoshi legion?

And finally, why is Umi ga Kikoeru on this list? Did it first air on TV despite being a Ghibli movie?

Anyway, glad to see Hataraku and SNAFU made it on from this season.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka would probably crush everybody (late-night) if we include figurines and other goodies. It even has its own monthly magazine/anthology where popular artists draws their fanfics/stories. Vol 11 just came out this year.

Latest figures for Madoka series was $400 million in 2012. Should easily top $600 million+ with the movie this year and goods that comes with it.

BURA JANAI!
>> ARTICLE
seriously, WTF?
>> ARTICLE
I want an explanation of why is this so popular
>> ARTICLE
It aired prime-time and is a family friendly show. I don't think it's especially popular compared to other prime-time shows like Sazae-san or Doraemon, but It's much shorter so I can see it selling lots of dvd's as opposed to Sazae-san which has almost 7000 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's supposed to be educational. It's to help learn English if I recall right. So that may be one reason.

it's one of my favorites and nobody ever talks about it, so i'm glad it at least sold well when it aired.

> *26,047 Fate/Stay Night [Deen]

huh. i guess the japanese didn't think it was a bad adaption...
>> ARTICLE
Woah this is so weird. I went to bed last night looking for these exact statistics, but couldn't find any. So, thanks!

Edit: Shouldn't Neko:Black be on this list? It's sold 60k+ last I checked.

Edit 2: Nevermind, it counts as a Special. Kinda crazy, though, if you count it, the combined -monogatari is almost 200,000. 
>> ARTICLE
It shouldn't count as a special, it aired on TV first
>> ARTICLE
I agree. I think it also aired on Nico at the same time? So I guess it's both. Maybe the difference is that it wasn't made for a specific time slot.
>> ARTICLE
>the combined -monogatari is almost 200,000. 
Remember that these are only average volume sales, not total sales. The sales per season  of monogatari have been decreasing over time.

Why in the Seven Hells has Nanoha StrikerS sold more than A's?! Damnit Japan!
>> ARTICLE
because strikers TV version has [worse quality](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrHSLt71we4)
>> ARTICLE
Some interesting things I noticed:

For how much love Steins;Gate gets here, it's pretty low on that list - just beating out Chuu2, which at 15k is more than I was expecting. Also surprised to see Cowboy Bebop so low. Does that include US Sales?

I'm glad to see Love Live! and GuP up there. Someone already mentioned F/SN at 26k. I liked it. I'm glad it's up there.

Clannad > Clannad: After Story; lel. 

I know people like Bakemonogatari, but I'm surprised at a mammoth 78k. Is there a reason for that? Is it just that good? I've got it, I'm gonna watch it now.

*monogatari and Urobuchi slaughter. Holy cow.

It's cool to see how well the data fit a curve. http://i.imgur.com/LQdIW3s.jpg

10 of KyoAni's 18 TV series make that list.
>> ARTICLE
It is really good, but its high numbers have always confused me as well. To me, it doesn't really have the features some of these other shows on the list have, what you could think of as universal appeal. Maybe its uniqueness makes it stand out. Maybe the LN was insanely popular anyways, so it already had a solid fanbase. I'm curious to know.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone have a link to the last update?

Why has Yamato only just been added? It's had sales at pretty much that level since it went on sale last year.

Top of list seems dominated by recent releases and franchises, hm.

Also, had to look up The World of Golden Eggs, since this was my first time hearing of it.

Definitely interesting.
>> ARTICLE
>Top of list seems dominated by recent releases and franchises, hm.

That struck me as odd at first too, but then I realized that as DVDs became popular, cheaper to make, and cheaper to buy, home video sales went up a lot.

[] BoxOfficeMojo reported 5,557,907,165 for Eva 3.0 back in early February, but Bunka Tsushin reported 5,260,000,000 at close of theatrical release. As a Japanese source and a more recent source, I'm going to have to give Bunka Tsushin more credibility here. BoxOfficeMojo may be overly affected by changes in exchange rate as it's not clear how they calculate their totals.

>> ARTICLE
Huh, with all the hype that Haruhi got in 2006, I would've expected much higher sales. Did it all go into merchandizing?
>> ARTICLE
An average of 42K is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly didnt expect to see Bakemonogatari so high up. I knew it well recieved but whoa. Thats amazing.

I'm happy to see Hataraku Maou Sama doing well.
>> ARTICLE
When you consider that Nisemonogatari is also up there at 60k, and the Neko OVAs did really well too, the Monogatari series is actually a powerhouse selling series. I'm looking forward to hearing how the first volume of Season Season did, which released recently. 

And then you consider that Madoka is up there, and the movies did really well, it shows that Shaft and Shinbou might be considered the most successful anime team on the market currently. 

>> ARTICLE
I actually saw the sales for Nise before I'd ever seen Bake so I just assumed that Nise did better than Bake and never bothered to check just how well Bakemonogatari actually did.

How well did Neko do? Also Neko wasn't an OVA, it was a TV special. I think they aired all four episodes in one night and simulcasted them as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know it was a TV special. It tops the list at 56k. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Love Live outsold Jojo, an immensely popular franchise with a lot of content and history behind it. Though I guess it's not completely fair to compare the two since Jojo had 2 adaptations, with a third coming soon (with the third being the most popular). But I guess that just goes to show you the power of moe idols.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I can't wait to see the numbers after Part 3 comes out since it's what they live by over there.
>> ARTICLE
What the heck is "The World of Golden Eggs" lol, looks like a children's show which makes sense. 
On the list I'm surprised that SAO *only* sold 35k, thought it was more popular than that. 

SnK no surprise it's selling big. 

Madoka somewhat of a surprise I knew it was popular but not quite 71k popular.

I thought Haruhi would be near the top of the list but only 42k.

Wonder what it would take for a series to break 100k these days, would have to be immensely popular and/or have a lot of volumes.
>> ARTICLE
>What the heck is "The World of Golden Eggs" lol, looks like a children's show which makes sense. 

It's not. It's an adult short (one of the episodes revolved around 2 teens fucking in the bushes at school). Very much like Robot Chicken's story style but there are no cultural jokes. Just plain datsuryoku-kei comedy. Occasionally there is a live-action cooking segment reminiscent of the one from Tentai Senshi Sunred. 

It aired on MTV in Japan so think about American MTV cartoons and that should give you an easier picture.



>> ARTICLE
Why am i not surprised?
>> ARTICLE
Fate series sucks anyway. I don't get how someone from the West can stomach the horribly interpreted Western themes.

I'm sorry, I know it's dickish to hate on things, but I can only take so much inundation of this show's praises.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how much experience you have with the fate series, but having played the visual novels I can safely say I have no idea what "western themes" you are talking about. If you are just talking about pulling from western legends like King Aurthur and whatnot, then 1 those are not themes, and 2 you could not be more wrong. 

But yeah the anime sucks pretty hard. Did almost nothing right.
>> ARTICLE
You're nitpicking over a word that's not even really even wrong. The interpretations at least in the anime were really shallow, as well.
>> ARTICLE
Everything in the anime was really shallow. The anime was really shallow. The VN gives character profiles to each of the servants and explains how they are affected by being summoned. Forcing them into a class alters them from their historical/mythological selves in various ways. Additionally they are strongly affected by how people remember their legend, rather than actual fact. 

They give a lot more depth and characterization to each of them, and delve more into the legends they are from.
>> ARTICLE
I see, so the problem I mentioned is probably not there in the VN.

> Avatar the Last Airbender, #13

I am personally happy with this, fantastic series, would have it #1 on mine if it was an anime/on MAL.

If I counted correct, I have 50/100 either completed, watching at the moment, or on hold.

It is mildly amusing to me that A:tLA is  (anime in Japanese), but not an anime (in English).

Because we Americans are picky as Fuck. RWBY is even considered an anime in Japan because they don't give a shit about cartoon vs anime wars over there. If it's animated then it's anime by default
>> ARTICLE
>If it's animated then it's anime by default

Yes, but anime is the japanese word we use to describe japanese animation only. Its not about cartoon vs anime, its about making clear what is what.

Holy cow Gate

That looks like a grand case of hype-train and airing bias.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Also Haikyuu at 9th, OPM at 3rd, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu at 73, Death Parade at 79, Naruto at 89 and One Piece at 59.

Definitely strong bias towards shows that are currently airing. 
>> ARTICLE
One piece..  Strong bias? Bruh if it finished airing it'd be rated a lot higher
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. I'm not sure about that. The story is great but the pacing for the anime is horseshit.

I love the story. However I can't give a shit about the story if it takes 50 episodes to complete an arc.

At this rate Oda might die before we see the ending of the story.
>> ARTICLE
It's not what you think though, just how it'd be rated. Fk the pacing agreed
>> ARTICLE
lmao Haikyuu is pretty damn good, it's pretty high up even on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
OPM is good as well. Doesn't mean they're not overrated by recency bias.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's cool how Avatar, RWBY, and similar shows are allowed. This and allowing for scores of X/100 are all the only things I've liked about Hummingbird so far.

You must be thinking about another site, I don't think Hummingbird has x/100

Not sure if I'm more happy with Bebop in the top 10 or salty AF that OPM is above Hunter x Hunter...so conflicted.

The following were anime on the myanimelist top 100 that were not on the hummingbird top 100:

Katkyo Hitman Reborn! (rank 100 on MAL)

Honey and Clover (rank 99 on MAL)

Detective Conan (rank 98 on MAL)

Ashita no Joe (rank 97 on MAL)

One Outs (rank 96 on MAL)

Kyoukai no Kanata (rank 94 on MAL)

The Tale of Princess Kaguya (rank 93 on MAL)

Rose of Versailles (rank 92 on MAL)

Beck (rank 90 on MAL)

Sakurasou (rank 89 on MAL)

Ouran High School Host Club (rank 88 on MAL)

Higurashi (rank 84 on MAL)

Angel Beats (rank 83 on MAL)

Tsubasa (rank 82 on MAL)

Kemono no Souja Erin (rank 77 on MAL)

Shirobako (rank 73 on MAL)

Romeo no Aoi Sora (rank 68 on MAL)

Mononoke (rank 64 on MAL)

Slam Dunk (rank 55 on MAL)

Nana (rank 50 on MAL)

Kingdom (rank 46 on MAL)

Rainbow (rank 34 on MAL)

Personally, I agree more with the MAL top 100.

How many have you seen out of the hummingbird list?

I have 50/100. Exactly half.

68 seen or attempted, compared to 53 from the corresponding condensed MAL Top 100. Maybe I should switch over.

Next we'll get to see an adjusted score combining the MAL and Hummingbird to see where a lot of shows even out.

>> ARTICLE
I liked magi... :(
>> ARTICLE
There's nothing wrong with liking it, but it's a bad show on almost every level. It was like a poor man's Avatar or FMA.
>> ARTICLE
How was it "bad"? It was pretty, had some nice characters, a kinda unique setting and some pretty welldone action scenes. It was a bit childish sure, but I don't think it was bad...
>> ARTICLE
The pacing was really bad, for starters. All the arcs were paced poorly. The earlier episodes were just rushed, and didn't allow you to form any sort of connection to the characters. The later arcs were drawn out and dragged on to unreasonable lengths.

The characters are some of the worst I've seen. Obviously this was to cater towards a young audience, but that's no excuse for having poorly written backstories, and shocking character exposition. Alibaba is probably the character I hate the most (save Kirito). He was written to be juvenile and immature, as were most of the characters, which honestly reflects quite poorly on the writers.

The plot was not well thought out, and was unsatisfying, especially compared to the superior Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

And why did you emphasize Card Captor Sakura ?
>> ARTICLE
Basically, this is the list of every show that has sold over 10,000 copies, which is considered the marking of a large success. 

Card Captor Sakura was highlighted because of the positioning at the bottom of the list. All the series that are moving up the list are from the last year (2012-13, anyway), except Card Captor. It was released in 1998, yet it's moved up! Very impressive!

>> ARTICLE
I'm still a little confused and new to this, what does average mean exactly? Are these numbers the total sales since the shows came out?  Also how come One Piece and Naruto Arent up there, but Bleach.

, I did a little research, and as I understand it now, These # are average sales per year per volume since the respective vol. Came out, right?   (So, f.e. This means that each Evangelion DVD/BE has sold a total amount of ~20million? Holy Shit)
>> ARTICLE
111k x 20 is two million not twenty
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, you are right, wrote that really late, sorry.
>> ARTICLE
That makes more sense, I would prefer a chart with the total amount of each anime sold.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand what is meant by "average". Is it an average over the number of years?

No idea how a few of these are so high, especially The world of Golden Eggs?!?!
>> ARTICLE
How come Sword Art Online is shown as selling almost 1,000 less than the last update, and 2,000 less than the update before that?

because over time if they dont keep selling as many units as before the average will drop
>> ARTICLE
One of my favorite series of all time.  It does atmosphere great and is very calming.  But it does have bits of drama sprinkled in and the further you go into each season the darker the anime gets.  Other than that, it's pretty much what you've described.  
>> ARTICLE
Lighthearted, episodic but episode 2 of the first season (only season I've watched) made me cry. Brilliant imo. Gave it a 10/10


>> ARTICLE
Since you have seen Mushi-shi, I will say that the two shows are kinda similar. Mushi-shi Is about a man who is forced to live a nomadic life while protecting people from unnatural and potentially dangerous creatures (mushi). Natsume Yujincho is about a high school student who interacts with unnatural and potentially dangerous creatures (youkai) while forging relationships with the various people he meets.

If you liked Mushi-shi you will probably like Natsume Yujincho
>> ARTICLE
> while protecting people from unnatural and potentially dangerous creatures

Quite the opposite actually. The series emphasizes the idea that mushi are the most primitive form of nature and hold no malice. They *are* nature. The only reason that people (in the series) think they are unnatural is because they are not as connected to nature as Ginko is. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved it. Personally, I feel it's very bittersweet. It's very episodic, but there a lot of episodes where I just want to cry for Natsume.
>> ARTICLE
I'v watched all three seasons of Natsume and I'm about to watch the fourth. In my opinion, the first one's the best but the rest is pretty good too. Just like others have said, it has a very relaxing atmosphere, great music, reminds me a lot of Mushishi and you just feel good after every episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Good if you like melancholy anime. 
>> ARTICLE
As in certain melancholic events or is the whole tone generally sad?  Anything to make you cry?
>> ARTICLE
Cry, yes. Definitely possible but it is all very subtle. It does a very good job of engaging you with subtle emotional moments.
>> ARTICLE
This should kind of describe Natsume's theme: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_no_aware
>> ARTICLE
Describes it perfectly. 

Its light, but you leave feeling a bit sad and happy at the same time. And nyanko sensei is a fun character to watch. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, this is great!
>> ARTICLE
If you're into animes like Mushi-shi and Spice&Wolf, Natsume Yuujincho has that same kind of feel. However, it's also got a touch of that slice of life/coming of age feel that animes like Sakamichi no Apollon have.

A close parallel in theme and circumstance might be xxxHolic.

I'm surprised Love Live outsold Idolmaster considering the Idolmaster franchise is huge. They've got games, tons of merch, spin-off anime series, etc. The popularity of idols and idol shows must be even bigger in the recent years than when Idolmaster was on sale.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably because Idolmaster is more known for the games than the anime and the anime is just a by-product of its popularity. While Love Live is a manga which means it originally has no sounds and people prefers the one with music

Just a guess of course
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I wasn't aware of the two series' history. It makes sense. I just figured it was a shift in culture and taste in Japan, but your explaination makes a lot of sense.

Well, seeing how Evangelion's Rebuild is still going on I would say yes. 
>> ARTICLE
It's the power of Nico-Nico-Niii!
>> ARTICLE
How does Queen's Blade even make it on to the list!?!?
>> ARTICLE
Why is this happening? The first season didn't do nearly that well.

Also, what's the show about?
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching the show this week, so someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I know:

Uta no Prince-Sama (Shortened to Utapri) is the best selling Otome franchise currently on the market with a total of 7 games (2-3 of them being rhythm games, the others are dating sims), Drama CDs, music CDs, manga, and other merch. 

It's about Haruka Nanami, a girl who's dream is to compose music for her favorite idol. In the games, you play as Nanami and eventually start a romance with one of the boys. There are six main male characters, all of which have their own unique styles and personalities, and a seventh is introduced officially in Season 2. Later games, you can also branch out to their rival group for more dating possibilities.

Being a female anime fan, it's refreshing to see an otome game get it's own series and with all of the harem animes around, (which sure, I still love those too) it's a nice change of pace. I think the series can be summed up as female fanservice. The characters are relatively well developed, but it's entirely a girl's fantasy anime. 

I could be mistaken, but I believe the sales are incredibly high because they included concert tickets? It's something I saw said in another thread, so I don't know first-hand. I do know the franchise is very popular in Japan, and has somewhat of a cult following of girls and women. It wouldn't surprise me if they wanted to complete their collections of CDs, manga, and games with the anime series.

All in all, it's fun to watch and some of the music is really good. Having no previous knowledge of the franchise; Season 2 is a lot better than Season 1. 


>> ARTICLE
it's selling so well because the first volume has a lottery ticket you need to try and get tickets to the live event at saitama super arena

expect the second volume to sell less than half this figure

I really love the last two episodes. The whole party was pretty great (as was seeing Ai again). Plus, you we got Athena acting silly. Then, we have a great Alicia-centric episode.

I've noticed that in each of the seasons, the second to last episode works a bit better as a season finale than the actual finale.

Arietta is next, not The Origination.

Oh crap you're right. I prepared this post thinking we were watching Arietta along with it and forgot to edit that sentence.

I think /u/DHKany is posting the OVA thread tomorrow (07 Sept) and the Origination on Friday (11 Sept).

Overall the Natural is a whole lot better than the Animation. This season we got a lot of development for Aika and a bit for Alice, but I still need *dekkai* more of her. And of course we got more of Akari, because she's awesome. Here is hoping that the Origination is even better.

I would compare Aria the Animation - Aria the Natural to K-On! - K-On!! Both seasons are great, with the second one being a bit better due to more episodes and character development.

Shouldn't Alice be a Single by now? She's been a Pair this whole time (and went to the Pair party earlier in the season), so I'd think she should have at least caught up to Akira and Aika (by becoming a Single).

man i get so sad when i finish a good series i cant imagine finishing more than one within a given week

finishing aria just devastated me. i love slice of life but to this day it still feels like there will never be another slice of life show that lives up to aria. i love moe too and so on but the characters in aria were so adorable without using too much of the moe tropes as the selling factor. a great story about life, friendship and change while maintaining a semblance of uniqueness that i just can't find elsewhere... =/

almost done with korean zombie desk car and i like the parody/comedy aspect of it and while i like the characters, i dont feel connected enough to them to get any feels for the serious drama they try to throw in here and there. regardless of whether it's a parody of other shows that do that it just kind of makes me go mehh. still gon watch the second season though and what few eps i have left go gives me just enough time until a subgroup besides hadena subs the new ep.

Ever tried Cardcaptor Sakura? :) (Manga and anime are both pretty good, but do NOT watch the 4kids dub: "Cardcaptors".)
>> ARTICLE
The genre is "iyashikei," meaning "healing."

It's the type of anime that won't make you go all *hnng*, but an anime that will sort of heal all your wounds, and lower your psycho-pass.

It's like watching diary entries or something. There are some fun parts, some sad parts, and you find out something new every day^(or episode).
