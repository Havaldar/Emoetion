THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST EPISODE OF HAIKYUU THAT END SEQUENCE HOLY SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
>> ARTICLE
This fucking Oikawa set up at the end was the highlight for me.

I get it he's an antagonist (kinda) but he's so fucking cool.
>> ARTICLE
It was unbelievable! Every spike felt like it would land. Every one. DAMN.
>> ARTICLE
Yoo I seriously think that end sequence shaved like 10 years off my life span my heart was beating so freaking fast
>> ARTICLE
Was holding my breath through that whole scene, it was sooooo exciting!
>> ARTICLE
My heart can't take this show...
>> ARTICLE
My heart was literally pounding out of my chest watching that. I can't even remember the last time it's done that for a show or movie.
>> ARTICLE
I had such high expectations for whatever the final sequence would be. I was like, I have no idea what it would be, but there is no way my expectations could be met. But they were absolutely obliterated. It was perhaps the single greatest bit of pacing I've ever seen in a scene. It lasted *the* perfect amount of time, which each element inside the sequence lasting a perfect amount of time. The extreme slow motion of the block reflected in Hinata's eye made me stop breathing.
>> ARTICLE
I don't tend to yell or get outwardly excited to shows like this, but fuck, everything in this episode was just dripping with hype and cool.

Really hope the next season can deliver this level of entertainment more often.
>> ARTICLE
Trust me, next season will be 10x more entertaining. The final match against [Kinda spoilery](/s "Shiratorizawa") will be AMAZING.
>> ARTICLE
How is the manga? I feel that for the sports genre, most manga wouldn't be able to match with animation. I kinda want to read it.
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga before the anime, and its absolutely amazing. You'd think hype levels wouldn't be as pronounced in freaking drawings, but I cried the same way after reading this episode's chapters as I am now.
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck, 10x more entertaining? If what you speak is true, my heart won't be able to keep up
>> ARTICLE
Shiratorizawa is next and believe me... it's going to be hype as fuck, I'm already giddy just thinking about it animated
>> ARTICLE
Dude, Shiratorizawa....

Just thinking about it makes my heart rate go up. My God its going to amazing
>> ARTICLE
Damn, you guys are making it really hard to wait for Fall. I can barely contain myself from reading ahead in the manga as is.
>> ARTICLE
and this entire episode really just showcased everything the entire team had been been working towards during the first 12 episodes. (except for Kageyama's sass, that was always there). THAT PAYOFF THOUGH
>> ARTICLE
*YES*

I loved that. I love the mirror moment of Kageyama and Hinata setting up that play, but the new quick is what allowed them to win. 

...I think one of my contacts shifted.
>> ARTICLE
RIGHT! That last rally was absolutely mind blowing especially with the addition of the Hinata spike from the OP. Knew it was coming but soooo damn epic
>> ARTICLE
[This is me this entire episode](http://i.imgur.com/nn2sglV.jpg).

HOLY FUCK. I mean, HOLY FUCK! It's like every time you think "There's no way it's gonna get better than this" [the show proves you wrong](http://i.imgur.com/UhX9x1v.jpg). The final sequence was just out of this world, with that new piece of OST, incredible animation, [and everyone having a piece of action](http://i.imgur.com/rugXvCH.jpg). I have no words to describe the sheer AWESOMENESS of this episode. It's something else...

* [Oikawa is fucking incredible](http://i.imgur.com/WLLwWee.png)

* [Incredible animation detail right here](http://i.imgur.com/a4ACdvJ.jpg) as Oikawa tries to get up as fast as possible and slips up

that part where Oikawa slipped was such amazing animation I was like :OOOOOOO

I was not that quiet...

> show proves you wrong

You know if he didn't have Yui already that picture on the left would lead to me shipping...

>  and everyone having a piece of action

Tsukki didn't do too much but it's fine, everything is fine :p

Yeah this episode was so hypeI forgot to even mention how amazing the animation was, gosh this is just too good!!

on the other hand... I noticed Tsukki low key celebrating a shot [for the very first time] (http://i.imgur.com/FC1McA4.jpg)

Holy SHIT I completely missed that!  Nice catch. 
>> ARTICLE
Would have been nice to see his face!
>> ARTICLE
It's probably something like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/Xg3A3zM.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, Oikawa was both so human and superhuman in this match. He is a great player and it shows but him trying so much and those scenes where he falls to receive the ball and then slips when he wants to run back, or when he is down while Kageyama is looking down to him...gaah he's great, they are all great!
>> ARTICLE
I love that Haikyuu completely dispels with the old trope of the main characters winning because they want it more. Every opponent fights tooth and nail to win and when they lose you can see how much it meant to them as well. Oikawa was clearly desperate to win and to make sure he did every thing possible for his team.
>> ARTICLE
I feel that is one thing that sports anime has always been great at though. A lot of sports anime even dating back as far back as the 70s, made you feel really conflicted because the opponents felt like they had ever much as the desire and the right to win. Even more complex if former teammates join the opponents. That may be a bit of a sports anime clich in itself, but a very effective one.
>> ARTICLE
I might as well stop watching anime now.  It's going to be hard to ever be more invested and hyped than this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, Icing is needed, wait for the last episode to cool down your damaged cells from watching this exciting game!

on god that manga panel of Oikawa "is he a monster of what?" is one of my favorite in the entire series. The anime has done most things justice but thats one i wish lived up to the manga version

edit: wow these gifs are terrific. You're amazing, thanks for doing this every episode!
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding me...that episode was **fantastic**!!

They finally beat them!! Not only that everyone was so hypuu this match. Yamaguchi being great, Suga coming in and being awesome, Daichi getting that big serve...seriously this episode was just amazing. 

Easily the best episode of the series for me, I was pretty audible when Kageyama hit that dump, that was just perfect, so happy right now!

Got chills when they flashed all the ace spikers before Daichi made the receive on Oikawa's second serve. Such a fantastic way of showing how experience can make or break a play. 

And I feel like a goddamn echo right now, but that last rally was incredibly animated and had me on the edge of my seat. One of the best episodes of ANY show I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a simple sports anime watching girl, and Kageyama's dump from last season was still my favourite moment of the show due to the sheer hype and cheek of the moment. But I was speaking to my brother a few days ago and he was like I cant wait for them to do a surprise dump again and I replied "nah man they wouldnt be able to play it off as well and I'd hate for such an awesome moment to become a cheap shock trick." BUT HOLY SMOKES WAS I WRONG. MOVE OVER MEDIOCRE IN COMPARISON DUMP OF SEASON ONE. WE HAVE A NEW WINNER FOR MOST HYPE MOMENT OF THE SERIES FULL STOP.

This is the first time I've wished for a sports anime to go on for so long that we see them playing volleyball in college and as pros.
>> ARTICLE
> This is the first time I've wished for a sports anime to go on for so long that we see them playing volleyball in college and as pros.

Gah now I really want this too...
>> ARTICLE
My god the look on everyone's face after that dump. And Oikawa was so pissed at him. The whole thing had me jumping around like a child.
>> ARTICLE
speaking of faces, how many face receives did we even see this episode? Everyone on both teams was so desperate to keep the ball up!
>> ARTICLE
I really thought Oikawa was going to get it, such an intense scene!
>> ARTICLE
They spent so much time over the past two seasons explaining that Oikawa wasn't a genius like Kageyama, but he damn sure looked like one in this match. His near-impossible to hit serves, the super long set to Iwaizumi, his recovery after crashing HARD into that table - I was never really a fan of him, but my god this episode made me a believer.

EDIT: Oh, and the fact that he would have gotten Hinata's spike if Kindaichi's hand didn't put it off course. 
>> ARTICLE
When they call Kageyama a genius, I think it refers more to his raw talent. Oikawa kind of monologues about this through this week's episode. He runs on instinct, reflexes and feeling. Sometimes playing based on his senses and with less thought leaves his team mates in the dust resulting in things like the King's Toss. Volleyball comes naturally to him and his potential is enormous.

For Owikawa, his volley ball was forged over time. He doesn't have Kageyama's innate talent. He trained hard and though his natural ability isn't as high, he makes up for it with every other tool at his disposal. He considers his team, uses his team, and does whatever he can to make up the difference. Even that killer serve didn't appear over night. He's been honing that monster for years along with developing strategies and schemes. Kageyama and Hinata on the other hand pick up new techniques far more quickly.

Oikawa is a strong rival, but he doesn't quite have the natural talent that would make him a genius and he's very aware of it. His fixation with defeating Ushijima and Kageyama are a testament to those feelings.

Edit: Putting it another way, Oikawa thinks, Kageyama feels.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny because from Tobio's perspective, we felt like Oikawa is a genius. Remember the episode when Tobio went ahead to scout him, and how he felt overwhelmed because Oikawa has the ability to be thrown into a pack of complete strangers and within minutes he can work with them in great coordination? And how Tobio repeatedly felt overwhelmed by Oikawa's abilities?

It's like they're telling us the difference of who's genius ultimately boils down to the results.
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa may not be the best passer, but his serve and general play and command of his teammates is still top notch. He'd be pretty much unbeatable if he had Kageyama's passing ability.
>> ARTICLE
That's what's so great about Haikyuu, part of me really wanted him to get it. By the end of every match I'm rooting for the opposition and every point has me conflicted.
>> ARTICLE
Daijoubu Yamaguchi ;__;

Tsukishima being nonchalant about Hinata's block was hilarious.

And never forget *YOU LITTLE BRATSSSSSSS*

That last sequence was the SEQUENCE TO END ALL SEQUENCES. **Best sports anime ever.** I would love to see a "What's in a Scene?" analysis done for it because there were so many details that stood out. The way the "camera" would frame around five frozen players for suspense before focusing fully on the sixth player (Who you probably forgot about) saving the day, the usage of slow motion, the way the court is covered 360 degrees simply by the perspective "traveling" with the ball, the way the music resonates with every action...just SO perfect!

P.S. The *tiny* background detail of Yachi embracing Tanaka onee-san during the victory cheer was so great! I'm surprised that the coaches and manager could just sit on the bench calmly though, as seen in the background during the Kageyama-Oikawa staring contest.

P.S. 2 As a long-time volleyball fan I recommend checking out [this real-life long rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSsZcqrZ0i4), considering the finale of this episode. Besides the insane teamwork and endurance, it also helps you remember how HUGE the court actually can be for six people to cover, although for high school-level the dimensions might be smaller.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu really is far ahead of all the other sport anime, but I'm still not sure if I like Ping Pong the Animation a little bit more. The art style was so refreshing and it had a lot of moments that gave me goosebumps like Haikyuu did.

Both are so well done, even people who don't do sports or have never seen a sport anime so far will enjoy this A TON.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing keeping me away from ping pong is the animation/art style tbh.
>> ARTICLE
It starts to grow on you by the 2nd or 3rd ep.
>> ARTICLE
This is why I have been singing the praise of Volleyball as an amazing spectator sport. The kinds of intense rallies we see in this show, almost every pro Volleyball game has at least one of these. Some truly great matches even are filled with these rallies.

I really wish someday, pro volleyball takes off in places like America. It's already sizable in Asia and parts of Europe, but it seems people only get exposed to it during Olympics.
>> ARTICLE
What in the fuck was that rally

That was superb

Just watching it was exhausting. Wow

Tsukishima was perfect in that moment. "Well, yeah. He's a middle blocker. He's supposed to be able to block." Priceless.

You'd think that straight face attitude would get old by now but nope still great <3

I cracked up so hard that I rewound and watched it again...such perfectly-delivered deadpan by Uchiyama Kouki there. Also reminded me of how little we actually see Hinata blocking despite having the title, lol.

I love the quotes.

"Today might be the day to grasp the chance to let your talent bloom. Maybe tomorrow, the day after, the next year... Maybe even when you're thirty. I'm not sure if physique has anything to do with it, but if you think it'll never come, it probably never will."

"Talent is something you make bloom. Instinct is something you polish."

No win of Karasuno's felt this good! Ahhhh I'm still shaking!

It'd just kill me if this is the last Karasuno vs current Aoba Jousai. I don't care if it's a practice match, just let me see it again!
>> ARTICLE
That moment for Oikawa was really nice.

The animation of that scene was mindblowing. I'm slightly sad they cut an important line from Aoba Johsai's Coach. After he saw that pass he says that he actually underestimated just how much of a beast Oikawa is. 
>> ARTICLE
the best episode i have ever seen in any anime to be honest. Before watching i was sleepy but after just watching first minutes of the episode i got so hyped like i drank tons of redbulls or something. Oikawa running for a chance ball and pointing at his teammate that hes going to serve him was just incredible. God damn this anime just keeps on delivering

I've had a cold for the past few days and this episode TOTALLY made me forget about it. I was running around my apartment hype as fuck after that last point!

*Yes it is*.

#GET HYPE
>> ARTICLE
Call me crazy, but that was the best episode of any anime I've seen in almost a year. Honestly, when you think about where Hinata was at the start of his volleyball journey, it's absolutely unbelievable how far he's come not just in terms of skill/ability, but as a player and everything around him. 

Deep down, I was 99% Karasuno would win this just because it'd be unheard of the main team to lose twice to the same team, especially as this was the 3rd years last tournament, but there were countless moments where I thought they'd actually lose. I'm a guy who's fairly into real life sports, but I don't think I've gotten this hyped and screamed at my television this loudly in any other game I've ever watched.

The music was perfect, the animation was glorious, the transitions from one play to the next was flawless and overall, this episode just solidified this season as a 10/10 for me. Can't wait for next week and season three...I'm still shaking a bit from the ending to this episode. Well done Prod IG, this was truly fantastic.

I absolutely cannot wait to see what they pull for the Shiratorizawa game in season 3.

>> ARTICLE
That dump also reminded me of how tall Kageyama really is, as it's hard to trick your opponents into thinking it's actually another set if you need a huge jump to tap the ball over the net.
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama's official height is 5'11 (I was shocked when I read that since I thought he looked like a 5'8-5'9)

Tsukishima's official height - 6'2 (I know he's the tallest but not that tall 0.0 I can't stop seeing him as someone who is 5'11 until the Tokyo training camp where I finally accepted that he is really that damn tall)

Hinata's offcial height- 5'4 ( I thought he'd be taller than that but it makes sense. At least he's taller than me XD)
>> ARTICLE
I like how it was all thanks to Suga's forehead that that block didn't go in, holy shit

Also, what's the intense game soundtrack? Plays immediately after the opening, couldn't find its name

I like when Oikawa was scrambling to get up from that falling-down-cross-court set he did in that final volley, he stumbled a bit in his haste to get back on the court.  It's little details like those that helps make this show incredible.  Also the fact that he totally made a Gurren Lagann face after Tanaka made that save.
>> ARTICLE
yea... Oikawa may be a really talented player with almost inhuman god-like serve...but in the end he's just a guy scrambling like any other to win
>> ARTICLE
That last point was breathtaking
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if anyone gets this reaction, but for the last 3 episodes solidly, at least half of the episode I have spent crying from uncontrollable happiness for characters.  Every time a player on either team made a big play my whole body gets shivers and my face starts leaking, heck even the moment when the opposing blonde who yelled at Mad-Dog-Chan earlier looks at Mad-Dog and just says 'We are counting on you' and then Mad-Dog just shifts his body slightly to denote that he is giving even more of himself to the game, even that slight interaction and redeeming of mad-dog-chan made my face leak.  god I love haikyuu.

I feel you. It's an uncontrollable train of smiles and small tear-ups. Add that their small moments that you can identify parts of your life in them.
>> ARTICLE
This is such a great way of putting it. It's easy to say, from the outside, "It's just highschool volleyball! How can it make you so emotional?" What people who bash on or don't watch this show don't realize is that the importance of the sport to the characters is what makes it emotional. We see their struggles, how much they put into this to get stronger, how they support and help their friends, how they break down when they lose, *everything*. And we all have our own 'volleyball' in our lives that make us do those things, that we're passionate about.
>> ARTICLE
That may just be one of the best episodes of any form of media I have seen, it did what it set out to do perfectly, even knowing who would win (I read a spoiler by accident) the tension was brilliant, the hype built perfectly into that final rally where I literally got out of bed to sit on the edge of my seat, everything about it was masterful. 

Anyway I know we have another episode but I think I'll be manga ahoy any day now, I need my fix. 

Also [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/UhX9x1v.jpg) basically shows every single one of my reactions from this episode... well done Hypuu, well done.

EDIT: Dammit why does my Volleyball club have to be on Thursdays, really want to play volleyball now, so hyped.

I was holding my breath [during that whole last scene](http://i.imgur.com/SM0pGrL.jpg) wondering what would happen. [It was amazing!](http://i.imgur.com/7T6KllV.jpg)

Yamaguchi might have not made a lot of points this time but his serves are so absurd, they are great! I really really liked [his reaction](http://i.imgur.com/Racbkpe.jpg) to the coach, it was so great seeing him so relieved. Even [Oikawa was amazed at him](http://i.imgur.com/m1uHLYv.jpg).

I really liked his story and thoughts throughout the episode, especially when [this happened](http://i.imgur.com/wiSYwtW.jpg) and it was like everything got reversed.

[Some great reactions](http://i.imgur.com/YVso0wr.jpg) this episode and they were all justified. This was a great episode, especially so close to the end of the season. Also, lol at [Kageyama's "my sides" pose](http://i.imgur.com/XSCwkLg.jpg).

[I'm really glad this is getting another season](http://i.imgur.com/4GPdInq.jpg) and I don't have to be too sad there's only one episode left in this one.

Infinity/10

That was probably one of the best episodes of anime of all time. Probably.

It's terms of narrative, you knew Karasuno had to win. The director, author, and writers know this too. So the only way to get you to buy into the tension and the stakes is to to pull you into the moment-to-moment and make you forget all that. 

Given my current heart rate and the soreness in my jaw, I think they've succeeded. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they went in a totally different way than other animes and it worked out soo well.

Somehow they made us feel for Oikawa and by the end of it you have these mixed emotions. You're happy Karasuno won but at the same time Aoba Johsai worked just as hard and deserve to win just as much and you just don't know whether you should be happy or sad. Ah Oikawa :( 

Uggh why does this anime do this to mee!!

THAT... WAS SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE MOST HYPE AND BEST EPISODES OF ANIME I HAVE EVER SEEN HOLY HELL.

Everything they did that ep was perfect, from animation, to soundtrack to anime-original scenes (Oikawa looking up at Kageyama wasn't there in the manga if I remember correctly).  
That last ball, holy mother of god.  
  
That moment when Hinata blocked the trap spike and soundtrack kicked in. Holy shit.  
Daichi, Tanaka and Suga's forehead are the MVPs of that fucking game.

Best episode i have seen in years. I screamed at so many moments, holy fuck.
>> ARTICLE
WHAT THE FUCK 20 MNS GONE BY ALREADY? BUT IT JUST STARTED
>> ARTICLE
HOLY FUCK. THAT'S ALL. Those fucking rallies that makes you stop breathing. It's fucking amazing how this anime can bring nervousness from spectators when they watch long rallies in a match. This is a fucking A game! Holy shit!!!


I love how they find way to use Sugawara in crucial moment. He's not really pinch server, but for me he's the pinch player. He always gets some sleeves in his hand. That setter's dump from Kageyama was just s satisfying.


Also god dammit, Oikawa is just so fucking OP. He reminds me so much of Hisoka from HxH. Remember when HxH had that dodgeball tournament, damn! 
>> ARTICLE
Bless this fucking show. Putting the rest of this winter season on it's back.

This whole Haikyuu season was glorious. The development, struggle, redemption, emotion.

Perfection.
>> ARTICLE
Whole episode was freaking fantastic but [when Hinata squeezed his hand into a fist after that hit at the end...](http://imgur.com/8S3WyU4) Holy crap I got goosebumps, it was so satisfying to see him so powerful.
>> ARTICLE
I can't even be happy though, after building up Seijoh so well I'm just sad that they lost
>> ARTICLE
Welp... This episode probably cemented Haikyuu as my favourite sports anime that I've seen so far (which means not a whole lot actually, but hey). Everything is so damn good with this it's just unfair. 

I can't find words to describe how good this shit is. Rarely have I felt as hyped and stressed for the characters as I am with Haikyuu, although you should know they're gonna win because they're the main team we're following! 

There's so much tension and it keeps you on the edge every goddamn time. It's so good. 

That episode was intense as all hell, and I absolutely loved that. 

Hot damn... That shit was good and I'll be sad when Season 3 ends... 
>> ARTICLE
Well boys and girls, this season of Haikyuu might be the first sports anime that gets a well deserved 10/10 for me. Few episodes of any genre have had me as enthralled as this one, and it wasn't the first to get my adrenaline pumping in Haikyuu.  

Cross Game came the closest so far, but Haikyuu just does so much right! The suspense, the lead-up, the hype, the delivery, and certainly the finish in each episode. On top of all that, there are no super powers, or absolutely ridiculous moves (Meteor shot, or spinning tornado attacks). We saw the blood, sweat, and tears that Karasuno poured into everything that they show.  

And to top that off, the show doesn't stop there. Character development, team development and growth, opponents that you just can't hate because they get development and growth, too. Spice all that up with fantastic animation and voice acting, and it's hard to find fault with this season.  

Finally, the finish has been strong. Each of the last few episodes has been ratcheting up the intensity and hype. The music seems to fit so well with the pace of the show, and it's hard to recall anytime I've ever been so rooted in place for 22 minutes at a time. Superb.

Never have I gotten so many chills from an anime

AND THAT'S WHY HAIKYUU IS THE BEST!!! Just amazing, the OST is perfect (Never tired of saying that) and really well adaptated.

This episode covered from chapter 143 up to chapter 147

That last point was like a cardio workout with how much it got me jumping up and down! That was an AMAZING Hypuu!! episode

WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT. That was utterly amazing, my heart was pounding throughout that last set.

So glad I picked this up after kuroko no basuke.     
Sports anime is a genre you never thought you would enjoy.    
But with stuff like this, how you couldn't enjoy it idk.     
Oikawa is still "King" in my heart.

THEY FUCKING WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I was sweating so bad through that whole episode, such an amazing show

I actually am on the verge of tears. That was easily one of my favorite episodes of this entire show.

Hey guys, JTricks here with another episode breakdown/commentary, this time of Haikyuu!!
We're right in the middle of the 3rd set between Karasuno and Aoba Johsai and things are definitely heating up. It's been an incredibly fun match, let's see how it ends!

Karasuno FLY!

**Haikyuu!! Season 2 Episode 24**

0:21 - [Nice Kill!](http://i.imgur.com/2y7RrVw.png) We pick up where we left off, impressive to see just how much Kageyama and Hinata's skills and chemistry have developed throughout the show.

I have a feeling this'll be a KageHina focused episode, it's been a while.

0:53 - [Even when complimenting Kageyama, Oikawa always manages to put in a cheeky jab.](http://i.imgur.com/rW44MkK.png)

1:19 - [But he's OUR idiot](http://i.imgur.com/1SPUQ52.png)

1:35 - [The jokes write themselves](http://i.imgur.com/zj6ty9E.png)

4:27 - [Love the focus on these two, really shows that the Mad Dog has been tamed by Matsukawa-senpai](http://i.imgur.com/6gEa92q.png)

5:11 - [PISSED OIKAWA](http://i.imgur.com/vdI67wk.png)

6:28 - [Sakuga time! The "Back-Breaker" serve haha](http://i.imgur.com/VZJcWW0.png)

6:48 - [He's baaaaack!](http://i.imgur.com/QueMkC4.png)

Crazy to see the crowd acknowledging him now as a threat, when they were criticizing him before, how the tables have turned!

7:13 - [Ahh Tsukishima best bro!](http://i.imgur.com/KUiARaD.png)

8:33 - [Iwaizumi carried that exchange soooo hard!](http://i.imgur.com/OwykcZE.png)

9:51 - [Oikawa's serve was so fast, I couldn't printscreen fast enough](http://i.imgur.com/ez5WyUH.png)

11:16 - [Serious Oikawa vs Serious Daichi!](http://i.imgur.com/1xbo5wf.png)

Daichi comes through with his team on the brink of losing!

12:38 - [HINATA IS READY TO "KILL"](http://i.imgur.com/rFhN8Sc.png)

13:48 - ["He's the middle blocker"](http://i.imgur.com/SqeOMek.png)

These Fate/Stay level quotes are killing me today lol

15:25 - [Payback for the first season!](http://i.imgur.com/2XgEnvJ.png)

I love the reversal here, before it was Oikawa executing a dump, but now it's Oikawa on the floor with Kageyama on top! Beautiful scene.

And Brief Oikawa History was great!

15:52 - [SUPER SERIOUS OIKAWA](http://i.imgur.com/v5rXP19.png)

One of the best sports antagonists for sure, I love his backstory, his personality and he's pretty good at volleyball.

18:08 - [Aoba Johsei has a synchronized chant with a ton of people and these two can't even chant at the same time haha](http://i.imgur.com/3ZurZH0.png)

19:29 [HOLY SHIT!](http://i.imgur.com/JVOHDSU.png)

Oikawa is putting his body on the line!

20:40 - [I'm SOOO HYPED, I'm crying LOOL](http://i.imgur.com/TbQ1jMr.png)

21:28 - [There it is! THEY DID IT!](http://i.imgur.com/KeQj3jN.png)

21:57 - [Crushing Defeat](http://i.imgur.com/YvTvy4z.png) vs [Pure Joy](http://i.imgur.com/mjijhaL.png)

22:14 - [Beautiful Final Shot](http://i.imgur.com/lne1q9v.png)

**END**

WOW! What an episode. That was one of the most hyped episodes I've watched in a while! Haikyuu!! truly turned it up here, as this is most likely the climax of the season. Next episode will probably be a brief Shiratorizawa intro. I'm definitely going to miss Aoba Johsai, such an interesting combination of personalities and talent. On the other hand, everyone on Karasuno definitely stepped up, shoutouts to SUGA-san! 

MOU IKKAI! Season 3 can't come soon enough.

Check out my previous episode breakdown of [DRRR!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4a4asq/spoilers_durararax2_ketsu_episode_10_discussion/d0xbdbd?context=3) and [Haikyuu!! episode 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugeycol1UnE)








>> ARTICLE
I just love being absorbed with this episode so much, buuut

> 22:14 - Beautiful Final Shot

umm... I thought it was great when I was watching it, but now I look at it, it looks a bit... weird. Is it only me? 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe.

You have to take into account the context of this screenshot as well. In season 1, the iconic picture of the match between Karasuno and Aoba Johsei was Oikawa standing tall and Kageyama and Hinata on the ground. This shot symbolizes that Kageyama can finally stand toe-to-toe with Oikawa, which is a huge accomplishment for him. 

Also, looking at a still screenshot is  very different from watching the show  when you're filled with emotion and the soundtrack playing in the background, so you have to account for that as well.
>> ARTICLE
The art style for the reaction of Aoba Johsai after they lose is just perfect. It's like every thing they have has been drained from them.
>> ARTICLE
> and he's pretty good at volleyball

Understatement of the year.
>> ARTICLE
Including manga characters, I honestly think if I had to pick a single best player from Haikyu it would be Oikawa. Aside from his incredible serve, he reads his opponents incredibly well (as seen when he came so close to catching Hinata's hit at the end of the episode), he brings out the absolute best of his teammates (even better than they think they can do, like with Kindaichi), he's incredible at setting and recieving, he's even a good spiker. There's nothing he's *not* very good or amazing at.
>> ARTICLE
That [super long toss](http://imgur.com/R7lackW) was the coolest moment of the episode for me. And his serves are fucking monstrous. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree on that being the coolest moment! Along with Iwaizumi's double incredible recieves in a row...           

Honestly came pretty close to rooting for Aoba Johsai. Only pretty close, though. 
>> ARTICLE
HOLY

FUCK

THIS

EPISODE

HOLY

SHIT

OMFG
>> ARTICLE
My God I don't even know how to describe this episode apart from brilliant.

It had me tensed up but with a smile throughout the entire episode, about as shocked as Aoba Johsai was when Kageyama did that dump, and that final point... absolutely brilliant. I don't know how I'm going to manage to wait for S3 until Fall.... "so close yet so far" never felt so real.

On another note, while I'm completely ecstatic that Karasuno finally won, it's rather sad for Aoba Johsai... Oikawa especially. You could really see how badly he wanted to have a rematch against Shiratorizawa, and it didn't help that the show has fleshed out his character a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
That last rally is the most intense thing this show has ever done. FUCCCKKKKKKKKKK.
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit. Had to rewatch that final sequence. I think my favourite part of this episode was Oikawa scrambling to get up after setting from outside the court. It just embodies the desperation of everybody playing in the game. They all know they can't lie on the ground and wait for the play to finish and have to give it their all until the ball drops. Beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
If anyone needs me I'll be crying in my room
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, what an episode.

>> ARTICLE
I knew this episode was going to be a good one when they opened with my favorite hype track. Mad Dog-chan and Oikawa get the spot light but Iwaizumi is so important to that team. He's the ace, clutch on defense and keeps the team in line. What a way for it to end. Kageyama must have ice in his veins. That dump on match point was savage. The hype levels are unreal.

Words can't describe how excited I am that this series is getting another season!

Edit: Can't forget Sugawara either. What Kageyama lacks in stability and tactics, Suga brings. Those serves weren't very strong but they were accurate and his ability to ground the entire Kurasano line up... This team is so damn magic, I really hope we get to see Kenma and Hinata's wish come true and get a Battle at the Garbage Dump in the spring tournament.

Edit 2: damnit, I'm not even at the end of the episode yet...

Edit 3: Oikawa's tenacity. Iwaizumi isn't the only wing spiker that can make big defensive plays! SUGA'S FACE! OIKAWA'S READS! HINATA'S WIPE!!! WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!?!
>> ARTICLE
> Can't forget Sugawara either

Of course we can't! He is calm, thinks things through and has great tactics. Also, he might have thought it was lame to receive that ball with his head in the end but he saved it! :D
>> ARTICLE
This episode started kinda weak, to be honest. Lots of repeated stuff from episodes before. Almost looked like a clip show.

I'll preface the rest of this by saying I'm a huge sports fan. I've run down snowy streets shouting (with no few others for company) over championships. Hell, I run a very well-trafficked blog semi-professionally. I'm serious about this stuff, however silly it might be.

By the end of this episode, I was about as pumped for Karasuno's victory as I would be for a real-life championship. From 19-20 on...holy shit that was masterful. Anime has gotten me emotional, angry, euphoric, you name it. Haikyuu, in this episode, got me invested in a fictional sporting event the way I would be in a real one, and frankly I'm stunned. I don't give out 10s easily. This was a 10.

Eh, 10.5.

One other thing: the structure of this season was perfect. Typically in a situation like this, you can get an idea of what's going to happen. Hell, just a basic understanding of story arcs would tell you Karasuno probably wasn't going to drop this game. Having this matchup be the one that thwarts them at the end of the season again would just be really hard to do well, especially with it spelling the end for the third years.

But...the end of the season started drawing closer and closer. And the match didn't end. How are they gonna get in the last bout against Mr. Japan? They wouldn't just let the season end without it, would they? Then that means...

I legitimately had no clue going into this episode who would win. If the price of that is a long, long wait for the finals, I will pay it every time.

Gonna go watch this entire show over. God damn but it's good.
>> ARTICLE
That cross court serve Oikawa did and then slipping up in the (tablecloth??) Was so hype, he really tried his best this game and I can't help but feel really bad for them losing. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm really glad that both teams had a chance to do their thing and really go all out. Like despite losing, Seijoh had a really truly crazy performance that would have steamrolled most other teams. And although all of their team had moments, we really saw just how good Oikawa is. True nailbiter.
>> ARTICLE
THIS EPISODE HAD ME SCREAMING!!!!!! I'M SO FREAKING [HAPPY](http://24.media.tumblr.com/bbd8bf5a655faa69a2582b30fa3f4e7b/tumblr_mtt3poBmY51svp3buo1_1280.gif) XD
>> ARTICLE
The final rally was just fucking amazing. The buildup throughout the entire episode to that point, was just beautiful. The ost, and the animation, was all on point today. Fucking great.
>> ARTICLE
That shot of seijohs schools huge synchronized cheering, followed immediately by karasunos very tiny and unsynchronized but rowdy cheering squad...oh god that was just adorable 
>> ARTICLE
my throat is sore ... damn... great episode
>> ARTICLE
oikawa's long shoot set from outside the court was the most impressive volleyball play of the match... so good
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I feel bad for Aobai, wanted Oikawa to win so bad. 

It's sad, I feel like they are underdogs that were promised. 
>> ARTICLE
This entire match has been amazing but this episode was on another level. 10/10. I think Haikyuu may have become my new favorite sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
This episode just ruined real life sports for me. I think i'm never gonna see anything so fucking exciting. HOLY FUCK!
>> ARTICLE
This show never stops surprising me, holy fucking shit. Just when i thought that it couldn't get any better. If it gets even better in season 3 (which i suppose it will - shiratorizawa hype), i'm jumping off a bridge out of excitement. I HAVE NO WORDS, JUST AMAZING!
>> ARTICLE
Damn, lived up the build up like crazy. Holy fuck
>> ARTICLE
Fuck those last 5 minutes made me damn near have a heart attack. Intense as fuck. Well done Karasuno. Season 3 is gonna be hype.
>> ARTICLE
What a fantastic episode. I'm shaking. So fucking good. That ending wow.

I WAS SO HYPED I BROKE ONE OF MY BRACES FOR BITING SO HARD

I am way too emotionally invested into anime volleyball.

I revoke every rude comment about sports anime I ever uttered in my previously uneducated life. This show. This show man. How did it get me to feel things about sports. GOOD EP.

Holy shit so much happened and it was just so good i don't even know what to comment on. What a 100% perfect Episode.
>> ARTICLE
This was an AMAZING episode.

it's ok...i'll just lie here...for the rest of the day... trying to calm my heart down after that intense episode...

Ahh what an end to that play and with new season announced things are looking good

THERE CAN ONLY BE SO MUCH HYPE!!!

HOLY SHIT

MOST INTENSE EPISODE OF ANIME I'VE WATCHED
>> ARTICLE
My body is ready for season 3

By far one of the greatest episodes of anime that I've ever watched. The intensity of the entire episode was insane. I look forward to the final episode next week and the coming third season.

This takes the cake, I've never been so hyped for an episode of anime before, fucking 10/10 no doubts about it. Haikyuu is goddamn amazing!

I feel sorry for Seij's Libero, he did not have a good match.

The hype was insane from the start of the episode, but holy shit did they get to the next level after the commercial break.

SHUT IT DOWN SHUT IT DOWN LET'S GO HOME

That last serve by Kageyama was 100% the same serve from last time, aka when they lost. But this time, HINATA GOT HIS EYES OPEN YOH! NO ONE CAN STOP HIM padjoiwadhakjdwjaifkawdapodwj

I still have goosebumps from that last rally

That was some amazing writing, you never knew what was going to happen at the end. I feel like it's hard to keep sports genre anime unpredictable. That was seriously a huge assclench the last play.

BEST
MATCH
IN
SERIES
I HOPE THAT FIRST MATCH IN 3RD SEASON WILL BE ALSO AS GOOD AS IT.
Okay, now I should stop caps.
Animation was great - I won't be surprised if last episode will have shitty animation. I suppose that next episode will show match of Shiratorizawa(please don't confirm if it's true). 
I think I'll have to consider if this season deserves for 10. 
>> ARTICLE
That last sequence might have been one of the most well animated and intense scenes I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn sports animes give me such an intense feeling... 
>> ARTICLE
bless the director of this show

so fucking hyped throughout this episode like damn
>> ARTICLE
So glad I decided to randomly pick this show up. Just saw it with such high ratings on MAL and gave it a shot even though I don't watch sports anime (sans Ping Pong) and don't particularly like volleyball. One of my favorite series! That ending was so satisfying but you know it was a hard fought journey for Karasuno.
>> ARTICLE
When you think this show can't get even more hyped, stuff like that happens! I find myself cheering out loud for both teams and it's exhilarating~  
I'm already going in withdrawal waiting for the next episode.....   

FASTEST FIVE MINUTES OF MY LIFE!!! OMG THAT WAS SOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!! 
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap, I don't recall there ever being this much traffic on any of the weekly Haikyuu threads, this episode was too OP.

THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS OF ALL TIME

HOLY FUCK THAT EPISODE WAS AMAZING!

My heart...

That well animated last hit! The atmosphere was so intense, so epic!!!!! And so many characters on BOTH TEAMS shined this episodes it was AMAZING! TRULY BRILLIANT!

Only one more episode this season... :(
I CANT WAIT FOR FALL WHEN THE 3rd SEASON WILL START! :D
>> ARTICLE
I hereby declare this "Anime-azing." So much hype. So much awesome. Words fail me.

As much as I've loved riding the hype train every week, I'm really looking forward to slamming the whole show as quickly as possible after the second season ends.

mY HEART IS GONNA BURST OUT OF MY CHEST. THE HYPE. 
>> ARTICLE
I fucking love how the match ended with Hinata and Kageyama's UPGRADED QUICK, considering how they lost against Seijoh last time around with the old quick. Production I.G. also used the exactly same frames as they did for the final quick against Seijoh in the Inter High tournament. Really really looking forward to the next episode since it'll seemingly shower us some moments with Oikawa + Ushijima + Hinata/Kageyama.

FeelsGoodMan
>> ARTICLE
We all knew how it was going to be. But the sheer brilliance of the moments which led to the result was absolutely fabulous to watch.
>> ARTICLE
 I held my breathe for the entirety of the last few minutes. Fuck.
>> ARTICLE
My heart was pounding quite a bit during that last point too. I think I held my breath during that last point too. It's amazing how much tension and anticipation there was in this episode. I had so many chills with both teams scoring points back and forth. 

Seriously the best episode of Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
Is this a good time to start watching this show?
>> ARTICLE
yes, yes and also yes. 

Season 2 is just about to finish and if you start now you'll probably catch up in time for the finale episode... unless your watch at a normal pace unlike I did but still 2 seasons worth of content with season 3 arriving later in the year.
>> ARTICLE
*scrolls up to see 200+ comments about not being able to breathe,  heart attacks, and sore throats*


yep, just do it.
>> ARTICLE
I've been on the fence for the last few weeks regarding whether Kuroko no Basket or Haikyuu!! was better. That was pretty fucking decisive
>> ARTICLE
I know I'm probably over reacting since I just watched the episode, but that might be one of the best episodes of any show I have ever watched. I knew what the result of the match but I was still tearing up and my heart was racing. The animation was beautiful and the OST was perfect. Haikyuu is up there with my favorite animes, not just sports animes.
>> ARTICLE
That last scene was FUCKING AMAZING!!
>> ARTICLE
There was a lot to like this episode, but I think the music really knocked it out of the park.
>> ARTICLE
Wow that was pretty neat.
>> ARTICLE
The last minutes.. 
Holy shit.. I couldn't even look.. I was holding my breath.. It was so intense..  

It's impossible to describe it..  like i was there..It was the best  and most exiting episode in Sports Anime History!  

>> ARTICLE
What is the song that plays at the start around the time Tsuki serves?

>> ARTICLE
So...are they saying Oikawa is just an extremely polished player with a setter's disposition (not a genius) yet Tobio is a genius even though he's only blossomed with Shoyo?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, in a nutshell Kageyama is physically capable of things that others aren't, that's what makes him a genius. For example, setting the ball for cross-court/straights when we're talking about quicks (remember Tsukishima's complaint about this in Season 1), that falling toss, synchronising the toss to Hinata's swing when he had his eyes shut, etc. Just think of it as Kageyama being able to make the ball do whatever he wants it to.

In contrast, Oikawa is not like that. That's what he used to be resentful of, and his mindset seems to be changing ("Talent is something you make bloom. Instinct is something you polish."), plus we do get that ridiculous long set to Iwaizumi this episode that is probably a milestone in the blossoming of his talent. However, no matter how you see it, he's nowhere near Kageyama in ball control.

But. As is obvious, there are many other factors that play into what makes either of them a better player, like intellect, game sense, etc. And I think it's pretty clear that as a player, Oikawa is not worse off by any means. He's probably the MVP of the entire show, tbh. So even though Kageyama is a genius and he is not, that's how they are for now. Hope this helps!
>> ARTICLE
I did a double take when i saw ryu go for the save, did not expect that to happen at all!
>> ARTICLE
This was such a great episode! I'm so happy that Karasuno won :D 
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit this episode. Haikyuu always gets me so hyped, but this was through the roof starting with Tsukki. I mean I usually get engaged, but this episode had me yelling at my screen, fist pumping, 10,000% engaged over here. Animation was so on point that last set, absolutely perfect.
>> ARTICLE
This show is just unbelievable. the artwork is always great and consistent. whereas some shows the artwork gets crappy for awhile only to get good for important moments. the last point was put together so amazing well. the music, the tenseness for the few times you thought it was over and even the camera angles for when things happened. the small things like when Oikawa did that long set and fell then as he was getting up slipped to get back on the court or when Kageyama was setting up for Hinata's last spike and you see his body shift or the spinning of the ball. I have so much respect for the people who directed and helped make this series. if only they could help with Hajime No Ippo.  JUST LOVE IT SO MUCH. 
>> ARTICLE
Heart was beating the whole time. That final rally was insane.  
For some reason the detail of him slipping on the floor mat was great. And the "Chance ball!" "Like hell!" Was SO HYPE. HOLY SHIT THAT EPISODE WAS INSANE. AOTS.

I WANT TO SCREAM BUT I'M GONNA GET KICKED OUT OF THE APARTMENT HOW AM I EVEN SUPPOSED TO FEEL AFTER SUCH AN AMAZING EPISODE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Thought I would watch my favourite anime before bed... I'm not sleeping for 6 more hours because whAT THE FUCK I'M SO FUCKING HYPED THAT WAS FUCKING AMAZING AND MY HEART IS RACING AND I'M GONNA DIE
>> ARTICLE
HOLY FUCKING SHIT GODDAMN I'M SO HAPPY BUT SO SAD I LOVE HAIKYUU SO MUCH like seriously when I think about it, this show is such a positive influence on my life and I'm so happy it exists. I pity those who haven't watched Haikyuu!!. Their loss.

Not a manga reader, but I knew that Karasuno was going to win the match, because how could they not? And I still cried when Aoba Jousei lost. I'm so so happy for Karasuno, but this show is so good, and I'm so attached to nearly every single character and team, that I can't help but be really really sad when any of them lose. Which happens literally every match? Like, literally every single match one of the team loses (duh) and I end up sad. Haikyuu. Why do u do this to me.
>> ARTICLE
So fucking good. WHAT AN EPISODE.

Hinata's feint, Daichi's receive, Kageyama's dump, Tanaka's save, Asahi's back court hit. FUCKING HYPE. And that's not even including the madness from the Aoba team!! The director absolutely nailed conveying just how much each team and player wanted to win the match, the intensity was unreal.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I've been so conflicted by a win before this match. By the end of the episode, I had gotten so invested in Oikawa's near superhuman dedication to winning and proving himself past the sheer raw talent that Kageyama (and Ushikawa) both have that I was so heartbroken about Aoba Johsai losing despite rooting for Karasuno wholeheartedly most of the match. While I do think he's a jackass, he's by far the one character whose efforts I've respected the most no matter what and just... to see the great king fall? I thought I wanted it, but man did I actually really not want to see it at all.

The cross-court set to Iwaizumi during the final rally had me on the edge of my seat and the rest of that rally on served to drop my jaw to the floor and skyrocket my heart rate with how into it I got. I honestly wasn't sure whether or not my heart would give out or the rally would end first.
>> ARTICLE
Karasuno should bring Oikawa on as a coach or something. I know that makes no sense, but I hope they work him into season 3 somehow.
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling Oikawa is brilliant enough of a player to go full pro soon. 
>> ARTICLE
Dunno about season 3, but he HAS to come back, either competing against Ushijima after high school, or watching Seijo. 
>> ARTICLE
Hooolllyyy shiiiieett!! That was soooo goood! There were so many close calls for that last point!

I really ddnt want this match to end, but that was such a great end sequence

What a damn amazing episode!!! Just as the team continually surprises so does the show. I am shivering right now. I am just blown away. I was actually screaming during that episode. How old am I again? Good grief I just can't contain myself anymore. This show has broken me.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man I cant contain myself. I feel like I need to go running! Best episode of season 2!! Next episode will be the aftermath episode for Seijoh. :( I need to mentally prepare myself for all the feels.

i think im gunna loose my voice after yelling so much, MUCH HYPE!!

Holy shit this was awesome.

This episode man... Am I the only one that's been hit so hard by the win. At some point I was just rooting for Oikawa and when he saw that gap in the block, I got this sudden urge of hope that maybe it's not over yet, maybe they'll end it on a cliffhanger... 
>> ARTICLE
i need help, i just binge watched all of it in two days.

My body can't take so much hype in so little time.

im not kidding, every time i wanted to stop hinata screamed in my brain "MOU IKKAI"

**WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!**

i knew it was coming (as a manga reader) BUT HOLY CRAP THAT WAS SOOOO SATISFYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!

oh man and here i was ready to rave about yamaguchi's serve, and then suddenly kag's drop! BUT THE WIN ALL IN ONE EPISODE?! OH YES! OH FUCKING HELL YES!!

i'm so looking forward to the next episode. we have 26 episodes for this season, right?

I came

This episode was by far the best out of s2 imo, that part with Oikawa in the last rally with the long fast set and the animation with him recovering from it was absolutely AMAZING. 
>> ARTICLE
Did any one else notice all of the similarities with this episode and the last time they played them? The end of the set was very similar especially. 
>> ARTICLE
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS EPISODE WAS SPOT FRICKING ON I WAS HYPED EVERY SINGLE SECOND DAMMIT I LOVE HAIKYUU 

THAT SCENE WHEN OIKAWA WAS ON THE FLOOR.........LOOKING UP AT KAGEYAMA.............................THEN AT THE VERY FRICKING END WHEN HINATA COULD SEE THE CIRCLE AND IT KEPT BLINKING AND OIKAWA COULDN'T GET IT PROPERLY.....................DAMN

Phenomenal episode. LOVE how they used the exact same shots from last season's finale match on that last point to specifically call out that kageyama and hinata together have surpassed oikawa.

This was the best episode so far this whole series, my god. Probably the best episode of the season too. So fucking good.

Even though they lost, this match pretty much cements Oikawa as my favorite character of the show. Can any manga reader tell me if we will see more of him in the future?
>> ARTICLE
talent is something you make bloom. instinct is something you polish
>> ARTICLE
So i wonder how much of the next season the shiratorizawa match is gonna take because it went from chapter 151 to 189 (38) in the manga for just that one match whereas the aoba josai rematch was 129-148 (19) which is 19 less chapters
>> ARTICLE
SHOYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
>> ARTICLE
By the way, my heart just dropped when I saw the manager's reaction to when the captain (sorry can't remember names from the amount of adrenaline coursing through my veins) caught Oikawa's serve. Like as if she doesn't get any cuter than that.
>> ARTICLE
I almost threw my plate of dinner! That's how intense this shit is! So many holy shit moments! Kageyama slaying Oikawa and making him realize who the real king is! Hinata's block, holy shit! This whole episode, just holy shit~!!

And next week, the infamous meme is coming! XD
>> ARTICLE
10/10, what a fantastic episode. I had tears in my eyes throughout the whole thing. 


>> ARTICLE
My heartrate was off the roof, this show is going to kill me one day! Does anyone know the name of the song that was playing during the scene right after the OP? That slow buildup was amazing
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga but watching it animated was an even more amazing experience. I was at the edge of my seat watching! Kageyama's dump is such a reckless play but still ingenious. Nothing you can expect from him. Hinata taking the final point is such a sweet taste considering he was blocked the last time.

I love Aoba Jhousai (love Oikawa and Iwaizaumi) so I am sad to see them be defeated but there can be only one winner. They won the last time and Karusno fought to death to win this. Season 3 HYPE! The long and intense 5 setter match between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa begins!
>> ARTICLE
The amount of emphasis they put on the eyes this episode made this episode really intense imo
>> ARTICLE
Anyone knows what's the OST during 16.34 when Oikawa's coach was talking and then in 18:50?  This episode was simply breathtaking, I had goosebumps throughout. The music was perfect.
>> ARTICLE
how is erased any close to this quality somone tell me please
>> ARTICLE
How many chapters into the manga did the show go?
>> ARTICLE
This was only the semi-finals right?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, finals in season 3
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, that was beautiful. Kageyama's dump and Oikawa's cross-court toss were awesome. And I love how Oikawa scrambled to get back when he fell, kicking chairs away in the process. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised that there are no comments about how that last point ended exactly the way that it ended the previous time they fought against Johsai. 

Hinata up against three blockers. This time though, thanks to the new impossible set, Hinata could *see*. 

It's a beautiful nod to their previous match with Johsai and to everything they learned since then. 

Oh and I'm happy to say I saw this ending coming from months ago. It's just too perfect for the story to not do. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never held my breath so much until this episode.  
God damn this was tense as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
I was kinda expecting points to get past 26 where it's like Season 1, ending past 30. But, during the episode, specifically during the last rally, "nah, too many epic moments for each of the players already, this should be the deciding point."

After last week's epic episode I'm not even prepared to wait another six months for the next stage, even though that's not a long wait at all in anime terms.

"I got goosebumps." *To say the least*

[This moment just gave me all the feels](http://i.imgur.com/R1OsHsz.png)! I was always somewhat disappointed that the Karasuno support crowd was small compared to the other schools, so it's beyond heartwarming to see the whole school recognizing them like this.

TFW the episode is over and you realize again that "tomorrow" is **six months away**:

like seriously, is he ok? I'm concerned. Poor tired baby.

I didn't even think about how long the wait's gonna be. Six months? UGH
>> ARTICLE
That's a lot better than being a Kuroko fan. 2 years (2013 - 2015) between seasons.

Let's not even get started on the chapter pacing for that last match. Like, it was great, but was it going-for-more-than-1-year-level great? Was it 60+-chapters-worth-of-one-match-level great? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm a giant Kuroko fan and waiting week to week for the [](/s "Rakuzan") match in the anime almost killed me. When I actually went back to read the manga version though, it hit me that it was just under a year chapter wise going week to week. How in the world was that? I couldn't even imagine reading Kuroko Weekly since I never just read one chapter at a time
>> ARTICLE
>How in the world was that?

It sucked donkey balls, especially since half of them would end on cliffhangers. I learned my lesson by the time the anime rolled around though, I didn't touch the last 11 or so episodes until everything had finished airing.

now imagine this in an in-universe context, once Oikawa goes home and is alone and it finally hits him that was the last game of his high school career ;)

So the match starts in a couple hours and not in 6 months right... ^^right... ^^^please...

You must undergo wilderness survival training to be able to withstand the level of hype that is sure to come in Season 3 anyway, so you should be *thankful* there is a six month wait.

[I spent all week writing up a long character analysis of Oikawa.](http://minuteart.net/2016/03/26/oikawa-blooms/)

He's probably the most important non-Karasuno character in the show, and more or less the main antagonist of the first two seasons. He provides a foil for Kageyama plus a complement to Sugawara and so many other setters and players. Also I have a pretty serious mancrush on him.

Seeing as how his high school volleyball career ended last episode, and his arc reaches a semi-conclusion/turning point this episode, it's only fitting to look back at what got him to this point. Hope you enjoy!
>> ARTICLE
I don't read the manga, so how does his arc continue? Isn't he donezo?
>> ARTICLE
His arc hasn't actually continued in the manga, but this episode/chapter doesn't really conclude him as a character. The implication is that he will continue to play in college, presumably against teams that feature Ushijima and other geniuses. At this point, Oikawa has lost to geniuses, but has doubled-down on his pride. Whether or not we ever see an official storyline past high school remains to be seen, but even if the mangaka doesn't continue to that point, there's enough development for fans to do so on their own.
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa is easily my favorite non-Karasuno character, so I just wanted to say that your analysis is pretty awesome and thank you for writing it all up  :)
>> ARTICLE
oh man I forgot all about college, Oikawa is sure to get on a good team.

that makes me happy.
>> ARTICLE
> there's enough development for fans to do so on their own.

In all seriousness though, some of the fanfiction written on Oikawa's growth as a university setter is absolutely amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
Example?
>> ARTICLE
Great write-up, I loved the spacing using the pictures between your paragraphs. It made the read much easier than a wall of text, and supported your points.  

I've always thought that the use of the word genius in Haikyuu was slightly misleading. Prodigy would be the word I would use, or perhaps physically talented, but I understand that the meaning of genius is often the same, and it was subtitled this way.  

Of all the characters, I tend to think of Oikawa as the closest to a mental genius. He uses his teammates as the weapons in his arsenal, and outside of his killer serve, it's his decision making that really moves Aobajsai forwards. It's the way he has changed his game into such a calculated, thinking sport, in response to the pressure that he feels from those naturally talented players.  From his strategical attacks, to the carefully thought out words he uses to inspire or motivate his team mates, that make me consider him the closest to a genius in the traditional sense. 

On top of all this, he has a sense for the game, and many of the decisions he makes are in the moment. He comes across as the most cerebral player, although he often disguises it behind his cheerful persona. While Kenma from Nekoma might be more intelligent, at this point he lacks both the desire and the communication skills of Oikawa.  

Sorry for the minor rant, it's just something that comes up when I think about how Oikawa refers to these talented volleyball players as genuises. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I think being able to see the show as you read about it really improves the essay. Perhaps a video is even better, but that's something for the future :P

As for the geniuses thing, I think it might just be a matter of translation. I'm in no position to say for sure, but I think the Japanese word doesn't really hold the same connotations as the English 'genius'. In English, 'genius' has come to refer to intelligence more than anything, although its meaning isn't actually that narrow. When Oikawa says 'genius', I just read it as implying some sort of raw talent or advantage.

I definitely agree with you though.
>> ARTICLE
I could read book after book just on Oikawa's development. Thank God for fanfiction.
>> ARTICLE
>Thank God for fanfiction.

That is not a sentence I am accustomed to seeing.
>> ARTICLE
> I have a pretty serious man crush on him

Don't we all? Nice write-up, by the way.
>> ARTICLE
We're only human, after all :P
>> ARTICLE
Great analysis! Also, the fact that he almost got Hinata's spike is also symbolic, in the same manner as he's feeling that he can touch that level but he cannot definitely surpass it.

But then, would the wall distorting the course of the ball imply Ushijimas claim as true, that he would be better off in another team perhaps?
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa would rather struggle to take a set from Shiratorizawa than team up with Ushijima to win. His ego won't let him take the easy way out.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's what's really interesting about this episode. It's kinda just up for us to decide. Oikawa is definitely more likely to win tournaments playing for Shiratorizawa+whatever college Ushijima attends, but maybe his pride is worth a harder road to success. Oikawa certainly seems to think proving he can overcome geniuses is more important than playing with them.
>> ARTICLE
I would think that to Oikawa that playing for Shiratorizawa would have been like playing for like the Bulls when Jordan was in his hey day and had Pippin and Dennis Rodman. the team is a powerhouse. So winning isn't something that would be too hard, but Oikawa going to another team that he could make better and even play to the level of Shiratorizawa or even beat them would be much more meaningful. Yes it was prideful but the victories meant more knowing that he could actually make a team that amazing and bring them to another level 
>> ARTICLE
And so ends this fantastic season of Haikyuu, I didn't think any sports anime would top season 1 but this season was just fantastic.

This wasn't a hype finale but it was still a great one. I actually teared up twice, [once](http://i.imgur.com/acb6Rc7.png) for [Yui](http://i.imgur.com/LTstJnL.png) and again during Yachi's speech. Seeing the whole school cheer them on was such a nice touch!

If season 3 is even better than this I have no idea how I'll be able to handle it.

Edit: [Bonus](http://i.imgur.com/Yy6VrpN.gifv) [Yui](http://i.imgur.com/FMU9hAP.gifv). Seriously seeing her again put the biggest smile on my face and when she saw Daichi was hurt *hnnnggg* that is what ships are made of :)

I'm still super salty they cut the woman's volleyball storyline. It was kinda "filler" in the manga, but it def added some new cool characters and damnit I want romance in this show. :P

Was great to calm everything down a bit as we wait for the hype match that will come in fall. Damn, can't wait!

That would be fantastic, not sure if my heart could handle it though lol they had like 5 seconds in this episode and it was a lot for me :p

From someone who read the manga 
(don't worry, no spoilers), the Karasuno Girls Volleyball team would be there to cheer the Boys Team against Shiratorizawa at the stadium. More Yui is always great. Daichi x Yui ship has been sailing in the series for me since I remember Daichi asking her permission to use the Girls Volleyball Court and [watching her fidgeting with her hair](http://i.imgur.com/46kMraW.jpg).

I can't imagine it represents anything, its just regular ol' art. The anime team probably thought it looked interesting so they threw it in.

To see Karasuno welcomed back like the triumphant heroes...that had to have meant so much to all of them, but even more for the third-years. Even when asked to stop playing, they kept going. And to see that sight...man, I can't even imagine.

Also, way to make us feel bad again for Karasuno winning, Haikyu! 

10/10 easy.

I'm glad the rest of the school finally realizes how awesome the boys volleyball team is! SEASON 3 KARASUNO SPECTATOR FANBASE HYPE! Maybe they'll get a catchy cheer like Date Tech.

Honestly though where was the other 20 minutes because that felt like it zipped by in 2.

In one of those episodes filled with Tony touching character moments, I've gotta single out Oikawa's 'best you remember my worthless pride' speech as my favorite. My heart goes out to that great big annoying pretty-boy who's an amazing player but always never *quite* good enough.
>> ARTICLE
> I've gotta single out Oikawa's

He's one of the most interesting characters in the show and his speech was great this episode (both what he said and how he behaved, [plus that face...](http://i.imgur.com/VMV9Hnd.jpg)).

For an anime original scene, I was surprised by just how much of an impact it ended up having.  I had both tears in my eyes and a huge grin on my face when I saw that.  ...I just love Haikyuu so much.  It's definitely one of my favorite anime of all time.  The character development and emotions in this anime are just unreal.  I mean, I'm pretty sure I've cried for almost every team that Karasuno has beat at this point.  I'm kind of a mess.  Lol

This was AOTY for me. I'm expecting Handa-kun in summer to come close, but nothing will top this. Everything was perfect. As a manga reader, this was a perfect example of a perfect adaptation. 

I can't wait to see the match against Shiratorizawa animated. Fall 2016 will be amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so, clear this up for me because I've been confused on the whole thing for a while now. For example, when an anime starts in fall 2015, and continues on into the next year's Winter season 2016(in this case) Is it counted as an anime from 2015 or 2016, or both? Because I've been waiting for this moment to make it official, that Haiykuu season 2 IS my AOTY...2015...Or is it 2016...I don't know, but to me it feels kind of cheap to have this as AOTY 2015 AND 2016, because believe me, and I may sound hypocritical for saying this but I doubt there's any future anime coming out this year that can top Haiykuu S2. But there is always the third season coming out in Fall, so I suppose its inevitable. Haikyuu potentially AOTY 3 times in a row?...Wow.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I have not seen or read any Jojo.

I have just caught up to the latest BnHA chapter and I'm pretty excited for the anime, however I can't help but feel uneasy about the adaptation, not about the studio, I think Bones will do great, but pretty much if it will come down to being a 10-13 episode series or a 22-26 episode series. I just can't see this one being a successful adaptation unless it gets atleast 22+ episodes. 

Also, I always say that too about a season, that it's going to be the "greatest" season ever, but by the end I leave with finishing like 5-6 shows and dropping a bunch of them. So, I guess I learnt not to get over hyped for upcoming seasons.
>> ARTICLE
It depends on people and if it's split cour or not. Usually a 2 cour (2 season/24-25 episode) series will be counted from the year it started, in this case 2015. However, some people will still count it for 2016 awards, specially if it's as popular as Haikyuu.

If it's a split cour then they usually account for both years.
>> ARTICLE
I imagine a lot of people feel the same.... this second season is currently top #12 on MAL

Same for me dude, Haikyuu just MEANS more to me then anything else Ive watched this year. Like theres been some really great stuff, but it just doesnt quite hit me like this show does.

I feel you, man. Getting to know the characters and how their development is portrayed really is something else in this show.

Sports anime often excel in these aspects, so it is crazy that Haikyuu still feels special among sports anime.

As someone who took part of the first season rewatch as a first timer, it's been since mid-September that I've been watching new episodes of Haikyuu either daily or weekly. I don't want this 7-month long tradition to end.

[](#frustration)

Now we've gotta wait the same amount of time before we see more. October can't come quick enough.
>> ARTICLE
I know! At least we have the manga which is weekly so it's not like Haikyuu completely disappears, but it will be so weird not having any Haikyuu to watch unless I rewatch everything. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm hesitant to get into the manga because I feel like this series in particular benefits so much from being animated. The animation itself is gorgeous, the VAs nail it, and the OST is godly. I'll probably give in after the third season, though. The wait for a fourth seems like it'll be a long one.
>> ARTICLE
I understand, but sort of disagree. Sports manga in general benefit from animation because you can see everything going on. KnB imo is one that greatly benefits from being animated because the manga sometimes makes what's actually happening hard to follow. Furudate does an absolutely fabulous job of showing movements so it's really not too different from the anime. It's also one of the few where I didn't feel any less hyped about the show after getting into the manga. You are right the anime does add a lot, but the manga is still really absolutely fabulous on its own. 

As for the wait, I don't know. I'm sort of wondering if they aren't planning for the whole 3rd season to be the Shiratorizawa match (which would be crazy, but because of the lack of much else pretty possible). If it was it probably wouldn't be much longer of a wait since there would be pretty much a whole year of content for them to make the next season from by that point.
>> ARTICLE
All valid points, I totally get you on everything. I've gotten lost before just in the 3d space that manga is trying to convey before and I could totally see it happening in one confined to a basketball court where movement and positioning is all really important. I'll definitely give the manga a try after season 3, then.

Based off [the name of the third season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32935/Haikyuu_Karasuno_Koukou_VS_Shiratorizawa_Gakuen_Koukou), I'm pretty sure it'll just be the one match, and probably only 12 episodes at that. How much longer would we have to wait after the end of the 3rd season for enough post-Shiratorizawa source material for a full additional 25-episode season? I wouldn't be surprised if it was ~a year or more.


>> ARTICLE
That's why I love the Haikyuu manga. I've never gotten lost or confused about what was going on or what he sort of motion he was trying to portray. 

> How much longer would we have to wait after the end of the 3rd season for enough post-Shiratorizawa source material for a full additional 25-episode season?

I doubt it would be that long because Shiratorizawa ended the beginning of this year (like second or third week of January). Season 3 isn't starting until Fall which is another 6-7mos. Then if it's 25 episodes it won't end until March again so that's over a year of manga content. Right now there's already almost a third to a half (depending on how they did it) of season's worth of content past Shiratorizawa. But I'm doubting that it would be part of season 3 because it would make a really weird second half of a season imo.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I might be biased, but Haikyuu, especially this second half of the season was probably the best series of the season. The source material is incredibly strong, but the anime studio should be praised as their adaptation made it even better.

This second season of Haikyuu had a decent advantage over the first season. We already had the main cast fleshed out, experienced a taste of tournament games, as well as a harsh loss to recover from by improving the team through training. Arcs with the Tokyo clubs as well as the tournament matches that led up to Karasuno facing Aoba Josai were all really good parts in the manga which as I've mentioned before were made better by the animation studio who stepped it up in their own way from the first season. They also made sure to make the final match of Karasuno vs. Aoba Josai the most hype thing ever. Episode 24 of this season is definitely one of the best episodes of anime I've ever seen. I've read the manga before hand, but I was on the edge of my seat from the excitement that the animators created in those final points. I could mention a wall of things that was done well such as Tsukki character growth, Yamaguchi serve, faceless 2nd year stepping in for injured captain, and much more. This series BROUGHT EVERYTHING and DELIVERED.

This final episode set up the next season which was already announced because this show is amazing, which will be the Karasuno vs. Shiratorizawa match. I will say I'm slightly worried about how they're gonna do that match. It was a really long arc and in my opinion the animators should do what they can to try and cut unimportant material and keep that whole arc to a 12 episode series. That's just my opinion from my experience with the manga, and that is only if they plan on focusing on the Shiratorizawa match and a little backstory of some of the charcaters.

God, there is so much more I want to say like the emotion you seem from the characters. You really felt for Aoba Josai at the beginning of this episode. Also the comedy is still there for the show as well and the characters are all just great at being who they are. That's not only Karasuno characters, but the Tokyo characters with Kenma and owl-boy, Aoba Josai's team, the adults, the supporters, EVERYONE IS AWESOME.

 I felt a bit emotional near the end when Kageyama and Hinata were thanking Yachi for her being there from the attachment I've gained through watching this series and being a supporter. In a weird way to me, it felt like the animators were using that scene to thank us as viewers for being here and watching the masterful animation they worked hard to achieve. Since in a way we're basically in Yachi's position of just just wondering into a volleyball anime and watching the games play out and I know that I'm thankful for the amazing matches I got to see. I feel like I'm saying amazing a lot. I digress though, if I say anymore  it'll just be more complements to a great series.

Haikyuu 2nd Season gets a 10/10 from me. If anyone thinks, oh this is a sports anime? I've seen Free! I'm not gay (Free is still fuckin good though), or who gives a crap about volleyball... GIVE THIS ANIME AND MANGA A CHANCE. Trust me, I thought the same thing when I started watching the 1st season, but you will soon understand how great this series is and not regret starting.
>> ARTICLE
i agree with everything you said. I dont read the manga so I was happy that some of the characters got some special attention. Besides Hinata and Kageyama, Daichi really stole the show. Totaly a meh volleyball player but his heart brings morale to the team. I enjoyed every scene that he was in even at the part how he described his new bruised face to the girls. Just an outstanding man. I guess thats why they chose him as the Captain. 
>> ARTICLE
>Totally a meh volleyball player

You take that back. Oikawa acknowledges the whole team is strong.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't know what to say. It was just... incredible. Haikyuu S1 was such an amazing and unexpected experience for me, and S2 managed to, somehow, beat it in every single aspect. It's just otherworldly! I cannot wait for the next season. [Is it even possible to be better than season 2](http://i.imgur.com/enYEIBX.jpg)?!

* Since I came in late for the discussion, I just wanna say that [Yachi](http://i.imgur.com/zfJr0Ls.jpg) is an incredible addition to the cast. I think her biggest strength comes from the fact that she's a polar opposite of [Kiyoko](http://i.imgur.com/El88Pta.jpg). She's super expressive, outspoken, imaginative, and the show constantly shows us her thought process. Not to mention that she's simply goddamn hilarious and her interactions with Hinata are amazing. 

* [Saeko](http://i.imgur.com/55VdHoA.jpg) is still [the best](http://i.imgur.com/qqknelL.jpg) though

* Oikawa is [scary](http://i.imgur.com/ilyKHbh.jpg). Oikawa is [funny](http://i.imgur.com/ORzqnct.jpg). Oikawa is fucking awesome.

* YES! [It's the hot as hell sensei!](http://i.imgur.com/CqhysA1.jpg)

When Kiyoko was being stern with the guys I immediately thought of another character she voices ;)

[Yachi](http://i.imgur.com/Khljpe5.jpg) though wow just her addition alone would have made this better than season 1, she was just such a treat :)
>> ARTICLE
> I just wanna say that Yachi is an incredible addition to the cast.

Yachi was a great addition, indeed. I didn't expect her to add so much to everyone's development at first but as you said, she's so expressive and outspoken that she helped a lot with that (especially Hinata-Kageyama). Also, [great](http://i.imgur.com/qEmUtXp.gif) [reaction](http://i.imgur.com/Q9JBsrk.gif) [faces](http://i.imgur.com/UK2VbxQ.gif)!

I'll definitely be running a rewatch of both seasons before S3 airs. Assuming S3 starts airing around the start of October, the rewatch will probably start sometime in August.

It's better the second time.

No mom I'm not crying because of a volleyball anime.

Everything about Haikyuu is amazing, the wait between now and season 3 is going to kill me. I want to see Hinata and Kageyama put Ushijima in his place so bad.
>> ARTICLE
;_;

I teared up so many times this episode. Iwaizumi having that short crying moment post-match broke my heart a little, especially because he's normally the strong one that keeps Oikawa in check. And Kindaichi in the hallway :( And Oikawa! Man, the past two episodes reminded me that he's my favourite non-Karasuno character. Hell, he might be my favourite overall.

But aside from all the sad tears, I can't wait for the next season. It just sucks that tomorrow on the show = six months from now ;_;
>> ARTICLE
It broke my heart when Iwa-chan was beating himself for that spike. Call me a pansy but the feels were really strong in that scene! 

Don't worry Iwa-chan, you're still best Seijoh in my heart ~~(and my Haikyuu OTP with Oikawa)~~
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised people aren't talking about Iwaizumi more, and how he let his team down. If anyone has ever been the go to guy and you mess up that shit hurts more than anything, you'll be in the shower like two years later and it'll suddenly pop back in your mind. 
>> ARTICLE
"We who grew from the concrete..."

Hinata sure knows how to wrap up a season. It's amazing that a post-match episode, instead of feeling anti-climactic, manages to keep me hyped and entertained.

Another Daichi x Yui moment, Yachi being adorable, Hinata-Kageyama bromance, Nishinoya and Tanaka being dorky... this episode had all the out-of-match elements I enjoy in Haikyuu.

I don't know if I can survive the wait for season 3.

Second half after the bus scene was anime original so don't have any comparisons of scenes after that. Also I'm a little sad they removed [Daichi's dream/the 3rd years as 1st years (minor spoilers?)](http://imgur.com/a/I7cvf) but hopefully they'll include it in S3!

Can't thank you enough for these!

Amazing story, adaptation, OST, animation, characters. By far the best sports anime I have ever seen.

[](#scrumptiouslymoe)

Nice way to finish the season, although I would've preferred that it ended with Ushijima's jump serve and the ball getting closer to the screen until it went black, but it was nice too.

Now we have to wait until fall for the longest match yet on haikyuu (almost 40 manga chapters!).

This episode covered from chapter 148 up to the beginning of chapter 150 (They changed and skipped some things from around the time they were on the bus back to school so you should start from chapter 149)

There were a lot of anime-only scenes in this episode which I am actually really happy for. They were really great and added a lot to some of the characters. Or with the whole school cheering them on ....... No these aren't tears in my eyes... ;_;

For those who can't wait until Fall or just want to know in general, last episode ended at chapter 148 and this at 149 or 150. Somewhere around there.
>> ARTICLE
[Same here!](http://i.imgur.com/781oAud.jpg)

This was a great end to the season. So happy they won, yet also sad for Aoba Johsai. Even [Kiyoko had tears in her eyes!](http://i.imgur.com/KeTZkPl.jpg)

This show always makes me feel like I like every team and feel so bad when some of the opponents lose. Same this time, [there were some really sad moments](http://i.imgur.com/nk0UMFY.jpg) that had [equally great encouraging moments](http://i.imgur.com/wkuFBc3.jpg) (that look on Oikawa's face just shows he's trying so hard to hold back). 

[Spectators](http://i.imgur.com/QKgZ8YB.jpg) also sad for Aoba Johsai but also [thrilled for Karasuno](http://i.imgur.com/tITuLN3.jpg). Loved both reactions, not to mention [everyone who waited for them back at the school](http://i.imgur.com/cr3BwpN.jpg) (love the look the other girl is giving Yui there, it's like "Come on, we know you like him!")

As for [Oikawa's](http://i.imgur.com/pL6XMLs.jpg) meeting with Ushijima, I liked how he stood up for what he chose and how he mentioned Kageyama. It showed how he also thinks they've progressed a lot. Also, some really good reaction faces there, once again like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/0LbJNoQ.jpg), [this one](http://i.imgur.com/8Jgfb5g.jpg) and last but scariest [this one...](http://i.imgur.com/VMV9Hnd.jpg) O_O

Oh, you won't be disappointed.

Is Ushiwaka just some oni drifting through Japan? He's always walking by himself just waiting to say ominous shit to the other characters. This was an incredible cool-down finale though, definitely setting the stage for next season very neatly, although there aren't many 'loose ends' to tie up in a show like this, so it has so much freedom to just develop characters and relationships, which is what this entire ep was about.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe that's why he is called "Mr.Japan". 

Seriously tho, he just pops out of nowhere.

What should I even do with my life until fall now. Season 3 couldn't come sooner.

Great last episode, sad that it's over, happy that it will start again so soon.

Ushiwaka can look at Oikawa and Aoba Johsai and honestly say that he chose the wrong path... just ugh.

Kageyama and Hinata couldn't even remember that they fought, classic simpletons. And Yachi was so worried about them, too.

Well then, Fall can't come soon enough.


>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how I'm going to manage to make it without Haikyuu every week.  The total support when they got back to school really teared me up.  

I want them to beat Shiratorizawa so badly.  The insults he gave Oikawa after the match really made me want to see them lose so badly after how hard Oikawa tried.
>> ARTICLE
Ah they ended with my favorite track on the entire OST.  LOL @ the way Tanaka and Nishinoya slept on the bus ride home.  Since Haikyuu is literally the only anime I watch nowadays allow me to just say I'm going to miss these weekly Haikyuu threads.  Ladies and gents, it's been a pleasure.  See you all for season 3!  Fall can't get here fast enough!
>> ARTICLE
I couldnt help relating to Yachi during that final talk with Kageyama and Hinata that if she had never decided to become part of their management team - she would have never been able to see them grow and reach the epic heights that were episode 24. 

I dont usually watch sports anime and Knb is the only other one I've seen some of (have had it on hold at s2 for a year now)- so deciding to watch Haikyuu was something I really did on a whim and I wasnt wowed by the first episode but boy am  I grateful I stuck with it because episode 24 is easily one of my favourites of anything ever and I honestly dont know what my anime experience would be like if it werent for these characters and this series. Time to pick up the manga.

>> ARTICLE
Nope. This amazing anime has ended. It will probably makes a lot of  people pick up the manga after this, because how can you not?? Thankfully, they will make the most hype match ever, soon, in fall season! 

Also for sure we will meet Oikawa again! How can we not with such amazing last line from Oikawa to Ushiwaka? If only this manga never stops, watching these guys become even more amazing player in higher level will be such a treat! Although the impact of Oikawa's 'worthless pride' was better in manga. But the additional scenes from students in Karasuno was amazing! 

This season has been such an amazing season. The animation is clearly one of the best. The soundtrack never fails. The comedy is still top notch. And although most of the time you can predict where the match is going or ends up, we still feel the sorrow for other teams. That's what I love the most about Haikyuu!! Not to mention the characters' development and interaction which is an absolute joy.

Also it's not everydays occurance in anime when the previous season you were crying because of your protagonist team lost, but in this season you cry because of 'enemy' who had beaten your protagonist team lost. Oh, Haikyuu!! 
>> ARTICLE
How did they even manage to make the end of a season episode so hype?!?! Argh!! 

Amazing adaptation by Production IG. They added a lot of scenes (the whole second half was practically anime-original) and everything just worked and helped to hype the upcoming S3. Can it be October now?! 
>> ARTICLE
GAH are you kidding me? This episode hyped the Shiratorizawa match up so much and now we have to wait until fall... :'(

Seeing Aoba Johsai so sad pained me, but "the team with six strong players is stronger" and Karasuno just so happened to be stronger. Oikawa, Iwaizumi and the other third years will despair for a while for sure, but they'll eventually recover from it, and the kouhais will practice even harder to get their revenge next year.

When Yachi reminded Hinata and Kageyama of their fight earlier in the season and they didn't even remember it- classic Hinata and Kageyama- that was priceless. Right before Yachi even mentioned it, I was totally thinking "the two of them practicing tosses now totally parallels them practicing tosses earlier in the season, cool" so Yachi's comments were terrifically timed.

I don't know how I'll manage to wait half a year for more episodes, but I'll try my best. Until then, I'll just have to rewatch the show several times and listen to the soundtracks on repeat nonstop.

Well, [see you all this fall!](http://i.imgur.com/2QqV8Ii.png)
>> ARTICLE
A nice, quiet little finale to cool us down from all hype of the last few episodes. If there's anything I've realized from watching this show, it's that Oikawa is one of the best anime characters I have ever seen. Never have I liked and rooted for the antagonist in a show as much as I did for him. Everything about him is just perfect: from his funny childish and petty outward behaviour to his cocky and smug attitude, to his extremely relatable struggle against those with natural talent. I really hope we get to see more of him in the future!  
>> ARTICLE
I honestly forgot that they had one more match after Seijoh. This has to be the most intense tournament I've ever seen in any anime, sports, fighting, etc. 

The fact that we get a season 3 so soon after this ended is probably the greatest gift the anime gods could ever give us, well maybe not including a Haruhi season 3, but still. I don't ever want a world where this show doesn't exist.

Wish we got more of Mad Dog and how he felt/what he was thinking after the match, but oh well.

This was a really satisfying conclusion to the season. I'm so hyped for S3 and the match with Shiratorizawa.

Damn, I love how this show makes me feel for both teams. Great character development all around. 

Gonna go down as one of the best sports anime of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
My first real sports anime. Gave it a 10. No shame. Now watching *Eyeshield 21* because I need more sports. Season 3 can't get here soon enough.
>> ARTICLE
I don't want to discourage you or anything, since it's always great having more sports anime fans, but I would recommend reading Eyeshield 21 instead of watching the anime. The whole reason the series got popular was due to Murata's godly art, and the anime was really deprived of that.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo, Baby Steps, Diamond no Ace, and Kuroko no Basket  are definitely some you should check out.
>> ARTICLE
Eyeshield 21 was a pretty bad adaption from what I was told, to get the real experience you should read the manga because the art is absolutely incredible and the story is great though much less realistic.

If you want a good sports show, def pick up Hajime no Ippo which is easily the greatest sports show of all time. If you want something a little more modern, Diamond no Ace is pretty good and if you can deal with the campy first season, Major is a great show as well it just goes on one season too long.

What a fantastic journey. I cant wait for the next season.

Man, I didn't expect the wrap-up episode to get me teary eyed like every other episode does. My favourite scene was when the entire school stayed behind to show their support for the team. Haikyuu's story is just about a bunch of high schoolers who really like volleyball, but scenes like that make you forget how little that would matter in reality, and instead want to believe that there are groups of people who are truly that passionate about a single thing.

I wonder if the matches in real high school tournaments are played on consecutive days like in Haikyuu!!.

I wish there was a short time span given to teams to come up with new strategies or to rest, etc.

Either way, season 3 hype!

I was interested to see how they ended this season without making it feel a bit odd. They did a really good job making the final episode. I'm excited/nervous to see how they handle the Shiratorizawa match since it's so damn long. It's absolutely fabulous, but it went on for like 6mos so that's a lot of content for one match.

Also everyone getting their face shoved into Saeko's boobs make me laugh ([Yachi](http://i.imgur.com/hpeL45u.png), [Tanaka](http://i.imgur.com/UMCakN8.png)). Along with her Saeko saying "What you can't handle some boobs in your face?"

Also when Hinata at the end met with the Captain of Shiratorizawa and said "i want to fight him" his facial reaction of excitment was so freaking good and the music with the violin is way too good at pulling on your emotions. It also gave me flash backs to when they showed the Crows fighting the Eagle in the sky. Done so freaking great.  I'm upset i have to wait for another season. 

These sports anime are so good. After watching Hajime No Ippo, Kurko No Basketball, Prince of Tennis and the one about bicking with the kid with the glasses and yellow jumpsuit I have been getting into sports anime way more. 
>> ARTICLE
well damn! haikyuu keeps on surpassing expectations. this was a darn good finale with all the feel-good and heartwarming bits in it.

i am sad we won't be getting more of this week by week *but* at least we don't have to wait too long! 

i can't even pick a favorite moment to fangirl over in this episode. IT WAS JUST GREAT. ALL OF IT. noya and hinata toppling over the whole team (aww!), the sleeping karasuno, yachi's general adorableness, yui!!!
>> ARTICLE
This fistbumb at the end. 

They came so far.

*sobbing like a child*
>> ARTICLE
overall happy ending, it wasn't as heart-wrenching as last season. Season 3 can't come soon enough 
>> ARTICLE
Gah this season was so amazing!  I don't want to wait for the next season.  So tempted to read the manga.... I must be strong.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit what a great way to conclude this season and maintain hype for the upcoming match against Shiratorizawa! Does anyone know where the manga leaves off, I don't think I'll be able to wait until the Fall...
>> ARTICLE
I have never shed more tears of excitement for than this anime. Every episode portrays team work and team spirit so well, getting me invested in each player, and of course the incredible action perfectly adapted from the manga that gives me goosebumps. 
Haikyuu, you da real MVP. 
>> ARTICLE
All aboard the season 3 hype train!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
I DONT WANT TO WAIT UNTIL FALL 
>> ARTICLE
Me neither, i'm gonna start the manga

Shit man what a great ending to this season. The months ahead spent waiting for the next season will torment me :'(

>> ARTICLE
I AM SO HYPE FOR S3!
>> ARTICLE
Oh sweet, the season is over? Time for a binge watch!!!

Thanks for letting me know guys. I've been patiently waiting for season 2 to finish after I completed season 1. I guess I just like watching them all at once. 

I'm so hyped! Time to start season 2!
>> ARTICLE
now that's over, what's the most similar to haikyu that isn't koroko's that I can watch in the meantime? Not necessarily has to be a sport anime
>> ARTICLE
I havent seen many sports anime, but Chihayafuru comes to mind. Similar to Haikyuu, but with more romance. Don't let the synopsis fool you though, it gets hype af.
>> ARTICLE
Stop saying tomorrow
>> ARTICLE
Is anyone kind of enough to tell me in which manga chapter did the anime finish?
Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
148!
>> ARTICLE
Is it really how Japan high school volleyball works in real life, 2 games today and then Finals tomorrow?? Isn't it too exhausting for the players?
>> ARTICLE
The hype level of this is real. 6 months to go for the Shiratorizawa match. I will miss my weekly dose of Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished season 1. Obviously not reading anything in this thread but... I'll be back!
>> ARTICLE
How is this show so good? Great animation, wonderful cast, brilliant pacing, thrilling action. It's got everything. 

Looking forward to its return. 
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone tell me what chapter Episode 25 is?
>> ARTICLE
Yachi entering the club and getting the jacket was amazingly satisfying for me. Tsukishima made it even better with everyone showing their jackets except him. I need a picture of that scene, it was great.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa didnt notice it. But yeah he is that kind of guy and thats why we love him so much :D 
>> ARTICLE
i love how tsukki stayed in character for that like nope, he won't do that. hahaha!
>> ARTICLE
Hah, how did I not notice that. [Here's the screencap.](http://i.imgur.com/7FU2wFe.png)
>> ARTICLE
I don't even know who the 3 dudes in the back left are...  Were they even given names yet?
>> ARTICLE
They're Kinoshita, Narita, and Ennoshita. The first two don't really have too much character development but Ennoshita becomes involved in the plot later when we find out that [manga spoilers](/s "he's probably going to be the captain next year.")
>> ARTICLE
Well for Narita [Manga Spoilers](/s "Narita is going to be getting a lot of playing time in their last set in the best of 5 against Ushiwaka because of Tsukishima getting injured")
>> ARTICLE
I'm happy he's finally getting some development but [manga spoilers](/s "I hope Tsukki gets better soon as he's my favorite. But I do want Narita to finish the match because he really needs to show off.") Hopefully Kinoshita will get some story time soon!
>> ARTICLE
Kinoshita, Narita, and Ennoshita
>> ARTICLE
I noticed it because I love Tsukishima as a character and it was a lot of black and then some white, so it stood out to me. Thanks for the screencap though!
>> ARTICLE
Haha he's great. I remember at the end of one of the games last season it showed everyone bowing but him.
>> ARTICLE
How is it even possible to make every single character in a show so likeable without them feeling like copies of eachother? Haikyuu is so amazing at making everyone feel so human. 

Also the animation was noticeably good this episode. I was sort of worried we would get a dip in quality after season one.

The final like 5 second made me cry from laughing. It's so comforting to know what the best show this season will be by the third episode ;)
>> ARTICLE
I agree about the animation. It makes the characters seem more normal with how fluid it is.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
[My doujins are writing on their own.](https://i.imgur.com/mZsn3HW.jpg)

Man, what it must have meant to Hinata to have seen that poster. "The Little Giant Returns!" 

Definitely misted up a little bit there.
>> ARTICLE
Just wait until the away training in tokyo. Shit gets real intense.
>> ARTICLE
i had to stop for a second to take it all in when i got to that point [in the manga.](http://a.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9904/09-076.0/compressed/i012-013.jpg)

it was a really great moment, possibly one of my favorites to be honest. (there's more to come, people! it just keeps getting better.)
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if I want to burn through the manga or just take it in week by week. All I know is that the wait is killing me
>> ARTICLE
Go for it!! Once you've started, it is pretty hard to put down. It is just that gooood.
>> ARTICLE
The whole decision segment got to me, what is this liquid flowing off my eyes?
>> ARTICLE
I've said it before and I'll say it again, it's the heart that makes this show so damn enjoyable. I've yet to find another show that has that same feeling.
>> ARTICLE
I felt some chills when I saw that poster. It was a great moment.
>> ARTICLE
I loved that it paralleled with the first scene of the entire show. Hinata riding his bike when "The Little Giant" catches his eye. 
>> ARTICLE
That sent shivers down my spine. I gotta give it to Yachi for coming up with that idea too. That's a brilliant picture to use for a poster, and I know it would catch my eye.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely, although I have to wonder what was wrong with the original poster that her mom said needed to be improved, since it showed that Yachi asked Hinata for help immediately after telling her mom she wanted to be the manager.
>> ARTICLE
The mom saying there was something wrong likely came before Yachi asking Hinata for help, and it was just presented in a different order to provide background plot (pretty much like a flashback).
>> ARTICLE
Did it though? I thought she asked immediately after, and then it cut out before the question was asked. 

Then they went back and showed that scene after Yachi's scene with her mom and Hinata seeing the poster.
>> ARTICLE
Oohh yeah you're right. They seemed closer when the mom says there's something wrong, so it came after the train station scene. Wait a minute... If she asked Hinata for help before she was criticized by her mom, why did she envision the spike **then**?  Surely she must have come up with the idea of using Hinata's spike as an image before then, because she asked Hinata for help... 

Okay, the only explanation I can come up with, is at first she had the image, up on the computer, with some bland black writing saying "The Karasuno High School Volleyball club is looking for donations." or something, and then when she thought of Hinata jumping for a spike, the phrase "the little giant" came to mind. So she then changed it to "The Little Giant Returns" and spiced up the font a bit.
>> ARTICLE
I think that has to be it, because I can't think of another situation that would be the reason why the mom didn't think it was that impressive. Solid work team!
>> ARTICLE
Didn't expect it at all it was perfectly executed
>> ARTICLE
The hype is real. That was one of the best moments in the entire show for me.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, probably one of my favorite moments as well.
>> ARTICLE
[Their reactions are always so awesome!](http://i.imgur.com/THvnjeJ.jpg)

The way they welcomed Yachi to the club was great, plus that poster she made was amazing. Couldn't stop grinning this episode.
>> ARTICLE
From the looks alone, I'm guessing bottom right failed. It would also be interesting as a narrative, because a new kid needs to take his place
>> ARTICLE
They haven't even gotten their tests back I don't think. Pretty sure those are their "PLEASE HAVE PASSED, I NEED TO PLAY IN THE AWAY GAMES" faces.
>> ARTICLE
But that dude is my favorite! 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he's awesome. Sorry I forget his name, I've forgotten almost all of their names except Hinata. ~~But the guy's a third year, and~~ I think our speciality serve-guy needs some ego-boost. Maybe.

edit: stupidity
>> ARTICLE
I'm bad with names too. I can normally only remember Kageyama and Shimizu's names lol.

I mean he probably can be bothered, just not bothered enough to do the pose.

But he didn't even bother to say welcome to the team with the rest of them (minus Kageyama who at least posed)!

[Yachi got hit with a downvote irl.](http://i.imgur.com/MK8G81X.png)

I love how this is a sports show... yet they haven't *really* played the sport for 3 episodes and I'm still hyped. Yachi's a great addition to the cast.
>> ARTICLE
I'm getting kind of annoyed with Yachi's super nervous personality. Like I'm sure it'll settle in but for the past 2 episodes half of her screen time is her freaking out for no reason. 
>> ARTICLE
It's kinda how a normal person would react to Hinata and co being super intense, though. Hinata gets fired up over nothing every 15 seconds, in fairness. I'd be freaked out, too.
>> ARTICLE
haha it's even infectious! Like in episode 1 where Hinata was freaking out over a bus, and fields, and signposts....
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I must admit I do get a bit fired up myself when I hear Hinata getting fired up. He makes no effort to hide how excited he is about things. =P
>> ARTICLE
They could not play for the rest of the season and I'd still have a blast with this cast :)

I'm loving this second season, even more than the first. Yachi's an awesome addition to the cast, and is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters on the show. And it's amazing how good they are at building hype even though they haven't actually played an official game yet.

Man, I wish I had the patience to wait until this finishes airing so I could binge watch it. Waiting a week for each episode is killing me.

 loved first season but second so far have been even better... this shows quickly becoming one of my favourites.

Goddam Hinata, why must you stir people's hearts without realizing it? This is not a shoujo manga yet I'm still shipping Hinata x Hitoka.

Great episode.
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama's yawn was really cute it reminded me of how Yacho compared spending time with Hinata as being in direct sunlight. That boy tires you  out
>> ARTICLE
Alright, more Yachi, woot!

The scene with Yachi's mom talking with Hinata and Kageyama wasn't in the manga; that was where the freak quick duo is supposed to meet Ushiwaka for the first time. Props to whoever decided to rearrange things---it made for an amazing climax in the first episode while putting more focus on Yachi in this one.

We're finally gonna meet the Fukurodani group next episode! Can't wait!!!
>> ARTICLE
A pretty great episode, it's great to see all these Yachi moments animated. And I had the biggest shit-eating grin when [major manga spoilers](/s "Tsukishima said there's no way they'd be able to block Ushiwaka.")
>> ARTICLE
Do you think they're gonna adapt the game that's going on right now in the manga before the season ends? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm really hoping so! considering they did the huge hyped set-up in the first episode this season!
>> ARTICLE
I think they'd have to. Unless they pull a Yowapeda.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I think it'll likely be towards the end of the season.
>> ARTICLE
It's really hard to tell whether they're going to get to the game where the spoiler occurs. Considering how many chapters the first season covered, they would have to condense quite a bit in order to make it in 26 episodes.

oh my god when the non manga readers see this in the show, I can't wait for it.

It's perfect, thank you kind sir.
>> ARTICLE
I love this show. I think this is getting added to my top ten. Thank you whoever did the rewatch. I didn't join, but I checked out the finale rewatch thread and decided to binge this show. Best decision ever! Love the cast - season 2 is even better than season 1. 

Three episodes in and I'm sure this is AOTS for me. Yachi is a nice addition to the cast. I enjoyed her interaction with Kyoko. It great to see how passionate Kyoko with being manager of the volleyball team. Yachi's mom is awesome and hot. Even thou there hasn't been much volleyball lastly, it still very enjoyable. I have the biggest grin on my face every episode. 
>> ARTICLE
The whole Hinata-Yachi interaction from getting the textbook till the subway station was super cute, I didn't get the same feeling in the manga, glad to see that the anime adapted it better :)

Also, we're getting HEY HEY HEY next week which should be great!
>> ARTICLE

Hooting intensifies
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the way the relationship between Yachi and her mother was shown. It was ratter quick (half an episode?), and yet enough to make me smile as her mother was impressed by her confidence. This anime knows how to create hype out of everything!

Also, that Hinata poster was awesome!
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Hitoka has been such an amazing addition to the show. Seeing more Kiyoko was already a bonus but now we get a cute ship also. Loved seeing an episode focused on her, liked her in episode 1 but loved her in episode 2 this show just has such great characters :)
>> ARTICLE
fucking christ, not everything has to be a "ship"
>> ARTICLE
You seem to have a hatred for shipping? At least I'm not fujoshipping lol
>> ARTICLE
She really brings back the awe of seeing the simple stuff that we should have already been used to. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I noticed that too and love it :3
>> ARTICLE
I never would have thought that a sports show would have such great characters. Just seeing everyone interact with all their little quirks leaves me smiling each episode.
>> ARTICLE
It got me emotional, laughing and smiling. they introduced her mom this episode and she had some powerful moments for me! 
>> ARTICLE
I thought her mom was going to be the cold parent type at first be she turned out to be really caring which was a nice change.
>> ARTICLE
Sports shows always have the best characters! There's just so much room for development as you watch them go through their struggles and failures until they're finally victorious.

Some of the best characters and character development I've seen in anime has come from shows like Chihayafuru, Baby Steps and Cross Game.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget Major!  It has a fantastic cast!!
>> ARTICLE
Put characters through the stresses of battle, strength, endurance to test their mettle and to watch them grow as a result. Basically every shounen, and as long as the characters aren't 2D, it works every time.

This show is going to end up being my favorite sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
No Lie I was super excited for that episode of Haikyuu. This may end up being my favorite episode of the season. It also does awesome jobs with the subtle things like Hinata Bowing much lower than everyone else before the match and the managers almost villainous smirk to show that she is in and a part of the team. But the A story with new girl and her mom was so well done I'm excited to see the rest of the adaptation
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu has a perfect combination of being serious when it has to and overall goofy and comfortable at other times. The series is just so soothing to watch. It warms my heart.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was EXACTLY as I wanted it to be. I was so hyped about this and they totally delivered. It was just perfect, as a reader I'm completely satisfied and happy. Yachi x Hinata canon please, they are the cutest thing EVER and they're totally made for each other.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoko's advice on "all you need is curiosity to start with", Hinata's poster moment, the "Townsperson B" feeling in the second half of the episode. I identified with a lot of moments because I'm one of those people who felt like they're unlucky for not having a passion in their life, always stuck in a "Townsperson B" role.

I was seriously tearing up multiple times. Thank you Haikyu!
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu!! always makes me tear up in every single episode. I suppose all of them are somehow very heartwarming 
>> ARTICLE
One of the most heart-warming episode i've watched, each character was unique in their own way and can't wait till next week 
>> ARTICLE
FANTASTIC EPISODE, SHIT! Got massive goosebumps when i saw the poster made by Yachi. She is awesome and her story about joining the club was very well done, too.

Also some nice and short volleyball with the amazing OST's returning. I loved this.
>> ARTICLE
ahhh I can really relate to Yachi a lot. Much as I'd like to try new things out of curiosity, I usually end up spending more time worrying about a million what-ifs before committing to something. She and her mom are both super cute (haha tissues!) and accomplished though.

and omg that last second tanaka monk pose

I loved seeing Hinata power up in the back ground before the match. 
>> ARTICLE
Can someone make a gif of them getting their exams back?

That was one of the most chilling smiling grinding episode i ve seen. I mean like this is the best anime. Comedy, slice of life and action all packed together
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion, this season is leagues above the first so far and is a strong contender for my AOTS. The characters are just great. Two weeks in a row now where I couldn't stop smiling for the whole 24 minutes. I'm beginning to fall in love with this show!
>> ARTICLE
I wish I could upvote this episode more than once. It was such an amazing scene where Hinata saw the poster.
>> ARTICLE
That's my favorite eyecatch yet, with Yachi's instant dogeza

Oh my Gaaaaawwwwwwwddddd this episode was amazing, the poster got my teary eyed for sure and Yachi is gunning for that best girl spot. Don't get me wrong Manager-san is a beauty but I dunno I'm really feeling all this character development for Yachi. 
>> ARTICLE
This show never fails to get me smiling. It started out great and continues to be great! :D I always find it super neat that they use shots of Hinata like [this](http://imgur.com/jHi836T) to convey a sense of intensity in his attitude. Super excited to get to some actual volleyball next week!

wonder why not more ppl are into this.. i think this is one of the better anime this season..

Just keeps getting better.

This episode is so cute! I love Yachi, and I loved the moment when she's yelling at her mom at the train station. Townperson B can fight too! 

I'm really excited about the upcoming arc as well. I've been keeping up with the manga, and I can't wait to see what happens next animated.

Anyone know the song thats being played during the match?

Someone want to tell me why they say "Nice serve" before the serve is even hit? :P (I don't know volleyball, just watch this anime)
>> ARTICLE
That's just how they say "give a good serve" it sounds a bit weird since we would use the phrase "nice serve" differently.
>> ARTICLE
It's sort of like, *go for a nice serve!*, just condensed. Like you'd tell someone at bat in baseball to hit it out of the park.
>> ARTICLE
Good luck and motivation?
>> ARTICLE
why have sports anime such good openings and endings? 

hachi is adorable
>> ARTICLE
I'm not imagining this, right? I feel like they're kind of building up a Hinata/Yachi setting.

I don't want to call it a pairing or coupling, because Haikyuu isn't really a show for that, but I feel like they have those two interact more than she interacts with the others, besides Kiyoko.
>> ARTICLE
Got a little teary-eyed at that poster... Hinata finally seeing his dream come true after years of hard work.
>> ARTICLE
"Townperson B has its own kind of awesomeness!" is for me one of the best lines in Haikyuu ever. It's a very empowering quote.

Loving the new season. Yachi is pretty awesome.

Get this filthy woman out of the spotlight. HANDS OFF MY HINATA! Also HRNNNNGH HINATA SHIRTLESS. Fuck man, I'm such a weeaboo but only for this show. 

On a more serious note I do hope to see some actual volleyball in the next episodes, this whole relationship thing coupled with the exams has been a bit of a bore.

The last 5 minutes of that episode had me crying lol

I was waiting for him to say something badass to Ushiwaka when Ushiwaka started walking away, but sadly nothing happened.

He probably just goes to the bathroom for those meetings/adventures alone lately. Worth it!

No kidding. I giggled watching him struggle entering the toilet as I hoped he would bump into Oikawa. Then it got even more better. Oh man, the tears of joy...

If you like that, then check out Nisekoi! Those faces are phenomenal lol
>> ARTICLE
Oh I hate Nisekoi, reaction faces are good but I hate the show.... 

Still read the manga though even though it causes me suffering
>> ARTICLE
That's completely understandable lol
>> ARTICLE
And not even one comment face on the sub, I think...Hopefully "Comment Face Refurbishment" fixes that.

I hadn't considered this until just now, but I think that's actually relevant! I think it's really interesting that he's adopted such a similar grin. It fits. 
>> ARTICLE
please his grin is nothing compared to [](/s "Tendou from Shiratorizawa.")
>> ARTICLE
Truly the shittiest of all grins capable of eating. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree completely! Hadn't thought about it before but it totally fits. Kuroo is such a trash bag.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that last scene, I can't handle the hype.

I suppose the one week wait will be even worse from now on.

Cracked me up when [Ryu randomly got hit](http://i.imgur.com/fbpjKXJ.gif) and noone really acknowledged it.

[I missed smug Tsukki!](http://i.imgur.com/Xg3A3zM.jpg)

It's just been two weeks but it felt like ages! The new opening is really good, both sound and animation. Ending, as well.

Kageyama spying on the others and thinking how [great Oikawa is](http://i.imgur.com/WWfX7jk.jpg) was hilarious. 

[The](http://i.imgur.com/fDhZyPx.jpg) [reactions](http://i.imgur.com/GdQtya4.jpg) to Tsukishima asking for advice and agreeing to play were great! 

And once again, [these two](http://i.imgur.com/TfrIODj.jpg) are the best (and completely synced!), they even [froze mid-air together!](http://i.imgur.com/5xOqW65.jpg) (lol [at Yachi's face](http://i.imgur.com/gKavnNQ.jpg))

[Oikawa's "teehee" face](http://i.imgur.com/ZEljKY9.png) on the eyecatch was spot on for his character, too.

I can't wait for the matches!

I thought it was a moustache and did a doubletake. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually really happy to hear "Go, Go, let's go! Let's go Date" chant, always loved that.

Another training montage to set up this second half...this is going to be so exciting!!

Also really looking forward to seeing more of that girl on the other team, even though it doesn't have many this show excels at them!
>> ARTICLE
I could hear [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU9Uwhjlog8) in my head during the training montage.
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha I also thought of that :p
>> ARTICLE
Love that chant too. So hyped for next episode
>> ARTICLE
I loved Date Tech last time. Hope Karasuno gets to verse them again
>> ARTICLE
The DateKo chant is one of my highlights from the first season.

It's so good that after watching two subpar shows from this season, it brought me back to full hype.
>> ARTICLE
The new ED is AMAZING. Having read the manga, knowing the frames, and seeing it all animated with the same art. Oh man, how cool. Plus tacica is just fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Going to miss the old opening though.  no more "SHOO AIMA BERIEVAAAAAHH!"

Seriously though, I like the new opening as well.  It fits the show.
>> ARTICLE
Been waiting for this shit for two weeks I'm hella horny now lets get it started 
>> ARTICLE
ushijima's voice is an aphrodisiac 
>> ARTICLE
just busted my nut real good
>> ARTICLE
I NEED MY HAIKYUU LIKE NOW, DIDNT KNOW IF I WOULD SURVIVE
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is literally drugs. I was already rewatching it, then found out my friend started it, rewatched it again. Not even mad
>> ARTICLE
Will they finally get revenge on the jerks who keep hitting on Kiyoko? I'm entirely too into this subplot...
>> ARTICLE
Yachi > Kiyoko
>> ARTICLE
I missed my boys so much I barely survived last week.

Also the new op is absolute fire.

Edit: YAMAGUCHIS SERVE OMG
>> ARTICLE
Yes! I was also barely survive on the one week hiatus. And Yamaguchi's serve was amazing. Finally Nishinoya couldn't received it in the end. I also can't wait on follow up of Tsukki's 'glasses' discussion between Akiteru and his mom.
>> ARTICLE
If you notice at the end he's got like the athletic goggles
>> ARTICLE
Like EverythingOP said, [here's Tsukki wearing athletic goggle thingies as seen in this episode's next-episode-preview](http://i.imgur.com/XppQtr5.png). (also lol at Daichi and Asahi's faces)
>> ARTICLE
Damn it, totally missed that one on preview. Thanks :-). 
>> ARTICLE
If Yamaguchi hits a game-winning knuckle ball serve I might cry
>> ARTICLE
[Vague spoilers](/s "let's just say that he plays an important role in one of the upcoming matches. And that I cannot wait to see his scenes animated.")
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, my eyes watered a little this episode when Nishinoya couldn't receive his serve. If he hits a floater serve in an official game I will sob.
>> ARTICLE
If Yamaguchi hits a game winning serve haikyuu is moving up from a 10/10 to an 11/10. 
>> ARTICLE
I will hack MAL to rate Haikyuu!! an 11.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit I'm completely captivated by the opening alone. This anime always nails the opening. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't agree at all. I liked the opening that they had before, i don't like this new opening at all. I didn't like the song, i didn't feel the hype that i had with the other two songs, i didn't like that they used photos during all the opening apart from two animated scenes. It would be better if we had yet the opening 1 or 2. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed god damn this opening was great especially animation wise. Will definitely be hearing it on repeat and I will be loving it more as the weeks pass I am sure of it. It could end up being my favorite of the 4 by the end.
>> ARTICLE
And the endings too! I really loved the last ending, and the new one didn't disappointed me at all.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a believer was my favourite opening of last season and I already miss it but considering this is haikyuu I'll get addicted to the new one in 2-3 weeks max :)
>> ARTICLE
I firmly believed that the new OP and new ED wouldn't be able to match up to the last ones because I'm a Believer and Climber were so great but somehow *these ones are even better and I'm so happy*
>> ARTICLE
It is definitely the most well-animated of the four Haikyuu!! openings that's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
The song's great too. Kinda sounds like Goose House.
>> ARTICLE
First one all the way. They're all great, but the first one is the best one.
>> ARTICLE
Most well-animated != best :P

I know, it had the best song.

I'm not a manga reader, so I can't WAIT for that fuckin float serve to come into play in a real match.  They've been slowly building that shit up for a long-ass time!  Gotta love a series that doesn't mind taking its time developing something, hope the payoff is as epic as what I've built up in my head. 
>> ARTICLE
Given that he spent an entire fucking season getting it to work, I hope he scores at least half a dozen points with it in the next game.
>> ARTICLE
BRUH Tsukki hype is increasing!

Yamaguchi beating Nishinoya, that was a very nice scene.
>> ARTICLE
I'm liking Tsukki more and more with each Episode. I also can't wait for [Manga Spoilers](/s "Yamaguchi's development and his serves in the next games")
>> ARTICLE
I think it's great how they managed to introduce Tsukki and (to a lesser extent) Yamaguchi as antagonistic team mates/rivals and now they are two of my favorite characters. 
>> ARTICLE
I hated Tsukishima in season 1 but after reading the Manga he became one of my favorites (Nishinoya and Tanaka still the best though).
>> ARTICLE
Tanaka and Nishinoya never fail to entertain me haha that frozen in mid air scene was hilarious   
That bathroom scene was hype as fuck... This break was killing me, glad haikyuu is back 
>> ARTICLE
It should be illegal for an anime to get you this hyped. Loved it.
>> ARTICLE
YESSSSS IT'S BACK IT'S BEEN TOO LONG

* My boy Akiteru! Man, I love this guy. Best bro.

* Oh, Kageyama. You kill me. There simply is no "easygoing" setting built into you.

* Tsukki just let Hinata goad him into trying. That's adorable.

* I burst out laughing when Tanaka got hit in the head. And it was acknowledged!

* Aww yisss Tsukki gettin' some more character development. I like this.

* Oooooo Mad Dog-kun looks interesting. Good to know Oikawa is still terrifying to him :P

* YES YAMAGUCHI CAN DO FLOATING SERVES NOW!!!

* Oh, Bokuto. You're so vain XD

* Yacchan is becoming a manager in her own right! Awwww she's all grown up now.

* Haha Johzenji's manager is apologizing for him. I get the feeling this is a regular occurrence.

* HA Hinata recognizes his own trope.

* LOL it's incredibly entertaining that Oikawa and Iwaizumi are so pissed at Ushiwaka.

* Aww Aone from Date is as polite as ever :)
>> ARTICLE
Yachi the animal trainer. 
>> ARTICLE
> Tsukki just let Hinata goad him into trying. That's adorable.

Tsukki is hella adorable. Like a little puppy that's trying to be angry but you're just like "aw, look at this puppy trying to be angry, that's so cute".

*~cHaRAcTEr DeVELopMeNt~* I love it.

> Oh, Bokuto.

[You're so vain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6UAYGxiRwU) :)

Aaand Aone is also an adorable puppy. But a polite puppy, not an angry one, not really.

I think I love this anime more than what is considered healthy. 

This second cour is going to be one of the best things in anime, ever. Can't fucking wait.

Edit: Kageyama the master of disguise lmao
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu properly delivering the hype for this upcoming season. I have to say the animators really were smart by placing this episode's manga events at this point in the season. Brings back all the characters and sets up the national qualifying tournament perfectly by showing everyone doing their final push towards being improving themselves and being ready for this competition. This episode felt long in a very good way to me, where they managed to place so much content into a single episode and it just flowed perfectly. 
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if Tsukki's bro will be the one to unleash Tsukki's final form -- contact lenses?!

I absolutely adored the opening! As always Haikyu delivers.. the 2 week wait felt like purgatory but I'm glad were back to the standard once a week episode! Can't wait for the next manga chapter either roll on next week!

SO happy to see everyone developing, for some reason the scene with Yamaguchi finally getting a serve past Nishinoya really made me happy.
>> ARTICLE
This new OP is groovy as fuck

Also Lol at Hinata realizing he meets dangerous people in the bathroom.
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto is a fan of transitive property.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, how I missed you Hypeuu!! Welcome back, my love.

Alone in this episode happened so much. I don't even where to start. Maybe I just talk about my two favourite characters:

Never. Stop. The. Tsukki. Development. Never. It's just so much fun watching him growing into a block beast. Looking forward to see his improved skills!

And Oikawa just showed why he is my second favourite. I just love his whole "I am friendly towards you but know that you aren't worth the dirt under my shoes." - attitude. And his face while talking with Mad Dog - chan. Brilliant.

Really looking forward to Karasuno's match with the party team.^^^^fuckingweirdhearing8manwithsuchahappyattitude

On a side note: I really like the opening and ending. The opening may be not as a hype as the SPYAIR one but I don't think it "kills" the hype like the second opening from S1. I think the ending is as good as the first one (but that might change in either direction after listening to it several times).
>> ARTICLE
ok but kageyama's disguise though. i still remember his cool "king of the court" image he had in season 1,ep1 
>> ARTICLE
[Johzenji intro music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SEOguApssc)

I literally just smiled for 24 minutes straight. Like, it's been at least 15 minutes since I finished watching the episode, and I can *still* feel fatigue in my facial muscles. Tsukki's smug grin. Yamaguchi's serve. Kageyama's shitty spying. Nishinoya and Tanaka freezing mid-air. Yachi. ^(Ushiwaka being oddly attractive for the .3 seconds of the episode he featured in.) Oikawa. Iwaizumi. **Oikawa and Iwaizumi**. *Hinata going to the bathroom*. **Aone bowing**. I *literally* can't even with this show there is too much for me to praise I don't know where to begin.

See y'all next week for more Hypekyuu!!.

[I really love writing about Haikyuu, so of course I had to do something for the start of this second cour.](http://minuteart.net/2016/01/07/faces-in-failure/)

This essay is focused on the last episode of Season 1, but I believe it's a great way to hype us up for the second half of this season! With (hopefully) matches against Aoba Johsai and Shiratorizawa approaching, I think it's the perfect time to remember the events of last tournament and the struggles of our favorite volleyball team.

Looking forward to the rest of this season :) 
>> ARTICLE
At the end Aoba Josai and Shiratorizawa saying about only one team could win I was expecting Hinata to give one of his death stares and announce that Karasuno would win.
>> ARTICLE
I thought he was gonna jump 10 ft. in the air and *then* do what you said.
>> ARTICLE
I personally think that the intense, silent gaze was far more powerful in this situation.
>> ARTICLE
 I'm in love with the new OP as always :3
New ED is very cool, too.
>> ARTICLE
I think this OP is going to be one of the best of 2016, man that was great.



>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest, I had some misgivings about the new cour at the beginning of the episodes, what with the new OP, the rushed subplot of Kageyama spying on Oikawa, and some shots that lingered a little awkwardly imo. Seeing the Bokuto, Kenma, and the rest in Kanto was nice, but I was finally convinced when I saw [Yamaguchi's face](http://i.imgur.com/nKTiR8k.jpg) after he hit a service ace against Nishinoya, of all people. I can't help but grin whenever something goes right for Yamaguchi; he's such a hard worker, he's humble, and he's a great friend to Tsukishima. From then on, the episode was beyond smooth sailing. What a great show.

Bonus: [King Oikawa](http://i.imgur.com/TA2EqUP.jpg)

Aww shit Mad Dog doesn't pull any punches

Tsukishima keeps getting better and better

The bathroom, Hinata's great opponent.

Love this new OP!

God, every time this show gets me amped. I wish with all of the sports anime now that eyeshield gets a chance at an anime revival
>> ARTICLE
They froze in mid-air tats awesome that had me dying i was tearing up at that point
>> ARTICLE
I always have the biggest smile on my face watching this, and the part with Hinata at the end was hilarious. The new OP/ED are also great, thought that's expected from Haikyuu! 
>> ARTICLE
Saeko in the opening! Hope we get more of her in future episodes, she's awesome.

Glad to be watching my AOTY 2015, in 2016. It gets to be the highlight of my week for another 3 months, heck yea!
>> ARTICLE
Next episodes are going to be awesome. I just finished watching this episode and I can't wait to see next. I'm glad that Tsukki has become important character and that we finally know something Yamaguchi's serves. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow I want to punch Tendou's face already
>> ARTICLE
The hype is unreal with this one.

Also the new bathroom scene was hilarious. 
>> ARTICLE
That intro got me goose bumps the first 10 seconds.

And i missed Yachi so much.
>> ARTICLE
I was cool with a new Opening, but I'm totally against the new Ending song, the old one was just too epic.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh yes, Oikawa in the new ED is finally back in his villain form.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, loved both the OP and the ED! We are finally starting the tournament so from now on. Also mad dog-chan makes his appearance! Pretty good episode overall.

This episode covered from page 15 of chapter 105 up to chapter 108 (skipped a few scenes of this chapter).
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I could ever get enough of Bokuto. 
>> ARTICLE
I might be wrong , but does the mad dog share the same voice actor as Aomine Daiki from KnB?
>> ARTICLE
Nope. Mad dog is Shunsuke Takeuchi; he's a newbie whose first anime voice-acting role was in 2014.
>> ARTICLE
God the ending of this episode was epic, it was great to hear all those different school's chants.

Also I like the new OP and ED.
>> ARTICLE
Woo! The moment I've waiting for all season has come: The games! We got a taste of it last week and the game before that, but now the real thing has arrived. It has now time to see if half a season of training and development will finally pay off and if i can truly say it tops sesson 1. While there were a lot of great moments in the first half and I liked the development, the games are the true soul of these types of shows and I can't wait.

As a side note, the other teams Karasuno played in the training cap are in a diffrent presciptiure(that's probably the wrong word) or something right? They won't play them unless they take top spot in this torment?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah think those are all in the Tokyo Prefecture, which is why both Karasuno and Nekoma need to win their prefectures and go to nationals for the battle at the garbage dump to truly take place. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they said that since Tokyo is so large two teams from there go to nationals. Only can imagine it will be Nekoma and Bokuto's team.
>> ARTICLE
[Hinata sure has bad luck going to the bathroom!](https://i.imgur.com/iKq6Fe2.jpg)

Now the biggest problem is how i'm supposed to wait every week to watch all the glorious matches finally being animated. My feeling is probably like Kageyama after spying seijoh, i know i will suffer, but pretty sure i will enjoy the ride. 
>> ARTICLE
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA IM SO HYPED FOR THE UPCOMING MATCHES. LETS GOOOOOOOO KARASUNOOOOOOOOOO

I swear! Blonde-with-Glasses better actually change his attitude during this tournament!! Looks like he just might actually do it since his older brother still loves and plays VB.

well, they're readable when they're typing

but it does seem that female japanese tend to have better handwriting for some reason, as from what i observe, and as to white people, they're both quite hard too read, everyone has their tics, and black and chinese, usually depends much on the person
>> ARTICLE
well you've just got it all figured out dontcha
>> ARTICLE
> dontcha
>> ARTICLE
Just wait till the anime catches up to where the manga is. Tsukki is now one of my favorite characters. 
>> ARTICLE
When do you think the anime will catch up?
>> ARTICLE
This season will probably end where the manga is at right now. Maybe 2-3 more chapters even.
>> ARTICLE
I really doubt that. We're going at ~2 chapters per episode, and with 80+ chapters to go, they'll have to put a lot of it in a 3rd season
>> ARTICLE
We'll see. There's no good place to end it between the game now and where they're at in the anime. Unless they end it right before the current game in the manga which would be pretty dumb IMO. 
>> ARTICLE
Is the manga past the upcoming tournament arc? I may need to binge it soon. 
>> ARTICLE
Not quite. 
>> ARTICLE
If you binge it now you'll end up extremely starved for the next chapter. More so than normal
>> ARTICLE
wait one or two weeks because the manga is in the middle of a match and it'll be done in a couple of chapters 
>> ARTICLE
couple...sure haha
>> ARTICLE
It honestly can't be stretched out much farther. 1-2 to finish game, 1-2 reactions
>> ARTICLE
For sure. If it doesn't end in 2 chapters max they're really pushing it. This game is great but it's been going on for around 30 chapters now. 
>> ARTICLE
Lmao the last Kuroko match in the manga went for over 60
>> ARTICLE
lemme guess, they won, like by the slimmest margin humanly possible? once a battle/game exceeds a certain length, it actually tends to decrease rather than increase the suspense because you know there's no way they'll lose
>> ARTICLE
BINGE IT. COMPLETELY WORTH NO REGRETS.
>> ARTICLE
I want to but I'm in the middle of Berserk right now and don't have enough time on the bus :/

I may though. I think I'll wait for the season to end (around 25 episode mark) then I'll binge and catch up with the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
I think watching it after this season ends might be a good idea. It'll build an appropriate amount of hype if it ends where i think itll end. Message me when you do read! I'll be down to re-read and discuss.
>> ARTICLE
I may. I might not because I'm totally lazy and might forget :(

Maybe every 20 chapters or so :)
>> ARTICLE
Okay! I hope you don't forget because its such a fun read!
>> ARTICLE
Good to know. I've been thinking about picking both it and Noragami up. And Gangsta. Damn that 'fuck you, read the manga' season end...
>> ARTICLE
Man, Haikyuu is full on the Tsukki hype train, both manga and anime. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a favourite character pool and he'd contest first place right now.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so ready. He's always been one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of feel like i'm the only one who doesn't really like him that much.
>> ARTICLE
Just wait
>> ARTICLE
> who doesn't really like him that much yet

FTFY



>> ARTICLE
He has a really antagonistic personality. This past few episodes and his growth later change a lot of people's views on him.
>> ARTICLE
But he's already so tall...
>> ARTICLE
I'm still laughing about this.
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow... that look Tsukki's brother gave him from across the court was just heartbreaking. 

[](#forgotkeys)

I wasn't sure if I wanted a flashback sequence at first, but that was really well done.
>> ARTICLE
I felt pretty heartbroken and I'm so glad it wasnt just him losing a game like I thought last episode it would be.
>> ARTICLE
I was certain it was gonna be that his brother got injured. Somehow I think this was sadder.

>> ARTICLE
At least with injury he will still have the younger brother on his side.

In this scenario he completely lost him.

Really? I felt like this was the only way it could go early on this episode. Last episode, I was split between the scenario we saw and the injury crushing his brother's (and, by proxy, his) world angle, but with all the tension we saw building in his brother, knowing that his brother also was on the same team as "The Little Giant" (sourced from Tanaka's older sister, Saeko in an earlier episode), and all the "he feels inferior to Hinata/won't put in effort to be his best because "it's only a stupid [fucking] game *teeth grit and angry stomp away*"" moments between the other characters RE: Tsukishima I became pretty certain this was a story of bitter betrayal, though I honestly didn't see the betrayal coming in the form of his brother being the aggressor until they did the flashback with all Tsukki-Onii's hesitation in body language getting added as the extra ingredient to the concoction... I did think it was well done.  I loved Tsukishima as a kid. Perfect, haha

Oki, limb here, so feel free to chop me down: Review [this](https://streamable.com/o739) scene graciously provided by /u/tsumehtai below. Towards the end, after Yamaguchi says "what more than pride", Tsukishima comments "To think this day would come". This obviously has the surface meaning that gets directly spelled out in the form of Tsuki telling Yama that he "can't believe he's cool", but there's a possible ironic interpretation as well: "he never thought the day where he could understand (maybe not forgive, but understand) his brother's actions." At least begin to. He seems to be smiling at his memory of his brother and all his own pent up emotion about it. There's reason for him, Tsukishima Kei, to be outside of that experience with his volleyball, too. So a third interpretation, even! (kinda 2.5, I'd say).

I appreciated how they kept him level headed and didn't give him so dramatic moment of realization, though I'm wanting the pace to increase. I just want to see him [own already](https://45.media.tumblr.com/bb77e06966e4ffd35d3460723b4f0834/tumblr_ny5x3mUFjc1qimk8ao6_r1_540.gif).  (also from /u/tsumehtai  - seriously, thanks yo.)

This anime and Diamond no Ace always make my week. I can't figure out which I like more
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko is a fun, very fast-paced and exciting anime with the very typical storyline of underdogs to champions. While One-outs is a completely different beast, a more psychological anime than sports and deals with much more mature themes. The focus is mostly on one or two characters at most and ignores all other characters. Overall I preferred one-outs, its main character Tokuchi Toua is such an epic person
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
IMO I would say yes , give it a chance. I really like Diamond it's very exciting and never fails to disappoint 
>> ARTICLE
i found giant killing pretty boring but sure, then there's eyeshield 21, cross game and major. they're _amazing_

one outs was amazing but doesn't finish unfortunately. kuroko is good fun.
>> ARTICLE
I love Haikyuu but I can't get invested into Diamond no Ace even though I've read the manga and watched the anime. I guess it's because I just don't like stupid characters. I don't mind if they stretch it a bit with the jokes but at a certain point Sawamura just gets annoying to watch because he's just so stupid.


Haikyuu draws a clear line between being stupid for comedic relief i.e Hinata, Tanaka and Nishinoya and their normal behaviour which they showcase during matches and otherwise. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm right there with you for years I hated sports animes, But summer of last year s1 Haikyuu I figured I'd give it a chance so binged that then binged diamond and a whole bunch others now their a guarenteed corner of my must watch every week, as to which I like better I think it's tough, Diamond... is a bit....slower in my eyes and the way they do cliffhangers piss me off Haikyuu Cliffhangers after showing off something cool, then pumps you up to see more, Diamond Cliffhangers right before something cool and forces you to watch wondering what it could be and thats more aggravating to me I suppose, so I guss I like Haikyuu more...but really not by much

>> ARTICLE
Any chance you have watched Cross Game? 
>> ARTICLE
I have not but sounds like it'll be a busy sunday for me.

>> ARTICLE
It is fantastic! Its a 50 episode show, and I finished it in less than a week because it kept me hooked. I would say its about 40% Romance, 40% Sports, 20% Comedy. The art is styled a little older, but it is great. If you like the character development aspect of Haikyuu you will like this show, plus there are a lot of those Haikyuu-like moments where something awesome happens in a game where you are just left feeling all "Eff yeah!". I don't want to talk it up too much, but it really is a great show.

Alright if this sucks you owe me a sunday :D haha

Hah fair. I'll tell ya what, if you go through the first 5 or so episodes and absolutely hate it I'll buy you Reddit gold. No lying though!

Giant killing was great, so sad it got shit canned.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like sports anime are very essence of classic shonen tropes of camaraderie, overcoming your own weaknesses and challenges set by others, improving yourself physically and mentally, often just for the sake of your own growth. I also find, that sports anime can utilize "absolute defeat" as a trope much better, than anime based on fighting to the death, because you don't have to pull "dragon balls" out of your ass to keep characters in game, so to speak. It just works better. Absolutely love most sports anime.

Major is probably my favorite series of all time, although binging on it is nowhere near the same as watching it, year after year, when it was coming out, growing with characters and watching them grow. Man, I love it so much, it makes me tear up a little. Such a journey - I don't think anime industry have it in, to make something like this again, but as long as they are sports anime, I will watch sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Absolute defeat, I can def uinderstand as being better portrayed here, adn shit 154 Episodes I have some watching to do. 
>> ARTICLE
Yowamushi Pedal has some great death scenes even though they don't die.
>> ARTICLE
*Furuya no Ace
>> ARTICLE
I really hate this term, as an anime watcher, you should know this show has less to do with sawamura and more about seido. Also, I can bet you my life, that sawamura has a considerable amount on screen pitching than furuya. The whole point of the show is the rivalry between furuya and sawamura and sawamura achieving the ace status as the underdog. Please, stop with obvious biast you have toward sawamura and you feel butthurt that furuya gets about equal time shown on the show as sawamura.
>> ARTICLE
No need to get defensive. It's anime. It's all subjective. People will care about who they want to care about. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude, relax. I'm pretty sure he was just poking fun at the fact that the protagonist (which is Sawamura, btw) is being completely overshadowed by a supporting character. I'm sure he understands why this is the case, as you so eloquently pointed out. 

And what's wrong with having a bias towards a character? You're telling the guy he can't have his own opinion? 

It's good to be passionate about a show, but maybe don't shit on other people while displaying said passion.
>> ARTICLE
I am not saying it's bad having a bias toward a character, but when you use it to make a pretty dumb statement such as "furuya no ace" it kind of gets on my nerves when the whole point of the manga is that sawamura gets overshadowed, that is why he is the "underdog" and at the last minute he is going to snatch the ace position from furuya. I wasn't trying not to be dick, but everytime I open the  diamond no ace thread when a new episode comes out all I see is furuya hate and the same joke of "furuya no ace." What do you want? Furuya to magically give up his spot as the ace and give it to sawamura and call it a day. The terijime is setting up an "underdog" story and that is what is so good about the anime. It breaks away from the shitty interhigh, beach summer camp, romance subplot, Goku style moves to create a story about rivalry and team strategy. 
>> ARTICLE
If you're coming from the "underdog" perspective, No shit Furuya is getting hate, because he's literally the main character's competition
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, I'm pretty sure most fans recognize that. They're still frustrated, since we're over a 100 episodes in and the spotlight's still on Furuya. I understand their frustration, but you're right; this isn't the typical formula that's followed, which is super refreshing in its own way. 

I think we're all frustrated, but I know the payoff will be well worth it. For now, I'm just trying to enjoy the ride there.
>> ARTICLE
Well I don't think people realize the act 1 of the manga is 413 chapters, with part 2 just started is going to be probably as long. Right now the anime is around 350 chapters in or so.
>> ARTICLE
Beware if you read all my previous comments, I'm a furuya supporter.. HE'S THE ONE TRUE ACE

Athlete not playing to their full potential, episode title with the word "hero" in it, recurring visual motif of the moon that comes from the kanji in their name, and they're voiced by Kouki Uchiyama.

Holy shit I never made that link between This and Ping Pong! Both are so alike and with the same monotone voice
>> ARTICLE
The samurai beheading moment was done super well! 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Haikyuu and Ping Pong are totally different in how they address winning. Ping Pong was about finding the ambitions to play and realizing who/what you play for, while earlier in the season of Haikyuu Hinata said something along "Why do you need a reason to win?" Both different, yet fantastic shows. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah, in a sense, ping pong is aimed for an older audience who's gone through the "teens", and feel emotional when looking back upon it(i know i did), how everyone struggles and shape to be so beautifully

whilst, haikyuu is just a very well handle shonen sports, ie, there's significantly more hype around haikyuu, cuz suspense and impact is important for shonen anime, to grab attention people who have "shorter" attention spans, whereas, ping pong, it slowly builds up to the best moment over the whole anime

Yeah episodes 10 and 11 of Ping Pong are my 2 favorite episodes ever.

Trust me if it actually spoils anything for you, you haven't really been paying attention.  It just confirms something that you probably already suspect if you've been watching.

Bokuto showing why he and Kuroo are Best Couple. The scene between Tsukishima and Yamaguchi was well done (They've adapted pretty well the manga overall).

This episode covered chapters 87 from page 16 up to chapter 89.

Bokuto and Kuroo are hilarious lol they kill me every time

I live for baby Yamaguchi and Tsukki. Also I love the lil moon on Tsukki's hoodie lol.

Didn't even notice that! What a cool addition
>> ARTICLE
Well that was a really good episode. You could really feel the tension when Yamaguchi confronted Tsukishima.

Can we take a moment to praise the soundtrack? It's been great all season, but the music that played at the end of this episode was *fantastic*. It really gave me the feeling that something big is coming.
>> ARTICLE
Btw if anyone find this soundtrack plz link me the video :) 

>> ARTICLE
Also what about the piece that played when Bokuto was motivating Tsukishima? With the intense fiddle?? AMAZING
>> ARTICLE
*yeeess* that one was pretty epic and fitting.
>> ARTICLE
Ouch my heart. 

So mini Tsukki was basically Hinata, with the same interest in volleyball, problems getting along with new teammates upon joining a team, and dislike for recieving. He even got the exact same advice about receiving that Hinata got from Sugawara way back in season one. 

Unfortunately, unlike Hinata and the Little giant, his idol happened to be his big brother, who had all the same passion for volleyball but not enough of the talent.

Can't wait for what's about to happen next.


>> ARTICLE
This anime is just way too freaking good
>> ARTICLE
Some of the manga moments I was eager for have finally been animated! One of the things Haikyuu!! does really nicely is giving all of the characters some form of personality or development, from the side characters to the other teams' players...

Tsukishima could easily have remained the sneering pseudo-antagonist from the first episodes/chapters throughout this entire series, but instead he too is given depth and and reasons/motivations of his own. Yamaguchi could have easily been relegated to 'the sidekick' archetype but he turned out to be a lot more than that (heck, he's one of my favorite characters). 

I dunno, it's one of the reasons I think Haikyuu!! is pretty great -- it's one of the reasons I got into Haikyuu!! despite not having much of an interest in sports anime. 

Also, the animation quality shined with Yamaguchi and Tsukishima's confrontation just like it did with Kageyama and Hinata's fight. Mainly with Yamaguchi's movements, I mean. 

Really nice seeing the flashbacks animated as well. 

>> ARTICLE
I saw it coming that Tsukki's brother was lying the whole time, but damn, his soul-crushed face when he was found out. I almost felt like **I** was the one who ended up getting caught up in the lie.
>> ARTICLE
The thought of tsukishima actually putting his full effort in something for once is making me squeal like a fangirl
>> ARTICLE
* Baby Tsukki and Yamaguchi are absolutely adorable :(
* Oh man. That moment when the brothers saw each other across the court... heartbreaking.
* YES Yamaguchi has his little outburst. And Tsukki's smile! :D
* Oya? Oya oya? Oya oya oya?
* Daaaamn Tsukki really went for it there. 'Bokuto-san, ima nigemashita'
>> ARTICLE
I'm starting to actually like Tsukki.
>> ARTICLE
don't worry, you will like him more
>> ARTICLE
That look in his eyes when Tsukki found out the truth...god damn. I can only imaging being so proud of your brother only to find out he's been lying the entire time.
>> ARTICLE
Well that was nothing short of amazing, Tsukhishima is definitely a force to be reckoned with now.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished watching the episode and ooh man. Tsukki is so wonderfully relatable which I adore. Hinatas comment about Tsukki needing to be cool was really great as well.

I'm pretty interested in the image that went with Yachis last comment because it was the moon existin in day time aka at the same time as the sun. Perhaps the best way to pull out the boys potential is to have them on the court at the same time?

(also the captains are so charming and completely steal any scene they're in. Oya oya.) 
>> ARTICLE
> Perhaps the best way to pull out the boys potential is to have them on the court at the same time?

i hope we'll get to see their dynamics animated soon. your guess is actually pretty close there. :)
>> ARTICLE
So many great things from this episode. Baby Yamaguchi is honestly the cutest!! Bokuto's speech was probably the best moment this season other than the freak combo meeting Ushiwaka, and the soundtrack is once again on point.
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto and Kuroo give me life.

This anime is always such a roller coaster of emotions. It's the thing I look forward to every week and I love everything about it. Keep on keepin' on, Haikyuu!!.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is the only show this season that I'm VERY excited to watch each week (Kagewani is up there as well). Definitely AOTY.
>> ARTICLE
I think this completely kills the whole "Glasses senpai is the Little Giant" theory, since Tsukki and Yamaguchi have both seen the Little Giant.  I mean, so has Hinata since the beginning, but Hinata is a bit of an airhead, so it can be explained away, but it's unlikely that someone as cerebral as Tsukki would forget the person who was the actual Ace instead of his brother.
>> ARTICLE
There's also the fact that Senpai is 29 where as Saeko is only 21 so that theory was killed once she gave her backstory about going to Karasuno at the same time as the Little Giant.
>> ARTICLE
I love Yamaguchi, both present and past versions.
>> ARTICLE
I went from watching Doctor Who to going right to this and let me tell you this

That Tsukki flashback and the confrontation with Yamaguchi got me right in the feels. That was just awesome and now I just want Tsukki to kill everything....on the court. And then I forgot to check how much time was left on the episode and just like that the ED kicked in :(
>> ARTICLE
I knew after they were hitting the ball against the backboard that his brother probably wasn't the ace, but not even on the team? That was heartbreaking...
>> ARTICLE
Really nice character backstory for Tsukishima. Better than him just being a to lazy too care smart guy. I do want the next episode right now though.
>> ARTICLE
This is the episode I've been waiting for. Everything finally pays off for both Tsukishima and Yamaguchi. The underlying resentment that Tsukishima has for Hinata makes way more sense. Also, all those moments from last episode where you can see Yamaguchi worrying over Tsukishima builds up perfectly to him losing his shit at him.

Mad props to I.G. They really caught the atmosphere and tension of the couple chapters they covered this episode. Not that that's anything new.
>> ARTICLE
What was the ost that played when Tsukki said, "we don't have to stop it?" 
>> ARTICLE
i am searching for that one too !

do you know at @17:10 ?
>> ARTICLE
Finally caught up to the latest episode. Totally regret not starting this series earlier since I always thought sports anime were not for me, but OH BOY Haikyuu is one of the few shows can get me soooooo pumped and emotional. Probably owes to all the super loveable and relatable characters. Even Tsukishima is starting to grow on me as of this episode.

Quite a few grins int his episode.

Absolutely heartbreaking. Tsukishima's brother... Holy crap man, I felt so bad. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok so this is unrelated to the current episode but its a theory. I am currently watching the anime and not reading the manga so please dont spoil. I've been watching season 1 again and there are a lot of flashbacks to the Little Giant. The more I look at it the more he looks like Takeda Sensei. I know they couldnt be more different but their hairstyle is so similar
>> ARTICLE
No [Tacos](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CChFsjEVIAE5Cao.png) shirt tho ): how come they animated Hinata's stupid red thingy shirt but not the TACOS one? I was really looking forward to it.

Other than that, the tension, voice acting and ost were right on point. My feels were up to my throat all during the flashback. Props to the director!
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this would have been a great episode if I cared about Tsukki, like, at all. But I don't, so I skipped over like 5 minutes of flashback out of sheer boredom just so I could get back to characters I like. God bless Bokuto and Kuroo though. 

EDIT: wtf, is it a crime to hate Tsukki? It's not my fault he sucks.

Maybe if you watched the flashbacks you'd like him better
>> ARTICLE
I watched like half of it and it *just kept on going*. I think it took me like 10 minutes to watch two minutes of flashback. My options were either skip the flashback or drop the show entirely, and I ain't about to give up my Hinata. 
>> ARTICLE
I take it you don't care about Yamaguchi then? The flashbacks pertained to him too, you know.

Hinata so damn badass, [that stare](http://imgur.com/mv99eVb) [and that jump.](http://imgur.com/yMdZx8x)

That animation in the jump gif though.

Hinata is actually Kiritsugu's son.. He can also use Time Accel
>> ARTICLE
Hinata's interception gave me goosebumps. I missed this damn show so much.
>> ARTICLE
And then Kageyama's shit eating grin after that. It was so good. 
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention the smile Japan!!! was giving them as they walked away.
>> ARTICLE
"I'm Hinata Shoyo, from the concrete." is one of the most badass quotes from the show so far, for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Hinata showed him so hard. Gaaa, that gave me a righteous boner.
>> ARTICLE
What does "from the concrete" mean?
>> ARTICLE
Ushiwaka essentially said they were below the level of unfertile soil (as his analogy went) which Hinata vocalized as concrete. It basically means they're trash among trash.
>> ARTICLE
Also connects back to the metaphor of Karasuno being crows and crows (and cats) congregating around trash heaps. Which, well, if you remember the Karasuno-Nekoma rivalry... "Battle At The Garbage Heap."
>> ARTICLE
Since the big guy kept on talking they are the fertile soil, while Aoba Johsai is the infertile soil, it implies that Karasuno is a concrete. (Plants symbolism)

EDIT: Spelled Karasuno as 'Karasuma'
>> ARTICLE
Ohhh, that makes sense
>> ARTICLE
He says "what are, we concrete?" a few lines before that "from the concrete" quote. 
>> ARTICLE
I love this metaphor because plants *can* grow through concrete but only the strongest can do so, the ones who persevere for the longest. Great metaphor for Karasuno.
>> ARTICLE
woah

I missed these boys so damn much.

I'm fully aware of what /r/anime is gonna be most enthralled with this season, but I hope all of you are as excited as I am that Haikyuu is back.

Prepare yourselves, boys and girls. This is gonna be good.
>> ARTICLE
I loved this episode so much! Missed Haikyuu!! more than any other anime, really.

Loved how they managed to keep that animation and camera-work style from the 1st season.

Also, OP by Spyair and ED by Galileo Galilei, what can be better!
>> ARTICLE
The Haikyuu!! fan base may be small on /r/anime (simply because /r/anime users don't give sports anime a try), but those who do follow it tend to love it and are really passionate about it. 
>> ARTICLE
How can some one not give sports anime a try?! Sports anime are the fucking best!
>> ARTICLE
The only sports anime I have ever watched are Haikyuu and Baby syeps, and they are both amazing. Both have little recognition here however :(
>> ARTICLE
eyeshield 21, major, cross game and one outs are a must watch
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Haikyuu and it got me hooked on other sports anime. They're some of the best imo
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget racing is a sport (if you did!) capeta and initiald are amazing anime.

Also there is a board game anime is freaking amazing, hikaru no go. 
>> ARTICLE
Meh, I didn't enjoy those. I really liked the baseball anime. Big Windup, Haikyuu and Kuroko are my top 3 sports anime, followed by Baby Steps. I like technical ones a lot 
>> ARTICLE
No yozakura pedal :(
>> ARTICLE
That's not racing, that's biking :D

That's probably my 5th or 6th. Not as high because I wasn't a huge fan of the character design but I marathoned through both seasons in like 3 days
>> ARTICLE
This. I never thought I'd be into sports anime, but after a couple episodes of Haikyuu!! I was hooked.
>> ARTICLE
The only one I have some trouble with rewatching nowadays is Prince of Tennis, the super moves just get ridiculous haha. 
>> ARTICLE
There are a couple anime from each genre of sports I feel like that about.

Kuroko and basketball, capeta and gokarts, Hikaru no go and 'go', baby steps and tennis. 

If you didnt like sports/volleyball but like haikyuu, give those I listed a try.
>> ARTICLE
should try baby steps if you haven't
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Kuroko no Baske, and half of the VA cast works in Haikyuu. Gets confusing.


>> ARTICLE
whoa! *really?!* :o
>> ARTICLE
You might like 'baby steps', though it doesn't have as many characters.
>> ARTICLE
tfw you find out that Akashi and Takeda share the same VA...
>> ARTICLE
tfw Akashi became a teacher, wore megane and dyed his hair 'normal' after graduating

Real talk, Hiroshi Kamiya is one of the most versatile seiyuu I've heard in anime.

He's definitely pretty busy this season, between Yato, Araragi, and Takeda.

The whole time I just had this big stupid smile on my face, the wait in between was too damn long. Love the opening and looks like there's a ton of new characters and challenges this is going to be amazing.

Also that animation of Hinata intercepting the ball was fucking epic , this show is already off to an awesome start!

loved how kageyama was all "hey calm down and don't get lost!" at first until that part.

Ohmygod I totally forgot about that part and now I'm laughing like a maniac. That's too good.

Reminds me of spongebob and patrick LOL

They actually reminded me of Roy Mustang and Naruto since season 1  episode 1. I think of Kageyama as a young Roy and Hinata as Volleyball Naruto.

[It's time, gentlemen!](http://zippy.gfycat.com/CircularSourBengaltiger.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Exactly my thoughts! I didn't realize it was airing today but it has instantly increased my mood. So hyped.

Probably the best first episode I've seen this season yet and an incredible Haikuu!! episode by itself. Set the tone of the season but was hilarious and stern at the same time. Very, very excited for the rest. Just wish I could binge this season like I did most of last season
>> ARTICLE
Hype, chillz then tears, coz episode end. Fuck this how do i endure waiting for another ones... Pls gibe me full season already ;___;
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu!! proved to me that sports anime wasn't always about the sport, and that sports anime has some of the best character development the medium can offer.

I love this show. I absolutely *adore* it.
>> ARTICLE
Check out capeta/initald and hikaruu no go if you haven't. 
>> ARTICLE
Major does this really damn well.
>> ARTICLE
You're absolutely right.  Major, while technically a "sports anime" always felt to me more like the life of Goro growing from a child into a man with the people around him and baseball.  Both of those aspects were incredibly important to his growth, as he wouldn't have been able to become the man that he is at the end of the series if it weren't for his friends and family or baseball.  He learned many life lessons from playing baseball and from the people around him as well, and became a better man for it.

...great, now I want to rewatch Major.

P.S.  If you haven't checked out Major yet, I strongly urge you to do so.  It may not become a favorite of yours like it did me, but I can't see very many people hating this series, as it's just a great watch.  And while Major is a longer show, I promise you that it is, unfortunately, way too easy to get through and to marathon Major.  And you'll probably be missing it once it finally ends.  It's both heartwarming and heart wrenching at times, and is just a really fantastic story about one boy's growth into a man.  If you decide to do so, I'd recommend giving it about 10 episodes or so.  This isn't because the first 10 are bad by any means, (in fact, some may argue that these are some of the best episodes in the anime, even if season 5 is probably the best all around) it's just that you start to get more of a feel for it after about episode 7 or so.
>> ARTICLE
Okay friend, come down with us in baseball hell. We've got Major, Cross Game, and Ace of Diamond to drown you!
>> ARTICLE
Hajime No Ippo is pretty good in this way as well. You'd probably like Hikaru no Go if you gave it a chance. It's about a board game but it follows the same idea (character development).
>> ARTICLE
I also really like how the entire series isn't focused just on Hinata, it does a really good job on giving character development to other characters as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched pong pong?

Edit: Ping Pong
>> ARTICLE
Yes.

I was put off by the arstyle at first, but it's one of the best shows i've watched.

It's not about the sport, but about the people playing it and their troubles with their lives, family and friends.

I actually thought that Hinata answer in the manga sounded way better. [Here it is.](http://i6.mangareader.net/haikyu/77/haikyu-4471441.jpg)

it was more badass in the manga, i agree.

i didn't think it would be that awkward as it when it was animated. (still awesome though, not gonna lie!)
>> ARTICLE
AND he had a bag on?!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the context where they meet Ushikawa is different in the manga. I'll use the spoiler tag just in case, but I don't think it's any major spoiler: [Haikyuu ch. 76](/s "In the manga they are being helped to study to raise their grades so they can go to Tokyo and notice they are in the neighborhood near Shiratorizawa, and then the same happens as in the anime. Not too relevant I guess, but makes it a bit more epic, I think.")
>> ARTICLE
Man that gave me the chills. So perfect. Thanks for sharing.

The final boss
>> ARTICLE
I love that Kageyama doesn't know how to high-five
>> ARTICLE
Wh-Whoo....
>> ARTICLE
I've been preparing for this for the past three weeks, and now, I'm ready and IT'S HERE.

The OP is amazing, and I was expecting no less from SPYAIR. [Yachi](http://i.imgur.com/BVHv4Zh.png) looks adorable, and I can't wait to meet her and [Bokuto and Akaashi](http://i.imgur.com/6K8siS4.png). I haven't read the manga, but I know that they're supposed to be awesome, so I can't wait!

The whole opening sequence (after the OP) with the team practicing was imo the best way to start the second season, reminding us of lots of characters moves from S1 (Tsukishima's feint, Noya's rolling thunder, the freak quick, Asahi's spike, and Yamaguchi's slowly-improving serve to name a few). Plus, the new soundtrack playing during it was great! The whole thing got me pumped up for the rest of the episode/season.

Then the bit with everyone getting excited for a [Nekoma](http://i.imgur.com/CdJFMw7.png) rematch: Kageyama intensely anticipating getting to see Kenma set again, and Noya ready to out-libero Yaku.

Then [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/LdUjRL3.png) (poor Hinata).

[Takeda is out. He's done.](http://i.imgur.com/abVazor.png) Gotta love his unshakable faith in the ability of his team.

Then I CAN'T EVEN I just CAN'T handle Hinata and Kageyama being the idiots they are [running up the hill](http://i.imgur.com/nm0LaAm.png) screaming the whole while. (I love Kageyama [calling Hinata a dumbass](http://i.imgur.com/86tKQlq.png) again too) And then they just HAPPEN to be near Shiratorizawa and like super casually just like [run into Ushiwaka](http://i.imgur.com/YqHCk7D.png) (JAPAN!) while he's jogging? Is this real life?

Gotta love seeing more of Hinata's [crazy eyes](http://i.imgur.com/C5XqDyN.png), and Kageyama's [proud faces at Hinata](http://i.imgur.com/ZTA5nSD.png) (after Hinata [does the thing](http://i.imgur.com/GdKISm7.png)). [This](http://i.imgur.com/WeldXXB.png) is another great shot, and I especially love the contrast between the *single* white bird (shira "white" tori "bird"- though I think it generally translates to swan) vs. the "*team*" of crows. 

And the ED is amazing, too! What are the odds that two of my favorite Japanese bands do the OP *and* the ED?

I know I just finished rewatching the first season, but I really did miss this. These volley boys are all my faves. Can't wait for next week's episode! ^(I believe in them they can pass their exams *sweats nervously*)

Edit: a word, also wanted to say I totally didn't mean to document the episode in screenshots but it kind of just happened.
>> ARTICLE
This is just what I've gathered personally about names in Japanese, and I might be wrong, but here's my thoughts on the representation of a non-swan.

While  (hakuchou) as an actual word does mean swan usually, as a name (Shiratori), it can be just seen as a combination meaning of the two kanji that create it (ie. white bird). Sure, since names don't usually have concrete meanings, people are free to think whatever they want, so I'm sure some people would think of a swan, but any other white bird is just as valid.

And of course that bird looked way more badass than a swan would.
>> ARTICLE
Who is bokuto and akaashi?
>> ARTICLE
They're members of one of the Tokyo teams. Bokuto is my favourite.
>> ARTICLE
Hinata's blushy face around Kiyoko is my one of my favorite things. Whenever they boys do anything that is typical teenage boy antics, it makes me laugh :) 

That ED was so good! I'm so pumped for this season 
>> ARTICLE
> Then the bit with everyone getting excited for a Nekoma[

Kenma loses his phone when he sneezes and Kuroo is really proud that he caught it

> I especially love the contrast between the single white bird (shira "white" tori "bird"- though I think it generally translates to swan) vs. the "team" of crows.

This explains so much, I had always heard that the shira meant swan and was confused by why they showed an eagle for Ushiwaka


I think we saw part of the OP in the second PV? Every time they showed Yachi in the opening and closing I screamed (I really wanted her to be in episode one but soooooon). I might make a post in a bit (but it is hard to take screen shots as I don't have a crunchyroll account)
>> ARTICLE
guys.. I wont lie... but this was probably the best first episode of any anime I have ever watched. spec-fucking-tacular.

That bird in the end just finished it off.

Aho! Aho! Aho!
>> ARTICLE
I almost never laugh out loud from anime, but those 2 falling into their rivalry with such intensity so quickly, and so quickly forgetting what they were supposed to be doing because of that intensity, made me laugh quite a bit.

I love this show.

Okay. I might have to give this show a go.
>> ARTICLE
It is amazing and judging by the manga, this season is going to be epic.

Why must you make the [Hisoka face](http://i.imgur.com/zDVzHZc.png) Ushiwaka


>> ARTICLE
> Noya that is not how you stretch people

Well, he is fairly small and the ace is a big guy so it might be hard for Noya to have any impact only with his hands so he is using more of his body weight. 

Nah, who am I kidding he's just trying to be an ass lol

Not even 5 minutes into the episode and we got some great gif material

#THE HAIKYUU!! HYPE IS ON

AMAZING. The scene between Ushikawa and Hinata was beautifully done, so as the last scene, when the music is abruptly stopped when they hear about the tests lol. 

Seems like Yachi will make her appearence next week and the Tokio matches will be 2 weeks from now (Maybe they will end next episode when they arrive to Tokio). 
[It's finally Bokuto time <3](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/58/eb/62/58eb62c1504e75a83648aef1daeacfc2.jpg)

[spoiler](#s "But as a heads up, what Akaashi actually said in the manga was "Ara?" translated: Oh?, followed by Bokuto going, "Ara-ara?" and Kuroo finishing up with "Ara-ara-ara?" So it's the same meaning, but that's probably how it'll sound.")
>> ARTICLE
Hypekyuu!! is back in full force.

I love how this show manages to be completely serious yet hilarious at the same time. Hinata and Kageyama's rivalry is great.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man! Talk about an episode to get you pumped for the rest of the season! Just like Ushikawa, I got so damn excited about what's coming next. 

The humor is still here, the heart is still here, the awesome moments are still there, and the great OST is still here. 

Welcome back Haikyu!!

Everything I could have asked for was in this episode. It was just amazing.

[Takeda](http://i.imgur.com/IMH5yKc.jpg) gets pretty real sometimes.

I just discovered it and binge watched the whole show and now I can't wait for ep. 22x2... I was never into sports but now I'm hooked. I get it, I totally fucking get it! And now I kinda regret not joining any sport clubs back in school... Never thought I'd think like that?! This show is def in my top 5! It's ridiculous how much it means to me now...

The animation during their practice match had so much energy, had to rewatch again since it was so good.

Yes! This gave me everything I wanted and more. I love how Haikyuu is animated, especially compared to the inconsistent (but still really good!) Kuroko's Basketball. Also, thighs. So many thighs. (I watch this for entirely legitimate reasons, I swear!)

No excuses needed, everyone loves Daichi's thighs.

And Kuroo's thighs. And Nishinoya's thighs. And Hinata's ass-- I mean uh. 
>> ARTICLE
Already getting development for Ushiwaka for the inevitable match against them later in the year, and there are so many matches already teased that I feel this season will skip a lot of the teambuilding and go straight into matches which is really nice.

BTW Have we had any word on how long the season will be?
>> ARTICLE
It would be a downright sin if it was anything but a full 2-cour
>> ARTICLE
I can't imagine anything other than 2-cour.
>> ARTICLE
Gaah! I should have participated in the rewatch! I don't remember much about the main characters aside from Hinata and Kageyama.

Holy shit, I didn't realized how much I missed this series. The whole episode was a highlight reel. Best stuff in no particular order, Hinata's get fucked face to white bird man, running to a new district, manager/hinata scene, rolling thunder animation.

LETS GOOOOOOOO! Ready for all the smugness my boy Tsukishima is going to bring this season.

What a great episode to start the season! I can't wait for what is to come.

Damn I'd forgotten how incredible the OST is, though I have to say, I did enjoy that moment it cut out for the exam talk.

I'm really excited for this season, some of my favourite moments of the manga are coming up soon. Best boy [](/s 'Bokuto') and best girl [](/s 'Saeko') are coming !

Oh yeah it's finally out

New opening is great nice to hear SPYAIR again. Definitely more hyped than I was before will be rewatching.

Ok and so I just rewatched the episode, and noticed something I didn't notice the first time around...did Ukai just...call Takeda...[Take-chan](http://i.imgur.com/uAlKDVG.png)?? He hasn't done that before, has he? It's hilarious!

I think that was Tanaka, only he calls him that

Aw, man. I guess it's funny no matter who said it, anyway.

HINATA WAS CASTING SOME MOTHERFUCKING SHADE IN THIS EPISODE!!!

I am so hyped!
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how it hasn't been mentioned that their teacher's VA also voices Izaya from Durarara!! When I watched the first season of Haikyuu!!, I never noticed it. This was probably because I watched the two series at different stages, but having just watched Durarara!!x2's second cour it's glaringly obvious that they have the same VA. It might only be because his voice suits Izaya so well, but it seems like it doesn't really fit their teacher. The VA himself just has such a cheeky intonation to all his sentences that suits Izaya really well. He's pretty much the Japanese version of Joker from the Batman series, a cheeky cunt who doesn't know when to STFU. The Haikyuu!! team's teacher doesn't really fit that.
>> ARTICLE
They have the same VA?? I didn't noticed that! That blows my mind.

Hinata and Kageyama are so fkn intense I love it.

Holy fuck, the op and ed are soo good. The animation. The hype. The comedy!

just waiting to watch it, HYPE
>> ARTICLE
Fucking so pumped that first ep got me hyped as shit
>> ARTICLE
i didnt expect it today what a nice surprise
>> ARTICLE
Missed this so much
>> ARTICLE
It's weird how much attention the anime gets around here, yet I can't seem to find the manga discussion threads over at /r/manga.
>> ARTICLE
It's not as big, but /r/haikyuu does have some manga discussions. 
>> ARTICLE
That's where I go for it.

The reason I still want to see the /r/manga discussion is because the opinions are always very different from the ones in the dedicated subs. People at /r/manga tend to have opinions of people outside the fandoms mixed in, and it makes the discussions different.
>> ARTICLE
I am so glad this anime is back! In the top 3 for sports anime definitely! 
>> ARTICLE
I've been waiting for Season 2 since this anime first came out. This seriously has to be one of my favorite anime out there ,s o God damn excited lol 

EDIT: Well I just finished watching the episode and damn this was perfect 
>> ARTICLE
One of the best starts to season 2 I have seen in a while. Plenty of comedy with just the right amount of season 1 backstory. It only took me 5 mins to feel like I was picking up where season 1 ended.
>> ARTICLE
Been containing my urge to read the manga since Season 1 ended back in Spring 2014, and now it all paid off. Nothing beats Production I.G.'s animation in Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny how the best players are always bakas who can barely pass exams, ex Kagami from Kuroko no Basket.

  I can barely recognize some of the other players on the team (the no namers), do they get introduced at all?
>> ARTICLE
The second years (apart from Tanaka and Nishinoya) barely got any screentime in the 1st season. I don't remember their names either.
>> ARTICLE
They don't get much screentime in the manga either, but one of them will get a more prominent role preeeetty soon.
>> ARTICLE
SIDE TAIL GIRL IN OP, FUCK YEAHHH
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me, or did Hinata's voice sound a little deeper than last season?
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely see this season being even better than the first one after watching that first episode! It's great that they're finally actually putting some focus on Shiratorizawa, who we never really saw before and I'm so hyped to see them go up against our Karasuno boys.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is so hype and happy fuck I missed this show so much don't wanna wait 1 week between episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Good to see Hinata back!
>> ARTICLE
they just kick-started the whole training arc with this episode! i'm so excited!

(it honestly moved so fast like we didn't even get a break from season 1, that's how it felt like.)
>> ARTICLE
First episode definitely living up to my hype, god this show is so enjoyable. I think I was grinning non-stop, everything was so perfect! Can't wait for the next few episodes with the introductions of Yachi, Saeko, and the Fukurodani players.
>> ARTICLE
"I'm Hinata Shoyo, from the concrete." soooo SICK. I'm watching a large majority of the fall lineup of anime, and a few have started already, but Haikyuu started the best. Great pace, badass vibe, great buildup. Super hyped. 
>> ARTICLE
They cant expect us to wait a week for the next Episode man, not after that Hinata jump.
>> ARTICLE
I loved this first episode so much how am I going to survive until next week I'm not sure yet.

ANYWAY on to actually talking about the episode:

First off, who said it was okay to start an anime with [DEVASTATED HINATA FACE](http://i.imgur.com/FyPvmxE.jpg). I don't think it's okay at all how dare you. But I think they made up for it with [this line](http://i.imgur.com/Gh0XHpp.jpg) and [the ray of sunshine on Kageyama's face](http://i.imgur.com/pwvmrS6.jpg) lighting him up like the [love interest](http://i.imgur.com/59hg0tq.jpg) he really is (can we get any more obvious help my dirty fujoshi feelings are showing up).

But that OP tho I've missed the feel good vibe of Haikyuu's OPs they're just so inspirational and almost makes me want to go outside and play (emphasis on **almost**)

I love when Hinata snaps. [That face he makes](http://i.imgur.com/hkYtcYF.jpg) is precious and so is [Kagayama's proud smirk](http://i.imgur.com/LK8F0op.jpg) when he performs his [ridiculously high jump](http://i.imgur.com/LK8F0op.jpg). 

[Can't wait for Karasuno kick Shirotori's ass.](http://i.imgur.com/u9wmeYg.jpg)

I'd almost forgotten how much I love Shimizu.

This anime is too badass and there is no need for guns or explosions to do that. Sooo much hype and yandere Hinata face FTW!
>> ARTICLE
Best opening episode for me this season so far.

CAN'T CONTAIN... HYPE!!!!
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering what shows I would watch this season and completely forgot this was starting again. Easy addiction to the rotation.
>> ARTICLE
It's finally here! so excited about this new season! I just have to point out how amazing the soundtrack of this series is, the song playing while Hinata states they're gonna defeat Shiratorizawa is just perfect, all the bgm helps to set up the mood incredibly. I'm on board of the hype train!
>> ARTICLE
Hype thrusters are reaching capacity. I miss that cold stare that Hinata does when he gets serious. This is going to be a great season
>> ARTICLE
Best Anime.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't stop smiling and laughing through the entire episode, so many badass moments and characters introduced...definitely one of the best opening episodes of a second season.

The world building is incredible. I never would've expected this out of a sports anime until I watched Haikyuu.

Finishing moves in other anime: "the zone," "emperor eye," "rolling thunder," etc

Hinata and Tobio's: "the quick that goes like whoosh" and "the floaty one"

So much tension this episode, but at the same time... what utter dorks.
>> ARTICLE
MODAFUKIN ZONE !! Fucking love Kuroko no Basuke!!!
>> ARTICLE
Let's not forget the Direct Drive Zone.

I love Kuroko no Basuke, I really do, but seriously? A fucking gate?
>> ARTICLE
You love Kuroko no Basuke but have an issue with [KnB Spoiler](/s "the ultimate move emphasizing teamwork? That's, like, the name of the show.  What basketball does Kuroko play? The kind where his team means something to him.")  Seems you made it through over 70 episodes of a cheesy shounen only to be surprised that it was, in fact, a cheesy shounen.  I loved it, but I also realized what it was.
>> ARTICLE
I love how the other teams call it the freak quick but to them it is just the whoosh 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, this show has a rolling thunder as well! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXTJ6Fi5dKQ
>> ARTICLE
but the clip shows the move "rolling thunder again" which is far more stronger than the "rolling thunder"
>> ARTICLE
hehe, I included 'rolling thunder' above, so yea it's mainly just our strange duo that communicates in gyuuns and whatnot
>> ARTICLE
An episode full of emotions. Hinata's and Kageyama's arguments are both valid. Hinata needs to improve so he can become a better asset to the team, but as long as he can't make the play correctly, Kageyama can't toss the ball to him on real matches.

Also the scene where Hinata tries to steal the ball from Asahi was great, you could feel the tension surrounding Karasuno. 

This episode covered chapters 80, 81 and 82 (up to page 17) for those interested.
>> ARTICLE
Hey did you notice that when the Russian guy did the "read block" he touched Asahi's spike and yelled out loud "ONE TOUCH!!" and then they other guy said "Chance Ball" and passed it to the setter which Lev then spiked,right?

Isn't that 4 touches(3 is max right) ??
>> ARTICLE
Blocks don't count as hits. The most effective block is one that flies straight back into the opposing teams court. But a one touch is also good because it takes the pace off the ball. What would be a massive spike down would fly up, make an easy chance ball and easier setup for the next big hit.
>> ARTICLE
>Blocks don't count as hits.

Oh,thanks.Didn't know that.I thought 3 touches where it.
>> ARTICLE
Bloody stupid anime....why is this fight making me cry! DAMMIT!!!

They need to evolve, and when you evolve there are two ways to go, the selfish, or the selfless. It looks like we almost saw the Former and I'm curious to see the latter
>> ARTICLE
It's mainly the timeframe that's an issue too. With only a month left and Hinata's receives and serves the way they are...most people would agree that trying something so drastic could actually make it utterly unusable by the time the tournament rolls around
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama's right but so is Hinata in the sense that he (and the team too) need to evolve if they want to seriously compete. The way they are right now, they barely put up a fight in practice matches much less a tournament. It's only a matter of time before people learn to deal with their freak quicks which from this episode has already begun. 

Hinata might be overly ambitious right now but the rest of the team need to pick up on his ambitions and really use this month to develop new tactics and techniques in order to be ready for the tournament,
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu has better animated fights than most battle anime.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that fight made me really uncomfortable, everyone's ^supposed ^^to ^^^get ^^^^along.
>> ARTICLE
It was beautifully animated, which made it so much better.
>> ARTICLE
Better now than later, when things get super serious. 
>> ARTICLE
It felt so much like a real high school fight
>> ARTICLE
Yachi telling them to be friends :(
>> ARTICLE
Yeah just hearing in the background and running out, that hit me the hardest. 
>> ARTICLE
Gotta love a well done fight, where you can kinda see them losing control of what they're saying until they explode. It's realistic and hits you right in the feels. Shirobako has a good one between a production assistant and animation director where you can see their self-control just deteriorate until they start screaming.
>> ARTICLE
I remember it being a real punch in the gut when it was first illustrated in the manga but the accompanying music and delivery by the VAs absolutely took the experience to a whole other level.
>> ARTICLE
i agree. you can just feel the emotions in their voices, not to mention it was animated very well. i love that little detail where kags bounced a bit before attacking hinata. oh man, it just looked and felt so real.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think they could go better than the manga but god, Kageyama's VA hit the ball out of the park. So much emotion in his voice, and combined with the soundtrack, it was just damn
>> ARTICLE
There was actually almost no soundtrack in that scene (save for a few dramatic moments), which made it all the more intense as their raw emotion filled voices became the focus of sound instead. Really helped to create that uncomfortable and tense atmosphere.
>> ARTICLE
I was referring to the piano and guitar piece that started playing when Hinata and Kageyama started going at each other (~18:12) and the fact that it continued to be carried over when Hinata and Yachi were walking home.
>> ARTICLE
Ah yeah youre right, I just watched that back. The sudden music really highlights the breaking point of all that tension when Hinata charges at Kageyama. 
>> ARTICLE
The tension has been steadily building up for a while too, which just goes to show how well done this entire season is.
>> ARTICLE
Gaah, I remember reading these chapters, and seeing it animated is just... TT___TT

EDIT: NEXT WEEK'S GRANDPA UKAI WOOT WOOT SO FUCKING HYPED
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa next episode as well!!!
>> ARTICLE
Grandpa Ukai is my spirit animal, this is gonna be bomb
>> ARTICLE
old ukai is kreygasm 
>> ARTICLE
Seriously. He's so cool. TT--TT Also there's the extended Ukai family too! I mean, I'm assuming they were relatives. I'm looking forward to the other setters.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, between Hinata (subconsciously) trying to usurp Asahi, and the fight, that was quite the tense episode. Even so, you have to appreciate the quality animation that went into that fight scene.

I can only assume that Hinata will end up improving the freak quick to the point where he can keep his eyes open during it, but Kageyama's thoughts are valid that it could take a long time to get to that point and Hinata should probably just focus on improving serves, receives, and the normal quick in time for the spring tournament. Interested to see how the aftermath of their argument will pan out.

And in case anyone missed it, Hinata was crying [(see the tears?)](http://i.imgur.com/2Vy7MLF.png) as he biked home after the fight and after talking to Yachi about his relationship with Kageyama.

In the preview for next episode, I have no idea what the context of this scene will be but [OIKAWA MAKES AN APPEARANCE](http://i.imgur.com/bpwZ5LN.png). Be still, my heart.

Edit: Also, I just rewatched the fight scene (because it's so well done and I wanted to make myself cry or something???) and noticed the [attention](http://i.imgur.com/15mBsBH.png) to [detail](http://i.imgur.com/paBlQVC.png) in the reflections in the floor, something I've only ever actively noticed before in works by KyoAni (though I'm sure it's been done plenty in other studios' works, I just haven't noticed it as much there). The animation quality was *definitely* bumped up a notch between Haikyuu!! S1 and S2.

>> ARTICLE
I have never been so excited to see Oikawa as I am now lol
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap I've never noticed the high quality in the reflections. It's so nice to see the artists focus on just the little things, they could of gone with shadows but they really wanted that as a focal point
>> ARTICLE
>could have 

Could of is incorrect. As a Dutch person this mistake is very easily avoided because every word is translated and checked in my mind. "of" just won't make sense, other than sounding alike to " 've". But even then of has a very short o sound to it while the latter has a more uhf sound to it.

I find it fascinating how often this mistake is made. To the point I automatically suspect people to write it wrong in their sentences and it more often surprises me when people do it correctly. 
>> ARTICLE
As a fellow Dutchie, I find it easier to just say could've, makes the thought easier and it's  less likely to go wrong (for me at least).
>> ARTICLE
[Nooooo, don't cry, Yachi ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/389r3h1.jpg)

I really can't wait for more! [Scenes like this](http://i.imgur.com/pOIFv8I.jpg) get me so curious and hyped for what's about to come! I really want to know what happens >.<
>> ARTICLE
I love that picture but I couldn't help laughing when I saw Kageyama. It might have been cooler if he was sitting on the tree branch with his back turned, legs dangling and his head turned towards us. But I guess I get the symbolism of resembling a crow. He just looks a little silly to me.
>> ARTICLE
The feathers and squatting remind me of Niizuma Eiji from Bakuman.
>> ARTICLE
Standing (even squatting like Kageyama is in the picture) has a bigger impact in terms of portraying power than sitting does.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. When I saw this scene I interpreted as the King and the side kick. I felt chills after seeing that.

Slav squat is show of power

[Now in wallpaper size.](http://i.imgur.com/Ku3SPOr.jpg)

Question: how do you make something wallpaper size? Like a regular image
>> ARTICLE
It's not really anything like that. I just had the 1080p version of the episode and while having it full-screen, I took a screenshot.

EDIT: You can however use tools like [Waifu2x](http://waifu2x.udp.jp/) to make wallpapers out of regular images. Just enter the link of the image you would like and try upscaling it, either 1,6x or 2x.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for the dumb question but can it be made into a phone wallpaper? I already have a cycle of like 7 wallpapers that I really like but I need one for my phone
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what size that is, but you could try any of [these](http://imgur.com/a/uCyUN)
>> ARTICLE
I could feel a chill down my spine when Hinata tried to steal Asahi's toss. He's getting intense as hell. I think Kageyama is really angry at him because Hinata might be acting/thinking just like him when he started to aim for the top setter spot.

Yachi is still adorable.
>> ARTICLE
he became a Passive-aggressive little sh.t.
>> ARTICLE
He passive-aggressively collided mid-air with Asahi, passive-aggressively announced on the court that he was going to stop closing his eyes, then passive-aggressively launched himself at Kageyama shouting he wouldn't let go until he was tossed to. If that's his passive-aggressive, I can't wait to see what his aggressive is then
>> ARTICLE
Your definition of passive-aggressive is weird because physically throwing yourself at someone is anything but passive. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Hinata is 100% correct though. They are getting crushed by the other teams with how they are, so they need to do something, and what they currently are doing isn't enough. They rely on Hinata to be strong, but then they limit Hinatas strength/growth. That doesn't make sense.
>> ARTICLE
daang I didn't even think about kageyama seeing himself in Hinata, that definitely adds another level to their fight.
>> ARTICLE
God I love this anime so much
>> ARTICLE
It feels so weird to call a sports anime and Haikyuu of all things heavy but damn that episode really was. From the moment Hinata bumped into Asahi right in the beginning of the episode you could just feel the tension resonate as it just kept building and building leading up to that super uncomfortable fight between Hinata and Kageyama and it really didn't help to have that feeling related through Yachi who had to witness it all too. 

The shift we're getting in Hinata's character this season is really interesting. I love all the super intense stares and his classic 'well i'm just gonna jump really high and shock you', but it was Asahi basically saying I better sharpen up and watch my back or Hinata is gonna "eat me up" that really summed up for me his current development. 

Cant wait for the tournament and the moment Kageyama trusts in him as he blows everyone's socks off with a new move. 

>> ARTICLE
Holy shit this episode is beautiful in a way I really did not expect from Haikyuu. The tension this week was the most oppressive I've seen since the Tokyo Ghoul S1 finale. And goddamn as much as I love Kageyama he's being an absolute ass of a utilitarian to someone who should be his *friend*. 

There's a lot more I wanna say but my thoughts are still a jumble right now. Apparently Hinata's character arc is, uh, somewhat controversial with manga-readers, but I am hella excited because he's my baby.
>> ARTICLE
why is his arc considered controversial? 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know the specifics, but a few of my friends who read the manga said this is when they "started to hate Hinata". (Which is completely baffling to me because Hinata is precious and needs to be hugged.)
>> ARTICLE
O_o because he's being greedy maybe? but he's also actual literal sunshine howww
>> ARTICLE
I guess because he's creating so much drama? But he's *right* and Kageyama especially is being way more selfish than Hinata right now.
>> ARTICLE
But *is* he right? I mean, I understand the drive to improve oneself as much as anyone, but the spring tournament is approaching and I can completely see Kageyama's point. If this were anything but a sports anime where players evolve freakishly fast, I wouldn't think it realistic for Hinata to improve so much in such a short period of time. They're both being selfish. 
>> ARTICLE
As it is, their options are basically: do the Same Old Thing (and we know how well *that* worked), or to try something new. I'm still baffled as to why everyone was so opposed to Hinata trying something new at a *training camp* of all places. If ever there was a place to try a new tactic, that's it. 

He's also right that Kageyama's still stuck in his old way of thinking. Karasuno's victories and losses are all in terms of *him*, in his mind. He thinks of how to *use* his teammates as a setter, instead of how to work *with* them. As things stand, Hinata only matters insofar as Kageyama can make use of him; if their quick doesn't work (and as we've seen, it's not difficult for exceptional athletes to deal with it), then Hinata becomes useless. 

The entire rest of the team are so focused on maintaining the status quo (which Hinata is trying to upset), that they can't see the bigger picture. Which is why I'm starting to think that the third years staying on the team is actually holding them back. Nekoma's coach mentioned that it takes a certain amount of greed to be an ace -- to even want to *be* an ace. With Asahi, I don't think Karasuno is actually used to having an *actual* ace. He didn't want to be an ace, it just got pushed onto him by circumstance. 

But Hinata wants it. He wants to fight to the last second to let his team win (which he can't do if he's only a tool for Kageyama's tosses). And he's willing to stand up to the rest of his team to make it happen.
>> ARTICLE
They all have good reasons. Kageyama summarized his points quite clearly:

1. From the way they see it, there's only a small chance Hinata can even do what he claims he wants to do, much less with just a month to go. And if it ain't broke, don't mess with it. If they're still in midst of revising it by the time the tournament comes around, even their original quick that they'd perfected could be useless if Hinata's still flailing about. Then the whole quality and balance of the team would be brought down. This uncertainty probably plays a bit on kageyama's insecurities too, given his middle school experience.

2. Hinata has a LOT of other things he can work on. Like kenma said last episode, he really sucks at almost all the basics. Today we saw he couldn't even do a single flying leap, which would really help with his receives. Those skills can't possibly get worse than they already are, and if he got better at them, he'd be able to provide tremendous support to the team and stop losing points on serves.
>> ARTICLE
> And if it ain't broke, don't mess with it.

But it *is* broken, and nobody else realizes it. This week, Lev was able to block it in a single set. How long will it last against Shiratorizawa? Nekoma's coach said it, too: will playing it safe really let them progress? 
>> ARTICLE
Yea, I mean I absolutely agree with Hinata, but when the options are possibly split between falling apart long before they can play Shiratorizawa vs not beating shiratorizawa, I can see why the team would choose the safer, less riskier, route
>> ARTICLE
I came here for volleyball hype not for the feels goddammit T_T, now i'm gonna be sad all week till next episode

Edit: Russians sure enjoy dividing a ~~country~~ team
>> ARTICLE
There's always the manga, it's amazing :) 


>> ARTICLE
Geez this was an intense episode, it's one character but I love how much Yachi adds to the show. Even though the main focus of the fight was Kageyama and Hinata I found her part was the one to make me the most emotional. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I can relate to her well, because I'm a third wheel most of the time when me and my friends that are dating go hang out so when they get into a fight I feel basically the same as Yachi in this episode (though I can't go call for help :'c)
>> ARTICLE
Dang. That fight I knew it was coming but ouch :(. Also Hinata jumping into Asahi, jesus christ.

Edit: Also want to say the animation for that fight was awesome.

You want many friends

who loves Haikyuu just like you?

You can count me in!

:D nice
>> ARTICLE
Haha we should start a Haikyuu group to watch the show together every week or something.  I did that with Breaking Bad back in the day, just a group of friends from all over the country met online via Mumble to watch the show together and discuss it afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
I would totally join in on this.
>> ARTICLE
That sounds awesome, should we post something on this sub?
>> ARTICLE
I was looking forward to the fight scene (having read the manga), but, Jesus *Christ* did I not expect that animation quality. Kageyama skid-stopping as Hinata plows into him, grabbing Hinata and then pushing him away, but *especially* Kageyama bounce-stepping/keeping on his toes as he braces for Hinata's rebound. The little details and effort like that helped make the fight natural and fucking fantastic to watch. 

I mean, Haikyuu!! is pretty consistent with having really fluid and high-quality animation, but this scene--this scene was incredible. It exemplifies the high animation standards Haikyuu!! has and surpasses them at the same time. 


>> ARTICLE
i know it was a sad scene but man, it was my favorite to watch in this episode precisely for those details you've mentioned (plus the VA's performances!).
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't expecting that fight at all... and it was pretty intense. Jeez.

looking forward to Hinata's and Kageyama's improved freakquick animated but bootcamp 2.0 is where this seasons's real fun starts.

that was hard to watch. watching 2 friends fight.

this show is so fucking good. i cant ever get enough.

When Hinata was in mid flight about to collide with Asahi I couldnt help but feel so awk . Love this build up though, if they can make it through this they will be stronger than ever.

Why. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. Damn, I can't stand seeing Hinata suffering. Can't wait to see how they'll improve!



~~Also I hope my ship get well soon~~

Fuuuuck, that fight hit deep.  

QQ

There were some really great shots from this ep including the fight scene.

I really didnt expect that. Im not a manga reader. That fight was difficult to watch and I was afraid someone would get hurt. That tension was really well done.

Hypekyuu strikes again. It was hard to see Hinata and Kageyama fighting, but this can only make them stronger.

And Yachi continues to be adorable. Her sleeping face on the bus was perfectly derpy.

That fight scene was amazing.

Is this like the feels weekend? First Noragami, now Haikyu!!. I'm not used to being this emotional during animes. Funnily enough they are both second seasons too.

Oh my lord its stupid how good this show is. Its so hype yet so sad, haikyuu is just toying with my emotions at every corner yet i keep coming back for more!

Check your pms.

Thanks bby
>> ARTICLE
This season seems to be focusing only on growth. Whilst other anime chooses battlegrounds as the sudden growth catalyst, Haikyuu seems to be opting for a more normal path. 

It certainly is entertaining though, I really liked 'Hinata' going into sort of zone. It kinda portrays being in zone is useless if it takes you out of sync with the team or you yourself are not ready to be in zone.  

I could really relate with Hinata as an engineering student. There are times, when you are so very motivated but you still keep on failing irrespective of your efforts.  
>> ARTICLE
Where is this in terms of the manga? I've just convinced myself to read it. Or should I start from the beginning?

And where should I read it?
>> ARTICLE
Chapter ~~78~~ 80/82

Read it here: http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/haikyuu-r1873

No need to start from the beginning. There were a few minor (like really minor) scenes missing or done slightly different but they are of no importance
>> ARTICLE
Every time an episode ends I get the urge to read the manga, but I don't want to spoil it for myself. I will probably read once the season ends, but its soo tempting to find out what happens next.

Yeah my bad. Forgot it, 78 was the last episode. Sorry!

Wonderful episode.  Can't wait to see what Hinata decides to do.  He's definitely causing the rift right now but I also enjoy seeing him struggle and wanting to grow no matter how greedy it is.

That was a really REALLY GOOD episode

Im glad I stayed up instead of going to sleep in order to watch it, the problem is that now Im so hyped it will take me some time to sleep :") but its totally worth it of course
>> ARTICLE
The conflict between Hinata and Kageyama was really well done. I could feel my stomach churning from the emotions caused by the tense atmosphere.
>> ARTICLE
I really thought their teacher was the Little Giant 
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit that would be awesome.

But neesan would have recognised since she knew the little giant. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I noticed the age difference too; hopes were crushed :(
>> ARTICLE
I've got a theory that the Little Giant is the teacher's younger brother.
>> ARTICLE
the coach really dropped the ball on this one. he's actually the one who lead to all this fighting. had he realized the potential and had the courage to help hinata pursue his ambition, they wouldn't be fighting in the first place. due to his lack of experience as a coach, where the players are suppose to look to him as a pillar for guidance, instead, they are left fractured. i hope coach ukai really steps it up next episode. i'd rather see the team crash and burn in pursue of their potential than stable and weak. there's nothing worse than when management is afraid to change and unwilling to take risk because they feel they're better off with the status quo.
>> ARTICLE
that scene made me cry and shout into the screen. 
>> ARTICLE
finally it's animated! damn, you can really feel the tension here. i'm excited for what's to come next. 

i also love how hinata is the baby crow even in canon. baby crow needs to spread his wings and fly, kagayama! come on!
>> ARTICLE
thank god the season's 25 episodes long
>> ARTICLE
In awe of this episode; I really understand Hinata and I think he is correct. The OP is so good too lol

[Nekoma's other coach](http://i.imgur.com/fy5sTVX.png) is down for the count. In his character profile his current concern is that he's been told that he's "worse with alcohol than he looks" and Nekomata's current concern is when he goes out drinking with Naoi he gets smashed too quickly so it's no fun.

[This shot of them on the bus](http://i.imgur.com/dHcx46j.png) reminds me of back in season 1 when they were all sleeping on the bus AND HAPPY. I just want them to sit together damn it. Also SOMEONE SIT WITH ASAHI YOU MONSTERS

I am really glad that Yachi didn't try to get in the middle of their fight and physically stop them she could have gotten hurt. Instead she did the smart thing and ran and got someone else.

Man this episode was quite good.

Anyone knows the name of the OST that started in the beginning when the coach was talking to the players?

I just can't get over this anime. The feels are real. I love all those characters so much and to see the fighting makes its tough, but its these kind of character building episodes that help make the show so much more worth while and amazing.

my babies ;__;; such tense fighting;;; looking forward to see how it pans out (hoping it's win win ...orz)

Came across a video that showed Hinata doing the open eye spike. Basically they showed it in season 1 in the practice match against aoba josai like hinata said in this episode.

Whats the theme song that starts the episode off?
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Haikyuu season one some time ago but I dropped it after a few episodes... It just didn't interest me as much as other Sport anime like Hajime No Ippo and Kuroko No Basuke. Is it worth giving another try? 
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu I think you really need to stick with until after the practice matches & gets into the actual competitions. That's when things settle. I think the beginning can be a bit meh to some people because there's so much set up at that point, but it definitely picks up a lot. It also has a lot of elements that I think were lacking in KnB.

During the first season, it was tied with KnB for me. With the second season it's greatly taken over as my number 1 anime. 
>> ARTICLE
yes. watched knb after watching haikyuu, although it was fun and i enjoyed it a lot, too, i would prefer haikyuu over knb any time.
>> ARTICLE
I love all 3 shows listed; in fact, I rank Haikyuu over Kuroko
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu isn't as flashy as Kuroko is, but the characters and plot/development are a lot better I think (coming from someone who really likes both shows).  It depends on what you're looking for, but especially given how intense the latest episode was I'd definitely give it another try.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, boner.
>> ARTICLE
YAMAGUCHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
>> ARTICLE
OH MY GOD. Is it next Saturday yet? *Is it Saturday??*
>> ARTICLE
So I've absolutely blitzed this show in the past few days - it's incredible. Very impressed. 

YAMAGUCHI, NICE SERVE!
>> ARTICLE
OMG! Oikawa and Mad Dog were so intense. I hope that Daiichi and Nishinoya manages to received those bone breaking serves.

And to think that there is a more powerful spiker than Mad Dog-chan.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu has consistenly been the anime I look forward to most each week, hopefully there will be a third season after the manga has had time to progress a bit further.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the studio keeps doing a better and better job of animating the manga. I can't wait to see what else they do with the rest of the episodes
>> ARTICLE
That Yamaguchi hype at the end. Can't wait for next week!
>> ARTICLE
This match is better than any match from Kuroko no Basket. It's just awesome. Yamaguchi is my favorite side character and I'm happy that he will play in the next episode. Mad Dog is great character, Seijoh needed someone like that. 
>> ARTICLE
And this is simply the semis for the Prefecture qualifier. What will happen in the finals if they reach it?
>> ARTICLE
Man Mad Dog-chan is pretty awesome.  Crazy good episode as usual though.  
>> ARTICLE
i just loved it when sugamama came in and changed it up! even if it was just for a short while. it was a nice change.
>> ARTICLE
It's really nice when (side/other) characters get the spotlight. 
>> ARTICLE
These past couple episodes have left me so drained after they're over, I'm so anxious whether or not Karasuno is actually going to win!
>> ARTICLE
I think Tadashi Yamaguchi is one of the most famous character in Haikyuu. He is not blesssed with so much speed, athleticism, vertical leap and strength, but that doesn't stop him to play the sport that he loves, that's why almost everyone can relate to him more than the other (gifted) characters. (Spoiler: That last scene was one of the best I've ever seen in this anime)
>> ARTICLE
That last scene was really *really* good, yeah.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who wants Karasuno to win but thinks that Mad Dog is really awesome? :D

>> ARTICLE
Mad Dog is crazy dude, just shoving away the spiker and steals it for himself... Truly mad
>> ARTICLE
He's so damn powerful which makes him pretty awesome :D
>> ARTICLE
Only reason people say he can be awesome it's because he's on Haikyuu and a fictional character. I play sports and having a guy like him in a team is frustrating to no end!
>> ARTICLE
I know, but I have a guy on my team which is pretty nice but he spikes just as powerful. Though his hair is not that cool :D

>> ARTICLE
It would be funny if Karasuno lost. I would rate this anime 10/10 instantly for being unpredictable.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I dislike about most animes that you already know what's going to happen
>> ARTICLE
Can someone get me a GIF of that last moment when Ukai's talking to Yamaguchi
>> ARTICLE
What was the violin song used near the end? It occurs around 21:12 - 22:10. I've been looking everywhere for that song but I can't find it in the OST list... Help :(
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was a contrabass, not a violin. Or something, whatever. I'm interested in this as well. This OST keeps bugging me because it sounds so familiar, similar to a Three Days Grace or some other band's song, but I can't figure it out.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds more like a cello to me. Unfortunately, I haven't listened to the OST yet. I don't really even know if it has been released. Has been used brilliantly in this show though. Makes it *super* intense and adds a lot to some of the best moments.
>> ARTICLE
Late, but since the OST just came out we now have an answer! :D

It's '[/Confrontation With The King](https://youtu.be/GpOz4a9v3mQ?t=264)'. 4:24 if the video doesn't automatically start at that time.

I'm not sure if this has been addressed before but can someone tell me why Iwaizumi is not Seijoh's captain? He clearly is more respected by all including Oikawa, the captain himself and the loose cannon, Mad-dog-chan.
>> ARTICLE
At the end of the day, Oikawa is the one that brings the most out of the team and got them to this point.
>> ARTICLE
Iwaizumi keeps the team together, but Oikawa leads it. Both of them are pretty important to having it work well, but serve in different roles.
>> ARTICLE
The double setter play was awesome, was a shame we didn't see more of it.

Yamaguchi HYPE!
>> ARTICLE
[manga spoiler](/s "The match against Shiratorizawa will feature at least one more double setter play, feat. Sugamama.")
>> ARTICLE
There is not enough capitalization in the universe to capture the intensity if hype I feel waiting for next week.

I knew as soon as coach started saying "Oh shut up already, I know." what was coming. It didn't even need to cut to Yamaguchi.

This show just keeps getting better and better. The two-setters/five-spikers blew my mind. The music was phenomenal as always. I felt like there were greater amounts of the really fluid motion shots that I love. My only possible critique is that some of Mad Dog-chan's spikes are beginning to fray into DBZ-sports territory. 

Is it next Saturday yet?
>> ARTICLE
So I'm thinking about starting this show. I don't really know anything about it so I just want to ask about why it's so highly regarded? Is it like Kuroko? 
>> ARTICLE
It's like Kuroko if Kuroko had good writing and interesting characters
>> ARTICLE
I thought Kuroko was pretty good. If it doesn't even match Haikyuu then I'll probably enjoy it a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
They're acutally both made by production IG. So animation and music wise, you know they're both going to be strong. But where Haikyuu excels really is maintaining hype (its moniker is 'hypeku') but with greater focus on the characters and more comedic moments. Nothing is revolutionary in terms of sports anime persay, but it does everything so well you don't even have to give a shit about volleyball to enjoy the show. In fact, they do characters so well, chances are you'll have have more than a few favorite characters that aren't even on the main sports team

>> ARTICLE
Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I encourage you to try it out (from the first season of course) and form your own opinion, but here's my two cents (i.e rant).

Haikyuu is by far my favourite sports anime of all time. If I were rating shows out of enjoyment, it would be my #1 favourite on MAL. Haikyuu takes everything exaggerated in Kuroko and does it to a lesser degree, making the plays a lot more believable, while maintaining a similar atmosphere. You won't find moves that have names attached to them in this show. 

Haikyuu has MUCH more fleshed out characters, making you sympathize much more with each team they play against, and the relationships between each character are just amazingly well done. You'll see stuff like one of the main characters fooling around with the enemy spiker because they share the interest towards their beautiful manager. People blocking the back of their heads when a lousy server is behind them. Enemy teams getting pumped up for their final match after 3 years of training, and losing. Opposing teams laughing and practicing together outside of matches. 

Of course the main characters have much much greater depth than the other teams, and I really want to say how so but it'll be spoilers... Anyway, the main characters are all brilliant. Sorry but that's all I can leave it at.

And btw, I don't think there's been a single episode of filler yet.

The greatest trait about it though is it's absolutely hilarious when it wants to be, and absolutely serious and tense when it wants to be, and does both perfectly.

It's leagues above Kuroko. Realistic plays and strategy, not a single poorly written or hateable character on any team, amazing animation.

Kuroko is DBZ characters playing basketball. Haikyuu is talented high school kids playing volleyball.
>> ARTICLE
> Kuroko is DBZ characters playing basketball

Yeah you're pretty much [correct](https://my.mixtape.moe/ewfvqi.webm)

For real though, I enjoy Kuroko and I think it's a very entertaining show... but it's also kind of insane at times. Which, on the whole, actually works in its favor - it's not like it ever presents itself as anything realistic.
>> ARTICLE
Talented high school kids that act like 4th graders.

I'm actually gonna be really sad if Karasuno wins this set because we won't get any more Oikawa :(
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa was crazy this game lol, it feels like Seijoh is going to win this game doe!
>> ARTICLE
And we're back at square one where the third years already graduate. Nice.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Oikawa is my favorite character, would be a shame to not see him anymore.
>> ARTICLE
^(also Iwaizumi)
>> ARTICLE
Manga readers, if there is a next match after this, will they have the time to animate it. 
>> ARTICLE
no not enough time. let's just say that no matter how this match ends, people are going to have a hard time NOT reading the manga after this season ends. Because given the source material, it'll likely be another 1-1.5 years before season 3.
>> ARTICLE
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Yea its really sad, I'm up to date on the english translations and I'll say there's only about another 8-10 eps worth of content after this season.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's the weird part about it, if they make another season. The Finals for this tournament would be overshadowed by the Nationals arc. The finals for this tournament should have been the ending of this season somehow (not possible if they skip shit). The seijoh vs. Karasuno game is hype af doe and deserves to be the season ender but I feel like The finals is just as hype or even more hype.
>> ARTICLE
You might want to spoiler tag. But I do agree, since they're sticking to a 25 episode season the arc doesn't really fit properly.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, there's at least half a season worth of material.
>> ARTICLE
Including stuff that's untranslated? Either way, with the pacing of the manga there's still at least a year until there's enough for another 25 ep season.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with a year. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey hey hey! It's better to wait than seeing the whole show ruined by fillers, isn't it? 
>> ARTICLE
Ya I suppose...but first one punch man and now this!?! I hate waiting damn it 
>> ARTICLE
nope. there's not even enough for a third season yet actually. 
>> ARTICLE
Let me put it this way. The Seijoh match last season took like, 6 episodes. This one should be similar, but it looks like they could wrap it up in 5, and let episode 25 be a season 3 setup.

The match after this will take 10+ episodes at their current pacing.
>> ARTICLE
I have a good feeling it might be a movie. 
>> ARTICLE
That's what I've been thinking. There are a lot of chapters in that match, but I think you run the risk of burning out your audience if every week is a midgame cliffhanger. Making it a movie, and condensing it a bit would help a lot, then we could start season 3 without there feeling like too much of a wait.
>> ARTICLE
Anime only viewers are gonna have to read the next match because that was such a doozy. 
>> ARTICLE
Yup.
>> ARTICLE
Probably a 3 part movie. [Manga spoilers](/s "The finals took 5 grueling sets before it was concluded. If the final scene of this season ends with Karasuno stepping on the court for the finals match then it will be a movie. And season 3 will start with their preparation for the Nationals after 2 years or so.")

this episode was so fkin hype i havent felt like this since saitama vs boros fight

Reading that fight was the ultimate hype. The the manga artist in charge of that, has to be by far the best artists of action shots I have ever seen. And that is coming from an artist. 
>> ARTICLE
which one u mean
>> ARTICLE
not sure if sarcasm but the remake. Not even sure if you can classify original as manga, maybe mangapasta. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they might be been asking whether or not you were talking about Haikyuu's or OPM's manga artist.

eyeshield 21 is a sports manga and it was previously done by Murata the one who draws the redone version of opm, its really fucking good too
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa reminded me of Johan Liebert a lot this Episode.
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa reminded me of Hisoka from HunterxHunter ever since he debuted. It's not just his voice, but also his expressions.
>> ARTICLE
I got started on this show back in Season 1 thinking I was just going to get an exciting volleyball anime and now here I am practically crying every episode and praying every player on Karasuno can achieve their dreams. If Yamaguchi doesn't wind up proud of himself after next episode I don't know if my heart can go on.
>> ARTICLE
i have a new favourite character for this season the mad dog is so badass
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure everyone will be loving this match so far. I think one thing the anime did better from my recollection of the manga so far is the integration of mad dog boy into team Aoba Josai. At least from my memory of the manga, the mad dog kid kinda came out of nowhere and felt more like a ringer for Aoba Josai than a real member of the team. 

Like, he's not that likable as a character, at least for me, and he was randomly spawned into the story as if he always was a part of the Aoba Josai team, and seemed like a cheap attempt at bringing in a new hurdle for the Aoba Josai team to face Karasuno against. These reasons were why I didn't like mad dog boy when I read about him in the manga.

However, in the anime from what I just saw, they integrated him really well into the team. Like I said, this could just be from poor memory because its been awhile since I read this part of the manga, but I don't remember from the manga making a huge point that the anime does about how Aoba Josai/Oikawa are a team that bring out the best in their players. This properly explains why they're able to use Mad dog kid. He's so unpredictable, that unless you have a team that can cater to his playstyle, he would more likely be a hindrance than anything positive, but Aoba Josai is capable of handling that struggle, and the anime, this episode does a good job to get that point across. So I think it works here really well. The hype shots of his spikes also bring out a huge impact of his presence in the match.

Besides that numerous other opportunities of hype, along with serve mistakes, along with super cannonball serves, along with people excited for Yamaguchi. He rarely shows serious expressions like that, but you gotta figure now... it... is... ON.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure the point of adding kyotani is so he can feel out of place, though
>> ARTICLE
Rather than having Kyotani feel out of place, we can say that the point of adding Kyotani is to throw off Karasuno because Karasuno are so in-sync with Aobajohsai that Seijou is having trouble getting ahead.
>> ARTICLE
The music in this episode was top notch, it really helped build the tension. Overall another great episode in the series!
>> ARTICLE
Awesome match, the pinnacle of 2 seasons!!
>> ARTICLE
I'm really happy to see Oikawa's "tactician" side in anime.
>> ARTICLE
This has to be one of the best episodes of Haikyuu!! till now. I could actually feel the tension during the match and the power of Kyotani (Mad Dog) with each spike. And damn, that ending! Yamaguchi is finally ready to show off his serve! Can't wait until next episode.

Edit: I forgot to mention how amazing the soundtrack was.
>> ARTICLE
> This has to be one of the best episodes of Haikyuu!! till now

me every episode
>> ARTICLE
Unleash Yamaguchi 
>> ARTICLE
Music was so on point this episode. Anybody else catch the track that went on during Oikawa's second serve after the perfect toss ace? The one he hits the net on.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit that Mad Dog's serve! It has the intensity of Oikawa's ultimate serve. Also super glad that we can see Suga played in this match. It fits what the coach was thinking in the previous match of Karasuno and Seijoh, that they can use two setters in one match. Not to mention Suga is pretty calculative player. Something that lacks on Karasuno if we compare it with an overwhelming calculative Oikawa. 


But god dammit, I'm so hyped for Yamaguchi in the next episode! Karasuno stil has a deadly weapon. I love how they keep using metaphor that Mad Dog is the double edge sword as Seijoh's weapon. But Karasuno also has weapon that has been polished for a while. Definitely different kind and probably opposite side of double edge sword, but hopefully as deadly. 


Now how am I supposed to wait until next week? 
>> ARTICLE
Funny you should talk about Yamaguchi that way! In a bunch of the promotional materials for the manga, he's depicted holding a giant spear. http://imgur.com/99qJroJ

So you're totally spot on with your description, Hahha.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, even though I read the manga, I totally forgot about this cover. If I'm not mistaken, Tsukki's promotional material holds shield, right? Which also totally amazing considering his skill in blocking


>> ARTICLE
Yeah absolutely! So it sort of all ties in to that thing with Yamaguchi taking really keen interest in the idea of 'Serve and Block' during the Tokyo away games arc. Yamaguchi the spear with his serves. Tsukki the shield with his blocks. It's really well thought out.

There's also some official sketches showing Tsukki holding the spear and asking Yamaguchi if he can borrow it because it looks cooler. Yamaguchi of course agrees because it's Tsukki, lol.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah. I remember the scene when Yamaguchi watched match of two Tokyo high schools and they use incredible serves and blocks. Oh wow, to think these parallels makes me appreciate the writing even more. I also remember that in anime, when Ukai brought neighborhood team, Shimada san actually gave the ball to Yamaguchi on his first scene there. What a neat parallel. 

Really? There are official sketches on tsukki and yama talking about spear and blocking? That's so cute! I wonder whether you can link them to me?

Yamaguchi wants in! Seijou is the wall that he needs to break down, I'm excited to see all that hard work pay off.  

This reminds me of Azumane having to overcome the Iron Wall of Datekou, and this show loves to pit characters against their failings/regrets. This show gets my hyped, I'm glad I caught up!

Don't know if they did this on purpose, but I remember the 21st episode of the 1st season actually opened with Karasuno switching out Kageyama for Suga under less happy circumstances while playing Seijoh. And now Suga set up an awesome shot for Kageyama to spike. What a great way to show how far they've both come!

Yamaguchi at the end got me so fucking hyped!

[Been waiting for Yamaguchi to shine for too long!](http://i.imgur.com/Bf7FDo4.jpg) Really hope he gets a good chance next episode and uses it!

[Reactions](http://i.imgur.com/YXaHDx3.jpg) this episode were [great](http://i.imgur.com/Qebv7mx.jpg), as usual...not just the players' but [Yachi and Saeko](http://i.imgur.com/hSw7Z3Q.jpg), too! 

I have to admit I really liked [Suga's tactics](http://i.imgur.com/6sx7rVa.jpg) even though they didn't last long. That two setter scene with Kageyama spiking was great as well.

[Oikawa](http://i.imgur.com/3Jb1guo.jpg) had some crazy serves once again and I really like how he can manage what the whole team is thinking, not to mention his [various faces](http://i.imgur.com/hs3wYjC.jpg).

I feel like Karasuno would benefit more if they use a multi-setter system more. Isn't that how National teams play?

Oikawa might might be the best setter in Haikyuu but I think Kageyama is a better volleyball player overall.

I think it's actually the other way around. Oikawa admits he can never match Kageyama's setting skills, but Oikawa is able to bring the best out of his team

Oh man you're right about everyone being a wild card. I genuinely have no idea about what's coming next and all I feel is hype
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh man I love seeing Suga in matches. He so smart. These are the best kinds of episodes - ones that take us away from 'Hinata and Kageyama will save the day' and give us a look at someone else for a while.

And that last rising shot on Yamaguchi was pure, concentrated hype. WHY isn't it next week yet?
>> ARTICLE
I know this gets said a lot, but the reason why I love Haikyuu so damn much is the amount of focus we have on other characters and other teams. Like, 4 out of my 5 top characters aren't even *in* Karasuno. 

I just want the whole manga adapted already dammit

LETS GO BOYS [SPOILER](/s "Yamaguchi HYPE")

Can't wait to see it animated!

Is this really a spoiler? It seems pretty obvious that he's gonna play a big role in finishing this before the 3rd set
>> ARTICLE
Just put it in there to be sure. Didn't want to rustle anyone's jimmies.
>> ARTICLE
so all these weeks when you manga readers have been saying [SPOILER](/s "Yamaguchi is gonna get his chance to shine") you've been talking about next episode? 

I can't wait. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually think I might cry during next episode, lets wait and see
>> ARTICLE
Yep! Seriously, it'll probably be the most hype bit of the anime yet. Just from seeing that last shot of Yamaguchi rise up, I can tell Production I.G are going to make it amazing.
>> ARTICLE
What I will never fully understand is how teammates would yell "Nice Serve" right before the guy tosses up the ball, or during it. I would hate it as a player when I'm trying to concentrate and my teammates are screaming at me.

It's like icing your own player at the free throw line in basketball. I wouldn't want people screaming "Nice Shot!" right before I shoot the ball. I can understand *after* it, or even after they miss. But before it, my personal preference is to keep quiet and let the guy concentrate.

***

Regarding the actual episode...man, what a thriller. I just love how Haikyuu will still animate quick montage scenes, even if it's the small fluttering of clothes. Other anime should take more notice. Even tiny movements and looping them would make still screens that much more watchable.

And how all the events connect so well to each other. Like when Karasuno faked the spike, Oikawa saved it, right back to a Seijou spike. That scene and the transitions were so smooth I had to watch it twice. Couldn't even wait 'til the end of the episode. I rewinded it and watched it again.
>> ARTICLE
It's an endearing shout

Kinda like (/add oil) or (fighting!/hwaiting!/!)
Also Eastern Asian culture is different when it comes to encouragement
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I mean, I get that. It's supposed to be something like, "You can do it!" or a "You can do a nice serve!" kinda encouragement.

...Which I sorta understand it, but I'll never *fully* understand it.

My sister teaches in Japan. I went back and saw a basketball practice, but everything (including their and Haikyuu's shouts) seems so mechanical, like a routine to say it.

And I know things are different. But it's just something I'll never fully understand.
>> ARTICLE
We have the same things in English. It's just that the languages are so different that things that roll off the tongue are much different in each language.

If you go onto any sports court you'll hear the same sort of thing thing, but because it seems natural we miss how much it is mechanical.
>> ARTICLE
Is it a volleyball thing? Because I've never seen or heard this happen in baseball, soccer, football, basketball, hockey, tennis, or any other sport I played back when I was in school.

Or has times changed so much that this is now "old school"?
>> ARTICLE
> I would hate it as a player when I'm trying to concentrate and my teammates are screaming at me.

And if something so simple breaks your concentration you're probably not cut out to be an athlete :>
>> ARTICLE
That's what people always say, but it's not that simple. You can filter out crowd noise. You can even filter out opponent noise. It's hard to filter out teammates' noise.

And it's not like it's going to fail 100% of the time it's done to you. But as an athlete, you want to be put in the best situation you can be in, which is when you can fully concentrate. It's not as simple as "if you can't do it, don't do it." It's more "I can do it, but don't make it any harder for me to do it."
>> ARTICLE
Dunno why you got downvoted, as that's pretty common even in professional sorts.  In MLB home fans usually cheer and shout when the opposing pitcher is going to rattle them, and are quiet when their own is pitching.  Same with pro football; quiet when your team is on offense so they can communicate, and loud on defense so your opponent can't do the same.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's episode 21, so any kind of negative opinion is more prone to get downvotes, I guess? Idk, I'm not really complaining about it. Downvotes will happen at times. I just thought, from an athlete's perspective, that "Nice Serve" was something that could actually hurt the performance of the server, since it *could* break concentration (not saying it will).

In my free throw example, players will [deliberately try to break your concentration](https://streamable.com/q3cz) with the most simplest acts. A player named Chris Paul literally [screamed at his own teammate](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2430503-chris-paul-at-a-crossroads) for taking too much time. People say, "well, if your concentration breaks that easily, maybe you shouldn't be an athlete," but it's *because* concentration for *anyone* breaks so easily, teammates should keep quiet and let them concentrate. You want to put them in the most optimal situation to succeed.

...is what I learned through personal experience and in sports psych. Obviously different for Japan.

In the manga I actually found Shiratoriza (spelling?) not very likable.
>> ARTICLE
Shiratorizawa. They are probably set to be the opposite of Karasuno, since even the name reflects that. Shira (shiro) means white, and tori means bird, shiratori is a swan. And anyway, they are set up to be the big bad guys, so we can't build nice characters to be the big bad guys before they are defeated or in the process of being defeated.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that makes sense. Like I don't hate them, I just don't like them.
>> ARTICLE
It is one of the things I really like about it. These are kids playing high school sports. Very few of them are going to be unholy monsters dedicated to sadism and war crimes. They are students trying to be the (very) best (like no one ever was). The Ravens are our protagonists, but every character from every team is "the good guy." Well, for the most part.

Hajime No Ippo also did this well a lot of the time. Most of Ippo's opponents were more likable than Ippo's gym buddies.

[We all did, Coach-san. We all did.](http://i.imgur.com/ea22YkE.png)

Man, seeing the manager leave with the co-manager crying on the tribune.... one day Kiyoko will leave too, and then it's gonna be Yachi shedding that tear.

Also, it's very small, but it took way too long to see Asahi again. They hyped him up as the unstoppable spiker in the beginning, but he didn't really get any screentime, or moments that made him feel important to the team.
>> ARTICLE
Remember they still havent versed the big giants of their area. Those games will be really long (i mean i expect them to  atleast verse Aoba this tournament) and then we will see every character get its moment
>> ARTICLE
Even against the big giants, I feel like Asahi and Tanaka are "useless" once they face a giant wall or a strong receiver. 

Daichi is... a pretty well-balanced, but also average player. His qualities come from being a good captain, not a good player. 

Tsukishima is good, no question. Nishinoya is 50-50, sometimes the savior of the game, sometimes just a bystander.

And Kageyama and Hinata are just solo-carrying Karasuno most of the time, really.

...that's 50% of Karasuno that I would consider "really good" players (atleast by the standards at which they are playing at), excluding those that warm the bench like Yamaguchi.
>> ARTICLE
Has anyone actually stopped Tanaka yet? From what I gather, he's a hothead who really relies on momentum. If he gets fired up and into it, he's practically unblockable, but otherwise he's just an average player.

Asahi is primarily used as the strong hitter from the back. He doesn't get as many up front spikes, so the power is a little lost, but he's the only one with the power to do a good back attack. On top of that, they need to use Hinata a lot so the other team focuses in on him. That's when the rest of the spikers get to shine. They literally call Hinata "the best decoy".

And Daichi is extremely balanced, but definitely one of the best receivers in the group. They've shown that where everyone else on the team can't receive certain hits or serves, Nishinoya and Daichi are the only ones who can. On top of that, Daichi gets in some spikes and is a solid blocker. He's the backbone of the team.
>> ARTICLE
Noya has been repeatedly mentioned as one of the best liberos at that age (and the best in middle school). And the whole point of Daichi is that he's the most fundamentally sound out of all of them. He's up there in skill.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but the show made it a point this season to portray the older years getting better. Those will come to show in the big matches. Asahi's serve, Nishinoya's setting, Tanaka's....something. Daichi is a well balanced average player, but its his leadership that matters the most. He is always there with the defense at the most important time. One of the weaknesses of the team last season was outside of Hinata and Kageyama, everyone was average at best. Thats why the whole training camp saga mattered so much as they were all trying to get better
>> ARTICLE
I think Tanaka is working on his cut short after seeing bokuto do it. Just like how bokuto worked on his straight to become a top 5 ace I can see that happening for Tanaka
>> ARTICLE
I remember KnB stretching the last 5 minutes of game into an entire episode.
>> ARTICLE
The last match in the show...I can't imagine how many episodes that's gonna be.
>> ARTICLE
Aw man this show just gets ya so hyped up!

The next episode is titled something like the battle without will power. Daichi, noooooooo!
>> ARTICLE
I know right?  This show makes me want to straight up just go running!
>> ARTICLE
* That Misaki flashback got to me. It was for like, what, 10 seconds? And there's just so much feelings packed into it, it was amazing.
* Oh my god the Nakashima Family Cheering Squad! I love them.
* And also, Saeko appears again, woo!!
* Oh man, Daichi being captain-ly (and a bit manipulative) is honestly kinda hot.
* OMG DAICHI-SAN IS DEAD NOOOO

He was the one that told them he wouldn't be a bench warmer forever or something to that effect.

Isnt number 6 the one that grabbed Tanaka and Nishinoya mid-air after the game?

Yes, that's Ennoshita.

Of course they end it there! Poor Daichi! :(

However I can already foreshadow him coming back when they are in a pinch and him saving the day. Just waiting for those feels right now

I expect Daichi to be able to move properly. More like a Paul Pierce moment but not fake

The way they showed it, honestly it looked like he got straight concussed. Not easy coming back from that.

Yeah, might just do a kiyoshi there.

I miss Kiyoshi :'(  His story was always sad. So much talent and we never got to see him at his best cause of his injuries

Still wasnt at his best. He could barely do them. DONT GET ME WRONG, I WAS SUPER HYPED

At the beginning this anime had me for the awesome volley. But what makes it amazing now its the characters. Its incredible how much they made me care for the manager that we only saw for 1 1/2 episodes.

No. I refuse to accept this. No. Get up Daichi. Please?

I'm pretty sure if you keep watching the episode over and over, Daichi will eventually get up. Don't let us down.
>> ARTICLE
One can only hope. 
>> ARTICLE
Hope Daichi is okay :( 
>> ARTICLE
This was my favorite episode so far in since the new season began. The action was extremely intense, and when Daichi was injured at the very end I was completely taken by surprise. So so so excited for next week!
>> ARTICLE
H o l y shit. This anime gets me every time.
>> ARTICLE
oh..... [FUCK FUCK FUCK DON'T DIE!!!](http://imgur.com/YxZWwCT)
>> ARTICLE
God I should have seen this Dadchi injury coming, they were giving him way more attention than usual. 

Also does anyone else see a bit of Yachi in the yellow teams manager? I definitely did. 
>> ARTICLE
Of all the teams to call Karasuno [outrageous](http://i.imgur.com/WAl0WJo.jpg), it's the one with this [fabulous spiker](https://gfycat.com/DeadDemandingAtlasmoth)???

Also, how great was [this moment](http://i.imgur.com/J6iXSjz.jpg) with Ennoshita? I like to imagine that, as a second year, he's had to deal with Tanaka's and Nishinoya's antics for years now. His [attention](http://i.imgur.com/G7PIfjF.jpg) to detail even when on the bench is also really impressive.
>> ARTICLE
Ennoshita has the demeanor of a future captain. He is way more level headed than Noya, Tanaka and the regular first years. 
>> ARTICLE
Somebody has to be team mom. That's Ennoshita. He's been doing it in the background for the whole series.
>> ARTICLE
Daichi-senpai is perfectly fine. He's just sleeping. He'll get back up right? RIGHT?!
>> ARTICLE
Daichi!!! Noooooooooo!!!

Besides that, Haikyuu continues to do an amazing job at building up the opposing teams. I really like that.
>> ARTICLE
NOOOO!!! Our captain :(. Hopefully he'll be fine.
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit... that ending :(
>> ARTICLE
At least he's got a whole week to recover.
>> ARTICLE
Dat Asahi spike, tho.  Kingly ace, indeed.

THE PAIN IS TOO MUCH.

But now we have Ennoshita! I've been waiting for this
>> ARTICLE
Managers are people to! 

The entire episode had some great moments to describe the moment, from the manager taking their last look at the court being its all over, to that amazing ending with Daichi injured. While I was shocked and stunned, all I could think about was how well done that whole piece was done
>> ARTICLE
This episode went from 100 to FUCK in 2 seconds flat
>> ARTICLE
GIVE ME YAMAGUCHI!
>> ARTICLE
Damn it, they ended it there? And the silence makes it even more dramatic! If I hadn't read the manga, pretty sure my heart would stop. Well, it did stop when I read this part in the manga. 

Aone was extremely adorable, as always. He really seems pretty fond of Hinata. I love how he's just pointed his hand, and Fukutachi just translate what he means by it. 

Also finally development for THAT CHARACTER next week. I can't wait. Also am I the only who who consistently checking on time while watching Haikyuu!! Because every episode feels like only 5 minutes, sigh. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't time the episode after, but I carefully watch the clock waiting for the sub to go live.
>> ARTICLE
dat ending tho

Daichi
D: 
>> ARTICLE
Get well soon Daichi
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit
>> ARTICLE
ouch i really felt that one
>> ARTICLE
I'm really liking this season a lot, even more so than the first I think. They've alleviated the "freak quick" problem I had with the first season where Hinata would just spike with his eyes closed which I always thought was perhaps a little too unrealistic and they've really built on some characters that didn't have much development in the first season (Tsukki and Kiyoko). Animation has remained at the top level as expected and the new tracks in the OST have been great.


>> ARTICLE
Why are all of Hinata and Aone's interactions so cute

Hype keeps on delivering with every episode and game. I wish I could see other viewer's faces when the shot switches to Daichi's downed body. Everyone probably had a looks of utter horror lol.
>> ARTICLE
This was a great episode, but I was kind of expecting more end feels from the first team, they built them up and it seemed a lot quicker to end than most of them so far.
>> ARTICLE
Daichi nooooo!! Also those violins when they were talking about teams they struggle against were sick.

Hell naw! Wake UP DAICHI. Ain't nobody got time for this XO

We get to see Thighchi's glorious thighs!!

So much Yachi goodness in this episode. 

This is pretty much 20-something minutes of why Daichi is awesome.

Daichi nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!
>> ARTICLE
Noooooo! They just murdered Daichi!!! Why Furudate why?!!
>> ARTICLE
Lol he died
>> ARTICLE
Tbh, I was hoping the Johzenji game would at least go to a deuce because they're so fun to watch! But somehow Wakuman is even more fun to watch too! They're definitely making these games ramp up in their suspense again.
>> ARTICLE
Aw Daichi. I know he's probably dazed/knocked out, but man the silence and tension made me super worried for a second. T___T;;

Also the more I hear of tacica in both this ED and season 1's 2nd ED, the more I can't stop associating them with The Living Dead/Jupiter era Bump of Chicken (early 2000s). That's a good thing in my book though.
>> ARTICLE
It's more than that. The morale base/source for the entire team stems from Daichi, especially for all the less... smrt... players.

The foreshadowing about how this'd be a battle of captains, is going to be really about how Karusuno will learn to succeed even without their captain actively being there.

It will most likely boil down to a "Daichi won't be here next year, will we just fail, or show him that we can succeed, and appreciate his captain-ship.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mean to imply that the collision wasn't severe enough to take him out of the match at the very least, but rather was more noting just how tense the direction at that moment filled me with enough tension/dread that despite knowing that he'd eventually end up okay, that something far worse had happened.

Still, I agree with you on how the team is at a crossroads in how it can move forward without him really pulling them together.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, if the 100% only reason why the team works together/succeeds is down on the ground. i.e. the 100% reliable/relied upon member of the team (even for the third years), is lying there motionless... That tension was appropriate imo.
>> ARTICLE
Never said it wasn't appropriate

We're finally up to one of my favorite games! Yes!

YUUUP

people literally call this show 'hypeku' so yes

Is it just me or this episode was different from other usual episodes with the different angles of the spikes, pacing, and timing of the ost
>> ARTICLE
My heart has yet to start beating again. How long do you think I can hold out until the next episode?
>> ARTICLE
That cliffhanger though, RIP DAICHI.
>> ARTICLE
I will never understand why they say "Nice Serve" before people even do the serve.

If someone says "Nice Serve" before the serve and you fail, that'd be pretty weird.
>> ARTICLE
I'm always a little bit sad when they decide to have a player get injured in sports anime. Sure it's a good way to build tension but i believe it's a bit of an easy way out.
>> ARTICLE
Wonder if that what Cavaliers fans felt when Irving got injured in Game 1 of the finals.
>> ARTICLE
It shouldn't, given how often injuries actually happen. Daichi is also the player who seems to be rotated out of the squad the least (alongside Asahi), so he's at additional risk. 
>> ARTICLE
It's more of a personal preference. I know that injuries happen often but it's usually the timing of the injuries that i do not like. It's always in a more important match to build that extra tension. 
>> ARTICLE
Technically all of these matches are important. If they lose, their dream of nationals goes out the door.

I mean, do you want an injury here, or against the two perennial title contenders? I'd take it here any day of the week.
>> ARTICLE
This is the show I look forward to the most this season.
>> ARTICLE
yep, pretty much only watching this and OPM
>> ARTICLE
cavalry isnt that shit.. not your avg shounen/ecchi manga, mc isnt a dimwit id recommend it if you have free time

Holy crap, me too! Its actually the only animes currently airing that I'm watching.

I've been reading lots of good things about OPM. So I'm going to wait for OPM to finish airing then I'll binge watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Better yet just read the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
LOL, HE WANTS TO BINGE WATCH AND U RECOMMEND THE MANGA?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. 
>> ARTICLE
Just saying because the rate of release with the pages is amazingly slow
>> ARTICLE
More material than the anime. Might as well if he wants to binge watch. 
>> ARTICLE
You know it's a short chapter when reading the discussion thread takes longer than the actual chapter
>> ARTICLE
Its not really the kind of show you binge watch, it's really episodic. 
>> ARTICLE
The episodic episodes are going to end pretty soon
>> ARTICLE
Still not a very plot driven show, beating enemies and climbing up the ranks of the hero association is pretty much all it is, besides the latest chapters. 
>> ARTICLE
It goes more into arcs though rather than a story that is pretty much wrapped up in an episode

the hair style of the Little Giant as well was the exact same but black

Didn't someone have to explain the basics of volleyball to the glasses teacher early in the first season?
>> ARTICLE
Yea thats why its a silly theory
>> ARTICLE
Takeda is also too old to be the Little Giant. He's supposed to be around Saeko's age. 
>> ARTICLE
My theory is close to that one. I feel like the teacher is related to the Little Giant.

Depending on how long the story has left, the Little Giant might not even been shown up and is an entirely new character.

It seems we've found a character whose driving rivals Miyamori's from Shirobako.

The tall dude actually seemed like a nice guy. It should be a good match when they play each other.

Finally!! I felt like I was waiting for so long for the Tokyo training arc, but it's finally here!!! I'm way too happy. Far out.

Not only do we get to hang out with some incredibly amusing new characters, but we get to watch the boys grow and develop. I'm so stupidly excited for the next several episodes!!

NO ONE SLEEPS IN TOKYO!
>> ARTICLE
whew! you can really start to feel a bit anxious for Karasuno. They're barely holding their own against the powerful teams there, and pretty much only because of their freak quick. And the more they use it, the quicker the opposing teams are going to figure out how to defend against it.

Really gives the feeling of four walls (or incidentally, the other 4 teams) just closing in on them.
>> ARTICLE
Jump out of the way of the 4 walls :\^)
>> ARTICLE
HYPE!

Goddamnit, why the heck are those episodes so short?!

I miss the 1st season binge-watch that I did with my orignal watch. But Yeah, this was a great Episode again. Can't wait for more episodes. 

On a sidenote: not enough Yachi this episode.
>> ARTICLE
And now starts, one week of suffering without Haikyuu!!, this is the first time I feel like I can't stand the wait for another episode. [Crying intensifies]
>> ARTICLE
I honestly thought they might try to [transform](http://imgur.com/1wwKV3O) into some kind of educational magical boy during this sequence. Way too [funny](http://i.imgur.com/aamxFvQ.gif).

Does anyone else really like how the guys look in their [school uniforms](http://imgur.com/ACTSgql)? They're in sleeveless shirts all the time, the change is kind of nice.

Such [great](http://i.imgur.com/0UabANd.jpg) faces during the [drive](http://i.imgur.com/BFfAigN.jpg).

This is the first time we've seen the [little giant's face](http://i.imgur.com/KeW7nyt.jpg), right? I love that he has the same serious face that Hinata sometimes gets.

The slice of life moments this season have been so good, from reaction faces to [bedhead](http://i.imgur.com/jwtdqXA.gif).

OTOH, the serious game scenes have [great animation](http://imgur.com/m0dN7Ev), too. God, that's intimidating.

I really really like how they showed the crazy height disparity with sharp [camera angles](http://i.imgur.com/unFCoys.jpg).

[Again](http://i.imgur.com/MFpBbRC.jpg), the [faces](http://i.imgur.com/7CLyYBA.jpg) are top tier.

Didn't we already have this [conflict](http://i.imgur.com/bxgxp76.jpg)? Hinata, don't you go trying to steal Asahi's thunder again. You have an incredibly important role to play. Speaking of which, [manga spoilers](/s "There was a scene where Hinata does such a good job as decoy that even Kageyama gets confused as to which teammate he wanted to pass the ball to. Was that in season 1, or is it manga-only so far? I read the manga too long ago to remember.")

I have a feeling that, "Aces score the most points!" is gonna fuck with Hinatas head a bit and he's gonna try to get way too greedy.

normally I'd think that, but the upper years always put them in their place when they get remotely cocky

Yea I think it will affect him in just the next game. He's gonna try to do too much I think though.

Woohoo! Finally we got to see all the teams that will be training with Karasuno. This episode covered chapters 78 and 79 of the manga for those interested, keeping the ~2 chapters per episode.

If there was a spin-off manga just for Fukurodani and the antics of Bokuto, I'd buy it in a heartbeat

I don't think this is said enough: The soundtrack to this show is fucking PHENOMENAL. 

In most cases soundtracks are very unnoticeable and it doesn't necessarily effect my enjoyment of a show (when talking about shows people don't usually say "this shows soundtrack sucks" they either say that it's good or nothing about it at all). IMO in the cases where a powerful soundtrack is used, it REALLY enhances the experience.

I recently picked up a bunch of sports anime that I really enjoy.

So far I've watched the 3 seasons of Kuroko no Basket, Season 1 and up to current episode in Season 2 of Diamond no Ace (<- still running), Majors S1-S6 and Haikyuu, now just started with Hajime no Ippo. If you haven't seen all of these then you'd probably enjoy them if you like Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
I just started Kuroko no Basket 2 days ago, it's pretty awesome and it reminds me of Haikyuu
>> ARTICLE
4 sure, i'm loving it as well.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Major, out of those (watched Diamond no Ace and One Outs, from baseball related series). How do you compare it to the first one? I really liked the characters in DnA, so does it have similar character development?
>> ARTICLE
Major is one of my favorite anime of all time.  And as Akilee said, since it has 6 seasons, it has plenty of character development.  And not just for the MC, Goro, either.  Many side characters get a good amount of character development.  And since Major takes place from the life of a 5 year old boy until he becomes a man, you have a huge supporting cast as well.  Yet despite this, each character feels like their own person, and many of these characters get a good amount of screen time/character development as well.  In fact, I prefer some of the supporting characters to Goro, and he gets a great amount of development.  Also, I really love Goro too.  So that should give at least a small idea of how good the development in Major is.  

I could go on and on about how great Major, and it's cast, are, but I'd rather not ramble on for too long.  Also, the best way to see how good it is will be watching it for yourself.  You may not end up funding it in your favorites list unlike me, (although of course there's still a chance you will) however I can say for certain that Major is worth a try.  And despite its length, Major is actually incredibly easy to marathon.  More so than many other anime that I've watched.  So give it a try!  If nothing else, it's worth that much.

P.S. I recommend trying to watch a little over 10 episodes before deciding for sure if you want to keep going or not since it's kinda hard to get a feel for it until then.  However, I will say that season 5 is probably the best in Major, along with most of 6, however all of the seasons are incredible.  I honestly couldn't rank them if I tried, as all gave really great moments.  So yeah.  You should check it out!  :)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks a lot for the input. I'll try to make some time so I can check it out, myself :)
>> ARTICLE
Haha you're welcome.  Thanks for actually reading my kinda long, two week late comment.  :)

I hope that you're able to find the time for it, and that you'll be able to really enjoy it too.
>> ARTICLE
Major is 6 seasons long so there's plenty of character development. It starts a little slow but it gets better for sure, at first the MC is 5 years old and at that point its about his father, then there's a couple of time skips in this anime where it will be about the MCs baseball.
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru is god tier, just saying.
>> ARTICLE
yowamushi pedal is good, too! (the pacing sucks but it's an enjoyable watch actually.) reminds me of haikyuu with its tone and feel.
>> ARTICLE
Wow nothing from the king of the sports genre Mitsuru Adachi. Please watch Cross Game and Touch.

In addition to what others have mentioned: eyeshield 21, yowamushi pedal, and free.

:D One of my favorite Anime of all time.

Hajime no Ippo arguably best sport.anime, i mean, it even is in top like 7th spot in myanimelist rating. Ippo is indeed amazing, and I hope you have a nice ride :)
>> ARTICLE
Check out Ping Pong and One Outs as well. So many good sports shows.

I've checked out Ping Pong but I didn't like it, probably because it's a seinen, and the animation is really not my cup of tea. I dropped it after 7 episodes, I just couldn't enjoy it as I've enjoyed other sports anime.

Will have to check out One Outs.
>> ARTICLE
One outs is less about sport and more psychological but a really good watch nonetheless.
>> ARTICLE
Episodes 10 and 11 of Ping Pong are my favorite 2 episodes of anime ever. You should be starting the competition soon so it should be all matches from episode 7 onwards if that means anything to you. I recommend finishing it up. 
>> ARTICLE
one outs is also a seinin, but it's different from PP
>> ARTICLE
why is no one suggesting Slam fucking Dunk. It's basically what popularized this whole sports anime genre. It's still considered Japan's favorite manga since like the 90s. The 90s animation might be a little weird, but if you dont like that, theres always the manga
>> ARTICLE
You should check out Ookiku Furikabutte.

Great comedy-style baseball show.
>> ARTICLE
Can't forget Cross game bro
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen that, atleast not yet.

edit: So far I've only watched shounen sports anime so I'm a little worried about Cross Game that they might not have this added almost magical effect to things like pitches which makes it really enjoyable, things like adding auras to intimidating or fired up opponents really brings excitement. I hope it's the same with Cross Game!
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game doesn't have "auras" or "special powers" but it definitely gets you hype. It still has that feeling of the main character being a boss.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, then don't watch Cross game. More about the people playing the sport than the special effects and hyping each other up before the game.
>> ARTICLE
Should add baby steps to that too. Not the best in terms of animation(ignore the bg always haha) but it's really good. No super power bs or anything either. 
>> ARTICLE
The BG almost makes the anime unwatchable for me, when I first noticed how the people look I could never forget and it just distracts me. I would much rather their be no fans with "magic cheering" than the manikin audience we got.


To be clear, I love Baby Steps. It's an amazing story with great characters and progression.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah man, studio perriot really dropped the ball with baby steps. They can make some excellent animation, though they known to cut corners, however baby steps was really bad in alot of aspects. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm interested to see what kind of steps Hinata takes to compensate for the faults in their quick attacks. One thing I thought of is Hinata isn't strategic enough when at the net. He never does that little push upwards I see Tsukishima use for example.
>> ARTICLE
As in a tip instead of a spike? (Not quite sure what you're trying to describe)
>> ARTICLE
Most likely yes. I'm not sure what a tip is, but the one where the person "spiking" pushing the ball lightly over the net with the tips of their fingers, in such a way that it goes over the blockers reach.
>> ARTICLE
I think the word you're looking for is "feint". 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, that would work:)
>> ARTICLE
Finally the dude from [Haikyuu!! Jump Fiesta 2014](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25303/Haikyuu!!:_Jump_Festa_2014_Special) makes an appearance!
>> ARTICLE
Man I can't believe how quickly this episode went by! As always I still look forward to the next episode and having read ahead in the manga I'm positively giddy for the character development that happens during the training camp! :D
>> ARTICLE
That OST when Hinata and Kageyama were warming up was awesome.
>> ARTICLE
This has now overtaken Owarimonogatari as my AOTS ^^so ^^far

I'm thankful that Lev was introduced in the 2014 Jump Festa special and he wasn't jut thrown in. Looks like he and Hinata could be great rivals!

These episodes go by to fast but I'm absolutely loving them!

I almost died at the "hey hey hey" from Bokuto. And his legging-kneepads. And just everything in general about him being animated and given a voice. I love the volleyowls and can't wait to see more of them.

Also. WOW Lev is tall. So lanky. 

Much hype for next week's episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Every time I think that they've run out of motivational moments in this show, they keep coming back with more. I LOVE IT.

Chapter 1.

Definitely a "transition" episode, but I enjoyed the heck out of it and next week looks awesome.

So many great scenes as usual! Can't wait to see hinata vs lev next week
>> ARTICLE
Just realised that the scene in the OP where Hinata and Kageyama puts down their water bottles, Kageyama's water bottle has "EGO" written on it.
>> ARTICLE
After every episode finishes I wish there was more T_T
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I really need a gif of that Little Giant scene.
>> ARTICLE
Hey does anyone know what chapter in the manga this episode covers? I really don't want to wait anymore :D

>> ARTICLE
i just love the little detail with hitoka getting annoyed by the others badmouthing karasuno. haha! i can't even recall if that was in the manga but it's a nice addition to her character.

Yamaguchi, nice serve!

Holding back the reserve players in the waiting area wasn't in the manga and was a brilliant touch, haha. I also think Tsukki's tiny smile when he picks up the ball was an addition, too, and one of my favourites so far.

IKR? He's been practising those serves since season 1. I remember him asking the senior glasses guy. I feel so proud.

I loved the way Yamaguchi just had fans all around the stadium. And everyone was screaming for him, EXCEPT Shimada (his serve coach), who was just sort of clenching his fist and shaking because he was so proud. It was really really well done.

How can you not love him

Hahaha. That's actually my flair over on the haikyuu subreddit! Face, not thigh.

I'm so glad they didn't skip this bit in the anime.

That moment literally couldn't have been recreated better. Im so emotional right now

The ONLY bit I think the manga did better was this shot of Yamaguchi loving the way the ball stings his chest after he receives Iwaizumi's spike. http://imgur.com/Hle9cmS

I have always loved that panel haha

Lol yes it's some foreshadowing that Yamaguchi actually has Incredible Hulk syndrome. This will be important later in the series.

Legit bro. I was tearing up like crazy

it made me cry once when i read the manga, now i just cried again

my second favorite moment in manga
>> ARTICLE
Same, the buildup before his first serve gave me goosebumps!

The way they toned down the OST and the crowd, so we can only hear the volleyball, the squeaks of his shoes and his breathing, it really emphasized that Yamaguchi was in **THE FUCKING ZONE**. Just a perfect scene.

In the name of all things good, why is this show ending?

I don't want to spoil anything but do you know at what part of the story the season is ending?

[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Damn. That's what I thought. I was looking at the episode count and thinking in my head how they would split it up but episodes were slower than I expected (in a good way). Man, I actually don't think I can wait for the next part to be animated.
>> ARTICLE
The end of this match. *internally screaming*
>> ARTICLE
Oh god really?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, they have *plenty* enough of time to wrap it all up. 
>> ARTICLE
They're running out of awesome stuff to adapt awesomely, that's all.
>> ARTICLE
Not really, but what is the anime going to do when the manga is drawing out single matches to arches?
>> ARTICLE
Right, that's what I'm saying. They're running out of manga material to animate and having been doing a great job of it so far that it's better that it goes away for a couple of years till the manga catches up.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that's possible with this show.

So it can rise again, even stronger than before.

I'm still not sure if he's angry. He could just be absurdly intense and putting literally every inch of that intensity into his hits.

Hard to say, though. He definitely looks like he has a chip on his shoulder.

An episode I was really looking forward to...[Yamaguchi's own episode!](http://i.imgur.com/Nvtl80c.jpg) (at least it felt like that)

I really wanted an episode where he can do what he didn't manage to do last time and it was even better than I expected. [This face](http://i.imgur.com/fdCrxyt.jpg) was worth the waiting! 

[The guys cheering on him](http://i.imgur.com/UJ4Ctla.jpg) were great! He managed to [annoy Oikawa](http://i.imgur.com/eP6KLQT.jpg), get some [good reactions](http://i.imgur.com/93T6iY5.jpg) on more than [one occasion](http://i.imgur.com/H1rLGKz.jpg) and even make [Tsukki smile!](http://i.imgur.com/OVHiT4j.jpg) ^^^^Yes ^^^^that's ^^^^him ^^^^smiling!

[Noya and Hinata couldn't contain themselves!](http://i.imgur.com/XhP1QvR.jpg). I like how on that scene as well as [this one](http://i.imgur.com/Lgswgnw.jpg) the others had to hold them back and cover their ears :P

Also, the part were the [opponents' girls cheered for him](http://i.imgur.com/h4P7uvi.jpg) was awesome! Not that [Yachi and Saeko](http://i.imgur.com/R6sJWxP.jpg) were not!

Right!? Goddammit, I thought they were gonna get the second set! NOW WE HAVE A WHOLE OTHER ONE TO WIN AAHHHHHH

I love how they continue to show us Aoba Josai and how badly they also need to win this match. If they lost that 2nd round, that would be the end of their 3rd yrs' journeys, and would be just as devastated as Karasuno's 3rd yrs. And simultaneously using Oikawa's serve to both show us how far Yamaguchi has come and how far he has to go...you can't help but be strongly attached to both teams


edit: also,


hinata: yamaguchi, get 10 points! 

yamaguchi: that'd end the match... 

hinata: I'd forgive you


!!!!

This is simultaneously why I love the show and why it also breaks my heart. I love that we get the perspectives of the other characters and teams; this show makes you want to cheer for EVERYONE. And at the same time, that means that no matter who wins, you're going to be sad. Every victory is bittersweet. I really want Karasuno to win, but I also really feel for Aoba Johsai and don't want the third years to go out with a losing match. Either way, there will be tears!
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, Yamaguchi almost took down Aoba Johsai *single handedly*. 
>> ARTICLE
Five points in a row versus that team, can't get any more badass than that.
>> ARTICLE
Well if he made one more they'd won the game that would be more badass in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Well simple math yeah, but I imagine there is no other team that can claim to score so many points in a row against Aoba Johsai (except Shiratorizawa probably).

I feel legitimately bad for anyone not watching this show

That was an amazing episode
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching a couple weeks ago, and now I have an awesome reason to get hyped every saturday morning. It's so exciting!
>> ARTICLE
Same. They have no idea what they're missing.
>> ARTICLE
Only feel bad for the ones that just haven't come across it yet. Laughing at the ones who think sports anime are beneath them, as they continue to try and struggle to find a slice of life as feel good as Haikyuu with characters no where near as great.
>> ARTICLE
There's some pretty good slice of life(s) too. But I watch slice of life for sweet relaxing moments. I can't even breathe when I watch Haikyuu. I watch Haikyuu to get hyped. It just different genre for different feelings.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is, most sports anime come from sports manga. For sports manga to be successful it usually has to have some kind of ridiculous gimmick. Just look at all of the other Shounen Jump sports manga; the ones that are successful made it into more of a battle manga. Eyeshield had the crazy battle effects to show off the moves and plays they were doing. Kuroko had made up abilities and lightning eyes. Prince of Tennis actually had a character whose tennis hits would blind people.

Haikyuu is the first Jump sports manga (to my knowledge) to find real sustained success without taking away from the realism of the sport. Most other successful sports manga are just run in different serializations and so they don't get as much publicity. Without the publicity they don't get an anime. I'm happy the long running ones are being rewarded, tho. It has made for an almost golden age of great series (Baby Steps, Daiya no A, Yowapeda, Ping Pong).
>> ARTICLE
Daiya no ace is pretty much that as well. Good characters and very realistic baseball. Sure they exaggerate hits here and there but it's essentially about as real as it gets. 
Major had the Gyroball (lol) and One outs was literally 10 different change ups pretty much despite also being great baseball anime. 
>> ARTICLE
The thing is that this isn't a generic sports anime. It's actually pretty realistic like some baseball animes. But why I love haikyuu and what's sets it apart is the way it develops characters and emotions. The manga is great but the studio has done a phenomenal job with the amazing animation, the great voice acting, and an excellent choice in music. The show is one of the best regardless of genre imo.
>> ARTICLE
People automatically put down most sports anime. I know i did until recently. Now sports is my favourite genre.
>> ARTICLE
Starting slam dunk I think sports changed for me.

I didn't like them before but slam dunk along side kuroku changed that for me.
>> ARTICLE
I thought they were pretty bad as well. Then, my friend put Kuroko on the screen cuz all of us had nothing to do after class. We got to like episode 8 in one sitting lol. 

Diamond no Ace, Kuroko no Baske, and Haikyuu are the only ones I've seen. And they're damn good.
>> ARTICLE
I got started with "Baby Steps" and Haikyuu is my second sports anime. I suppose you could count Initial D which I watched ages ago as it was airing, but I wouldn't count it.

I've tried to find others that I would genuinely enjoy using MAL but it's really hard. I should probably give Kuroko a shot, and even though I know sports anime are more about the characters than the actual sport, I still can't see myself getting into Diamond no Ace.

Even though I f****** love Haikyuu and have zero interest in volleyball.
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko is pretty mediocre as far as the genre goes, IMO. Well executed, but after a while kind of repeats itself and gets a little out of hand with ridiculous superpower moves.

Here's a couple of recommendations - 

* Hajime no Ippo (just an absolute classic)
* Major - not that great, but solid and consistent throughout
* Cross game
* Diamond no ace (you should really try it)
* Ookiku Furikabutte (interesting take, where the team usually plays smart with mediocre players)
>> ARTICLE
IMO the twists in Kuroko were expected but fun to watch with the animations
>> ARTICLE
Boy does being turned off by baseball limit your options when it comes to sport.
>> ARTICLE
I would never watch baseball in real life. But good anime makes it much more interesting and personal. I mean, I would never watch volleyball IRL either
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, i've watched some clips and it still feels more "in the zone" than baseball. Watching a spike setup is so exhilarating. 

>> ARTICLE
I hated baseball for the longest time. Then I got introduced to advanced metrics and now baseball is an all consuming passion that has led me to be able to name most of the players in the Mets organization down to the AA level.

>> ARTICLE
Truly a 10 out of 10 season. This show is so good. I look forward to every episode.
>> ARTICLE
That was the best episode yet! Yamaguchi's moment to shine was so bright! I'm so happy for him. He talked about the difference in experience between him and Oikawa and that made me excited thinking about how good Yamaguchi would be when he became a third year. The opponents that Karasuno faces are all so likeable, but this Karasuno team is sooo damn likeable. The way they cheer each other on and celebrate each point and each personal victory is the best. It made it even better when Yamaguchi scored his first point, Karasuno was cheering so loudly while the people in the stands were asking why they were so excited about "just one point."  And let's not forget Tanaka's guidance as an upperclassman to Yamaguchi after Yamaguchi felt like down about not winning the set. Tanaka may not see himself as a capable captain next year, but him and Nishinoya are definitely the spirit of this team and will be great third years to lead the next team. Although I want Karasuno to win, I'm kinda glad that this match is going to a third set. It would have felt a bit anticlimactic(? I dunno if that's the right word) if they just beat their toughest opponent in a 2-0 sweep. I'm super hyped for the next episode!
>> ARTICLE
I definitely agree about Tanaka and Noshinoya being the spirit of the team! Tanaka encouraging Yamaguchi brought a tear to my eye. :') What a great senpai moment.

As a current volleyball player, this series as a whole has been a trip. Hell, this series made me motivated to join the university club team. If that doesnt show how moving this show can be, I don't know what will.

Literally every moment of this show I've experienced one way or another, and it recreates the same feelings I had on the high school volleyball team. By far my favorite anime thus far.

I cannot wait to see the final game of the match next week.

[Only 3episodes left...](https://yametekudasaii.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ss-2014-10-09-at-12-28-32.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
My friends who are waiting to binge watch this season are saying "Ugh. Still 3 episodes left"
>> ARTICLE
Nooooooo... D:

I wasn't keeping track of that and I thought there were plenty more episodes to come...
>> ARTICLE
I've calculated that in order for there to be enough material for Season 3 of Haikyuu, it still needs 20 more chapters. 26 episodes of each season needed about 70 chapters. And there's 50 or so chapters that should be around after this season is over. So I hope the wait isn't *too* long until the 3rd season (26 episodes). 
>> ARTICLE
There are extra chapters too, they can use them. At least it's pretty sure that we'll get 3rd season.

[manga spoilers](/s "i cant wait for shiratorizawa match and fukurodani vs nekoma")
>> ARTICLE
[Manga spoiler](/n "Fukurdani vs nekoma was like 4 chapters. im pretty sure they will animate the 3rd place Tokyo match cuz it seems to be the most important match for nekoma atm(last chance for nationals). Also they have to introduce us the team that Fukurdani are going to face in the finals cuz they are favorites to win nationals and they have the best spiker in Japan.")
>> ARTICLE
Could be sort of filler, if they just make the whole match, instead of just skipping around.
>> ARTICLE
[Some serious manga spoilers](/n "Honestly they could make the Karasuno-Shiratorizawa match into a whole movie as opposed to dedicating a season and a half to it considering how long it is.")
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the same thing. It would probably fit good into a two hour movie as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Or its own mini season 2.5. 
>> ARTICLE
Shame that Yamaguchi's epic serves didn't end up mattering for the overall result (they lost the set anyway), but it was still great seeing him shine.

Now how the hell am I supposed to wait an entire week for the start of the third set?
>> ARTICLE
It shifted the momentum of the match. Now everyone is feeling more confident.
>> ARTICLE
Besides, now Yamaguchi can come in for the 3rd set and just sweep it. Or at least get his promised ten points.
>> ARTICLE
> Shame that Yamaguchi's epic serves didn't end up mattering for the overall result

It did matter a lot though! It's so different to lose the 2nd at 28-26 from losing it at 25-18 or something. (Besides, story-wise, we all know Hinata and Kageyama too have to have their time against Daiou-sama!)
>> ARTICLE
And just 3 episodes left :( OST amazing as always.

I love the fact that the studio is faithful to the manga (except from some tweaks, but nothing big) and how they are able to transmit all the feelings perfectlly to the audience, nice Production IG!

This episode covered from chapter 136 up to chapter 139.

I sure hope the same level of hype in the OST will translate into Boku no Hero Academia.

I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EPISODE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON.

It was AMAZING. I was screaming Yamaguchi through the entire thing. 

And holy crap what is the ost of this anime? Incredible!
>> ARTICLE
Is the ost for the new season out yet?
>> ARTICLE
Not yet, sadly. Volume 1 goes on sale March 16, and volume 2 on April 20. The [covers](http://okmusic.jp/#!/images/news/1069581) are out tho 
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely loved that ending of Daichi's and Oikawa's respective monologues. The Difficult opponent vs The Troublesome ones. How Seijou were meant to be out of their league and Kurasnoo beneath them yet despite everything, both are being pushed to their absolute limits. 

I'm not ready for this show to end.
>> ARTICLE
Spurs - Arsenal, Bayern - Dortmund, Karasuno - Aoba Johsai, the Nail-biting is off the charts today for me.

So great to see Yamaguchi being the hero, even if it went to the third set in the end. Didn't expect anything other than the full distance anyway.

Aoba Johsai is just such an experienced and cool team, staying calm after losing 4 points, [even the neutrals in the show can't help but want both teams to succeed.](http://i.imgur.com/2yjsalM.gif)

 
>> ARTICLE
Haha tied games everywhere. Today was an intense day.
>> ARTICLE
haha not even neutrals, they're aoba johsai fans.

(i lied, actually they're me, i want to cheer for both teams)
>> ARTICLE
and they become Yamaguchi's harem after this match
>> ARTICLE
The day has come where I can say this:

Yamaguchi. Nice serve.

:*)
>> ARTICLE
the best episode of this season! i've been waiting for this episode to air for a long time! 
>> ARTICLE
> But apparently We're fated to play to the fullest

I FUCKING WOULDNT HAVE IT ANY OTHER FUCKING WAY. FUCKING LETS GOOO
>> ARTICLE
Seeing the girls from Season 1 cheer for Yamaguchi was the cherry on top of that amazing serve. I've waited a year to see that serve and i'm so happy with how it turned out animated.
>> ARTICLE
The whole episode is perfect, I don't have to point out every scene that I liked since I'd end up writing the whole episode.

Remember when Yamaguchi was just Tsukki's weak-willed sidekick who makes fun of Kageyama and Hinata? Look how far he had come! 

I really liked the comparison between Yamaguchi and Oikawa' serves. It shows us how important serving is.
>> ARTICLE
Being an avid manga reader and watching this show from the very beginning I honestly hate how I get the feels from watching the first half of the episode. All the Yamaguchi action hit me so hard. I wish Karasuno had won in 2 instead of going to 3. But the comparisons from the manga to the anime are still just as amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I actually cried. YAMAGUCHIIIIII, YOU GLORIOUS BASTARD.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly thought they were gonna run away with the win. Nope, they play the rivals card. Nekoma is displeased.

Yamaguchi's was this episode's MVP but Tsukki was freakin amazing too. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope some of the kids that wants to play volleyball watch this anime, it really teaches a lot, maybe this episode is the best example, a guy who doesn't have so much speed, high vertical leap, or a powerful spike, but still works hard because of the sport he loves so much. Even though he only have one weapon which is serving, that doesn't stop him to be a better player. Actually, it is a great weapon because that's the only way in volleyball where you can literally win all by yourself, I mean you can score 25 straight service aces and you win. :P (btw, I hope Kazuhito Narita and Hisashi Kinoshita will have there own chance to play in a game)
>> ARTICLE
even though I already read the manga I can't help but smile and feel what their feeling this is a very well adapted anime by Production IG 3 episodes left.
>> ARTICLE
[Manga spoiler](/n "You think they're going to go with a cliffhanger ending? Assuming they dedicate the entire next episode for the third set vs Seijoh, I don't see them finishing the BO5 vs Shiratorizawa within 2 episodes. But then again I don't know what they'd do with the last 2 episodes if they decide not to adapt the final.")
>> ARTICLE
[Manga spoiler](/n "No way the final will start this season. I mean the whole match about as long as everymatch up until the win over Aoba Josei. For season 3 the final might even make up the whole first cour")

Not OP, but most likely
>> ARTICLE
God damn, Yamaguchi. Almost on level of Tadokoro from Shokugeki. You beautiful bastard.
>> ARTICLE
>Almost
>> ARTICLE
Lets be real, its gonna take a lot to beat Tadokoro's qualification in the group stage
>> ARTICLE
So I was at work (night front desk at an assisted living facility) and I totally was all "hell yeah" when Yamaguchi kicked major butt. This is probably the nerdiest thing I have ever done in public.
>> ARTICLE
So much fun gif potential in this episode. The show continues to be great as it heads towards the finale of the match.

Yamaguchi, I waited so long to see this episode, my baby ;-;
>> ARTICLE
Yamaguchi for the win! This match had me on the edge of my seat! 
>> ARTICLE
Yes!!! Yamaguchi!! Finally! This episode is such an epic moment to show his incredible jump float serve. I couldn't help but cry at that moment. Even though I have read this scene over and over again in the manga, the animation's really pull all the emotion in me. I love how quiet everything is during that first serve. The only sound was only Yamaguchi and ball's movement. What an incredible moment. 

 And as usual, the low key (no pun intended) supportive Tsukishima Kei always amazing. After all, he is the one who knows the best how many nights Yamaguchi spends practicing this serve since they usually got home together. I also love how they show the bond between Hinata and Yamaguchi. Next time, 10 points! 

Now, the last set. We definitely don't want either team lose. As Kindaichi reminds us in this episode, if Seijoh lose, this match is going to be the last match for their third years. But at same it's also going to be last one's for Karasuno's third years. Too bad Miyagi only has one team to represent their district :(

I loved how everyone on the side encouraged Yamaguchi.

dude, he is already nerfed for a long time, let him OP for a while

Holy crap that episode hit me right in the feels. Not the sad kind though. It was some combination of fulfillment and satisfaction. What a great episode.
>> ARTICLE
Yamaguchi, nice serves! I knew you had it in ya. 
>> ARTICLE
I think this episode was top notch, especially with the soundtrack ! It hyped me a little more to listen the full soundtrack and what Yki Hayashi will do for Boku No Hero Academia !!
>> ARTICLE
I am so freaking hyped!

Seriously, I am loving riding the weekly hype train with everybody here, but I am also super excited when the season ends and I binge both seasons as hard as possible.

Then the post Haikyu depression will start where I wonder what to do with my life and how quickly Season 3 might realistically come out.

Anyway, in addition to how awesome this rivals battle is, I also keep thinking how much I want to see the Battle at the Garbage Dump! But I also want Johsai to get the chance to beat Shiratorizawa!

Arrghh!!!! Haikyu! Why do you have to make me feel feelings?!
>> ARTICLE
So, did anyone else notice how Tsukki protected the back of his head when Yamaguchi went for his first serve? Like.... you actually showed that you trust him, Tsukki, why did you protect the back of your head? I am disappointed.

And wow, Yamaguchi already has 3 fangirls. Good job.
>> ARTICLE
But after Yamaguchi successful first serve, Tsukki stops putting his hand at the back of his head. I thought it was a nice subtle thing to show that Yamaguchi's not the same coward that he used to be and Tsukki fully trusts him now.

Anyone knows the song that starts playing @13:32? It's the same song that played when Oikawa was about to serve to begin the match.

God, there aren't many episodes left. Is anyone else getting the sinking feeling they're going to lose based off that alone?

I am so nervous... oh god...
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know the name of the song that plays leading up to Oikawa's intense jump serve? It was some sick music.

yamaguchi! ;_; everyone is so moved by his serves!

and did anyone else catch the preview for the next episode? it's got some yachi x yamaguchi goodness in it. (seriously, a coffin?!)

this episode is like a reminder of everything that makes haikyuu awesome: character development, team dynamics, and realistic play - oh and hype!!!

additionally, can someone make a full version of that amazing side-by-side of seijoh and karasuno by the end? :D

Yamaguchi... we are all so proud of you ;-; 



>> ARTICLE
DAYUM. Never expected to tear up a bit watching a sports anime... 

Yamaguchi's first service made me so happy. The build up was not wasted at all. It was so, sooooo good to see him finally get this right. Holy shit. I was smiling like an idiot for most of the episode after that. 
>> ARTICLE
Never felt so much emotion in me from a sports anime my God...

That was an intense episode. There are only 3 episodes left!!! I guess it will go to triple overtime or something ridiculous score like 32-34

13:25 into this episode a soundtrack revolving around a guitar starts, does anyone know what it is called or where I can find it?

I need more...I can't wait another week for the next episode. That's  it, I'm caving.

Anyone know what chapter this episode is in the manga?

What an amazing episode......Couldn't contain my tears for Yamaguchi!!
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap what a beautiful episode...

...and it's over...
>> ARTICLE
i was actually expecting the episode to end after the first jump toss + asahi's spike and all. i was just *so used* to haikyuu leaving me high and dry like that -- but then we got more! 

and then it's over.
>> ARTICLE
ARGH, I HATE THAT THEY'RE SO SHORT. But that episode was beautiful. Now another week's wait for another great episode.
>> ARTICLE
that basically felt like 2 minutes of adrenaline rush.
>> ARTICLE
The animation this episode was top notch. Oikawas serve and mad-dogs spike were incredible.
>> ARTICLE
I swear I was only watching for 5 minutes. Haikyuu-time is a real thing.
>> ARTICLE
Holy.... That trumpet at the end gave me the chills. I read the manga and know whats gonna happen but that really gave me the chills.
>> ARTICLE
On that note, there was a short piece within the first minute or so that I swear came straight from Mario Kart.
>> ARTICLE
Really smart by the sound team in my opinion. The implementation of the trumpet, an instrument we haven't heard in any of Haikyuu's soundtrack so far IIRC, changes the atmosphere quite differently and it really goes well with how Mad Dog's substitution will drastically change Aoba Johsai's system of play.

Or I might be just reading too much into it.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, the sound production team for this show is one of the best I've ever seen. They know exactly how to heighten a scene to the best it can be, whether it be a complete lack of music and just SFX (Oikawa's jump serve this ep), or a really good track (Mad Dog and Ennoshita's scenes) to send hype levels through the roof.
>> ARTICLE
The bgm flowed with the intensity of the show so well.
>> ARTICLE
Nah I don't think you are. The track that's playing during that moment is incredibly sinister-sounding with the choppy, distorted guitars and the slow, ominous drumbeat. When it does come in, the trumpet enters on an off-key note that drowns out the other instruments through sheer volume. It also doesn't play in time with the other instruments as the song continues, and its parting flourish is the last thing we hear before the ED starts - which, even though it's the most [dissonant](http://www.britannica.com/art/consonance-music) out of all of the EDs so far, actually sounds pretty soothing compared to the song that played before it. 

The song was likely specifically written to reinforce the visual of the gears straining against each other and being forced to run counter to their intended purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Glad that I wasn't wrong on my thesis. I wanted to word it more properly, but I would've never noticed those aspects you mentioned. 
>> ARTICLE
Careful though, I don't think a lot of what he said is correct.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call the starting note off-key...It was a non-chord tone (appoggiatura that resolves right away) and then does some improv-style pentatonics before ending on the tonic. I would describe as more of an "intense" or "wild" feel rather than "sinister". Also, it's not really the "volume" that "drowns out" since the track is gain compressed; we hear it so clearly because the high-frequency spectrum has these overtone harmonics that you get in the high-register of the trumpet.

Plus the ED isn't really what I would call a "dissonant" piece. Follows pretty standard chord progressions harmonically and resolves typically. Though the singers sound pretty out of tune at times, lol, I guess you could call that dissonance.
>> ARTICLE
Damn i love this show and you just made me love it more.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that trumpet sound was new. It gave me chills too, but at first I thought my headphones were broken.
>> ARTICLE
What trumpet sound are you guys talking about? Like at what time? (I'm hard of hearing and I miss some things. :P)
>> ARTICLE
Its a bit after the new guy hits that spike, its a little high pitch/squeaky.

Thanks!

I can't get over how great the anime adapts the manga and makes it even better! I just love how the characters are developed so well and how they intertwine with each other! There are no bad guys or unfavourable players! DAMN IT I LOVE THIS SHOW

I'm planning to watch Daiya one day, but it's kinda long, I don't watch series which have episodes more than 25 (no time)

Another good sports anime is one outs. 25 episodes.

Ace of Diamond is a slow anime but its amazing. It takes the time to develop each character so the slowness is justified. There are some episodes where they hella blue ball you but oh well. 

I remember binge watching the whole first season, and I'm glad I didn't find out about that anime until the season was over because waiting for an episode a week right now is torture.

I caught up to just before the knuckleball pitcher was introduced, saw the trailer for it in a Japanese restaurant after having it in my queue for a while and said fuck it. I'm pretty sure this season has been going for like 7 months now lmao.

Yah, didn't the second season also release like right after the 1st season ended too? although the first few episodes were recaps haha

Yeah second season started like late spring early summer, crazy how long it's been.

then I'm game, character development is my weak spot.

You're gonna be stuck watching the first season 24 hours straight if you're not careful.

Damn it if [this moment](http://i.imgur.com/VrkKhf8.png) wasn't super satisfying out of nowhere. I think after some serious contemplation Iwaizumi has become my favorite Haikyuu!! character. Also, wondering: did Iwaizumi always do really intense jump serves? I feel like that's a new thing.

[Calm down, Tsukki.](http://i.imgur.com/ZpKDh92.png) Thanks for [saving Hinata's blocked spike](http://i.imgur.com/nGIuTUJ.png), though. That's definitely not something Tsukki would have put forth the effort to do towards the beginning of this season.

[Same, Daichi. Same.](http://i.imgur.com/4vHr2Hb.png)

The animation/soundtrack/EVERYTHING is on point as always.

Interested to see how Kyoutani (new, scary Seijou player) affects the game.

Yeah, I was shocked it was Tsukishima that saved Hinata's spike! But I thought it was a really nice touch. :') He's starting to actually care.

Holy shit that serve was amazing. The animation was top notch and it got me off the edge of my seat. The new player is also looking like really bad news for Karasuno. I have a feeling this is going to be the best rematch game I'm going to ever see.

I was in awe from the animation of that serve.

Gosh this match is AWESOME. Was hyped with even the slightest thing happening and both teams are so good. Not even sure who I'm rooting for anymore, I just want the match to continue.

[](#rengehype "Can't wait for the rest!")

[Oikawa vs Kageyama](http://i.imgur.com/gXxYUQE.jpg) right off the bat, as well as the [other players getting annoyed](http://i.imgur.com/lSRsZm1.jpg) when they realised there is a new girl in Karasuno's club were funny but nothing beats the various [reactions](http://i.imgur.com/8jfImWl.jpg) when things were going right. That crazy [Noya-Asahi](http://i.imgur.com/yNu45Zg.jpg) moment at the start was SO GOOD! [They are quite prepared this time](http://i.imgur.com/e8ZZUej.jpg)!

As for [Oikawa's crazy serve](https://my.mixtape.moe/mqmxap.webm)...it looked great and [initial reactions seemed scared](http://i.imgur.com/5n0cEWS.jpg), but [Nishinoya got more excited than ever](http://i.imgur.com/DRulK2U.jpg). By the way, [this guy looks scary...](http://i.imgur.com/HoSPbxa.jpg)

Yeah, it made me really happy seeing Nishinoya/Asahi's new set/spike combo in an official game! Especially when Nishinoya got the idea for it from watching Seijou's libero!

THAT SERVE! THAT SPIKE! Like holy hell is this what the rest of the match is gonna be like?!

Also was it just me or was the OST particularly on point this week as well?
>> ARTICLE
I know this has been said over and over again, but seriously, Haikyuu gets me hyped up more than any other show I've seen in a long time. Everything about it is just so perfect, the characters, the music, the story and honestly, it all just blends together so naturally. I wasn't expecting the first set to go by this quick, but I had a feeling it would go into OT from the getgo. 

We finally get to see Mad Dog in action and I knew he would have some "beast-like" personality/playstyle, but that last spike even surprised me a bit. I don't know if I can make it through to next week without dying from hype, but until then, KARASUNOOO FIGHT!!

PS. Could anyone tell me the OST around the 5:35 mark? I might be wrong, but it sounds like a string instrument? It's the really upbeat soundtrack that gets you pumped up. Hopefully this makes sense...would really appreciate it! 
>> ARTICLE

What a f*cking cannon, jesus I got goosebumps. More, more, more more more more moremooremreoremore! That new guy has the presence of a tiger. Seems I wrote to early aswell, TWO cannons, damn.

Indeed, I figured he was going to an absolut beast(EEEEEY) when I saw the haircut & eyes. Great stuff.

I really didn't see him shoving someone over coming, and it made his character seem even more fearsome than it already was. A brilliant way to introduce the character imo.

That was a crazy episode, which is exactly what I expected. I knew that guy at the end was gonna be scary good, but for some reason, I didn't expect him to be a huge asshole, too! I probably should have expected it, but the way he pushed over his teammate just to get that spike. It's almost like he's Hinata's evil twin or something.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a big sports fan, and the best sporting event I have seen in a while has been this show. I was cheering every point. 

Also the whole Yachi interaction was perfect. 

Kageyama kicking Hinata was hysterical but it totally worked and got him calmed down. I just love that he literally kicked his ass to get him into shape.

Daichi Being terrified of that monster serve and analyzing it, and then Noya being like holy shit I want to recieve that. Perfectly shows that dynamic. Daichi is level-headed, and Noya is having a blast and just wants to be challenged. I love it.

Also fuck Mad-dog-chan for knocking down Kindaichi. That's a reckless play and how people get hurt. 
>> ARTICLE
holy shit that was intense!!! the match every1 has been waiting for, and they delivered it p fckin great!! next episode gonna be even better! this is haikyuu time to show if it deserves a 10
>> ARTICLE
Every week i have to emotionally prepare myself for the ending at the halfway point of each episode, a week is too long to wait after a spike like that.

>> ARTICLE
It's interesting that Mad dog got put in because Karasunos biggest weakness is apparently calm collected teams that scope them out and adapt quickly. Which Seijoh is... except maybe not as much now that Mad Dog-chan's here? What I'm trying to say is bring him in may be the scale that tips everything in Karasuno's favor.

[I can't stop writing about Haikyuu. Here's a write-up about some hype from last week!](http://minuteart.net/2016/02/20/building-more-than-a-wall/)

Haikyuu is similar to a lot of sci-fi and fantasy in the sense that its world is very alive. A lot of effort went into building each team as a believable entity, so much so that we almost feel like they're real life teams. It's that level of effort that makes matches like today's so exciting :)
>> ARTICLE
shit the mad dogger
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god! This is the hype! Is it just me or it's like 3 times more exciting than when I read it in manga? I guess the animation really helps. Especially that Oikawa's serve and Mad Dog's spike. Holy shit! 


Daichi's play also really strong in this episode. Such a strong receiver! Also is it the first time Noya/Asahi combination as setter and spiker works in official play? It's awesome when Seijoh was surprised by it. But godamn, seijoh even can make their other player set perfectly too. An all round team! 
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu!! makes me so happy
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Just wow.

But let's check my list from last week, shall we?

>* Tsukki to block some bitches
* Yamaguchi to do some delicious pinch serving 
* Daichi and Nishinoya to do some godlike receives
* Asahi and Oikawa to deliver some service aces
* ~~And Yachi to puke her heart out~~^^^^thatmomentwassofunnyandcute  

So, we just got one block by Tsukki in the first set until now. I am not satisfied with that. Waiting for more.

That we haven't seen Yamaguchi until now is no surprise. I expect him to step on the court at the end of the second set.

I guess we can cross "Daichi to do some godlike receives" off the list. Shit was impressive. Still waiting for Nishinoya.

Well. Oikawa's serves were fucking monsters if we got by the reactions of the characters. Still waiting for him to score with them tho and I guess Asahi got his spotlight with Nishinoya already.

The Yachi one was actually a joke but I guess her being scared of those serves is a good replacement.

We might also add

* Mad Dog-chan fucking shit up
* Mad Dog-chan working with Seijoh

to the list.

His "entrance" was just.... I actually just wanna say: Fuck that guy. He is scary as fuck.^^^^butpleasefuckKarasunooverwithyourbehavior

Can't wait for next episode!

I made some gifs of the nice animation for funsies. :3

this episode was so awesome with the jump toss and the decoys (dude hinata and tanaka certainly looked like they were gonna hit it!) and then it was all Asahi and boom!

and oikawa's explosive serve that was far too strong -- that i also wanted to try and receive! damn!

and what about that funny bit where one of seijoh's members tried to hit on (heh) dear yachi? HA!

such a good episode. can't believe we're only getting like 5 or 6 episodes left til the end of the season.

Oh look Oikawa's less evil now.... oh wait he isn't.

Karasuno's significantly better at receiving now.

No wait, Karasuno is significantly better overall compared to their last match with Seijou.

Kiyoko is a strong independent woman!

LMao @ Mattsun's dopey face when he's blocking Hinata.

Why do bad things always happen to Kindaichi? xD

If they're scared of Oikawa's powerful serves, how much more with Ushiwaka's spikes...
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa's serve actually made me stop breathing for a few seconds; I was in that much awe. So well animated. <3

Also, does anyone happen to know the song when Oikawa served at the beginning of the match? (Around 8:50)
>> ARTICLE
My lord... this episode has everything I love about Haikyuu. The gags, the reaction faces, the blood pumping adrenaline and Oikawa. Especially Oikawa. I've never loved an 'antagonist' in an anime so much. He's cocky, arrogant, petty, childish and acts like a complete fool, but DAMN is he a monster on the court. That new monstrously powerful and fast serve blew my fucking mind with excitement. OIKAWA YOU DAMN LOVABLE TRASH YOU
>> ARTICLE
Found the quality of the episode quite strange.

Yes there was those freaking gorgeous moments but damn it is laking a bit of quality right now and even the other episodes have a lack of the detail season 1 had.
Maybe they are putting all the money in the last episodes?

Edit: Reddit community always will be so bitter! Yeah downvote me for having a opinion.
>> ARTICLE
The sheer athletics displayed in the scene where Hinata makes the receive (including Ukai desperately trying to move the bench out of his way) was animated beautifully - and that was just in the first six minutes. I think this episode, more than any other since the series' start, showed the beauty of receives and just made them look AWESOME. I have a newfound appreciation for the defensive players on the team.

Also Ennoshita is amazing and lovely and I'm sad we're just starting to meet him a season and a half into the show.
>> ARTICLE
Ennoshita really grew on me, I mean Im glad that Dad is back but I hope that the show continues into the next year so we can get even more second year development.

Ennoshita's been there in the background the whole time. It's really amazing how they pull the focus away, but he's always there. I noticed it after reading the manga and rereading chapters and watching the anime, but he's always there.
>> ARTICLE
Supposedly Ennoshita's (and Yamaguchi's) story was not planned from the beginning.  I guess Ennoshita as the next leader just developed out of his character like happens in real life.  
>> ARTICLE
> including Ukai desperately trying to move the bench out of his way

I loved that touch, they didn't need to do it but it was just something little but so perfect.
>> ARTICLE
I think we can all agree tho that the best part was Take-chan getting knocked over.
>> ARTICLE
Im actually really glad that they put this in. I remember it from the manga and it made me appreciate the amount of attention that went into the little things. Iirc it was a chair in the manga though which makes more sense to pick up if you sort of think about it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, In the episode it didn't really seem like a big concern, due to the way it was shown.

But I also think it needed to be their purely to demonstrate how far out he was actually going to get that one touch and then get back.

I mean logically none of the benches would be placed within an area even considered for potential play.

Would have been cheaper for them to not animate it. But also would have taken from the scene.
>> ARTICLE
There aren't chairs on the side for these matches though...? They're always on benches afaik. In the manga it really seemed like he would have crashed into the bench if it had been there though.

just curious, how do you make these gifs? how long do they usually take? is there a fast way to do this?
>> ARTICLE
Hm the time it takes varies but maybe an average of around 4-5h? (excluding breaks ~~and me getting distracted by things~~)

Making the gifs takes about 2h so what really takes time is cleaning+redrawing the caps. Of course if the caps don't need redrawing then it takes less time! Also if the redraws are more complex then it'll take a longer time since I'm still an amateur.

I don't know if there's a "fast" way to do it; there's probably a more efficient method but I'm used to the way I make these so \\\_()\_/

Hopefully there will be more afterwards. Either a summer league, or we get to see the next year, where Hinata and Kageyama will be 2nd years. So we'll see some other characters again and hopefully get matchups that were missed out on.

Yeah the OP and the fact they haven't beaten Seijo :/
>> ARTICLE
>Next ep will probably be the last time we'll hear the chant  :(

This season! I'm pretty sure Haikyuu is so good it's not allowed to stop until Hinata and Yachi are an old grey couple, alongside great-uncle Kenma, regaling their grandchildren with stories about how they met in high school.
>> ARTICLE
> it's not allowed to stop until Hinata and Yachi are an old grey couple

I am perfectly fine with this.
>> ARTICLE
I need to know where Yamaguchi went at the end. I was hoping him and Ennoshita would meet up in the bathroom and talk, but like usual the episode went too fast :(
>> ARTICLE
Aw man, that would've been a great scene. It's obvious the two of them have similar feelings about their performance in this match and they could've helped each other back up again. Maybe the manga has it?

No, like Tsukki said he wasn't going to the bathroom (aka you'll find out soon).

He just needed a shit

Haikyuu made every character likeable but bokuto stole it for me in season 2. 



>> ARTICLE
i wasnt too crazy about him either but recently i took a peek at the latest chapters on MS, and then as i read it, i heard his voice HEY HEY HEY! lool. what a guy.

I didn't think I'd like him. New character with a weird character design.

I was totally wrong.

Nothing weird about it. Dude's just an owl.

I forgot his name for the longest time because I call him Owl-kun almost exclusively.
>> ARTICLE
I think its the combination of Bokuto, Akaashi, and Kuroo that really helped them all shine. Some of the best moments of this season involved those three.
>> ARTICLE
I like that Hinata and Kageyama do DBZ-type fighting now instead of just Kageyama choking Hinata or something.  Shows they're getting closer to being equals and no longer just Hinata benefiting from Kageyama being a genius.  Little things like that, this anime does so damn well.
>> ARTICLE
The main team of the series, Karasuno, won. So why am I crying that Wakanun lost against them? What is wroing with the series to make me/us feel such things for almost all characters? This is not fair.

Overall I thought the episode was really intense. And suddenly... Bokuto appeared. That got a good laugh out of me.

Also shoutout to Ukai-san for the fast reflexes!

And next week... Aoba vs Date Tech hype!
>> ARTICLE
[*"Once more...let me do it once more."*](https://i.imgur.com/pJNmurL.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Wakanun was interesting in that it seemed the most Karasuno-like of all the teams thus far. We've had guys who don't care, dominating presences like Oikawa, gimmicks like the two meter man and "party team," and the silent giant of Dateko. But these were just a bunch of well-balanced players who understood one another with one abnormally talented player in the same vein as Hinata, right down to the fixation on the Little Giant. 

Usually Haikyuu has to go to some serious lengths to get you interested in the other team. They crammed a lot of backstory into that Ohgi Minami match to make the ending so effective. This one was almost like easy mode. Why do we care about Wakanun? Because it's easy to see Karasuno in them.
>> ARTICLE
> What is wrong with the series to make me/us feel such things for almost all characters? This is not fair.

This is what happens when an anime has excellent character development. Its a rare sight nowadays.

>> ARTICLE
And why (one of the reasons) I have the first season a 10 and probably this one as well
>> ARTICLE
STOP MAKING ME CRY OVER ANIME BOYS PLAYING VOLLEYBALL
>> ARTICLE
I think I actually teared up a bit---what with Ennoshita berating himself for his failures even when the team won, and Yam's face... that last scene with Takeru was definitely the final straw. I definitely full on cried because it's just so fucking relatable. And I don't even play sports.

This episode had that same feeling of melancholy and regret during last season's episode 16 (Karasuno's first match in the Interhigh, plus the Karasuno girl's team's match), and I loved that one.

On a more lighter note, Daichi's back! I don't even know why but he seems hotter than usual... (is it the posing, like how coy he looked scratching the back of his head... I don't even fucking know god)

And yay we're gonna get to see bits of the Seijoh vs Dateko match! I love Dateko and their chant and their unfair tallness and Aone's missing eyebrows and [character that's gonna appear next ep](/s "Koganegawa, who's unfairly tall and adorable")
>> ARTICLE
ever episode makes my eyes watery..
>> ARTICLE
>he seems hotter than usual

I attribute it to "absence makes the heart grow fonder" and the fact that there is now credible evidence to point to him being awesome and rugged.
>> ARTICLE
I think Daichi was originally supposed to come across as intimidating.  Like, in addition to being "scary when angered", he's one of the densest characters in the series (the only characters with a higher BMI are all in Fukurodani and Date-kou, lol).  It didn't really work out like that since he ended up being "dad".  

I thought this scene was the opposite of rugged.  It was kind of cute with his awkward apology.  
>> ARTICLE
I can't even decide who I hope is their next opponent.  I'd love to see the rematch after that loss in season 1, but Karasuno's offense versus the Iron Wall defense would be a fantastic match also.    

[](#hypeoverload)
>> ARTICLE
I hope it's Aoba! We need an Aoba vs Karasuno rematch!!
>> ARTICLE
looking at the focus of oikawa in the OP it seems very likely that it'll be that

That's what I've been thinking, too! I really hope that's why.

Someone is making clones and selling them as fans clubs. Seijoh, Dateko and Johzenji have the exactly same repeated faces in their fan clubs

After this match I definitely appreciate Daichi a lot more. 
>> ARTICLE
AAAAAAAAAA I love this show SO much.

So many great moments this episode. Kageyama's "kind advice". Ukai frantically moving the bench out of the way and dumping Takeda-sensei. Tanaka parroting Ennoshita's lines. Ennoshita's amazing receive with the play that HE thought up. Hinata's rebound and Bokuto's spidey sense. Nishinoya's compliment. Tsukishima's solid block. Kageyama's push over the net. Nishinoya's method of "cheering up" Asahi. Hinata seeing Nakashima's wipe. Ennoshita doing that incredible receive right after. Hinata's face in the back after seeing Daichi.

I'm so glad that Ennoshita's getting some attention now. He's absolutely lovely. Now I'm just waiting for Yamaguchi's moment in the spotlight! And I can't wait for next week. Date vs. Aoba Johsai is gonna be SO HYPE.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time commenting in the Haikyuu! thread! I'm so nervous!

Dang what a game. It's nice seeing that Hinata isn't the only person who [was inspired by The Little Giant](http://i.imgur.com/Hqjm5BS.jpg). This is another strong aspect of the show. You're not the only one. You're not the only one working hard, you're not the only one who gives it your all, you're not the only one who earns for victory. And as always, despite the fact that [I'm super happy for Karasuno](http://i.imgur.com/jAeM5eW.jpg), [it's really hard to see the other team lose](http://i.imgur.com/dkC5zzg.jpg). 

Next episode is probably gonna be even harder. [Dateko vs. Aoba](http://i.imgur.com/zZU7f2p.jpg). I'm gonna cheer for Dateko, because of my best boy Aone!

Damn I got chills [when Chikara hit that...](http://i.imgur.com/eq7PNyw.jpg)

I'm really glad he got these receives...and even more [when Nishinoya complimented him](http://i.imgur.com/EfQF4z5.jpg)...the others' reaction to that was great, as well and [Chikara got so happy about it](http://i.imgur.com/eoErNIx.jpg).

I really want [Yamaguchi](http://i.imgur.com/ZNPLaWW.jpg) to be able to get a chance like this and use it, too...hope we get to see that in the future.

Also, [Daichi](http://i.imgur.com/kc7PkpG.jpg) seems to be okay ([lol at Hinata's face](http://i.imgur.com/ZwlErhU.jpg))
>> ARTICLE

Of course Daichi is okay. Did you think a little thing like a potential concussion could stop him? Teeth? Do you need them to play volleyball? It's probably just holding Daichi back.

That last Ennoshita hit was extra amazing when seen through Takeru's perspective!

The sound production really elevated that scene from a solid 7 to a hard 10. Adding those drums made it so hype.

A..perfect episode really. Ticked every box with what makes Haikyuu episodes: great dialogue, amazing match matched with great animation, comedy, Hinata/Kageyama duo galore, staple emotional moments (nice receive Ennoshita) and the abundance of mixed feelings at the conclusion of our team winning a match accompanied with the return of our hero. 

The only way is up with these Haikyuu episodes tbh. I really hope the whole of next episode is dedicated to showing Seijoh v Date Tech. I cant believe one of them is gonna be eliminated before playing Karasuno. 
>> ARTICLE
This show is absolutely incredible. 
>> ARTICLE
Hinata was a fucking beast. That save followed by an immediate counter was beautiful

Chikara not being satisfied despite the win makes me want to look forward to see him get better and better.

Date Tech vs. Seijoh is gonna be hype even though we all who's gonna win thanks to the OP.
>> ARTICLE
can we take a minute to look how easy it was for Ukai to pick up the bench with the teacher sitting on it lol
>> ARTICLE
Tried to put off watching the second season until it was all the way through.

Finally gave in on Wednesday.

And now here I am.

God damn this show is too good. And I think the second season is actually better than the first somehow. Having gone so heavily on Hinata and Kageyama in the first half, those two can kind of simmer while they develop everyone else, even guys like Ennoshita who barely existed in season one. 

Just the most human cast of characters I've seen in a long time, which is made all the more impressive by how damn large that cast is.
>> ARTICLE
>too good

... Are you suggesting it should be worse?

> Finally gave in on Wednesday.

I guess that answered my question already.

And welcome to front of the hype train. A basic week feels like this: 6 days 23 hours and 30 minutes of waiting for the next episode, 25 minutes of watching the [amazing] newest episode, and 5 minutes (or up to 6 days 23 hours and 35 minutes) of merely basking in how amazing what you just watched was. Hope you survive. It is quite a ride.
>> ARTICLE
Its nice that Hinata is skilled through practice and determination like a traditional shonen protagonist is, however I appreciate that there is also natural talent that can't be be aquired through sheer hard work. There is some natural instincts that Hinata has that take him above and beyond the average player.  And I am just waiting for Yamaguchi to come through. It is going to be a glorious moment when he finally does.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu really strikes a realistic balance between "this character worked really hard to get where they are" and "this character is a naturally talented freak" in their character development. You get the feeling that Oikawa, Hinata, Aone, and everyone else got so powerful because they took their innate strengths and honed them incredibly well.
>> ARTICLE
This is precisely why I love this show. People like them have natural talent, yes, but they so obviously work and practice and put their blood, sweat, and tears into becoming so skilled. 
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoy the score keepers little comments. They are just so casual compared to the tension of the games
>> ARTICLE
Yo, the bathroom has become a magnet of challenges.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably bias because he's my favorite, but I love how Nishinoya continually lives up to his Guardian Deity status with well-timed reassurances to both Ennoshita and Asahi.

Damn that final play had my heart on edge though. I'm really happy with all of the focus we've had on Ennoshita these past few episodes. I hope to see a lot more of him in the future now that he's got a real fire lit in his heart now -- though admittedly not *too* much since I still want to see a ton of Daichi (who unfortunately got a series of welcome-back punches from Suga right after he came back). That Daichi trusted him with the last few plays was really heartwarming too.

Once again while I'm really happy that Karasuno won, I'm still upset that their opponents lost.

I'm assuming Aoba Josai wins against Date Tech though due to the sheer focus in the OP/ED they get. I'm sure I'll still watch that match on the edge of my seat though. It'll be a nice parallel to S1 if Karasuno can win on a rematch vs Aoba Josai to finish out this season.

edit: removed an unnecessary apostrophe
>> ARTICLE
I end up thinking about this after any episode featuring Tsuki and Yamaguchi, but think about what you thought about them when you were first introduced to them. Now think about how you feel about them now.

At what point did I go from thinking they were jerks to thinking they were vital parts of the team and members of the cast? It just sort of happened at some point.
>> ARTICLE
That scene at around the 18 minute mark where it looks like Hinata is standing alone but then you realize Kags is beside him was really really cool. Good symbolism for how they achieve success.
>> ARTICLE
This was fucking great
>> ARTICLE
This show is like the apex of what I love about sports anime. I love all these characters; I think the Wakunan game is my favorite game of the series so far!
>> ARTICLE
Johzenji and [0-to-best-girl-in-5-seconds Misaki](http://i.imgur.com/1SPEuO0.png) were pretty damn good too, though
>> ARTICLE
Really the only right answer for being excited to go to the bathroom. Good call Kageyama [](http://i.imgur.com/kN9kEcU.png)
>> ARTICLE
What a game! Props to both of teams, as usual in Haikyuu!!, you will feel despair no matter which team has won the match. It's very nice to see Kageyama and Hinata funny interaction in this episode. When Hinata said to Kageyama "Why do you have to break my heart?", I was laughing loudly. It was phrased differently in the translated manga chapter, so it's sort of becomes nice little surprise. 


Ennoshita's last receive was amazing. He also displays his ability to commandnas future captain. We definitely need to get more Ennoshita! Also the last bit when Yamaguchi went to bathroom. God dammit that poop/shit joke will always funny! It's also such a nice display how all of first years are in that scene.


Last but not the least, dateko and seijoh chant all over the stadium gives me chills! 
>> ARTICLE
I really would like to see another Date Tech vs. Karasuno. But it's shounen and im certain that Aoba Johsai will win next match so Karasuno can have their "revenge".
>> ARTICLE
I'm loving how the other characters in Karasuno, like Ennoshita, are now getting motivated to not only be in the team, but to *actively play* during matches. Hopefully we may see the same thing with the other characters (Yamaguchi will succeed next time I'm sure). 

Hype for seeing Mad-Dog chan play next week!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Without knowing where the manga ends up making it to. Whether they just run through Hinata and Kageyama as first years. Or make it to a point where they are second years it's interesting because normally the backups literally just exist to justify the player being off the court for a couple of minutes to recouperate.

But this is the first team sports anime where it seems like the team is actually trying to make sure they are competitive in the future as well.

---

If you were to take Kuroko, a year later, half the team is gone, and they haven't spent a lot of time making sure their backups can really take their place.
>> ARTICLE
As always, Haikyuu manages to make me feel both happy and sad at the same time. Also i'm gonna miss Touma, Index III when?
>> ARTICLE
My favorite part was the final shot of Takeru/Wakunan against the fall-colored trees; it gave me chills, esp when you compare it to the one opening shot of the rain outside the venue. It really gives off the impression that both teams are taking something positive away from the match, even if it doesn't seem like it at first.
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting that Karasuno is continually recognized as continually recognized as this offensive power house. It's mentioned that they have the fire power to break through, but their defense seems pretty under rated. Hinata is amazing and Kageyama is a genius, but that defense! With Daichi, they've got a very solid ability to receive, complimented by the best Junior High libero. Tsukki's ability to read offensive plays and shore up his blocking is growing by the game. It's no iron wall, but it's getting good.
>> ARTICLE
Damn it, I couldn't help be tear up a bit this episode.
It hurt to see Ennoshita be so hard on himself even though they won. It was the first time we got to see him play but I already like him a lot since hes actually really relatable. 
Felt so bad for the other team too, especially when the captain started crying :( Damn you Haikyuu and all your sympathetic opponent teams!
>> ARTICLE
I am so so so excited to see Oikawa and Iwaizumi in action again next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Ok so as I mentioned in FTF I just got caught up with Haikyuu earlier today. The wait to see how this match would pan out has been a very painful few hours (and that's only partly due to the killer sore throat I've got). Now I have to wait an entire week for the next episode? I honestly don't know how I'm going to cope.

Super glad Daichi made it back safe and sound for their next match but I'm also happy that we got a spotlight on Chikara, and by extension the other 2nd years, these past few episodes. I have no idea how far this series will go but it gives a strong hope for a solid team even after the 3rd years move on from Karasuno.

This show is just so insanely awesome and is easily sailing to a 10/10 finish, joining the first season for me to give a perfect score.

Man, every single one of these episodes brings me close to man tears out of sheer happiness at the growh of Karasuno players.

Easily one of my favorite things about this anime is that I feel like I never actually know who is going to win, even though of course the hero team is going to win. You really get to feel the tension when Karasuno is backed into a corner.

Ah this show continues to be amazing. I'm glad that I can still count on good ol' Haikyuu.
I don't remember it from the manga, but I really liked the moment where Nishinoya complimented Ennoshita on his receive.

Still looking forward to Yamaguchi getting the spotlight eventually.

Also looking forward to what appears to be the season's final match of Karasuno vs. one of their two rival teams. :D

The only thing that could make this series better is if there were some epic rallies going back and forth with little to no monologue.

I got so emotional towards the end. "The Losers" was a proper title. Not everyone in the winning team won.
>> ARTICLE
And simultaneously, they also don't just focus on the winning team, and we're reminded of the losing team as well. This series > 
>> ARTICLE
Ennoshita got his time to shine yet he's still disappointed at his self.

Yamaguchi still regrets what he's done or haven't done for the team. You're gonna have your own time to shine bruh.

Nishinoya still badass as always. Getting a compliment from a great libero about receiving would really lift one's spirit.

Tsuki is still sharp as always, noticing very small details at everything. The one I'm most excited to see shine in this show but we still have long long way to go.

Btw the bathrooms in this anime is really where all action and drama takes place so when a character goes in a bathroom, you know shits gonna happen.
>> ARTICLE
The amount of detail the animators put into this was amazing; notice that right after Kageyama tells Hinata to watch the ball, the following play by the opponent tricks Hinata into jumping just a [bit](http://i.imgur.com/nb4WdPl.png), while Kageyama sees through it and immediately goes to the ball, while Hinata lags slightly behind, which leads perfectly into the gap formed in the block right after.
>> ARTICLE
Kinda disappointed that Suga didn't play any part in the victory. With Daichi gone you would think that Suga would be the vice captain of sorts and he would finally be able to step up to the plate and help the team over the line. I understand that he's a setter and a double setter line up is probably not ideal but him not having anything to do with the win is quite strange to me.
>> ARTICLE
Finally catched up to Haikyuu!!, it's such an amazing series and this episode was insane!

I think that Takeru was influenced by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQimzAluRg) player. Pretty awesome that there is someone in real life that can do that.

Anytime I describe Haikyuu to people, I always put it as the pinnacle of what Sports anime has been up until now. I think it really is the finest combination of reasons I love Sports anime. That being said, it doesn't really have twists and turns, and there's no real original aspect to it. They just took the best parts of everything before it and brought them all to a perfect 10.

From here on out, the genre is going to need a new spin to get the same results.

ENNOSHITAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I've waited for this moment for so long. Ennoshita's so awesome. The flashback was really well done.

Also precious Yamaguchi. Tsukishima encouraging him (in his own way) was nice.

Agreed. Love the whole "2 sides of cowardice" thing they had there. Seamless transition between character focus and perspective.

Ennoshita Chikara... he sure lives up to his name.

(on a serious note, Ennoshita means "under the floor" = "behind the scene")

Wow. He really emulates that name.

*ooooh!*

is that also why the furudate also makes these silly parodies of popular movies starring the haikyuu cast as ennoshita's films? haha!

>> ARTICLE
ha ha, yeah, it's supposed to illustrate someone very strong and powerful supporting "the floor" underneath for those on stage, without getting any attentions from the audience.
>> ARTICLE
so perfect for ennoshita. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
After the flashback all I could think about was how nice it was to see everyone encouraging Ennoshita when he entered the game. As soon as he calmed down He acted like a vice captain. The team respects him and the two years agree with him being the next captain. I like him so I don't mind him being the captain.

Yamaguchi coming into the game got me really excited. I've been waiting for him to shine. It was a little frustrating watching him be afraid of using his serve. Ennoshita stopping the coach from going off on Yamaguchi just adds to his captain levels. I'm not losing hope, the next time we see Yamaguchi he's going to have it ready for action.
>> ARTICLE
>  It was a little frustrating watching him be afraid of using his serve.

It's a matter of both self-confidence and his role on the team. We see him practicing his serve and in 2 actual matches. In match 1, he didn't get his serve in play and today's match saw him get lucky to have it tip over the net. His only job is to make the other team have to receive a tough serve and in his 2 game experiences he views it as a failure.  

To add to the lack of purposeful success, his lack of confidence in himself has to make him view his place within the heads of his teammates as someone that can't do their job if he doesn't put his serve into play. As Asahi admitted earlier in the show while still practicing his jump serve, he ran away much like Yamaguchi did here.  Yamaguchi doesn't get other ways to "prove his worth" to his teammates, so he rationalized that just getting the serve into play was much more worthwhile than doing his jump float serve.

Source: I play volleyball a lot and have been through this personally and with teammates

I think the Yamaguchi stuff is pretty realistic though. I don't play volleyball, but I've had times in my first year or so of playing badminton where I served the bird out and then panicked and did the wimpiest serve, etc.

Yeah, from a story standpoint, Yamaguchi had to suffer in this one so we could see Ennoshita is the next Daichi. The point of the episode being that Ennoshita knows what it's like to be a wrangler of over-excited wild ones, and also knows what it's like to run away when you're feeling scared.

Also lol, I can't help but feel Yamaguchi gets *such* a raw deal. I know that's the lot of a pinch server and stuff but I mean he gets 20 seconds of match experience the entire season long and then it's like 'hey go in there and score some points at this VITAL juncture', haha. Guy's got frayed nerves to start with. 
>> ARTICLE
Yamaguchi hasn't been shown much love as of yet. I'd be extremely pleased if in the future he saves the team big time.
>> ARTICLE
He'll have his big moment soon, don't worry! :)
>> ARTICLE
He's probably my favourite. I just really enjoy characters that start so low on their arc so they've got plenty of room to grow. And boy did they start Yamaguchi low, lol. Poor guy.

I have a feeling if Haikyuu goes long enough to see them in 3rd year, this episode will prove to be the one that has both future captains in it. Ennoshita for next year, Yamaguchi the year after. Ennoshita is basically Yamaguchi one year on.
>> ARTICLE
I'd think Tsukishima would be captain when they're third years. Maybe it's just my bias towards him, but we've seen plenty of captains that are all scheming defensive players. I think with Tsukki finally getting into it, he's going to be on top of people and will be in control of the defense by that point in the series.
>> ARTICLE
Could well be if they continue his development path. He'd have to change a hell of a lot to even want to be the captain, but that's the thing about sports anime characters, they change a lot, haha.

I've actually seen a pretty convincing argument for Tsukki/Yamaguchi taking on the role together as co-captains, too. Tsukki to kick people's asses and Yamaguchi to look after them when they're down. Because, a bit like Daichi and Suga, the only one who's allowed to put Tsukki in his place is Yamaguchi, hah. They've got some good parallels going on.
>> ARTICLE
Understandable. I just see him as being a lot like Kuroo in the future. Roughly the same height, but Tsukki definitely would need to put on muscle. Personality wise, I could easily see Tsukki being the exact same.

Of course, they could go with the Oikawa approach. Have Tsukki as captain, and have Yamaguchi play the Iwaizumi role. Just be the pillar to keep him in check.
>> ARTICLE
Hasn't he already by getting Tsukki to actually put some effort in?
>> ARTICLE
Seeing my favourite character leave was brutal but wow Ennoshita did shine in this ep.

Really wanted Yamaguchi to have his awesome moment though :(
>> ARTICLE
[With low confidence comes a low play-making ability...](http://i.imgur.com/D6b3S8L.png)
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda happy they had Tsukki trying to encourage Yamaguchi and get him to relax, its just nice seeing their friendship work both ways.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously..  I can totally respect the show for showing the struggles of players who aren't superhero talented and have to work for their place on the team, but Yamaguchi's only known suffering.
>> ARTICLE
You know, it wasn't till way after the episode ended that I realized we haven't seen Hinata/Kageyama in the spotlight for quite some time now. And I think it really speaks to the quality of the characters in a show when the watchers fail to notice and/or just don't care
>> ARTICLE
YAMAGUCHI WILL HAVE HIS MOMENT AND IT WILL BE GLORIOUS
>> ARTICLE
Its gonna come and when it does, I will be an inconsolable ball of emotions. I can feel it in me bones.
>> ARTICLE
HE BETTER!!
>> ARTICLE
If Yamaguchi hits an awesome serve and Tsukki freaks out this show will be my #1 forever
>> ARTICLE
What I loved about Ennoshita is that he didn't really come out of nowhere. They always put little hints throughout the show that he was a calming force in the team. Seeing his character get fleshed out was a classic Haikyuu moment.
>> ARTICLE
> They always put little hints throughout the show that he was a calming force in the team. 

Yeah loved how they flashed back to them :)
>> ARTICLE
Why is it I'm chopping onions when Haikyuu is on?! Dammit that whole flashback to Ennoshita was perfect and such a strong foundation for the character in the short time they had.

Also, Dammit Yamaguchi, I can see Ennoshita coming to his rescue again later in this match being he's ran before and Yamaguchi is thinking about running
>> ARTICLE
Somehow despite whatever the weather forecast, it's always raining in my face whenever I watch Haikyuu!!. And also I'm pretty sure time relativity theory works really well whenever I watch it. 20 minutes feels like 5 minuts :( 
>> ARTICLE
OMG RIGHT! Just as the ED starts I'm like "Fuck its already over?!?!"
>> ARTICLE
Damn right. That's me every time. Even though I keep checking on time stamp, but it still hit me so hard when ED starts. I was like... "Fuck, it's only 5 minutes in????" 
>> ARTICLE
It's the same when the little clips during the middle of the show play, its like "wait, we're half way through?"
>> ARTICLE
Yeah this episode was the only time I was actually surprised when the middle clip played.
>> ARTICLE
For today that break came and I said out loud "what, we're only 2 minutes in!"

Imagine my surprise when the episode actually ended 
>> ARTICLE
[I was hoping for more Tsukki so when the ED started I was like](http://i.imgur.com/I4HcSWx.jpg) 
>> ARTICLE
This show is so good with handling multiple plot points at once. Like in this match alone weve got Yamaguchis serve, Daichis injury, Ennoshita filling the captain spot, Tanakas stress over Daichi, Tsukki stepping his game up and all the issues with his brother, Captains battle, and actually winning the match. Like its so amazing how haikyuu handles telling a million stories all at once.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "I can't wait for more Tsukki development :S")
>> ARTICLE
> [i can't wait for](/s "His roar")


>> ARTICLE
And then there are people who think Haikyuu's second season sucks because the show doesn't focus on games entirely. I pity those people.
>> ARTICLE
It's really hard to believe that people are here solely for the games. I mean most of the time it doesn't even matter who wins cause you'll be sad either way. 
>> ARTICLE
IKR? One of the reasons why I love Haikyuu is that they focus on rival teams too, and they're not shown as "enemies" to main characters (Karasuno), just volleyball dorks who wants to play volleyball, have fun, improve themselves and win.
>> ARTICLE
All of the "enemies" are just huge nerds too. There isn't a single character in this show that you can justifiably hate.
>> ARTICLE
The only character I kind of hate is Oikawa. But that's because he rubs me the wrong way. 
>> ARTICLE
How can you hate such a lovable dork
>> ARTICLE
It's only kinda. And mostly because of Aoba Johsai beating them in season 1. I'm still bitter. 
>> ARTICLE
I love Oikawa because even though he has a terrible personality (Iwa's words), I believe half of it is an act to seem cool and hide his weaknesses, he's just an alien/space nerd who likes to netflix and chill with his friends or alone
>> ARTICLE
Oikawa can be sweet too!  He takes his nephew to volleyball practice and teaches him how to play.  I love that Oikawa is s space dork.

Why does Haikyuu always make me so emotional? ;___;

I just love how in Haikyuu they flesh out all of the characters so one can only feel for them. That's probably why Haikyuu is one of my favorite series.^^^^andvolleyballismyfavoritesportbutw/e

And I also really liked Oikawa's narration. His whole explanation just got even more tense because of that superb voice acting of Daisuke Namikawa.

Side note: Am I the only who chuckles every time when Mad Dog-chan protects his head because of Oikawa's serve in the opening?
>> ARTICLE
I seriously must not be paying enough attention to the opening cause I never booked that! I'm gonna see it every time now thanks to you lol.
>> ARTICLE
I love basketball, but Haikyuu is making me want to play Volleyball more. Argh, I want to play!
>> ARTICLE
I got back into volleyball because of it. I haven't played for seven years, so I can't serve anymore, but I can still dive, set, hit and tip like I did in high school

That's awesome! I wanna try and see if there aren't any group playing nearby. Basketball or Volleyball, preferably both. I'm greedy for some sports!
>> ARTICLE
I KNOW RIGHT. I READ THE MANGA SO I KNOW WHAT GOING TO HAPPEN BUT I STILL TEAR UP AT EVERY EPISODE. Seriously, its so well written. Its making grown men cry about volleyball

And women. I cry almost every episode. Not sadness but like pure emotion. 

Last week I drank a whole big bottle of wine because I was terrified Daichi was concussed and needed to cope. 
>> ARTICLE
Also another manga reader, I legit had to remind myself to breathe after that scene last week. Shit has me fucked up
>> ARTICLE
Ennoshita's scenes were awesome! Love how he stopped Ukai from screaming at Yamaguchi. 

I swear, when Yamaguchi's floater succeeds, it will be hype as shit! They are building this up since season 1. Don't worry, you'll get it soon. Also maybe, he can do more than that with more confidence.

Love how Tsukki gave him sympathy.

> it will be hype as shit

Understatement.

It was so simply done. "He knows." and that's all it took. It's a painful truth though.

Ennoshita is essentially the Simba to Daichis Mufasa. I mean he did the lion roar and everything.

Thought it was [a lovely bit](http://i.imgur.com/YKi8DkC.gifv) when Kiyoko went to dab the blood from Daichi's split lip (nice timing with the animation - a second after Daichi clapped a hand to his mouth: nice indeed). 

Karasuno's [previous captain's](http://i.imgur.com/Ar2bHtr.png) name is [Hiroki Kurokawa.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FvrfkKJV2uA/U-2yZByx_3I/AAAAAAAAM58/-J67hokxPWw/s16000/007.png)

It really is Ennoshita's time to shine though. I love this (arc? game?) both because it heavily involves Daichi, my favorite character (aka "the support guy that gets outshined by everyone") and because Ennoshita is the one taking his place--one of the second-year trio who normally don't get nearly as much screentime focus as the rest of the Karasuno gang. 

Seriously though, Daichi lost a motherFUCKING tooth. And then he congratulated a guilty Tanaka on winning a point. He's my favorite for a reason.  

Oh, and also Yamaguchi! (second favorite) Gotta love Yamaguchi. I feel like some people here aren't cutting him enough slack - he knows deep down that out of the four first years he's the 'last' ranked: the other three are part of the A team. He's not. That alone is enough to give anyone confidence issues.  He's barely been on the main court - so of course he's going to be nervous his first few times on it, especially since when he *is* called it's with the expectation that he's there to earn some (emergency) points - that's a *lot* of pressure on a kid who already knows he's not as...necessary as the other first years. As Ennoshita pointed out to Ukai, Yamaguchi *knows*. He knows more than anyone else. Maybe it's because I've been there (granted, in a choral/theatre context rather than a sports one) that I can empathize with him so much..that feeling of shame, that desperate desire not to let your teammates down...I know those feelings. It's not easy.

Give him time. [](/s "It'll be worth it.")

It's finally happening! This entire season. The entire season and we're finally here. I'm excited. Expect screenshots (and gifs?) to be edited in soon.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've been there too. I am there actually, and it's really frustrating. I want to be useful. It's way more fun when you can be counted on.

Like I've learnt from Haikyuu, things become a lot more fun when you don't suck at it.
>> ARTICLE
I am happy that Daichi isn't concussed. I was worried about that. But man, how metal was him spitting out that tooth and then trying to say he can still play. It seems to be a theme, first with Kageyama and his nosebleed and now Daichi with his mouth. 

Ennoshita was my pick for captain once Daichi leaves, I'm glad that the other 2nd years agree. I also think that his experience Leaving the team then coming back had augmented his feelings for the game. 

I felt bad for Yamaguchi. It must be nerve wracking to be put in as a pinch server and to have your first serve go almost the same way as it did against Aoba Johsai. I think that he had to falter for two reasons. 1 so that he can realize that he can't be afraid, because as he said to Tsukki, what do they have besides pride. And 2 so that Ennoshita can show that he can handle the duties of being a captain. The last thing Yamaguchi needed was for Ukai to yell at him, and Ennoshita knew that and deflected it. He will make a great captain next year. 

Great episode. I'm glad it didn't end on a cliffhanger like last week did, I don't know what I would have done. This week was terrible, I was counting down the days and hours until I could get to the next episode. Once this season is over I'm definitely picking up the Manga. I can't go that long without a Haikyuu fix, that's for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
>It seems to be a theme

Characters getting injured and saying they can still play is like Trope #1 of sports anime.

It is true though. Everybody wants to continue playing.

I need to watch more sports animes. I've only watched Haikyuu and the first season of Free!

You need to finish free! It'll be a fun ride with friendship and crying and just watch Eternal Summer.

I cried at the end of the first season with the relay. What a touching moment. 
>> ARTICLE
There's even more crying in eternal summer.

Try Big Windup (AKA Ookiku Furikabutte).

It's probably one of the most serious sports manga out there since the author is a sports psychiatrist or something, but the anime has all the excitement and cuteness of Haikyuu.

Yes, yes. Submit to the glory that is sports anime.

I started cross game but it emotionally abuses me. I still hate my friend who recommended it to me... Only sorta, because I do like it, but I can't binge it.

Try Baby Steps if you want a sports anime that's relatively light and fun.

Its a true thing of sports. Back in highschool football we had a player break his finger who just wrapped it up and kept on playing. Everyone tries to hide injuries.

Yamaguchi serving stressed me out so much
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read ahead so this is all speculation (please don't spoil me) but [spec](/s "the development they are giving to Ennoshita and Yamaguchi has me worried we're heading towards another loss at the end of the season and they're setting the stage for the next year.  I'd really like to see them make it to nationals with this team but purely by an episode standpoint I don't see that happening this season.")
>> ARTICLE
Nonono [](/s "they're going to win and make it to nationals and win that too and then after the third years leave Haikyuu will keep going, following Hinata and Kageyama through their second and third years, because it's amazing and shouldn't end so that's what their development is for.") (I haven't read the manga either so I hope you're wrong)
>> ARTICLE
Alternatively [](/s "they could win the tournament and end the season there and have the 3rd season, hopefully, start as they are training for nationals :)")
>> ARTICLE
There's only 7 episodes left for this season & this game isn't even finished yet. They won't have time to fit more than one game after this one into this season.
>> ARTICLE
Either of these three things will happen.

 - They will lose now.
 - They will lose to Seijoh (don't think this will happen given last year's loss, it would be a real downer)
 - They will win versus Seijoh and the anime will end there, 3rd season starts with them preparing to the nationals.

The other option involves Seijoh losing to someone and they fighting this someone instead but highly unlikely considering the OP.
>> ARTICLE
Seijou isn't the only team they'd have to beat. They'd have to beat Shiratorizawa as well to get to nationals.
>> ARTICLE
> They'd have to beat Shiratorizawa as well to get to nationals.

I thought it would have like 2 team divisions, and both winners would go to the nationals. In that case, they would win versus Seijoh, and the 3rd season would begin with them fighting Shiratorizawa, they don't have time for both.
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of what happens, I kind of hope the story continues after the current 3rd years leave since the development of the first years seem to be the main focus.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree. Obviously I don't want it to go on forever and drop in quality, but at the same time I love it so much I don't want it to end so soon.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Haikyuu is my favorite so I'd hate to see it go to shit. Maybe though when it does end (if he doesn't make it follow the first years after this year) it'll be like KnB and have a spin off where they're older or playing on a national team or something. 
>> ARTICLE
As long as we get more high quality Haikyuu I'm happy.
>> ARTICLE
Also speculation [](/s "the way they set up the match with Nekoma been the last with the current coach, make me believe they will at least get that far.")
>> ARTICLE
Oh god,  that was a feels overload. Definitely my favorite of the new season. Goddamn. All these characters are so complex and well-written.
>> ARTICLE
Slightly unrelated to the episode (Spotlight on my boy Enoshita was awesome!) but seeing Takeru's jump serve was amazing and I can't wait to see Oikawa's jump serve again and perhaps even better animated than in season 1. Seijoh/Oikawa's theme is probably my favourite Haikyuu OST.
>> ARTICLE
It's Ennoshita's senpai time! I also love how Furudate definitely didn't only, you know... out of no where gives the flashback for Ennoshita's character exposition. If you guys remember, Ennoshita and the other two second years mentioned about how they had quit the team to Hinata and Kageyama when they were in first training camp. It's nice that they use that information. A solid foundation. Just like Tsukki's character development, we also got a tiny glimpse before second season on how he "hates" overexcited players, how he didn't want to put an effort and keep saying "this is just a club." 

I totally forgot that we would get Yamaguchi's development too in this episode. I love how his moment gives us glimpse on how strong relationship between Yamaguchi and Tsukki. Tsukki knew from the moment Yamaguchi took second ball to serve, that Yamaguchi wouldn't try a jump float. And he silently gave him a towel. It's very nice bond between these two. 

Also Oikawa san's analysis is accurate as hell, it's scary. He's truly the orchestra master.

I think it's safe to say that the team will be in good hands when the 3rd year guys leave 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know the name of the OST that was playing when Ennoshita got the serve?
>> ARTICLE
Why can Haikyuu make me tear up so much. Like I counted like 4-5 times this episode alone. Yamaguchi's little bit hit me really hard though, he gets me.
>> ARTICLE
Ennoshita stepping into place and guiding the team was absolutely wonderful to watch -- especially his little step-aside at the end of his speech to have Asahi reassure Tanaka. That was super adorable/amusing -- along with how everyone was vigorously supporting him.

It'll be amazing when Yamaguchi's able to get his confidence up to the point where he can pull off the jump floater consistently in competition without tripping over himself. Can't wait to see him get there. =D

Also -- it was really weird seeing First Year Nishinoya without the streak in his hair. Just as adorable though.
>> ARTICLE
I love how the episode opens up with basically, we don't need to overplay the drama, you know Karasuno is gonna win so let's just get that fact out of the way and on with the show. 

I like the new captain, gonna be interesting to see him as the main captain next year but I wish he had more of role prior to this, it almost felt like they transplanted him back into old scenes, George Lucas style. 

I'm glad he stepped in for Yamaguchi, those moments where you mess up but you know exactly what you did really hit you hard, and having someone berate you for what you already know on top of that is painful. 

I would say slightly too many flashbacks this episode, but still a good one none the less. ~~(may have also forgot they are now playing best of 5 it caught me off guard when 2-0 wasn't a victory.)~~


>> ARTICLE
That was how I interpreted it too, until I realised that the guys in school was actually the players they played last time, not the current opponents!
>> ARTICLE
No no, still best of 3 for now. Yamaguchi took us to the end of set 1, and the little flash forward at the end showed Karasuno behind in the 2nd set.
>> ARTICLE
I swear they destroyed this team in the first set... I must be going mental.
>> ARTICLE
The episodes are being split in really thematically good places but really awkward scoreboard places, lol. Add to that the amount of flashback we had in this one, including cuts to Jozenji AND Seijoh, and yeah. I can totally get where things get blurry, lol
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I don't know how I got it into my head that the time out when the other team began to play better was the end of the first set... I'm an idiot.

Doesn't help that Haikyuu! airs on a Saturday night (7pm here in the UK), I always want to watch it asap but that generally means after having one too many drinks.

Aw man. 7AM on Sunday over here in Oz. I...I don't know which I'd prefer, lol 
>> ARTICLE
Think I'd prefer the Sunday, wake up on a sunday morning, drag myself down to the place where the tea and bacon resides, then crack on some Hype Volleyball Shenanigans, sounds like a good way to start a sunday.

Actually it is pretty awesome. I just watched the whole thing with a coffee from my machine and some peanut butter on toast and now it's only 8am, so there's a whole day to go.

Yepp, whereas it's 9pm and I'm here like well all I've done today is my weekly shop and watched Bakuman... and no town tonight so Haikyuu! was the last thing I was looking forward to, kind of a wasted Saturday... Oh well back to Bakuman. :P

hahahahahahahahaahhahah dat ending haha

Fuck you too, Haikyuu

I'm glad that we finally saw Yamaguchi.
And I'm wondering... How long will these series last? It looks like there has to be something after this tournament, without current third-years.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really looking forward to the next episode! More focus on Enoshita and Yamaguchi is always a good thing!
>> ARTICLE
Time for the side characters to shine!

Hypekyuu had done it again. My favorite scene is Ukai walking to Yamaguchi and yelling his name then Chikara stops him. Intense moment!

Hello, 

So I just finished episode 11 and I'm wondering if I should keep watching or wait until it's done airing. How big is the hype right now? 
>> ARTICLE
The hype is big and constantly growing. I was sorely disappointed when I was called into work early today and therefore could not watch the sub the minute it dropped. I mean... I complained to my coworkers about it.

I have to say that riding aboard the hype train with everybody here on this thread is pretty great though, but at the same time, I much prefer marathoning shows when possible, but I just am so desperate to watch the show I can't stop myself. The show is great.
>> ARTICLE
Manga reader here. Hype will get worse with each episode. 
>> ARTICLE
The hype will just keep on going so I'd say just keep watching.

Hype is definitely getting up there after this episode, and I can only see it getting bigger later on.

>> ARTICLE
After a string of really great episodes, this one felt a bit weak in comparison. I was fully pumped after the last week's cliffhanger, but just didn't feel it in this episode. Idk if it was too many flashbacks, or introducing a new character or being let down that they didn't use Sugawara. I also got fooled by the first scene, confusing the previous opponents with the current ones.

Anyway, I'm sure next episode is going to be much better, because anything below great is super rare in this awesome series!
>> ARTICLE
Thought it was one of the best, the ones where characters get build-up, that's what Haikyuu excels at.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry but watching Yamaguchi is so damn frustrating, I really dont like his character, yet. I assume he is going to get "his" arc, because for now, he is basically just a crybaby clinging on to Tsukishima. The rest was great, the Vice Captain seems like a pretty good fit. 

EDIT: /r/anime delivers downvotes because of what? I dont like ONE character on the show? HE IS USELESS, he has done NOTHING positive that we get to see, except motivate Tsukishima a bit during his arc. I love Haikyuu, but I can't stand Yamaguchi, YET.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah well, it's good to see flawed characters, because almost every character of Haikyuu has a flaw, which is anxiety and inferiority complex for Yama.
>> ARTICLE
He got the most annoying flaws a character can have, I would be okay if he only got 1 of them but he got both and he has both happening EVERY TIME HE IS ON THE SCREEN.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, you don't overcome in problems in one night. It wouldn't be realistic.
>> ARTICLE
But you don't show these problems whenever you're in the screen, [manga](/s "also, he overcomes these problems in the next game so this is bullshit!")
>> ARTICLE
It's not the flaw, it's the character. He's done nothing useful, all he did was go to one of the older guys and asked to be trained. 

Remember, Hinata also had "stage fright" and hit Kageyama in the head, and got over it pretty quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Not everyone can get over something so quickly, but a moment of event can change things - we see that he may show a certain change later too from this episode, or at least he learned something the hard way. I find him necessary for Tsukki. The creator is trying to reach out many different types of characters as he thinks he needs in this show, and you see that some people can relate to Yamaguchi, even if you can't. I hope you're still enjoying the show anyways.
>> ARTICLE
Yamaguchi's such a pussy it actually annoys me
>> ARTICLE
He's justified imo. I used to play Baseball before and still got nervous every game even when I was a regular player. Imagine hardly ever playing in a real game and when you finally do get called in during a super important game the whole team is relying on you to get that point.
>> ARTICLE
Sure, but not being able to move is kinda overkill on the nervousness department.
>> ARTICLE
I mean being able to hit a quick with your eyes closed can be seen as overkill as well but hey it's anime.
>> ARTICLE
And I'm sure that annoys some people as well
>> ARTICLE
Im pretty sure if the main ability of the main characters annoyed you, you probably wouldnt have watched this show all the way into the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed but I'm still here because it doesn't bother me. That doesn't mean Yamaguchi can't annoy me.
>> ARTICLE
I mean the guy has some pretty clear anxiety issues to start with. 

In any case, he's just a product of the needs of the story. The story being told today is that Ennoshita is a good choice for a replacement captain. So they made Yamaguchi's feet freeze so Ennoshita could lunge in and save the day, and then step in to protect Yamaguchi from the coach at the end because he knew being yelled at is the last thing that'd help. 

Ennoshita quit the team because his skills weren't up to snuff and he kept being yelled at by a Ukai. It's just showing that he knows exactly how Yamaguchi feels.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, when I played sports, before every game I got super nervous even though I had done it many times before. Also considering he messed up the previous time and then almost messed up again, its understandable for him to take a safer approach.
>> ARTICLE
That's true. Sometimes when you make a mistake it messes with you causing you to make even more mistakes.
>> ARTICLE
On tilt. It's the worst :(

No.9 anime > 10x manga.
>> ARTICLE
tbh I feel that way about Haikyuu's anime as a whole in that it exceeds the manga by a long shot.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say by a long shot, but the movements are really good animated, which is hard to do in a manga. But most of the time the manga looks great as well (especially no. 6).
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the anime is so smooth and the soundtrack adds that whole other level. Personally, the anime got me hooked, but I love the manga too. I feel like it conveys movement and action really well!  
>> ARTICLE
Well, that's(i think) exactly what he means. Haikyuu is all about motion, well anime is about motion, but Haikyuu has that feeling about it because its very attached to moving around and the flow of the players/ball. Obviously you're gonna think that anime is better than the manga because you're seeing everything moving, rather than just a still picture.
>> ARTICLE
It's like the opposite of Kuroko no Basuke for me. Haikyuu!!'s animation is very fluid and focused on motion, while the way Kuroko works is that the manga focuses a lot on making each individual panel look really dynamic. There are so many times where I think the Kuroko manga did it better than the anime (though the anime takes the cake every once and awhile, especially with Aomine).

Feel bad for all the plebs that aren't watching Haikyuu this season. Probably my favourite show of the season. 
>> ARTICLE
Didn't like sports anime because of Kuroko no Basket.  
Got bored as fuck and for some reason I haven't figured out, decided to watch first episode of Haikyuu just to "kill some time".  
Ended up killing way more time than expected because I binge watched the whole first season, found it amazingly funny and nice to watch because of the "power progression" when it comes to characters, even for Shoyo you get his background of practicing alone and with people who didn't play volleyball and he suddenly becomes this star with the help of Kageyama.  
Season 2 has been cool as fuck, hopefully it'll top S1 which was already insanelly good.
>> ARTICLE
somehow, this was my story this season. Was waiting for some "cool series" to come on Sunday, wasn't really following anything else during the week, and started watching hte 1st episode of S2 in boredom. Now I look forward to saturdays more than sundays, wondering how the heck i got to this point
>> ARTICLE
Definitely AOTS.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, no idea why so many people avoid sports anime around here.
>> ARTICLE
Well I mean it's easy to get burned on bad sports series.

But it's like any other genre, there's a ton of garbage and then maybe 5% of all of them are actually any good.

And when a sports series is on point it can be *great.*
>> ARTICLE
Because an absolute shitload of sport shows are just average. And having Kuroko no Basket as the most popular one in the genre isn't helping, because it embraces everything people dislike in shounen shows without the satisfaction of Luffy/Naruto/Ichigo physically beating up their opponents.

I love sport shows, and I've followed every sport show in the last couple of years. But let's not act as if Haikyuu isn't pretty much a revelation to the genre.

Free, Ace no Diamond & YowaPedal are great for sports fans, but aren't the things to draw in new fans. Kuroko no Basket lacks substance, Chihayafuru was too niche to call it an actual sport show and Baby Steps' production quality was utter shite in its first season, on top of not sucking you in immediately with its slow start.

That leaves us with Ookiku Furikabutte & Cross Game (both which stayed low-key, although I see Cross Game being referenced more and more!) and a couple of long-running shows before we get back to Hajime no Ippo, *the* sport show ever made.

Haikyuu is an outlier. Many shows lack pacing, substantial character growth off the field and a diverse enough cast to not turn it into a self-insert power show. It's sad that that is what makes that Haikyuu is not as popular as it could be, because it's the best sport anime there is in my opinion, even surpassing Hajime no Ippo, but there is a definite explanation as to why the sport genre is in the state it is in.
>> ARTICLE
It also doesn't help that the Eyeshield 21 anime is absolutely horrible compared to the source material too. 
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru is in some no man's land where its neither a sports or a shoujo (at least I don't seem to think so) and sadly it doesn't get the number of fans that it should
>> ARTICLE
> sadly it doesn't get the number of fans that it should

I'm actually surprised by the amount of fans it does have. It's recommended and praised really often on this sub and I didn't think it came close to the excitement and feels you got from Hajime no Ippo or Haikyuu.

I thought Chihayafuru's sport was hard to relate too. I just don't think it portrayed the hardwork, sacrifice, and dreams like Hajime No Ippo or the special comradery you see in Haikyuu or most other sports anime.

I know it's just a matter of preference, but what in your opinion made it so great?


>> ARTICLE
First of all, the big thing that drew me in was the typical sports premise about making a team and competing to win competitions, that changed into me wanting Chihaya and Tachi to succeed. Although not on the level of Ippo's sacrifice (not going to school to become a pro boxer) you can see the dedication that Chihaya puts in which is in its own sense endearing. As you can see that she realises that she is lacking in certain areas and works hard to overcome her shortcomings 

 She never backs down from strong opponents and it makes you want to cheer for her, and every game is going to be different with its own circumstances unlike say Kuroko no Basket where you know  Kuroko is going to step in steal the ball and pass it to kagami who is going to do a slam dunk (I read the entire manga btw) and also you never know who is going to win. Especially since the Karuta tournament that Chihaya is in is a team based tournament where they have to get majority of the wins so its not a guarantee that Chihaya is going to win every match unlike Kuroko No Basket where you basically know hey these guys are definitely going to win.

Another thing that Chihayafuru does well is to portray realism in a sense, it doesn't allow Chihaya to win matches that she should be able to and theres usually even when she wins its not down to some bullshit thing like friendship power or anything but an actually well explained reason. An example would be like [Kuroko No Basket Spoilers](/s "How Kuroko manages to win Akashi and his team of 4 uncrowned generals with their honestly half baked team that won because of some bullshit mid game power spike")

And thats only talking about Chihaya and none of the other characters like Tachi Nishida Oe Desktomu (I can't remember his actual name, damn I'm a failure)

And thats only Season 1 and not Season 2 which brings more characters in and shows even more development for the group 


PS sorry for not being able to do spoilers properly, really cant figure out why it can't work just hover over it thanks
>> ARTICLE
That, and the fact it has 2 seasons yet still no conclusion.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is that it deserves a 3rd season, the amount of source material is incredible, the anime ends of at around chapter 90+ and as of now there are up to 154 chapters (currently at 114) and whats more is that one chapter has 30+ pages instead of the normal 17-20 which means that in terms of source material there's at least enough for one more season or two at least
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't having average series apply to every genre out there? I agree that Kuroko no Basket gives the genre a bad rep and that Haikyuu!! is an outlier, but if something nailing both production values and storytelling can't hook audiences its going to be a really difficult job.
>> ARTICLE
I should've been more clear I guess.

Because the sports genre is a smaller one, the percentage of quality shows has to be higher than in other genres because you still need an actual number of good shows to interest people. I only feel comfortable recommending Haikyuu or Ippo to people unfamiliar with the genre.
>> ARTICLE
 think it's my top 3 all time

I love seeing everyone trying to learn new techniques, well except Tsukki :(.

What was kageyamas goal in going to the kids camp anyway? To visualize Hinata hitting his tosses? Hahaha

Anyway, so it looks like kageyama has done some introspection, humbling himself in the process, and decided to use his training time to practice this new setting technique, somewhat blindly, without any assurance Hinata can pull this off. But given that Hinata has placed his trust 100% in him from the beginning, it's damn satisfying to finally see kageyama reciprocate and to have to attempt something with his own eyes closed this time around.

Both of them are still constipated high school boys who don't talk about their feelings though.
>> ARTICLE
> What was kageyamas goal in going to the kids camp anyway?

They didn't include a full translation of the poster in the last episode, but the poster includes "Learn from a pro" at the top so I assume he went to ask a pro about his situation only to run into Oikawa. 
>> ARTICLE
ahaha, so we got the very impassioned bowing scene instead. he already bowed once to tsukkishima so he probably figured he couldn't go any lower
>> ARTICLE
I just meant the translation wasn't included so his reason for going wasn't as clear as in the manga. The whole Oikawa scene was in the Manga as well.

Great thing was they made Oikawa even more of an ass than in the Manga. Didn't think that was possible.

I love how the team just found that common ground that they all need to improve as individuals if they want to succeed. We didn't need a huge cheesy speech or anything, because obviously the athletes want to get better. Im hype as shit to see noyas toss, and yamaguchis float serve and whatever the freak duo will manage to pull next!

So *is* going from chibisuke to chibitaro a promotion? I have to know. ^^^^And ^^^^so ^^^^does ^^^^Hinata.

I swear all my friends ask me how I watch anime with volley. The first season had the best character development. Imperfect human beings trying their best to fight. Then they realize they can't fight themselves and they cooperate. You see the struggle the problems , the team bonding together. They lose , they try to evolve, they fight and they still try to figure this out. I mean it's basically how life is supposed to be with bonus of hyped fights in volleyball and laugh as well. This and your lie in April are truly masterpieces in my book.

oh thank god this was animated now. i never really quite understood the tempo principle when i read it in the manga. another great episode that was cut short. i wanted to see them play nekoma!

edit: also my fave moment has to be when the adviser, shimizu and yachi brought some snacks that made our libero, spiker, and decoy so happy.

EDIT EDIT: ALSO **YUI!!!**

This show is so damn good, holy shit. Can't wait for what's to come.

Ahh, Oikawa, trash king as always <3

Finally, Karasuno starts to stop being a mediocre team who relies too much on Kageyama's genius and starts improving themselves individually.

Never has a training episode in a sports anime been this very good!
>> ARTICLE
Jesus... this is the first training arc of a sports anime since Slam Dunk that got me hyped so much for the succeeding episodes. Even thought I don't see Karasuno doing perfectly what their practicing in time for the second leg of the training, I think it'll be enough to send chills down the spine to the other teams in the training camp. Especially Nekoma's coach.

Karasuno's still in the rough carbon that needs more time and polishing to become a crystal clear diamond.

Yeah that's how I feel as well. I mean, there was some foreshadowing, but we didn't *really* know. I don't like this sort of thing because now I know for sure it's happening and it kind of lessens the drama.

Love how Tsukishima really shines this episode by being proactive in strategy!
>> ARTICLE
Finally! I disliked how he seemed to disappear for long stretches as a major character this arc. He was almost a total background character these past few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Tsukki is and always has been the best character. It's just taking some people extra time to figure it out.
>> ARTICLE
I think until he got his arc about self confidence he wasn't really fleshed out enough for people to take notice of him.
>> ARTICLE
I love how deadpan he is most of the time but then quickly flashes the smuggest grin every time he does something right. Just Tsukki doing Tsukki things. 

Seriously, there needs to be a subreddit dedicated to Tsukki's grin. Or at least a comment face here.

It seems like a pretty huge step for Hinata, too. When he started out, he was just pure athleticism, to the point where the only way they could use him effectively was to have him close his eyes to completely remove his actual skill from the equation. 

Since then, we've seen him pick up a lot of new skills. But it's always been a sort of targeted thing. "Well I'm going to learn this bit now." 

But to my knowledge this is the first time he's actually been able to actually improvise successfully. It's not just another base repetition of thing A, B, or C. It's the subtle but important distinction between Hinata being a guy who plays volleyball, and Hinata being a *volleyball player.*
>> ARTICLE
Well he did practise hitting all sorts of tosses from all sorts of setters to be able to respond to unexpected situations better. So I'd say this is a result of one of his "well I'm going to learn this bit now"s. And such an exciting result at that!
>> ARTICLE
Damn it Haikyuu, I don't want to be super happy when Mad-Dog scores, stop showing his backstory and developing his character!
>> ARTICLE
I wish they did that a little earlier in the series, so we can have Hinata pair off against him as the two players who were inspired by volleyball heroes during their youth.
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie, got a little emotional about Mad-Dog. Got damnit Haikyuu, got me well again! This anime literally never stops surprising me, love it :).
>> ARTICLE
>stop showing his backstory and developing his character!

I swear this happens with every single character, and I love/hate it because it actually hurts when they lose. I'm going to be a damn mess at the end of this match, whatever the outcome.
>> ARTICLE
Ace of diamond does the same thing... god damn.
>> ARTICLE
God dammit Aoba Jousai is such a likable team.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to Haikyuu!! where you love all teams and every character becomes your adopted child.
>> ARTICLE
They're my favourite team, but I'd be lying if I said Karasuno doesn't have a special place in my heart.

The end of this match will be pain
>> ARTICLE
How do you like another team more than Karasuno?
>> ARTICLE
Not the person you are asking, but Haikyuu makes pretty much every team likable, so it's hard to hate anyone. We're usually given bits of backstory, though sometimes we get a lot more insight about the team/character (like with Oikawa, for instance), and it can be enough to make you like them and feel so much more attached to them, to the point where you find yourself cheering harder for opposing team than for Karasuno.

At least that's how it was for me; that's how I ended up where I am now, cheering for Seijou and doing my best to prepare for the inevitable heartbreak since they are not the protagonist rofl.


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I love every other team, but up to this point we've watched Karasuno grow for 45 episodes, it's hard to legitimately hope they lose.
>> ARTICLE
Oh don't get me wrong, I don't want Karasuno to lose, but it's just that at the same time, I don't want Seijou to lose either.

I'm absolutely the same way.

He's pretty annoying, but I do actually like him a lot after his backstory... just like every other character.                 

I hate his team's setter, though. Only character in the series I legitimately dislike, his attitude is so annoying.
>> ARTICLE
Akaashi is to me the most interesting character outside of Karasuno.

Bokuto too. He isn't your usual airheaded character. His relationship with Akaashi is pretty interesting. Opposites, but they get along with each other so well, and Akaashi takes care of him most of times (not a headcanon).

I don't think kuroko was trying to be realistic in any sense.

At least in the earlier part of the show it wasn't completely batshit crazy. I mean kuroko himself always was. But it was actual basketball otherwise

Then it turned into DragonBasketBall Z

Haikyuu hasn't even approached that sort of uncanny ability yet

>> ARTICLE
> Then it turned into DragonBasketBall Z
> 

You act like that's a bad thing
>> ARTICLE
Oh it's completely fine. But as a result after about the first half of season 1 it stopped being any sort of sport anime that might interest you in the sport itself because of it's craziness.

Looking forward to the Extra Game movie when it comes out

>> ARTICLE
I picked up volleyball as a hobby exactly a year ago. A few months after I started, my buddy told me to watch Haikyuu and no jokes it's helped me improve some parts of my game.

Coincidentally I also play middle blocker, feels so nice to get them quicks in.

If I was to play I would probably be a Libero, I'm short and don't have much jumping power. Matches look like they would be so fun though.

I started playing casual once a week this semester because of Haikyuu. Totally worth getting into, nothing feels better than getting a solid receive straight at you. Makes you feel like Daichi.

>> ARTICLE
I played for years and stopped playing because my team disbanded. I might get into it again one day though it will be really depressing to learn everything again.
>> ARTICLE
Played from grade school up through college. Even coached my little sister. 

It's an awesome sport. Probably my favorite to actually play. It's tedious though. The show does an almost perfect job at relaying how isolating it can be when on the court. Another point that was dead on was when someone was subbed in and the moment you cross the line you feel all the tension and momentum that's been going on the court.

"Yeah, finally time for my boy Hinata to deliver a thorough ass-kicking!"

"WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME?!"

I swear, Haikyuu possesses some kind of wonky time magic. How else could you explain the discrepancy between the timer on the video player and my mind which is telling me it's barely been 5 minutes?

I feel you completely! I just got done catching up 2 weeks ago, and now I have to deal with antagonizing wait that the current viewer has to deal with, with the end of each episode! The hype factor is so strong, I need to cooldown after each episode.

this show is just ridiculous

for the next haikyuu release whether it's a s3 or movie, they need to release the damn thing in one full segment without weekly airing. i swear its sacrilege to wait for this show weekly

I swear on everything holy, I check the timer thinking there's at least 10 minutes left, and there's 2 minutes and 51 seconds instead.

At this stage, we don't even need time machines. Just watch some Haikyuu if you want to travel forward in time.
>> ARTICLE
This show is going to drive me insane with suspense.
>> ARTICLE
It's really great seeing both Karasuno and Seijoh players stumble upon different ways to support the players on the court, and discover their own brand of teamwork. 


Hinata, possibly worried that Kageyama might be doubting himself in the face of Oikawa's genius, offers the [exact same cocky words of support] (https://57.media.tumblr.com/930f1a248f9b6f34f611c34e3c953c6e/tumblr_o3y4m4MMzq1tcr2fko1_540.gif) that had Kageyama given him under similar circumstances during the 1st season's Neighborhood association practice match. Tsukkishima steps up to cover for Tanaka and Noya when they need it. Yahaba whips Mad dog into shape for himself and his senpai. Oikawa is great with individuals on his team... and absolutely terrifying to his opponents
>> ARTICLE
So, I started watching *Haikyuu!!* last Saturday, watched through all of season one and got caught up just yesterday. My thoughts on the show as a whole so far: this is extreme hype. The only sports anime (if it counts) that I'd seen before is *Girls und Panzer*, and that definitely doesn't compare. I haven't been this excited about a show in a long while, and have had "Go go! Let's go! Let's go, Dateko!" stuck in my head lately. Wish the Crow's cheering section was a bit bigger.

Last episode was Yamaguchi's time to shine, and of all people, it seemed like this episode was Mad Dog-chan's. But Tsukishima had a few moments, and Hinata came in at the end with his "baseless courage" and downward spike. Definitely hyped for next episode.

Speaking of baseless, I have a theory that is probably way off. Feel free to correct it if so. But. I believe that the Little Giant is Sensei. This is based mainly on the similarity of their hair styles and size, plus the age is about right, and (to be honest) I just want it to be the case.

Also, thanks to /u/acrillex and /u/r_anime for recommending this show to me last week in FTF. Y'all rock.

>> ARTICLE
Kuroko's characters are so bland that I had a hard time caring about anything that was going on in the matches. Part of the reason Haikyuu is so amazing is that you truly want the players to succeed (whether they be on Karasuno or another team) due to *all of them* having personalities / hardships / etc which make you sympathize with them. In contrast Kuroko is basically just a bunch of boring anime archetypes vs a few nobodies + a douchebag.

I gotta do *Chihayafuru* first, but I'll do *Kuroko no Basket* once that's done.

They are both amazing in their own ways, so u wont lose out

You are in for a whole new world regarding sports anime. A lot of them have intense tourneys and great character building and it is such an underrated genre. What I like about Haikyuu is that it moves from backstory to flashbacks to actual action so seamlessly. While stuff like Girls und Panzer was more methodical with its pacing.

As someone who hasnt watched most of season 1 what games where the best ones

The best was probably the last one with Aoba Johsai.

Dateko's cheer is going to be stuck in your head for ages. It is *very* catchy.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I'll write my essay contest entry purely on analysing that cheer....
>> ARTICLE
That's actually a very popular theory, although many people like to debunk it by stating that Glasses Senpai had to have the very basic rules of volleyball explained to him early in season 1.  However I wouldn't be surprised if Glasses Senpai was at least related to the Little Giant in some way.
>> ARTICLE
> That's actually a very popular theory

Dang. I guess being original is impossible when you're late in joining the fandom.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think sensei is TLG, but if he somehow is, it would also be hilarious as Kamiya Hiroshi is his seiyuu...and this would make this the second "powerful little giant" he has voiced recently (After Levi).
>> ARTICLE
>Kamiya Hiroshi is his seiyuu...and this would make this the second "powerful little giant" he has voiced

Shamelessly going to count that as evidence for why Sensei **must** be TLG (aside: is that how "the Little Giant" is normally referred to by the fandom? Cool! Reminds me of HRG from *Heroes*.).
>> ARTICLE
Haha I just made up the acronym on the spot :D
>> ARTICLE
To be fair he also voices Akashi from Kuroko who also was "an all powerful little giant" (well compared to the rest of them )
>> ARTICLE
Sensei can't be the Little Giant. Sensei is 29 and the little giant is around 21, since he was in the same grade as Tanaka's sister.
>> ARTICLE
A ruse, I tell you!
>> ARTICLE
It's so weird to see a theory that Sensei is the little giant because just as I was watching the intro where Hinata and the little giant's figures sync up, it came into my mind that the little giant looked a LOT like Sensei there :P

Though to instantly debunk it, its pretty weird that he'd be having to be taught the basics of Volleyball when he just started being involved with the club...
>> ARTICLE
But sensei seems older and ryu's sister is in college so shouldnt the little giant also be a college student or someone near her age?
>> ARTICLE
> its pretty weird that he'd be having to be taught the basics of Volleyball when he just started being involved with the club...

Unless it's all a ruse! Maybe something happened, an injury to where he couldn't play anymore, but he loves the game and loves Karasuno so he can't stay away, but he also doesn't want to be remembered as a "has been" so he pretends to know nothing about the game while sponsoring the club.

I will admit it's pure speculation and there are a ton of holes in it, but I want to believe!
>> ARTICLE
Though that's still weird because they've already met people who knew the Little Giant like Ryu's sister and the Nekoma coach, and none of them have ever said anything about the sensei. So they'd all have to be in the ruse. I admit it would be cool though. What if they're not the same person but they're related?
>> ARTICLE
> they've already met people who knew the Little Giant like Ryu's sister and the Nekoma coach, and none of them have ever said anything about the sensei. So they'd all have to be in the ruse.

Not necessarily. I hardly look like I did when I was 16. If someone went through something life-changing, to where their personality/aura was different, it's not unthinkable that they wouldn't be recognized. Especially since none of them knew him closely, but only saw him play on the court.

>What if they're not the same person but they're related?

A definite possibility. Though I can admit the most likely scenario is that there's no connection between them at all.

After the clutch block by Tanaka and Tsukishima that drove Mad Dog over the edge. Coach Ukai and Advisor Takeda were cheering and she was making that face off to the side.

No one gonna talk about that Seijou guy going all 'dont you dare eff this up for my beloved senpais'? The entire dialogue from that scene starting from "sorry..but no" to throwing him against the wall and telling Mad Dog that he wouldn't let him drag dirt onto the senpai's court was incredible.

" You need to face the team and have the team face you. "

Gosh, the chill that I felt when that ex national player said that quote. It's a very nice fit with the biggest struggle for Mad Dog. It's somehow a similar struggle with what Kageyama faced in first season. 

Also Tsukki's definitely the silent brain in Karasuno. He also used tactic that Sugawara taught him when they faced Seijoh in first season, the switch blocking. A very nice callback. 

The biggest problem of this series is how the episodes feel like 5 minutes every time. Even though I have read the manga, I couldn't help but feel pretty tense in this episode. 

>> ARTICLE
Fucking incredible episode, Haikyuu never fails to blow away my hype thrusters
>> ARTICLE
So Haikyuu almost has me root for the opponents team again. Almost forgot Mad Dog was facing Karasuno for a while. Love how they do this
>> ARTICLE
Its scenes like where Yahaba shirt fronted kyotani and shoved him against the wall that demonstrates just how much expression and life the animators give these characters.

We're finally seeing a studio being permitted to put some real love and detail into their work now and Haikyuu is a cut above the rest.
>> ARTICLE
"I feel my life span shorten everytime Oikawa Serves" 

You and me both, man. You and me both. 
>> ARTICLE
All right! Everyone's settled! Heart-tugging emotional flashbacks are executed and in place! Now I think all that's left is to duke it out. I kind of didn't realize how much I miss the dynamic duo of Hinata and Kageyama until the very end of this episode. Hinata hasn't been involved all that much up until now, and I reckon it's about time they started to rip it up and show Oikawa what they can do.

But man this was a great episode for Tanaka, Tsukki *and* Asahi. Tsukki the tactician. Tanaka smashing through points. Asahi with that killer serve! Please hurry and be next week again.
>> ARTICLE
But next week is closer to the season finale before The Long Wait begins.

What a catch-22.

:-((((

It's the saddest.

[Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD0eVSapXw0#t=21s) Hype intensifies! 

Half way through the final set and only three episodes left :( but on the bright side [we have a new attack for Hinata!](https://i.gyazo.com/a63fbbf76ee88a21e4a669bb02835027.png).

This episode covered from chapter 140 up to chapter 142.
>> ARTICLE
God the pacing of this show is so on point it's insane. How did they pack so much of that Aoba Johsai development into just one episode? It didn't even feel off-kilter in the slightest.

And now we play the waiting game......

Thank god Haikyuu only comes out once a week, if not all they hype would have killed me in one sitting.
>> ARTICLE
Watched it in one sitting. Good thing I didn't watch it week by week, all the hype in between while waiting will kill me.
>> ARTICLE
No. I want more hype. I don't care if it kills me.
>> ARTICLE
Just bring along the defibrillator for all of us! 
>> ARTICLE
This anime is honestly bad for my health, I'm nearly dying from the hype and anxiety.
>> ARTICLE
THEY EVOLVED FURTHER!! JESUS THE LAST SCENE WAS PUUUUUUUUURFECT
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love the build-up Haikyuu has for most, if not all, characters. It actually makes me question which team I should root for, because they all have their own great stories and aspirations. 
>> ARTICLE
That last spike.

[Hype thrusters, full power.](https://45.media.tumblr.com/bc6929f6950f6501dad0c389608e78d5/tumblr_n2ro5xAH911rwxtzvo1_500.gif)
>> ARTICLE
I was waiting to see that slamdown animated ever since I've read that chapter. Such a great moment.
>> ARTICLE
That final spike was too hype! This series keeps on leaving me at the edge of me seat. 
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, I love this show. Feels like everything is on point, from the pacing, to the action, to the characters. 

Hinata and Kageyama might just be my favourite anime duo ever. 


>> ARTICLE
Aye. Anymore hype and I might die.
>> ARTICLE
The tension the ost can build up is amazing. I never get as "gaaaaah" as this.

>> ARTICLE
That background chant of people every time Oikawa serves is totally awesome, It's like charging up a killer move from DBZ.

Love how Tsukishima starts to shine now as he's one of my favorite characters from the series and will be way cooler in the future.

That super-awesome-accidental-didn't-mean-to last attack had a really good execution though.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad I'm not the only one, there's something so *satisfying* when they start chanting. 
>> ARTICLE
I looooooooooooved Kyotani's backstory. They're really good at crafting wonderful flashbacks and that was no exception. This week also sees the full-on return of Oikawa's infuriating serves which is one of my favorite aspects of Aoba Josai in general.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu is really the kind of series that even after you've read the manga, you're still nervous as hell when watching the anime.
>> ARTICLE
[This shot was so awesome!](http://i.imgur.com/roZBoRq.jpg)

[Mad Ryu](http://i.imgur.com/8T1nXIE.jpg) did great against [Mad Dog-chan](http://i.imgur.com/Wo4FoEx.jpg), which by the way is able to [look normal](http://i.imgur.com/Zs5yvXn.jpg) sometimes, too.

[Tsukki's fast thinking](http://i.imgur.com/UGTS84Y.jpg) and figuring others out was great. [Oikawa](http://i.imgur.com/V7LRkd3.jpg) continues to be scary but he somehow looked even scarier and cold [when he was shown during practice](http://i.imgur.com/G44FpCM.jpg).

Can't believe there are only 2 episodes left...I want more! [Can't wait for next week!](http://i.imgur.com/oz9DufY.jpg)

Does anyone know the name of the intense song that plays at 20:00?

Was it just me or did someone else also pee a little when Yahaba said "Sorry, but No" and Slam Mad Dog into the wall! 
Yahaba x Kyotani, Aoba's next year's Oikawa x Iwaizumi!
HAIKYUU!! THE HYPE IS REAL!

Is there only one more episode?

Mad Dog is definitely tilted

I'VE BEEN WAITING TWO SEASONS FOR THAT GODDAMN MIDDLE BOUNCE BALL FUCK YEAH

No one noticed that Kiyoko can't decide on which side of Ukai-kantoku to sit? Every scene she was on the opposite side.
>> ARTICLE
i believe she only changed seat once after the teams switched sides
>> ARTICLE
That laugh out of Ryu after Hinata said "there's base" was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I love reading the background conversations. They're usually hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
"a horse!" is my favorite background comment, ofc delivered by suga and daichi
>> ARTICLE
i'm so happy the studio worked those in. Most just ignore them
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else notice the music that started playing around 19:30? Never noticed it before, but it has a fucking choir in it and is absolutely epic. It really felt like the two teams are at war. Absolutely incredible.
>> ARTICLE
I still don't know how I fell so hard for a sports anime, and a sport I never even liked before. And got me to like characters originally set up as antagonists. Damn it Haikyuu. It's crazy how much I look forward to each ep but I'm also dreading the end of the season.
>> ARTICLE
So as I do with every episode of Haikyuu, I watched the previous episode again (do the same shit with AoD) just to build the hype train! and in the previous episode, it seems to me like all the females are interested in Yamaguchi?! is this the thing? DO BITCHES LOVE BIG SERVERS?! also enjoyed the hinata bit at the end of this episode...


>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Apparently it's called 'Thunder' from wikipedia

I only remember terms like six-pack (hit to the face) or roofing (a block)
>> ARTICLE
OK! Drunken Episode Recap: Tsuki does a thing where he pretty much owns dog-kun from the other team. There's a whole bunch of angry face making by the white team. Dog-Kun get a weird flash back that is not necessary and only put in for filler. The ball travels over the net causing Drama. Finally Hinata-kun hits the ball onto the white teams court using plot-armor even though he broke tradition by telling everyone how he fucked up yet still being too OP to fail. 

Predictions for next weeks episode: Kageyama enters the zone so that Hinata can hit the ball without making any noise creating a new serve "Silenced attack" only level 30 wizards can see it and you need legendary item "Antagonists ears" to hear it. Since nobody has access to Magic nothing happens and the white team is confused. 
>> ARTICLE
If you remember the reason the new quick was created was for Hinata to have time in the air to judge and guide its trajectory.

So in this quick's case, Kageyama saw it as an opportunity to give him a good ball just over the net for him to slam down with a steep angle. This, as you'll see next episode, is a new move created on-the-fly, proving that they've 'evolved'

It's not plot armor if this shit is a legal and valid technique in real volleyball
>> ARTICLE
I mean its nice of you to type that all out but im pretty sure that dude is just an unfunny troll
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this show always anticipates my concerns before they come to anything. 

>Concern: "Their quick is great, but they need more ways to win"

Hinata realizes the same thing.

>Concern: "It would be kind of cheap if Hinata and Kageyama suddenly just got stronger without struggle"

It really takes them some time to figure themselves out.

>Concern: "What about the rest of the team though"

It shows everyone else also trying new things.

>Concern: "Tsukishima is kind of being pushed aside"

Tsukishima-based episode.
>> ARTICLE
That only means that the people behind the anime are very aware of not only the material they are adapting (not the Haikyuu Manga but manga in general) but also of how it will be seen by us viewers and what questions will be brought up by every piece of information the episode gives us, that way they can perfectly place the events in the story to keep us interested. 
This kind of ability only comes with lots of experience which means years and years of work. 


tl;dr version: The people behind this anime know their shit
>> ARTICLE
They're definitely doing a good job of getting the foreshadowing across
>> ARTICLE
tsukishima development incoming..... 
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully. Also possible that he quits the team
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Don't spoil things for those that haven't read the manga. That's just incredibly shitty behavior. If you want to post manga spoilers use the spoiler tag that's why it's there. 
>> ARTICLE
Cant see him quitting he cried way ti much to quit like that 
>> ARTICLE
[Dude...](/s "Tsukki became ESSENTIAL for Karasuno after his character development. He became a cornerstone in one major aspect of Karasuno's game.")
>> ARTICLE
Well I am glad to hear that!
>> ARTICLE
I feel like he will get mad and almost leave, then his brother will be like "I was sad, but I was so much more happy that I cared" or something like that and he'll be all sentimental and return to the team pretending hes not much different but reluctantly asking for help behind the scenes to improve.
>> ARTICLE
Considering we got a glimpse of the real reason he plays volleyball, I think he'll only come out of this experience loving it (because he doesn't right now) and will try to improve himself, like the rest of the team is doing.
>> ARTICLE
That would be *really pathetic*.
>> ARTICLE
Second favourite character development in the series is coming up. I'm so excited for the feels train 8D
>> ARTICLE
Who has your favorite development, Kageyama? 
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama has definitely developed a lot, but it's actually [spoilers without going into too much detail](/s "Tsukishima again because he undergoes even more character development in the recent manga chapters").
>> ARTICLE
Thats pretty cool. I think my favorite thing about Haikyuu is that all the characters are likable. I'll probably start reading the manga here soon. 
>> ARTICLE
I definitely recommend reading the manga, it's fantastic. Enjoy :)
>> ARTICLE
 Is it completed?
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, I read and watched KnB before I got into Haikyuu and while it was good I felt like all the characters on Seinin except Kuroko and Kagami were just completely uninteresting. They just felt like extra characters that were there simply because you need 5 players on a bball team.

Haikyuu manages to flesh out its characters very well both those on karasuno and even on the others teams. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked Tepei and Hyouga on Serin, that being said my favorite side characters were probably on Shutoko(?) or Kise's team. I think all the characters are awesome in Haikyuu though, and that is one of the reasons I like it more than kuroko. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the only person that didn't care at all about Tepei. I did like Hyouga & Riko though. I just irks me that they had so many of characters on Seirin, but there was zero to them except an occasional joke. I liked Akashi's team the best. Think they had the most interesting characters since all 5 managed to be really unique interesting characters. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck. Episode was aces as usual, but that jazz piano BGM when they are running up the hill. Way to step up your game, Haikyu.
>> ARTICLE
The best running-up-a-hill-after-losing-your=practice-match music that I've ever heard!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that scenes music was so on point and original
>> ARTICLE
how the hell do people get by only watching 1 episode per week. I marathoned season 1 when I first discovered it, and again last week after I found out s2 was airing. Now the wait between episodes is killing me.. especially now since Tsukishima is my favorite/the most relatable character. zzz   
If anyone reads this and also reads the manga is it worth it to just say fuck it and start reading or do you think it would be a bit ruined not seeing things for the first time in glorious animation?   
edit: started reading, when I read certain parts like "one touch" and whatnot during the games I can hear the anime VA in my head shouting the line and the soundtrack starts playing as well so I think it worked out quite nicely that I watched part of the anime beforehand lol. thanks for the help friends, glad I started reading but already getting sad that I'm close to the end of the manga :p
>> ARTICLE
nah, it's cool if you read it while watching it. it just hypes you up for what's in store for the anime. :)

my only problem with the manga is that even if there's a new one every week, i find it hard to keep track of what's currently happening. but that's probably just me. haikyuu makes for an addicting binge-reading though.
>> ARTICLE
If you start to read the manga, then you will only end up in another series of week-long waits when you reach the head of the story.
>> ARTICLE
True pain is getting one chapter a week. With 20-ish pages. Smack-bang in the middle of a match. 

Personally, there's no way I feel that a scene is in anyway ruined just because I know what's coming. If anything, it enhances the experience. 

>> ARTICLE
I'm going to be 302 by the time the Shiratorizawa match ends.
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga week before last and I have to say Read it! I was worried it would take away the excitement of seeing everything animated for the first time like I've had happen with other things I've read, but it hasn't at all. I'm even more excited for each episode than I was before. Yeah you already know what's happening, but it's still as awesome. I don't regret picking it up at all. Now would also be a great time to start since this coming week is the last chapter to the current arc so you won't be catch up when it's right in the middle. 

It actually makes things better because now each week I get double Haikyuu. Friday there's a new chapter of Haikyuu & Saturday there's a new episode. 
>> ARTICLE
For me, I read the manga before the anime ever started so I was always excited to see everything come together and hear what the VAs had to offer, the soundtrack, animation, and everything else always makes me thrilled when a new episode came out. It still does and honestly the manga gets me hyped in a completely different way. 

I'd say go for it, the manga really does some great things and while you won't ever be shocked, you'll be excited and waiting for them to do your favorite parts. IE: Bokuto, Akaashi, and Kuroo are some of my favorite characters so today's episode made me super hyped to see them even though I'm sure someone that's anime only would just think they were cool dudes and not have as much of an impact. 
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu has a really underrated soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
Just a general recommendation to listen to Galileo Galilei's other music (they do the ED)

Since seeing their OP for anohana I looked into all their music and they are no joke my favorite band of all time now
>> ARTICLE
Yeah last week's episode had great music too, so I went and found the season one OST immediately after.
>> ARTICLE
 If you can tell me the name of the track that played when Hinata practiced with coach Ukai, that would be awesome. EDIT: Oh you said season one, nvm.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't think it's underrated and that's not me saying it's not good, it's actually in my top 3 OSTs but people definitely acknowledge the soundtrack of this show and how good it is
>> ARTICLE
I *LOVE* THE SOUNDTRACK SO MUCH. I feel that along with the animation and my darling baby characters (and the plot of course) it elevates the anime by a million. One particular instance is the end of episode 17 and the soundtrack there is just *gorgeous* and perfectly encapsulates and even *elevates* the moment. (Track 23 of OST Part 2) 
:') 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. It's really unique as far as anime soundtracks go. 
>> ARTICLE
The jazz piano BGM was so legit.
>> ARTICLE
I was slightly taken back when i heard it. It was that good. 

I can't wait for the full ost to be released.
>> ARTICLE
same, at first i was like *"oh."* but it surprisingly works!

[Tsuki Hype](http://i.imgur.com/W25z4lc.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
The focus on Tsukishima and his character development is probably the most substantial in the entire series and I can't believe we're finally watching it animated. What a time to be alive.

Hope you're all as hyped as I am for next week cause [yessss](http://i.imgur.com/geQCISS.png) to [next weeks episode](http://i.imgur.com/cipYl9M.png)

Edit: A quick PSA to manga readers! The next episode should have [this famous scene](http://i.imgur.com/jrT1ior.png) (not spoilerish), but the actual translation is different so be careful not to get your hopes up. Still, I wonder how CR will deal with it
>> ARTICLE
Uh...what was going on in that manga scene? I don't remember it at all.

I'd rather not put a giant spoiler tag here, so if you're interested, it's from chapter 89

I can't deal with how much I want the oho scene

I know... I wish we could get it
>> ARTICLE
One of my favorite moments of this arc!! I CAN'T WAIT!!
>> ARTICLE
[That moment they both realised the other is changing](http://i.imgur.com/zD5oYcq.jpg) was great!

[Asahi's aura](http://i.imgur.com/vULrLkz.jpg) was so fierce even [Hinata realised what's up](http://i.imgur.com/7fXOazL.jpg). I liked how the girls were relieved at what happened.

Yamaguchi [asking Hinata](http://i.imgur.com/0YQxQRI.jpg) was really nice. It really felt like he wanted to somehow help Tsukishima and encourage him but wasn't sure how to go about it.

Also, next time seems like we'll see [a little Tsukki](http://i.imgur.com/sENdMqY.png) <3
>> ARTICLE
Im exited for when kags and Hinata really come together again. I miss their interaction :/
>> ARTICLE
It made it so much more striking that Hinata went into his "badass eyes mode", and yet Asahi's determination was even more powerful.
>> ARTICLE
I love the whole licking his lips thing Hinata does. His primal desire is to just hit any free ball.
>> ARTICLE
Reminds me of the famous [Messi is a Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDsztJOgqUg) video
>> ARTICLE
ive decided the 2 things i love most about this show are the focus on practice rather than games

and the eyes. i feel like the eyes in haikyuu tell the viewer a lot of what a character is thinking or feeling 
>> ARTICLE
Tsukishima's thoughts are totally relatable. It's easy to lose motivation to do something if it feels like a waste of time and you're being overshadowed by someone else. He seems like a very externally motivated guy. Rather than seeking self-improvement, he wants results. If he thinks those results aren't going to happen even with a ton of effort, then there's no reason to put in any effort at all. Couple this with the inferiority he feels toward Hinata.

Yamaguchi still thinks Tsukishima likes volleyball though. Without that, it'd be very hard to get out of this rut.
>> ARTICLE
He has to realise he has potential as a blocker though.
>> ARTICLE
this episode felt especially short!!! all buildup, no climax :(
>> ARTICLE
I believe the term is edging 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. The moment where Azumane establishes dominance was a quiet high point. The last time I felt that flutter of excitement was seeing the picture/poster of Hinata back in episode 3. As hungry and ambitious as Hinata is, the ace can still put him in check with his presence alone. It's a pretty sharp contrast to the Azumane I'm used to seeing.
>> ARTICLE
>It's a pretty sharp contrast to the Azumane I'm used to seeing.

yep, a great reminder than hinata and kags aren't the only ones that are evolving. he's definitely not the asahi we saw in season one.
>> ARTICLE
But that just means they pay off will be all that much greater!
>> ARTICLE
And it looks like Tsukishima has more issues than just "I don't really care about volleyball that much", so I like how they took time to set up his real inner conflict.
>> ARTICLE
Damn seriously these episodes just get better and better. Tsukishima starting to develop into the fully grown crow he deserves to be. As the weeks go on I find myself enjoying these training montage episode more because they all have so much inner struggle. But when all the pieces get put together in the coming weeks be sure for an explosive ending to the season.
>> ARTICLE
The ED for this show is possibly my favorite I've ever seen. It matches the show so perfectly in tone and feels so beautifully emotional. The ended picture with Hinata soaring above the rest of the team as the song comes to a close is just so amazing, I'm sure why I love it so much but it just gets me every time. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes, I get goosebumps every time it gets to the part where Hinata soars and the rest of the team looks up at him.

*Shivers*
>> ARTICLE
I actually like that they don't simply improve over night, but have to struggle to make even a bit of progress. Sometimes shows will just randomly throw new techniques seemingly out of nowhere at you. Can't wait to see it all pay off. 

[Kuroo is a damn solid blocker.](http://i.imgur.com/RVSGc07.gif)

 Yes, it reminds me of HxH in that aspect.

I really love ~~that black haired guy~~ Kuroo. He looks so cunning in an evil way, it's awesome.

[This scene was so well done,](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/9904/10-087.0/compressed/c010-011.jpg) finally Karasuno's ace has found his will to become the ace that the team needed.

Thanks man, I wanted to start reading the manga after this episode.

You're in for one hell of a ride, it's my fave manga of all time

Tsukishima, literally the polar opposite foil of Hinata. Tall to Hinata's short; smart to Hinata's dumb; disinterested to Hinata's passionate; moon to Hinata's sun. Yet, like it's been said, he's essential to the team, just as Hinata is. I haven't read the manga yet, so I am very excited to see how Tsukishima develops as a character

\#1 anime this season that is making me smile all the time.

Seriously, they are a happy-go-merry squad that is COOL.

I kind of find it hilarious how all the teams except for Nekoma have an attractive female manager. Kinda puts Tanaka's Doppelganger's (I forget his name) outburst last season into context. Also Yachi OP as fucking always.

TSUKISHIMA FLASHBACK AND YAMAGUCHI HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPE

I love Kuroo. What a great character.

And can't wait for Tsukki's development!
>> ARTICLE
I hadn't really paid a whole lot of attention to him before this episode, but I really like him now. The face he made when blocked Bokuto's spike was awesome.
>> ARTICLE
That climbing hill metaphor though...
>> ARTICLE
Oh Tsukki...

Also a wild Akiteru appears!

EDIT: Oh my god, that motherfucking preview.

Oh my god oh my god

I seriously cannot handle this right now 
>> ARTICLE
Oh god I've waited this long for Akiteru why does it feel like I can't go another week without him
>> ARTICLE
I like the truth that they didn't perfect their training quickly makes it feel much more realistic than Kuroko no basket(still love it though), every week i forget why i was so hyped for the next episode and this show just keeps on reminding me why.
>> ARTICLE
Watch slam Dunk. Amateur MC had to literally shot 10,000 jumps shots aside from the basic skills training.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love slam dunk man, I watched long time ago though but man that was one my anime gate openers and brings me nostalgia thinking about it 
>> ARTICLE
I really love the [little things](http://i.imgur.com/1oZpndZ.jpg?1) that other characters sometimes do in the background. Obviously... Asahi needs a lot of work on his serves
>> ARTICLE
The character interactions are sooo good. I love how all the different teams talk like friends, it's so much more reasonable than what you usually get in sports anime. 

Also I'm so hype for when Karasuno pulls together (including tsukki).
>> ARTICLE
Tsukki's development is probably the longest and most extensively written and is only slight eclipsed by Kageyama and Hinata. The current arc in the manga just screams of Tsukki. Love that guy.
>> ARTICLE
Really looking forward to the beginnings of Yamaguchi's development that we'll see kick off next episode. One of my favorite characters in Haikyuu!!, and we're going to be seeing some really great scenes with him soon.

welcome to Tsukiyama hell everyone

nOT THAT ONE
>> ARTICLE
I bet I could watch this whole season in an hour, since every episode feels like it's 5 min :(((
>> ARTICLE
God, seeing this animated just feels more heartbreaking than reading it. Poor Tsukki. Very well done though. 

Also Asahi finally acting like an ace is so fantastic. 
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn, this is anime is amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
Hinata thirsty for that [ball](http://puu.sh/llGpq.jpg) as always
>> ARTICLE
It looks like one of, if not the biggest hurdle for Tsukishima is Hinata and his growth so my guess is there is going to be some sort of parallel between Tsukishima's brother and The Little Giant which will help Tsukishima adjust and settle in better with the rest of the team.
>> ARTICLE
Really happy they are putting some development on some smaller characters in this show.
>> ARTICLE
TSUKI IS THE BEST
>> ARTICLE
Feel like we're seeing less of Daichi in terms of him trying to improve/evolve.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, but Tanaka isn't really getting much either.  The most they are doing is the synchronized attack.  I think the author realized he can't spend that much time on each character and focuses on certain things. 
>> ARTICLE
I think that was a comment on Tsukishima. They even show a single shot of Tsukishima after Nekoyama's coach's comment on Karusuno's development except *one* person's.
>> ARTICLE
It was a comment on Tsukishima, but I have to agree with the above commenter about how we don't see Daichi doing anything different, really. He's a very solid player and arguably one of the most dependable on team so I don't think there's a terrible need for improvement, but he is the captain which means he has to be on the court at all times and could benefit from it. 
>> ARTICLE
Daichi's one of my favorite characters in the series, so I feel your frustrations there--I will say, as a manga reader, that he is probably the only Karasuno team member who doesn't have that focus on improving/evolving (Tanaka probably would be second in that regard). However, Daichi is set apart in that he's considered incredibly mature emotionally/mentally wise (for the most part) considering he's a high schooler. Ukai Jr often comments on how Daichi's much better with the motivating/inspiring speeches. 

Also as a manga reader/Daichi fan: I am incredibly excited for certain scenes involving Daichi in the manga to be animated. I'm not sure if they will be this season, but I cannot wait for their eventually adaptation. 

Of course, I'm talking about [Chapters](/s "117-121+, with Daichi's *mini* injury and the aftermath.") 
>> ARTICLE
It's crushing to see the team lose all their games again but damn it's fun to watch them slowly improve. I only watch the anime so it'll be nice to see tsukishima's backstory next week.
>> ARTICLE
[I really love how everything that they are trying to learn](/s "all comes into play when the official matches finally started.")

[Karasuno practically...](/s "acquired all the strengths/techniques of all the teams they've practiced with (except for Nekoma) in the training camp and incorporated it in their play style. The pay-off in their official matches was so satisfying.")

These dudes from the other prefectures will probably be shocked when they finally see each other again in the Nationals.
>> ARTICLE
I want to see a full game right now so badly. It's going to be awesome when all these improvements finally bare fruit. Why must you make me wait Haikyuu?! 
>> ARTICLE
Loved the jazz bit as they were running up the hill. Can't wait for the evolution to be completed!! And hopefully Tsukishima catches up too
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully Tsukishima will become equal to some of the other blockers we have seen. And some background on his brother and such will be pretty cool if he was part of the team with the 'Little Giant'     
So sad I have to wait a week at a time unlike when I watched the first season in a few sittings. Always one of the highlights of Saturday evening.
>> ARTICLE
can someone link that piano BGM? it was fucking sick...
>> ARTICLE
Episodes with action and character development are always the best. The short glimpse of kid Tsukishima already seems like a polar opposite. gaaaaaaaahh next episode now please I wanna know why.
>> ARTICLE
next episode, we get to see a chibi!Tsukki. oh man, i can't wait.

i love how everyone and everything's slowly coming together. and that kiyoko and yachi helps out in the practice. yachi trying to smooth things out with the two is just adorable.

edit: also who else loved that watermelon seed thing? that was pretty cute. i don't know how kenma even feels about (basically) babysitting hinata and lev.
>> ARTICLE
That homage to the sharingan + sound effect. Brilliant!
>> ARTICLE
A shame there wasn't any development in their quick past Hinata hitting it with his left hand (which I thought was awesome). I'm interested in Tsukishima's character development too, but I can't help but be hyped as always to see what Hinata is going to do next.
>> ARTICLE
I just really cannot care about Tsukishima at all. His personality is bad, his attitude is bad, and he doesn't get along with any of the characters I actually like. At least Hinata and Kageyama are getting a lot of development still. 
>> ARTICLE
I hated Tsukki until his development arc in the manga. Unfortunately we probably won't get that until s3 of the anime sigh
>> ARTICLE
Ah the pay-off is already starting, can't help but grin during those scenes.

Bokuto is great as teammate and opponent. "You taught him that" and his emo-mode were hilarious.

I seriously didn't think 20 mins had passed every episode feels like its the best yet...

Can we please make this a comment face?

If they don't make a comment face out of this scene this sub will be as good as dead to me.
>> ARTICLE
yachi sploosh
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that was pretty goddamn adorable. Yachi is a great addition to this show, honestly not sure how they got this far without her anymore.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad Yachi isn't introduced until later in the show's development. If they introduce her too early, she'd feel too much like the audience surrogate. That's not bad but its been done and leaves something on the table. Since we know something about the game and the team, we're now able to view her as this new comer rather than just a stand in for us, the viewers.

Yachi also gives me an interesting perspective. There are often times when I wish I could reexperience something for the first time, like watching an anime. There's something exhilarating about a first watching something for the first time. Yachi can give us that feeling again. The evolution of the Kageyama-Hinata quick is awesome but it feels like its compounded by Yachi's reaction and takes me back to the 3 on 3 match where Kageyama-Hinata and Hinata were playing for their spots in season one.

It's funny you should say that, because the two webms I posted just now are *also* my first ones.

That goes to show you how Yachi motivates people to take the first step for the sake of cuteness.

It's like they didn't even expect it! Though [Kageyama looked so annoyed](http://i.imgur.com/g5nsMpk.jpg) when he realised Hinata made him toss like that, was pretty funny. [Yachi's reaction](http://i.imgur.com/8gIfkju.jpg) to their [getting along well](http://i.imgur.com/kehEqUk.jpg) was adorable, too :D

[The options part](http://i.imgur.com/827aIry.jpg) was hilarious, especially followed by Bokuto's emo mode, lol.

Kageyama is the true tsundere.

"He encouraged me again, damn it." 
"Wh-What...You dumbass..."

I LOVE THIS ANIME SO FUCKING MUCH. UGH.

The new quick was INCREDIBLE. I actually teared up a bit hahaha

And Bokuto the drama queen!
>> ARTICLE
I cry during every episode lol. I can't even explain it. Maybe it's the feeling of being a proud parent of my anime volleyball babies 
>> ARTICLE
It's like, all their hard work and blood and sweat and tears has finally paid off and they're so happy about it. And then I cry because I'm so proud of them.
>> ARTICLE
I understand this feeling. I can't believe how connected I am to these characters haha
>> ARTICLE
True.  The animation was so freaking good.  The wave the ball creates especially.

>> ARTICLE
Was expecting Bokuto to give his team the thumbs up and say don't worry when he missed that spike. Nope. Dude actually went to option C haha.
>> ARTICLE
[YES THE QUICK FINALLY HAPPENED](http://i.imgur.com/Ft4Rvhm.png). It's felt like so many episodes leading up to this :'). Now the real battle begins!
>> ARTICLE
Amazing. The scene where the new quick works is my new favourite scene from both seasons, along with the scene from the first episode when Hinata's team lost to Kageyama's. Poor bokuto, having a bad game, but still being the best <3. 

The OST was on point the whole episode and made it even better. Sadly, the episode only lasted like 2 minutes :(

This episode covered from page 12 of chapter 92, 93, 94 and up to page 9 of chapter 95. (Getting a faster pace woohoo!)
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama's reaction to Hinata calling him awesome is priceless.
>> ARTICLE
You can tell that he does not know how to deal with it mentally. Haha!
>> ARTICLE
Yup best moment of the episode especially with hinatas face during that scene
>> ARTICLE
"the weirdo duo is back in action" ... I think I almost cried. The cogs all coming together is amazing, this is totally the episode weve been waiting for! Its great how much the other teams still respect Karasunos skill despite their constant losing and I'm living for the interactions between Bokuto and Akaashi. What is up with super talented players actually being total babies? (I'm looking at you Oikawa)

Also shoutout to that one scene of Daichi receiving they use atleast twice every episode.
>> ARTICLE
They also use that scene of Kageyama setting with his arms outstretched and mouth open again.
>> ARTICLE
It just keeps getting better and better, really loved how they showed everything is coming together with the cogs.
>> ARTICLE
Now all we need are the Tsukki and Yamaguchi cogs and the team will finally come together perfectly!
>> ARTICLE
You are forgetting Suga.
>> ARTICLE
And two second years.
>> ARTICLE
Youre right! Oh man and he totally had that adorable smiling scene in todays episode and everything :/
>> ARTICLE
She was the last one to acknowledge it but Yachi's encouragement when they finally nailed it was easily the best :)
>> ARTICLE
Her little happy hop and Bokuto's emo mode were the best points of this episode. Everyone showing their emotions so openly really works well in this show and makes it that much more endearing.
>> ARTICLE
That Kuroken banter... I always love it when they do their back and forths. It makes me wanna rewatch the Nekoma OVA again.

The scenes didn't really flow well and it made the episode feel disjointed, but individually it's awesome. Hinata and Kageyama successfully pulling off the new quick gave me goosebumps (especially the moments before, when time slowed ~~and soulfully gazed into each other's eyes~~). So is Nishinoya doing a libero's toss (twice!). And that synchro attack... hnngh.

Everything Fukurodani was a sight to behold animated. I fucking love Bokuto. I fucking love Akaashi. I also love their teammates that I forgot their name.
>> ARTICLE
Hold on a second, there is an OVA for Haikyuu that i didn't know about?

np and btw, i wasn't actually the one who made it, just for info :P
>> ARTICLE
The scene where they finally used the new quick was so well done! I loved how as Kageyama was contemplating not to give it to Hinata, Hinata speaks to him in a quiet voice and the music cuts out as well making it so much more impactful. I hadn't actually realized I was holding my breath the entire quick scene until it was over. I LOVE THIS SHOW.
>> ARTICLE
dear god that quick from hinata and kageyama was beautiful. i had tears of joy flowing

>> ARTICLE
The OST is just incredible. When Hinata and Kageyama finally did their new quick the music that played gave me goosebumps.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, the music starting from when they tried the libero set and the synchro attack in this episode is the same track from the first episode where the two birds were flying at each other.  I friggin love that track, I need to find it somewhere, anyone know when the OST for season 2 comes out?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know when it's coming out but I neeed it in my life.
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto is definitly my new favourite character, he's hilarious ;-;
>> ARTICLE
He was one opf the main reasons why I was so hyped for this season!
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama is weak to direct attacks eh? That's one of my favorite tropes - just, partners uninhibitedly praising one another. And after all the work Kageyama's put in, I'm so glad Hinata was unafraid to tell him he was incredible, over and over, and give credit where it was due
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I really like it too. I wish people did it in real life as well. I love both giving and receiving praise in my life.

Holy shit this is good
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been commenting on these threads recently because I felt like there wasn't much to say. There were some exciting moments, but they seemed to build anticipation more than fulfill it. This is the episode where it all paid off. We definitely saw the team start to show and execute their new techniques and I started to wonder if this was going to be another buildup episode. Not that I mind the build ups. Haikyuu has a way of making every episode satisfying (unlike Diamond no Ace) with some development.

The evolved version of the kageyama-hinata spike changed everything. Everything just snowballed from there. Kurasano played with abandon and threw out everything they had been practicing. It worked and the pay off was huge.

Beyond the hype, there were some quieter moments I appreciated too. The bond between Kageyama and Hinata continues to grow stronger. The look they shared before Kageyama sent him that toss speaks volumes. Even the other teams noticed it. The next time they tried that quick, it was a miss and served as a nice grounding reminder that their quick is something special and difficult.

Bokuto's development was also fun and refreshing. As his frustration built I was dreading some transformation into a rage beast and desperately hoping for something else. I'm glad he turned into a drama queen instead and loved how his team handled it. This season has felt like a slower, quieter start. It doesn't lack strength but the hype has been replaced by anticipation. In this episode, it all paid off. I can't wait for the tournament!
>> ARTICLE
But, but Diamond no Ace has that giraffe reporter who always steals the show and adds something to plot unlike Yachi.

>> ARTICLE
Hi friends. Make sure you come discuss this at /r/haikyuu with all your other nerdy volleyball obsessed friends there. It's a pretty neat place.

>> ARTICLE
11 hours in, and it seems that no one is mentioning the scene where Fukurondai's setter is going over the 3 scenarios of what happens if he sets to Bokuto. With the .5 second timer going, I thought that scene was hilariously adapted well into the anime!
>> ARTICLE
This episode was awesome. Finally get to see the progress they've been building up! I love how Bokuto tilted so hard.
>> ARTICLE
I would put screenshots of all my favorite parts of this episode here, but that would be pretty much equivalent to me posting a video of the entire episode here. Suffice it to say this was the best episode yet, as all the previous episodes have also been. Especially because of Bokuto. Interested to see if he gets over his emo mode and the owls win or if the crows keep it up and win.
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto and Akaashi are amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Amazing episode, but it looks like next week might be even better since it seems like Suga might finally get some time to shine! The highlight this week is definitely between the quick working and Akaashi thinking about possible outcomes. I'm loving him, Bokuto and Kuro more and more every week. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode was so satisfying, and everyone's already captured the reasons why, but I just want o say that I loved the moment when Nishinoya was [celebrating](http://gfycat.com/AdolescentMildAlleycat) Tanaka's spike.
>> ARTICLE
The first of this season was absolutely well made in terms of character development. Mostly revolving around the relationship between kageyama and Hinata and massive hints of potential development for Tsuki.  #firstyearsOP

Just another episode that's too short but left me incredibly happy!

So much cuteness in one episode (Yachi being oh so happy for the KageHina pair!!) and I love the part with Akaashi's calculations of Bokuto's temperament. I feel you Bokuto. I would be frustrated too.

im assuming that's why usai taught all of them the tempo concept
>> ARTICLE
Isn't the point of synchronised attack is, everyone but the setter moves ?
>> ARTICLE
I love how they consistently manage to make every other team likable with their own distinct personalities. They really know how to make characters.
>> ARTICLE
This is one of main points of this show. Almost every character seems really likable or unique to me. Even the side characters got some interesting moments. 

Creating an interest for all these characters in such a short time is brilliant work. 
>> ARTICLE
This is what I really love, I get attached to teams and just don't want anyone to lose. Why can't all the teams be happy?
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu and Ace of Diamond both do an amazing job at this.
>> ARTICLE
Woo Ace of Diamond, people need to watch it, like right now! 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for mentioning this. It's something almost no anime can do properly.
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps, Yowa Pedal, PPTA, Kuroko, Ace of Diamond to name a few...
>> ARTICLE
When it comes to sports shows I don't think that's really true. In Baby Steps I felt all the competitors were well designed. In Yowamushi Petal I couldn't decide which team I wanted to win.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with this. At one point, I even wanted Midosouji to win in YowaPeda...
>> ARTICLE
Also Hajime no Ippo. Like it's hard not to root for both people in the ring. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it depends I think. Like in Kuroko (S1 at least) or Prince of Tennis, a lot of times both teams just seem to hate each other and everyone is mean. Baby Steps is definitely like Haikyuu in its ability to make the opponents distinct and cool.
>> ARTICLE
That's a trope I hate in some sports anime. Sometimes they act hostile to each other even outside matches, like "you're my opponent, don't talk to me". That's why seeing the character interactions in Haikyuu is refreshing.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't that kind of the point of the first season of Kuroko? The fact that the GOM became un-likeable is kind of the reason for the plot, and GOM aside most of the characters in Kaijo and Shutoku were friendly. Kasamatsu and Takao are the ones the spring to mind

Also you are forgetting Seiho in that assessment the team that used martial arts movements the were a very fun team.
>> ARTICLE
In Knb the teams become friendly after they are beaten once. Before that happens they are usually shown as very hostile while in haikyuu or baby steps the hostility that is sometimes shown feels like a normal rivalry between teams
>> ARTICLE
Well considering the fact that Seirin has a reputation as a seriously competitive upstart, team compared to Karasuno which has always held some level of respect. So it's kind of t be expected that the teams would e treated differently. Karasuno started with friendships Seirin had to make them 

The main point though is that Haikyuu and Kuroko are coming at things from completely different perspectives. Kuroko is all about strong players becoming stronger through teamwork, where as Haikyuu is the reverse. Players that already have team work becoming stronger.
>> ARTICLE
Johzenji was extremely fun to watch and I got caught up in their excitement too.
>> ARTICLE
They also look different which is great too. I feel like sometimes sports shows make the opposing team just look bland, but somehow Haikyuu is great at making characters look unique and cool but not too ridiculous looking.
>> ARTICLE
I am not so sure with that. Some of these characters look kinda similar too me sometimes. [Tanaka got a twin?](http://i.imgur.com/zUrzaWE.jpg)

I still like these characters because their personalities are different.
>> ARTICLE
Eyeshield 21 and Prince of Tennis had very likable rivals. Compared to Kuroko anyways...
>> ARTICLE
Eyeshield 21 was also great at this. All of the enemy teams had very distinctive traits
>> ARTICLE
i'm still salty about how they ended that.
>> ARTICLE
How did they end it in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Yea, the anime just fails to be as good as the manga
>> ARTICLE
Daichi-san really fits the role of a captain, even though he doesn't stand out that much, he really is the backbone of the team and I'm glad he got a bit of recognition this episode.  
Also, overall, I think haikyuu!! really is the most enjoyable anime to watch, can't wait for the Rolling..Headbutt!!
>> ARTICLE
I also really like how they contrasted Daichi's role as the "foundation" of the team against Johzenji's complete lack of structure as a team. I'm guessing something's going to change within Johzenji's team dynamics next episode.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked how they had that focus on Daichi. Showing how Karasuno is able to play around *because* they have that strong backbone, whereas the other team falls apart a bit once they start losing.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. I almost teared up at tht. Daichi finally got him moment to shine

Hinata is spiderman confirmed and poor Kageyama blocking the ball with his face.

Where is the NSFW tag, two girls said "spank" in this episode how lewder can an anime get.
>> ARTICLE
Females can't say spank? 
>> ARTICLE
This aint no hentai! 
>> ARTICLE
I am pretty sure I heard Runa using the term "hentai" too.
>> ARTICLE
That word means pervert or weirdo to in Japanese 
>> ARTICLE
Although it's true that they did both say "spank" (), that wasn't the word that the boys were focused on in Japanese. The Johzenji manager, I think Hana was her name, said "ass" () and that's what they were excited about because it's kind of rough language for a Japanese girl to use. And then what Kiyoko said afterwards was "butt" () which is more polite and not as surprising as what Hana said. But since it's Kiyoko they were excited about it anyway. So what I'm trying to say is in Japanese the focal point was "ass" and "butt", not "spank".
>> ARTICLE
Amongst other things, I'm always so excited for one of the bench warmers to get a chance to shine - [this was a very cute moment to see between Narita, Ennoshita and Kinoshita](http://i.imgur.com/43969At.png).

This episode covered chapters 109-113 of the manga. 

Ch. 112 cover page: ["The entirety of the court rides on these hands"](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l-IThRcLoJI/U7w7lP91dsI/AAAAAAAAxtE/pF-_DAgZ-aI/s16000/001.png) - Daichi's hands that is, as the caption and illustration refers to him. It's very fitting for this episode. 

Daichi's my favorite character, and this episode/these chapters are some of my favorites because he finally gets some of the spotlight [](/s "not to mention the upcoming chapters...!") and viewers who might not really have noticed him before hopefully now are starting to see that he's actually really useful as a player and as a captain. 

Oh, and also [Narita](http://i.imgur.com/Ip4CQVk.jpg) getting to play is certainly worthy of mention. It's nice when the 2nd year trio get their time to shine. (Nice little bit with [Ennoshita and Kinoshita](http://i.imgur.com/AoVcT0Y.jpg) sighing in relief at Narita's success, since he's essentially is representing the three of them while he's on court). 

[Yamaguchi pushing Kageyama](http://i.imgur.com/iLbTIhO.jpg) was pretty enjoyably animated. Might turn it into a Gif. 

As others said, the symbolism with [Daichi and the Johzenji banner](http://i.imgur.com/Cv2aANs.jpg) is pretty great.  They did it in [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/StPYa0L.jpg) too.

The music swelling and cutting off at Daichi's little support speech was a nice touch, especially since it was accompanying his [badass pose.](http://i.imgur.com/NXZ9gL5.jpg) (You can also see the Jouzenji banner in the background). 

Oh, and good times what with Daichi getting to [spike the ball](http://i.imgur.com/7rBx8RX.jpg) and actually earn a point. It makes sense because Sugawara's the server, and he and Daichi work really well together, and we don't get to see Daichi spike the ball all that often, so it was great to see. 

(Also [Daichi and Asahi's faces](http://i.imgur.com/P5PN9hD.jpg) at Terushima's failed spike/synchronized attack were brilliant)

Was great to see Daichi getting to shine, he's just so cool :3

But wow their manager is pretty great, I neab she's no Kiyoko but she was nice to watch in that last scene!

It was nice that Narita was getting a chance too.

That's one thing I noticed. The female managers are great characters but almost any other female in the show is just a fan girl. The Oikawa fan girls make me a little angry.

[**Well... this is /r/anime after all...**](#nocomment)
>> ARTICLE
If anyone didn't understand the reference that Tsukki's brother made at the beginning, it was a joke on Shiratorizawa's ace's nickname, Ushiwaka. His actual name is **Ushi**jima **Waka**toshi. The reference was to the story of Ushiwaka and Benkei:

>Ushiwaka overcoming Benkei at the Gojo Bridge

>This triptych illustrates an episode from the life of the popular hero Yoshitsune (1159-89), who was also known as Ushiwaka-maru (young ox).

>On one of his nightly outings from the temple, 12-year-old Yoshitsune encountered Benkei on the Gojo Bridge in Kyoto. Benkei, a wild giant of a man, had been told by a sword-smith that he could forge a magic sword from the tips and cutting edges of a thousand blades. He obtained the swords by attacking samurai warriors crossing the Gojo Bridge.

>One night he saw the young Ushiwaka approaching; he was carrying what would be his one-thousandth sword. Benkei attacked him without delay, but the youth was too quick for him and managed to defeat him. Benkei was so impressed that he promised to serve and follow Ushiwaka. 

So hopefully the line "Whether it's Ushiwaka or Benkei, you can stop 'em!" makes a little more sense now.

Watching Johzenji play is a ton of fun. Just nice to see players who enjoy the game so much, even if their [attacks](http://imgur.com/z5oSFcE.gif) sometimes fail.

[Kageyama's nosebleed](http://imgur.com/GU7G3mQ.gif) was pretty funny, too and it was good to see Suga play again and Narita (for the first time really?), if only for a little while.
>> ARTICLE
Kageyama, now is not the time to be emulating Hinata's face-recieving skills
>> ARTICLE
For some reason I teared up a bit during Daichi's part, we don't get to see too many moments of him so I was really happy about that.

This episode was just perfect, gosh I love Haikyuu. Is it possible to get more hype every week? I can't wait another week!
>> ARTICLE
It's also lovely for the series to highlight just how much underlying influence he has on his team and even opponents (e.g. Misaki and Terushima in this episode)!
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree! Like he said himself, he may not be able to make fancy plays, but he can give the team a solid foundation. Being able to influence not only his teammates, but also his opponents, now that's a captain. 

Oh and thanks for the screenshot of Daichi with Johzenji's banner, I didn't even notice that at first, but now I appreciate that scene even more.

Just caught up, another thing to add to the "painful weekly wait" pile.

As an unathletic person who couldn't give less of a shit about sport I never thought I'd find myself watching a sports anime, but after seeing it's steady scores all through last cour and reading nothing but good things I decided to give Haikyu a go. *Damn* the hype is real. It's so exciting and intense, and the characters are interesting and fun. Such a wholesome and refreshing anime.
>> ARTICLE
same. I also started watching kuroko's basketball after catching up to haikyuu, it's pretty fun too, give it a try!
>> ARTICLE
It's the human aspect. Even nonathletic people can attribute themselves to the way people interact under pressure/strife, and how they come to succeed, or resolve those issues.
>> ARTICLE
Even though I have read the manga multiple times, the moment Kageyama said "I'm not bleeding, I'm okay!" while the blood is still coming out from his nose, manages to make me laugh. 

Daichi.... The back of the captain! With some "wild members" on Karasuno, he's the perfect captain. 
>> ARTICLE
When I played football, I got a bleeding nose, and had precisely the same reaction. It's nothing to you, but you are still required to sit the next 5-10 minutes out, which sucks.
>> ARTICLE
So on this day a week ago I was at like... episode 4 of S1 and now that I've powered through the rest of the series and caught up with the current episode, I want to express just how much fun it was. The hype is still real and I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to wait patiently on a week-to-week basis without jumping into the manga.

As for the episode itself, it was a fairly strong one (as expected) and I'm glad that team-dad Daichi's getting some of the spotlight and really emphasizing that while he doesn't stand out/doesn't get focused on muh, he's incredibly important to the dynamic of the team and their chances of success. I've come to love Karasuno so much (and so quickly) that I just want to see more and more of everyone that makes up this amazing team of dweebs.

>> ARTICLE
> [Spoilers/Speculation](/s "We will get as far as the Seijoh fight, but not Shiratorizawa. So it will be a "good" ending, but I'll be sad we won't see the "final" boss for this arc. Unless, of course, they extend it another 6 or so episodes past 25... because there's not enough manga chapters past Shiratorizawa for a whole new season right now.")

I think I've enjoyed every Haikyuu opening. This one is just too good.

Johzenji is definitely my favorite team so far. From the few times the stars aligned and made it happen for me I can attest that there is nothing more fun than a team full of outstanding athletes running around just on instinct and reflex with no level of coordination. The show represents that well with them pulling amazing plays out of their ass but then completely failing at the most basic things. I'd love a spinoff series of them.

Huh Terushima has a tongue piercing, I don't think I've ever seen one in an anime before

Wait... I just started this episode 5 minutes ago, what happened?

I really liked the focus on Daichi. He is one of my favourites from Karasuno. He is just so solid.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, the emphasis on Daichi this episode was really well-deserved. I also loved Aone finally speaking (his friendship with Hinata is so adorable).

More importantly, I am now completely convinced of the composer's, Yuuki Hayashi's, brilliancy. The piece that starts right after 8:30 is amazing (jazz piano? I'm *in love*), as well as the one right after 17:00, and the one after that, at like ~18:10. I will be keeping an eye out for anime Hayashi does the soundtrack for from now on.

[REAL GAME HYPE](http://i.imgur.com/wFkjhNr.gif).

I don't really know why but that barbecue scene was like the most satisfying SOLish scene ever.
>> ARTICLE
I was just thinking that. All the different characters played off each other really well and everyone's personality really shined. There were so many great little conversations too. The managers comparing their aces, Tsukishima and Yamaguchi discussing the Kiyoko Fan Club, the captains acting like dads. They were tiny moments but it made it really feel like a group of people having fun at a barbecue.
>> ARTICLE
This anime shows human relationships in a very optimistic yet real way.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how they do it, but every episode is so consistently amazing. Fantastic end to this arc and yet I'm getting somehow more hyped at what's coming up next for Karasuno.

I'm glad Tsukki had that cathartic moment with his brother. No silly continued misunderstandings, just two brothers being mature and talking. 

Aaaaand Bokuto is now my favorite character on this show.

One subtle thing I love in every opening of Haikyuu is the scene of Karasuno lined up versus other teams. You see the other teams seemingly unified with the same clothing set up and exact same pair of shoes, while Karasuno's teammates all have their own flair to them and different pairs of shoes. It's small, but it does a great job of emphasizing how each member of the Karasuno team is an individual person that when combined with the rest of the team makes up the sum of its parts. 
>> ARTICLE
one of the major themes of haikyuu is that what makes karasuno strong is not that they have a set strategy that works, but that theyre able to adapt. i think this is a visual cue pointing at that
>> ARTICLE
Last episode discussion, I commented, "Interested to see if he [Bokuto] gets over his emo mode and the owls win or if the crows keep it up and win," like somehow Fukurodani winning was dependent on Bokuto getting his act back together. But of course the show had to go and remind me that strong teams are strong not because of a single member, but the entire team. ^(especially Akaashi)

The brief scene between [Tsukishima and Akiteru](http://i.imgur.com/30CqXum.png) was probably the highlight of the episode for me. [Tsukki's rare smile](http://i.imgur.com/ZuptKct.png) being the highlight of the highlight. After Akiteru stopped being his motivation, Tsukki was just playing volleyball for some vague reason- maybe just to have something to do, maybe because Yamaguchi always urged him to- but now he's finally playing for his own reason. Tsukki's character development this season has been fantastic.

And the end of the episode, showing all the teams preparing for the official matches about to start, was so hype. Hinata and Kageyama continuing to perfect the new quick (in front of Ukai senior, with the crow-flying metaphor too...), Oikawa (presumably) working on an even more terrifying serve, Ushiwaka, and even Aone...SO HYPE!

^(shout out to the soundtrack for being epic as always)
>> ARTICLE
This show would have been my favourite piece of media ever if Tsukishima had his "moment" with a feint like hinata did. He seems like the type of character that would be fuelled by looking down on people.
>> ARTICLE
But Tsukki has already done a lot of feints like Hinata did. In fact anytime we've seen him go to spike the ball he's pretty much always done a feint. It's also not as big of a deal for Tsukki as it is for Hinata. Tsukki is already taller than most people so he naturally looks down on people. Hinata on the other hand is shorter than most everyone so it's more of a big deal to get the other team looking up at him.

Also Tsukki may be an asshole, but I'd say he gets fuel from being irritating and riling people up more than being arrogant.
>> ARTICLE
Wait... did we just get another a little bit of Tsukki development? 

God bless.
>> ARTICLE
And we are only half done yet.
>> ARTICLE
I'm liking his development so far. I also like his snide remarks to Hinata and Kageyama, always get a chuckle outta b then
>> ARTICLE
I'mma guess that he's gonna hit some disappointment along the way, as a result of his opening up to the idea of getting involved in the competition more wholeheartedly. His brother will be his saving grace.
>> ARTICLE
It's like that in real life too.I mean.Whatever you will do , at first you will get a 'punch in your face'.You will have sentiments like disappointment and frustration.It all depends on how you are able to get up and continue

So Haikyuu is real life?

This episode was a great break before the matches start, as well as [reaction faces paradise](http://i.imgur.com/1ex3Z5D.jpg). Fukurodani is an amazing team, really love how they work together. Bokuto went from [this](http://i.imgur.com/i8UsWjA.jpg) to [this](http://i.imgur.com/5vVJT8K.jpg) just because they all know each other so well! Also, Tsuki [looked more intimidating than ever](http://i.imgur.com/twF3Nuv.jpg) but the moment with his brother brought a smile on his face...that was really touching after what happened in the past.

More playing, fewer metaphors please!

That said, I really love how that despite being very very competitive, each of the schools cheer each other on and look out for each other - just like how Akaashi looks out for for the choking Kageyama (eat slower jeez) and all the other schools players for Yachi. They all have such a pure love for volleyball, that they want to make sure everyone has fun playing it, that I can't help but smile when I see all their interactions

I'm so happy to hear that, I love Saturdays mostly for this show

* As a anime-only watcher (I really need to start the manga), the new teams being introduced for the tournament gets me so hyped! Now that I like all the players from Aoba Josai, Fukurodani, Nekoma, and Ubagawa, I can't wait to see all the new people :D Tongue-piercing-kun looks interesting.

* All the managers are so cute! Red-hair-chan is my spirit animal. Onigiri are indeed delicious.

* Poor Yachi... I'd be terrified too, girl.

* AKITERU! Best onii-san is in da house! That little heart-to-heart is just what Tsukki needed, I think.

I'm excited to see Yachi be excited for the first game :)

50% of my enjoyment for this series is seeing Yachi's reactions to stuff.

[This scene](https://49.media.tumblr.com/6426bf28cddb47a058ffc87753b26aa3/tumblr_nz9jprqmZa1uh6s9xo5_r1_1280.gif) was hilarious.

She has just been such a wonderful addition. Was hoping Hinata would save her there though!!
>> ARTICLE
I like her so much, I'm already considering who to remove on my MAL favorite characters list to make room for her, and we're not even halfway through the season yet.

How did we ever manage without Yachi? She almost makes me forget that we're 11 episodes in and haven't had an official game yet.
>> ARTICLE
Sasuke from Itachi-yama XD
>> ARTICLE
I loved the face of Ukai (old) when Hinata and Kageyama were able to successfully execute the combo. 

could someone make a gif of that [**please?**](#katoupls)
>> ARTICLE
Man this show continues to be amazing. I was actually shocked when I reached the half-way mark because I felt so satisfied at the barbecue scene that I felt like the episode could have ended.

The Kiyoko fan club was absolutely way more amazing animated. The whole scene was just a lot of fun between the characters and it was wholly satisfying.

Definitely excited for the tournament to start and see some hype volleyball action.
>> ARTICLE
Really loved the slice of life feeling that all the 2nd season episodes gave off so far. While it is quite a change of pace from the 1st season, we got to see old characters fleshed out more and new characters introduced (Yachi <3) so its a welcome change. That being said, I can't wait for next week as it seems like the series is heading back towards its original fast pace from season 1 with one intense tournament match after another.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know if it'll end next episode, or is a 24 episoder?
>> ARTICLE
It wouldn't make sense for them to start a new arc next week if it was going to be the last episode. Its 24 episodes. Same as last season.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how far they will take the season. Considering how much the manga draws out the spring tournament it really cannot fit into this season - the finals seems like it could take a whole season of its own :/
>> ARTICLE
I would imagine it goes until before the finals
>> ARTICLE
25 episodes I think!
>> ARTICLE
yep!!
>> ARTICLE
God damn I'm so fucking hyped to see not only Ushiwaka play, but to see how Kiryu and Sakusa look and play as well!
>> ARTICLE
I can already tell that the unknown first year they mentioned is going to be a difficult opponent. It's also kind of cool that Ushiwaka is taking Hinata seriously.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, did they imply that there are two other opponents above and beyond Shiratorizawa? The boogeyman of 35 episodes has even bigger boogeymen standing behind him? Hype as fuck to see what those guys can do.

This show keeps me so engaged week to week. I was fuckin upset that they lost today, and it was just a practice match. Go out there and win those real games next week guys! We're all behind ya! 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the other guys are more versatile? Or maybe they're on a better team overall? I'm looking forward to more information about them later in the story.
>> ARTICLE
And it starts. Chill chapter, a nice way to put an end to this arc (Bokuto :'( ). But on the bright side, we are finally going to start the tournament and got a glimpse of possible new teams that might be playing against Karasuno in the new tournament. 

This chapter covered from page 10 of chapter 95 up to chapter 97.

Chapter 98

thanks

What chapter of the manga did this cover? I want to start reading from here on.

This episode covered up to and had the more important parts of Chapter 98 so you could start at 99, but it wouldn't hurt to go back and read 98 as well.

I really didn't like how they changed the scene in the BBQ where the girl was scared of everyone taller than her, in the manga it showed only 4 guys and one of them was Asahi, I found it funny how she was still scared of him but here it was different.
>> ARTICLE
This episode felt really... Meh compared to the last couple. Only interesting scene for me was the brief moment between glasses and his brother. The BBQ scenes were a bit heavy handed for me I guess. Oh well, tourney hype next week.

Yea I felt this arc was too long with little reward

Ah, what an unexpected... development.

As soon as she thought of that, [Kageyama reacted.](http://i.imgur.com/vZuyzla.jpg)

That translation was a little weird. "A banana suits Tanaka well" would have been better, implying that he looks like an ape.

The scene after that with kageyama wouldn't make much sense then.

She didn't say it out loud so there's zero connection regardless of how it's translated..

Not really. It's from the manga where it more correctly translated as [this](https://41.media.tumblr.com/be560e187c5df8f2f493238312930139/tumblr_inline_nzmhyz6ew81qiwb0x_540.png). She wasn't complimenting him.

I gotta say this has been my favorite thing about Haikyuu you actually kind of feel for the other team.

I think it looks a lot better and more frightening in the anime. 

Thanks for the comparison.

I think it's because there's more detail on the eyes.

You are probably right, it seems to be the only bigger difference.

Hinata looks like a kid lot more in the manga version, no wonder people keep thinking he is a middle schooler.

From that image above, you can see that the manga Hinata has a wider face and rounder cheeks; definitely makes him look like a kid.

Tanaka really is a monkey..
These episodes just keep getting shorter and shorter it seems like. I just can't wait to see the current manga arc animated!

How many source material is out there? Will the second season cover everything that is released so far?
>> ARTICLE
The manga still has a while to go
>> ARTICLE
No I highly doubt that. This episode covered chapters 99, 100, 101 and a part of 102. The last chapter released is chapter 187.
I would guess it might end with [Manga spoilers](/s "them beating Aoba Johsai before tackling Shiratorizawa")

I was wondering where they were going to end too, but [Manga Spoilers](/s "after I finished reading the Seijou match, I figured that would be a perfect place to end this season.  It would make a good parallel.")

Yeah that seems more likely.. It will still be pretty hype for that to happen, but I just want more Tsukishima scenes.

I hope Haikyuu never ends and will fill the hole Hunter x Hunter left T_T

Yachi's quiet "Yeah" was a game breaker.

This and the last play of the match were the best moments of this episode.

Let us all take a moment to appreciate [sad baby Asahi and his short hair](http://i.imgur.com/Hguyhxk.png).

And then, while [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/tVJS1Dk.png) (seriously what even is his hair) was [motivating his team](http://i.imgur.com/NEfq8tk.png), the soundtrack that was playing, which was one we had heard before, played a part of the track that we *hadn't* yet heard and it was magnificent. From around ~18:50 to ~19:05. ^(I love Haikyuu!!'s entire soundtrack so much)

And [this](http://40.media.tumblr.com/90fcbdc94fb05aec4acc021ce9e756b8/tumblr_n63lf6MZP71ruabdjo2_500.jpg) turns into [this](http://i.imgur.com/OelpCcH.png), which just was a fantastically weird/funny scene, but I loved it. Silly Hinata. In particular, [Kageyama's reaction to Hinata was perf](http://i.imgur.com/G5LPxxi.png). He's thinking, like, "why would you even be scared? I'm here, so you're gonna be invincible."

me: *dies at how Hinata and Kageyama support one another*

Excited now that we're seeing Karasuno actually competing! Now to wait another week...
>> ARTICLE
Do you know what the song/ost is called that plays at that time?
Around 17:50 to 19:20 ??? I really want to know so I can play it!! n_n

I really liked Captain Akki, but I couldn't take him 100% seriously because his hair is god damn distracting.

Also, the team in green that Karasuno are about to play against gives me the Date Tech vibe.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like a big difference between Date Tech and this new team is going to be that while Date Tech relied on all of its team members to create a giant, imposing wall, Kakugawa (the new green team) will show how one individual can make a huge (pun sort of intended) difference.

I knew that guy from the other school was going to redeem himself and dive for that final ball, but it still gave me chills!

I'm getting burnt out on Anime but Haikyuu is one of the only shows that I still love watching.

My eyes were getting a little teary when he thanked his former captain. I love how even the side characters in this show are really relatable and have fairly unique character designs. (dat captain hair style though...)

Speaking of which, the first few episodes of this season of Haikyuu had a crazy amount of animation. I really hope they didn't blow their budget/effort on those.

Loving the tournament already! I'm almost as hyped [as](http://i.imgur.com/MOCp39u.jpg).[them](http://i.imgur.com/5Wxdwxb.jpg)!

A [serious Hinata face](http://i.imgur.com/WlQ4mGq.jpg) appears! Really like it when this happens. [Tanaka's usual zen stance](http://i.imgur.com/kIJJZi7.jpg) was hilarious, he even [thanked Kageyama with it!](http://i.imgur.com/2Gu1XXr.jpg)

Really liked the [challenge accepted](http://i.imgur.com/hI42ZjJ.jpg) part and how they value their opponents no matter how ahead they are in points.  

Really not sure [what's up with Kiyoko and her fascination with banana Tanaka](http://i.imgur.com/kHCLp83.jpg), but somehow it made the scene more laid back and funny.  
  
[Yachi mingled in with the kids too well](http://i.imgur.com/J4r5ZaU.jpg)...and [her and Hinata's reactions to the tall opponents](http://i.imgur.com/uimtDIX.jpg) were great, as usual. 

[Can't wait for the next one!](http://i.imgur.com/Uuqc3cT.jpg) 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if you've seen it or not, but someone above provided a better translation for what Kiyoko said about Tanaka and bananas. It's better as "That banana suits Tanaka well," referring to how he's a monkey. 
>> ARTICLE
That makes much more sense...though it doesn't feel as random as the no context banana Tanaka fascination :P
>> ARTICLE
> he even thanked Kageyama with it!

I love how, in response to that, Kageyama seemed to do a mini-bow himself and didn't really know how to react. Kageyama is adorable.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, loved that part, too! It's like they don't even find it odd for Tanaka to act like that, they just go along with it.
>> ARTICLE
And the tournament finally begins.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking love tournament arcs. I'll actually be pretty sad if they make this height thing that big of a plot point. Go go lets go lets go Dateko guy was already almost 2 meters if I remember correctly. I just don't feel like it would make that much sense to make Hinata "scared" here.
>> ARTICLE
the dateko guy is 1,91
>> ARTICLE
This anime handles so well other teams damn it! I wanted them to win...

I have a question: Why does the best regional team needs to win the Spring Tournament to go to the nationals when they already won the previous Tournament?? Or they are just competing just for the sake of competing? 
>> ARTICLE
They are competing in their own region. It is similar to a state (USA), or province (Canada). This can also be called a "qualifier", where the champion of the region is named, and will go on to compete in the nationals for the title of best team in all of Japan, against all the other regional champions who won their respective regional spring tournaments.
>> ARTICLE
That badass intro followed by them being silly. That's my Haikyuu :)

Feels so good to see them win a real game! And that double reaction from Yachi and Hinata <3


>> ARTICLE
I really love how this show doesn't try tomake a team that we should hate for their methods. It feels so natural.. 
>> ARTICLE
["I...want to combine with that shark."](http://i.imgur.com/1EFkbF7.jpg) - *Hinata Shouyou*

Some nice animation in this episode, for sure. Like when the rising captain (I think?) of the opposing team [crashed into the equipment](http://i.imgur.com/6Sjun3I.gif) in order to save the ball, and when Captain Akki in the flashback [dove to save](http://i.imgur.com/6Sjun3I.gif) the ball (and failed). 

They always know what music tracks to use when. As soon as I heard the jazz track I smiled. Great choice. 

I don't watch sports anime normally, but I do appreciate that Haikyuu!! makes an effort to empathize with the opponent teams, even the 'one-shot teams' we don't see much of (as opposed to Nekoma or Aobajoushai). I have no idea to what extent the other big name sports anime do this, but I feel that Haikyuu!! at least does it well. 

Some good group shots from this episode. For those interested: [Waiting to play,](http://i.imgur.com/zLsk7vw.jpg) [Let's go!,](http://i.imgur.com/01DHabN.jpg) [Awe from the sidelines,](http://i.imgur.com/MSbMjM6.jpg) [Victory,](http://i.imgur.com/e76GfnS.jpg) [intimidation.](http://i.imgur.com/P7ozGER.jpg)

The shot of the [main Karasuno lineup](http://i.imgur.com/sNV8Zlr.jpg) was pretty neat (nice angle too). I don't think we've seen them standing in their starting positions, all orderly and professional before. At least, I don't recall one from either season one or the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
The tournament begins! I absolutely love how every team has a story and we get to see the conflict there. What makes the teams fight and what makes them strong/weak is so thrilling
>> ARTICLE
a high schooler over 2meters tall, wow, can't wait to see if hinata's training can beat that
>> ARTICLE
Thats pretty normal.
>> ARTICLE
Where is that normal? 
>> ARTICLE
middle-east.

Edit: I was 184 when I was in 8th grade. didn't increase much after 9th grade now at 194 (if not a bit higher). there were a few people taller than me.
>> ARTICLE
My dad's ~198cm, more than 50 years old, and has only met a few people taller than him in his entire life, just to give another perspective.
>> ARTICLE
Statistics would argue that someone over 2 meters tall is not normal at all.  
>> ARTICLE
How is someone being almost 6 foot 7 normal?
>> ARTICLE
Not in Japan
>> ARTICLE
I loved this episode. I like the little drabbles about the other teams Karasuno plays, it really fleshes out the world and appeals to the part of me that likes the amount of empathy sports anime usually has. 

I realized while watching Yachi by herself up there that we haven't really had the Neighborhood Association as commentators. I miss 'em.

Great episode. Always liked how haikyuu gives the opponents some development.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished 1st season, how does this compare to the first?

liked it!
>> ARTICLE
Just as good so far IMO but mostly we have only seen team development and are just starting to get into games (which is a good thing in my mind personally).
>> ARTICLE
Yachi is too adorable!

...also, Tanaka looks good with a banana.

I liked how much sway Captain Turkey-hair had over his tough-looking kouhais as a wimpy-looking guy, but having seen a lot of sports anime, I knew what would happen.

I want more of Yachi.

Hey guys, can somebody do/post a gif with hinatas amazing quick in

Karasuno, Fight! Finally the tournament starts, but the first menace of the tournament will arrive next episode. The voice of the former captain of Ohgi Minami was just like I imagined when I read the manga, nice choice for the seiyuu! 

This episode covered from chapter 99 up to page 6 of chapter 102.
>> ARTICLE
How many episodes will be there for this season, I can't get enough of this show!
>> ARTICLE
According to [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28891/Haikyuu!!_Second_Season), 25 episodes.

this was epic man that save was insane. I feel like this is where hinata's feint will work against that tall dude.

I'm so invested into this show, it's kinda bad.

What is the name of the song when karasuno wins?
>> ARTICLE
A lot of others already pointed this out, but I just have to say how much I enjoy the fact that they also show a little bit of background story for every team the play against, it's nice to give the acknowlegment that with every winner, comes a loser that is just as sad and frustrated as Karasuno was when they lost. It makes it so hard to be happy for Karasuno thought, a part of me is always crying for their adversary XD

Does anyone know what chapter in the manga the spring tournament starts at?

98 or 99, I think

Quick question, is the spring tournament over in the manga? It's getting really hard to wait week to week for episodes.

40+ chapters and counting.  Mangaka is simply dragging it.

It's being dragged needlessly by the author... Even at Chapter 192. The match point of....
>> ARTICLE
It didn't make it to Chapter 192, according to the site I used. 
>> ARTICLE
I just found out that the site i am using is erroneously labeling it as 192. 188 is the latest.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why but that episode felt short. Guess I was just used to the jam packed training camp episodes. Looking forward to see the giant play next week.
>> ARTICLE
The episode was good as always but I found the backstory on the other team to be pretty boring. Sure it's nice if the other teams get some exposition but I dont think its really necessary for EVERY team.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to /r/anime where downvote seems to be a disagreement button.  Downvoting to oblivion just for stating one's opinion seems to be a norm here.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same way, but only because I'm watching while it's airing. If I were binging, I'd love the fact that they took time to give some characterization to this random team that Karasuno beat so easily. But since I'm so anxious to get to the crazy intense matches, it was hard to get invested in this team's story. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's really interesting since you wouldn't get a glimpse on how teams feel, if they are completely overpowered/frustrated and how they can overcome it.

edit: I don't know why you get downvoted so much for just stating your opinion, though.

Meat meat meat!! Meat is God!

That was pretty much the best thing ever.

[That "umbrella" trio](http://i.imgur.com/66R6ZJ0.jpg) and the meat dance were hilarious!

I really like these practice episodes (especially when they practice along with the other teams), but I can't wait for a match episode. I'm really hoping everything works out with what they learnt and it ends up awesome!

Also, Kageyama changes reactions so fast. From [this](http://i.imgur.com/rHzjSLy.jpg) to [this](http://i.imgur.com/4CATOO7.jpg) then [this](http://i.imgur.com/9WB40TU.jpg) in like a minute.
>> ARTICLE
That umbrella scene was easily my favorite of the episode 
>> ARTICLE
I love how all the teams are interacting with each other for practice as well. Its not only adorable but also way more realistic than the usual sports anime that treat rival teams like warring countries.
>> ARTICLE
Totally. And it's not like in Kuroko where practice game is them trying to demolish each other. Rivalry rah, rah, rah. 

They're super friendly with each other. 
They actually help each other improve just because it'll make things more interesting in the official games. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean Kuroko had the friendly practice games with Shuutoku that one time.
>> ARTICLE
Well, they're all friendly with Seirin after [Kuroko spoiler?](/s "they get beat by Seirin"), but before then it really looks as if they hate each other with passion.

I can't wait to see them use everything they've learned, it's going to be so amazing.

I've said it before but wow Yachi adds SO much to this show. I can't imagine her not being there, she just fits in so perfectly!!
>> ARTICLE
I feel like she's what would happen if you inserted the viewers into the show. Yachi sees all the drama behind the scenes and really understands that the team DESERVES to win. Also she's adorable and hilarious and just lovely over all. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, I initially figured she was the plug and play female interest character but she turned out to be a super good character and really gives transparency to the story so the other characters can be themselves and not have to explain everything.
>> ARTICLE
Nice and fun episode. Hinata and Bokuto <3 getting along and learning from each other, and next week we're going to see the best and the most hyped match of the training arc, Hinata's new secret weapon :o and more importantly: [the BBQ!](https://gyazo.com/8c46317ed4d9f18931ee8571cd8d88d9) 

This episode covered from chapter 90 up to page 11 of chapter 92. 
>> ARTICLE
I love Haikyuu as much as anyone here, but I definitely noticed the deliberate change in plot pacing this season. The first season covered up to 70 chapters or thereabouts, whereas we've just reached chapter 92 with this episode.

On one hand... this insinuates the studio's desire to continue with an additional season, most likely. I can't complain about more Haikyuu! Seeing the actions animated definitely bring out a certain level of more "oomph" than the manga itself at times.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, they have covered very few chapters per episode, but thats because this part is mostly development rather than matches. Once the training arc ends, i think they will start adapting more chapters once the tournament starts. Plus, there is not enough material (assuming the scans are on par with Japan) to rush over the chapters. If they start covering around 3-4 chapters per episode, this season will end with [Spoilers](/s "The rematch against Aobajosai, and then season 3 (hopefully) will start with the match against Shiratorizawa")
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto and Hinata interacting is the best thing ever hahaha

Every character in this anime is awesome. There is not a single one I dislike!

I dislike the volleyball character that doesn't go where it scores Karasuno points till they win championships.

DID EVERYONE IN THIS THREAD SIMULTANEOUSLY FORGET TO COMMENT ON [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/OHrx5mg.png) MOMENT?? BECAUSE I'M STILL DYING OF LAUGHTER.

Ahem ok this episode was a good one. Pretty much every episode this season has been the best episode yet. I love how with Haikyuu!!, nothing much can happen in an episode, and it can still be totally engaging and go by in like 3.7 seconds. Some screenshots:

[Kuroo](http://i.imgur.com/A38wkV3.png) was especially cute this episode. How does his hair even work? I will refrain from posting a gratuitous amount of pics of him here though.

[Hinata and Lev](http://i.imgur.com/XMESneo.png) being total spazzes and overly excited is adorable. Especially when you [add Bokuto's craziness](http://i.imgur.com/G1gvqPv.png) into [the mix](http://i.imgur.com/xNvAKwj.png) and can compare [all of their faces to Akaashi, Kuroo, and Tsukki's](http://i.imgur.com/1dVzyHU.png). Like, [Lev, what are you even doing?](http://i.imgur.com/rtW17mJ.png). I love Bokuto so much though he is my precious baby owl.

Ah yes, [Kuroo "Nice Person" Tetsurou bathed in the light of the volley gods.](http://i.imgur.com/ciqMbam.png) Then [Hinata and Tsukki's faces...](http://i.imgur.com/t90Qnjc.png)

[Someday, Lev will learn.](http://i.imgur.com/OPnAsZC.png)

I can't take a [king who is that adorable](http://i.imgur.com/MOFg70M.png) seriously. He's really rockin' the cape, though.

Here's a [team shot](http://i.imgur.com/a3hrXml.jpg) from right before the episode ended.  

Aaaaand now we wait another week.

Here are the screenshots of [King Hinata](http://imgur.com/HJv7oOf) and the [whole team](http://imgur.com/zcM2Kjo) in 1080p, for what they're worth.

>> ARTICLE
IT'S THAT TIME OF THE WEEK!~~~ SO MUCH HYPE

So glad I had Haikyuu!! to look forward to after Black Friday weekend work.
>> ARTICLE
> IT'S THAT TIME OF THE WEEK!~~~ SO MUCH HYPE

Definitely. It's the only show this season that I watch immediately when it's released.
>> ARTICLE
I will just sit and refresh the new page until this thread pops up and I know the new episode is out. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah. I got Sonarr+Plex. It *tells* me when it has a new episode ready. Get a notification on my phone and everything.
>> ARTICLE
Wait.... They didn't know that Kuroo is a nice person? Oh come on now.

And the next episode looks fucking hype.
>> ARTICLE
I like how Bokuto pronounces Akashi. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually his name is Akaashi. Bokuto's not pronouncing it in a special way. 
>> ARTICLE
Huh, you're right. I thought that was just a typo in the subs.

Now I'm wondering if I didn't notice other characters saying Akaashi's name. Well, whatever. 
>> ARTICLE
I might be wrong, but with romanji/writing out Japanese in English letters 'doubling' vowels is a way to show that you're supposed to emphasize/elongate them when you say the words out loud. So for Akaashi, the 'aa' means you're supposed to hold the sound longer than you would normally. 

That being said, Bokuto's tone was pretty funny. It sounded like he was sulking or pouting (e.g. *Akaashi*, don't be cruel), like anyone of us might do in real life. Nice delivery all around. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Bokuto's VA gives Bokuto a very distinctive voice, too, which adds to the uniqueness of how he says Akaashi.

^(Also the "hey hey hey"s kill me every time)
>> ARTICLE
[Hinata's yelling in the background intensifies] (http://i.imgur.com/gBYPG3Q.jpg)

Yachi is basically the audience personified. I don't how we got through season 1 without her adorableness.
>> ARTICLE
We didn't realize we needed it back then. Now we know what we were missing.
>> ARTICLE
hahaha, oh god I'm done. Kagayama awkwardly trying to do the meat is god dance.
>> ARTICLE
Just when I thought this episode was already great, they throw in that montage at the end and bring up to 11. Looks like next episode we're gonna get a full game with all these new skills which will be fun to watch.

This episode also reminded me of my cross country training camp I went to when I was in high school. I met a lot of people from a lot of different schools and it was really fun.
>> ARTICLE
This was a great episode. Yachi is also a really good addition to the show.
>> ARTICLE
Great episode but I hope the whole "Yachi explains character reactions" bit doesn't become a thing. Kinda makes it feel like they're slapping you in the face with it. Although it *was* hilarious when the ball flew at her in the middle of her monologue.
>> ARTICLE
The explanations are not for the viewer, its about her continuing learning experience with the players.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I feel like most of the things Yachi explains are things the viewers can figure out by themselves. The opening monologue was pretty good though.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't. At least not in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
They played 65 matches in the course of 4 days? 5 days? (can't remember) Either way that must be tiring as hell...
>> ARTICLE
Each match was one set instead of the typical 2-3. Either way, 65 sets in 4-5 days is still ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
I'd hope they were rotating players in and out
>> ARTICLE
Fuuuuuuck that cockblock ending.
>> ARTICLE
gaahh... i really wanted to see that quick. I kept hoping for it not to end then it started summarizing all their learnings.. oh well. hype for next week!
>> ARTICLE
Who else would ship Hinata and Yachi? They're so cute lol
>> ARTICLE
I said to myself I would let the series build up some episodes before watching them but I cannot resist this damn show!

What on earth are you babbling about? I think this week's episode has been one of the best Haikyuu has seen so far.

Then again, I tend to think that every week...
>> ARTICLE
I agree, but like, IT hasn't happened. Every week I'm just waiting for them all to click and then I get to be hype as fuck!

I think I've been like "Man... can't wait for the next Haikyuu" for the past 3 weeks and it's still not there, I want them to fusion into a perfect being.

HYPED!!!!

End just made me so happy. PROGRESSION! & MEATU!! <3

This show is so good at building up the hype with showing Karasuno's true skills little by little, can't wait until it pays off.

And now to wait until next Sunday ; - ;
>> ARTICLE
what chapter is this episode in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Covered Chapters 90 & 91, and pages 1-12 of Chapter 92. 
>> ARTICLE
Lol at Tsukki shielding the back of his head when Asahi serves and Kageyama's awkward dancing
>> ARTICLE
Mff mmmm mrrrf
>> ARTICLE
They are so close to a breakthrough I can almost taste it. Once they click they are going to be unstoppable!
>> ARTICLE
this episode has so much cuteness! i'm so hyped for the fukurodani vs karasuno match for next week.

hinata has to be everyone's favorite kouhai regardless of what team they're on by now.

also, whenever kiyoko san speaks... my heart just goes doki-doki and it reminds me of how perfect her voice actress is for her. (more shimizu speaking screentime please!)
>> ARTICLE
Hinata [stuffing his face](http://gfycat.com/ElementaryHiddenKentrosaurus) was absolutely hilarious, as was Bokuto's [enthusiastic pride](http://gfycat.com/FrigidEvergreenLark) in Hinata's spiking. Actually's all of Boluto's [reactions](http://gfycat.com/AstonishingElderlyHeterodontosaurus) are priceless.

I think Yachi stole this particular episode, though. [Her expressions](http://gfycat.com/PalatableApprehensiveGordonsetter) are just too much.

Screenshot album [here](http://imgur.com/a/DcZGk).
>> ARTICLE
Bokuto and Hinata are so great together. The airhead and the idiot! I love them. Much more enjoyable than last week's snoozefest due to much less Tsukki, imo.
>> ARTICLE
Last weeks episode was my favourite this season, it's kind of surprising to me that you didn't enjoy it. Are you just not a big Tsukki fan? Or more into the sports side of the show? 
>> ARTICLE
I just really don't like Tsukki. At all. I *love* Hinata and Kageyama and Bokuto though. (I was like super pissed that Kageyama wasn't in last week's episode *at all* since he's the most relatable character for me.)
>> ARTICLE
Eh I guess you cant really force yourself to like a character. I totally agree with you about Hinata and Kags tho, Ive really been missing their interaction as a duo.
>> ARTICLE
Their fight a few weeks ago is still my favorite bit from this season so far, actually. I understand this is a necessary period for them both to grow (especially Kageyama), but I miss them being stupid idiots together. 
>> ARTICLE
literally nothing happens
>> ARTICLE
Huh? What episode were you watching? Things definitely happened, mate.
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else notice how they put the [mark on Daichi's](http://imgur.com/mYB7vIg) face in the OP? I'm pretty sad to see Date Tech go but at the same time I can't wait to see Karasuno vs Aoba Johsai. I want that sweet sweet revenge from them losing last season.
>> ARTICLE
Its gonna be a hell of a 6 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed but I had to go back and make sure. Gotta love it when shows add in details like that to their OP or ED
>> ARTICLE
> Did anyone else notice how they put the mark on Daichi'sface in the OP?

I did. I just kinda assumed that it had always been there without me ever noticing it, but that's a pretty nice touch.

Yeah same here, I had to go check the previous episodes to see if it was there as well.

The flashbacks were painful though, poor Yamaguchi especially...

Anyway the Hype is stronger than ever, can't wait for the rematch and to see what the mad dog can do.

>> ARTICLE
Damn this episode just made me even more hyped for the next one! Especially since it's against Oikawa...[can't wait for the match](http://i.imgur.com/NGGq8IO.jpg)!

Enjoyed watching this match even if it didn't involve Karasuno. Once again the show makes you care about the other teams and their progress. I really like [the random reactions](http://i.imgur.com/iehFHCs.jpg) not from just the [players](http://i.imgur.com/6lFqAjb.jpg) but [the rest](http://i.imgur.com/e80VUxl.jpg), as well, not to mention their [interactions](http://i.imgur.com/eAVbUn4.jpg). 

Also, [Yachi, I thought you were an expert](http://i.imgur.com/bh8Z75W.jpg) and you'd help [poor Yamaguchi!](http://i.imgur.com/m0qwCKG.jpg) Which reminds me I really want to see Yamaguchi get a good chance next time and use it...I've been waiting for that for too long >.<

It better happen in this next match, guy deserves it!!

I finally made it. I started watching Haikyuu!! 2 weeks ago, and I just caught up, so this is my first time watching it as it airs. Pretty exciting.

I did expect an episode mostly focused on this one match, and it was pretty fun. Started off strong with the best chant in the show, and that new member of the Iron Wall was pretty interesting.

Can't wait for next week when Karasuno starts to put Oikawa and Seijoh in their place. _There's no way they can lose to them twice, right?_
>> ARTICLE
I caught up today too! It really hurts not to be able to watch the next episode right away. I'm so hyped for this next match.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome!

Hope you enjoy the rest of this season as much as you enjoyed all the other earlier episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to volleyball hell.
>> ARTICLE
At least it'll be fun once a week.
>> ARTICLE
For six more weeks, that is.
>> ARTICLE
> There's no way they can lose to them twice, right?

If there's anything Baby Steps and Diamond no Ace have taught me it's that the protagonists can get shat on over and over again in a sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
Guess I have to watch Diamond no Ace now.
>> ARTICLE
I hope you're ready for some fuckin baseball, because the first season is 75 episodes long, and the second season is about to end its fourth cour.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know anything about baseball btw, does it explain the sport well enough?
>> ARTICLE
I only knew the very basics of baseball when I started watching it (hit the ball, run around plates) and still got into it. Been watching it since it aired and still don't understand why it isn't very popular.
>> ARTICLE
I've been sucked into the Diamond No Ace hole myself. I think the biggest complaint most people have is the pacing is overall much slower than most sports anime imo.

Also although I know it's an unfair comparison the actual animation isn't nearly as good as other shows such as Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it explains the significance of pretty much everything happening.
>> ARTICLE
[Welcome!](http://i.imgur.com/BoKqhff.gif)

> There's no way they can lose to them twice, right?

I hope they will win but I'm sure the match will be exciting either way! Really looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
I hope they redeem yamaguchi's character this match, I mean he suffered long enough. I just want him to feel part of the team 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, from the standpoint of sport psychology (full disclosure, I am in now way an expert... I'm just sort of assuming that is probably very much a thing actually), wouldn't being called in as a pinch server three times and three times failing do major damage to his self-esteem? At that point, I would guess the coach has to seriously consider if he can continue to rely on the player.

From a writing standpoint, if you want to continue with the character, he HAS to succeed next time he goes in or it just feels really, really forced.
>> ARTICLE
It's more of a gambling mentality where you have to take some drastic action in order to change the flow of the game, even if you don't immediately improve standings you use that chance to buy yourself a ticket into the remaining rounds. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, same here. It's sad seeing him suffer like that all this time, too.
>> ARTICLE
Was an all around great episodes. It established Tateko's team with its new players and it was just really fun to watch.

Also the end to the episode really annoyed me; I really don't want to wait for an entire week to see this clash of giants (and one of them is little ;) )

Also, I can already imagine /u/AmethystItalian being really down because of her favourite team chant being out of the show now (poor [Dateko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFinIXw5j_0)).
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure Dateko is expected to come back down the line. Aone pretty much swore revenge against Hinata there. He has to be back for another contest between those two.
>> ARTICLE
Necessary sacrifice :(

Luckily I got to hear it a lot this ep :)
>> ARTICLE
At least the episode started with a long string of it. I actually had a hard time paying attention to the dialogue, I was so caught up in the chant.
>> ARTICLE
Too bad we're stuck with the far worse chant for the next game :(
>> ARTICLE
Maybe Yachi will come up with the best chant (even better than Dateko), and it'll give Karasuno a huge confidence boost, and they'll shut out Seijoh.
>> ARTICLE
Let's just hope there will be another season next year or in 2, and we get to see them again, with the same good ol' chant.
>> ARTICLE
This is one of those few anime that makes you keep track of every minute that passes wishing you've been born in alternate universe where 20 minutes lasts for a whole day.  

Also, did anyone notice how Kageyama acquired the only insult that he knows from constantly hearing Iwaizumi using it ?  

>> ARTICLE
The main problem with Haikyuu!! is how fun it is that we can't help but feeling despair with how one episode is only 20 minutes-ish. 

And yes!! I definitely notice that. The scene that Kageyama was talking about was the scene when Oikawa almost lost it and almost hit Kageyama before Iwa-chan stopped him, right? I remember Iwa-chan keep saying how stupid/dumbass Oikawa was and Oikawa even commented that how can his insult vocabulary is limited in one word. Oh well, tiny Kageyama is adsorbing everything, lol
>> ARTICLE
I love that Oikawa is such a [monster](http://i.imgur.com/YmeXjSq.jpg) that he can set his opponents on edge, but he's also a total goofball. Not just whining to Iwaizumi all the time, but being genuinely [cute](http://i.imgur.com/kGBmdsD.jpg). There are so many characters in this great show, and it's really satisfying that not a single one is a one-dimensional caricature.

[anime_irl](http://i.imgur.com/9l9hTOw.jpg)

I never get tired of these awesome [group shots](http://i.imgur.com/1e2mMqc.jpg). They really accentuate the hype we're all feeling for the revenge arc.

EDIT: Put the [group shot](http://imgur.com/5G6cQYD) through waifu2x.

Yes, that's one of the reasons I really love Oikawa! He has so many different faucets to his personality and it's really interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, yes. [So many faucets.](https://www.google.nl/search?tbm=isch&q=faucets)

Typo aside I totally agree. One of the reasons Oikawa's my favorite. <3

Looking back at when I first started watching this show, judging it unfairly as "a bad attempt at imitating KnB" I can't believe how much of an idiot I was. 

It struck me today that Haikyuu has consistently been an amazing show, episode per episode. There are other shows I enjoy as well but for example I sometimes get frustrated or bored if I have to sit through their "build up" episodes. Haikyuu on the other hand is always enjoyable. Every moment and every scene feels like it has a clear purpose and the entire ride as a whole has been nothing short of an amazing experience for me. 

There are other shows that I really enjoyed, perhaps during certain moments I have even enjoyed them more than Haikyuu, but none of them have kept such a high and consistent level of engagement as this show has done. It's a little bit depressing to know I might never find another sports anime as good as this. 
>> ARTICLE
> judging it unfairly as "a bad attempt at imitating KnB"

Anytime I've ever heard some one say they didn't like Haikyuu that's the reason they've always given. I think a lot of people expect it to be like KnB for some reason despite the fact that it's not at all.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo and Diamond no Ace are quality sports anime.  More similar to Haikyuu than KnB.
>> ARTICLE
KnB stopped being a sports anime and became a super-powered battle shounen 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, it's a *great* super-powered battle shounen.

It's just that's a different category of sports to Haikyuu/Cross Game.
>> ARTICLE
Not saying it's a bad thing, just you'll enjoy KnB a lot more if you approach it as if watching HxH or YYH
>> ARTICLE
Alright so are they in the semis now? And has it been all one day?

>> ARTICLE
Yes, they are in the semis.
>> ARTICLE
Here's hoping they make finals for Yui!
>> ARTICLE
I think my favorite moment of the episode was when Aone said "Opponents that are hard to stop aren't always big or strong."

Because we have this story about the new setter/blocker for the whole episode, and all it takes to bridge that story into the team's story or another player's (Aone's) story is one sentence and a shift of perspective from a guy who's just starting to an experienced player who has his own focus for his determination.

I liked it.
>> ARTICLE
Well, at the beginning I expected this match to be more on the funny side but oh boy, that got intense really fast.

Nothing else to say, really. I thought it was pretty obvious that Aoba wins, it was just a question how.

And now I am ready for:

* Tsukki to block some bitches
* Yamaguchi to do some delicious pinch serving 
* Daichi and Nishinoya to do some godlike receives
* Asahi and Oikawa to deliver some service aces
* ~~And Yachi to puke her heart out~~^^^^thatmomentwassofunnyandcute  
>> ARTICLE
Was actually sad they chose to animate Aone and Hinata simply walking by one another in the hallway without acknowledgment. I was sure in the manga they were both really bummed they wouldn't get to play against each other? Their strange friendship is one of my favorite things about Date Tech.

This was a cool episode otherwise though. Loved seeing Iwa get all intense and show off his ace skills. Oikawa is the brains but Iwa-chan is the muscle.

Also that scene between Yamaguchi and Yachi was incredibly sweet. 
>> ARTICLE
> Was actually sad they chose to animate Aone and Hinata simply walking by one another in the hallway without acknowledgment. I was sure in the manga they were both really bummed they wouldn't get to play against each other? Their strange friendship is one of my favorite things about Date Tech.

Didn't you notice that Aone steps into a shadow as soon as he walks by Hinata as if Hinata casted the shadow even though he's shorter? And just before that he says "Opponents that are hard to stop are not always big or strong".

I thought that was ingenious.
>> ARTICLE
I meant conversationally. Dialogue between them rather than the sort of cold shoulder they gave each other. 
>> ARTICLE
it wasn't much of a cold shoulder, more of them acknowledging each other's strength and how the way the past few episodes have played out, they have the same exact thoughts in mind, and they know what each other is thinking

hinata: "Let's play again, and every time i will overcome you."

Aone: "I will defend against you next time."

They both respect each other's drive as rivals. In that sense, there's nothign to say

That flashback still hurts

It hurt so much :'(

I started Haikyuu 4 days back. Now on ep 18 of S2 and chapter 165 in manga.

I seriously wish that  this anime gets more love from r/anime. Majority of people ignore sports genre thinking it would be monotonous (I used to think same).

But damn, this anime is so good, that I will run out of vocabulary to describe my opinion.

Edit: spelling

Goddamnit. I didn't want to see Dateko to lose. They are a very interesting team and I would really love to see a rematch between [Aone and Hinata](http://i.imgur.com/Xsf44aS.jpg). But oh well. [Go go Karasuno](http://i.imgur.com/DSvPwJq.jpg)! Take your revenge and wipe that smirk off [Oikawa's face](http://i.imgur.com/lvKkfYl.jpg)!

I'm really hoping that Dateko takes down Karasuno at the next tourney. I think it'll make sense with Karasuno losing the 3rd years and Dateko meshing as a team. Plus I'm sure Aone will take down Hinata's quick. He's been so focused on it.

The episode was pretty great, definitely felt like cool down from last week. I'm sooooooo excited for this rematch though. The last Seijoh game was so good and I can't wait for this one.

Ive always wondered what Haikyuu would be like if there wasnt really a main team and everyone received equal attention plotwise. I mean heres a game that doesnt even involve the main cast and I'm still fully committed to it. I cry after every game because I want everyone to win.

I feel like I might not even root for Karasuno if every team recieved equal screentime. Id probably root for Nekoma because of their team dynamic or Aoba Josai because I honestly adore Oikawa as a character.

I honestly don't think I could really root for a team [that](http://i.imgur.com/FHyNMEs.png) [doesn't](http://i.imgur.com/mxsl5cF.jpg) [have](http://i.imgur.com/4B32tOm.jpg) [Tsukki](http://i.imgur.com/TfaOVYz.png).

God dammit I hope they beat Aoba and get to the nationals. 
Maybe I'm a dreamer, but knowing that Daichi is in his last year and that the mc is in his first... The anime can keep going without Daichi

This episode solidifies my favorite animation sequence in Haikyuu!! The animation of Iron Wall when Dateko did their blocking. It's just really awesome. With new setter, the movement when the third wall is added into already solid two walls, is really great. And when Iwaizumi's spike get through it, its just glorious! 

>> ARTICLE
When Aone walked past Hinata, it was pretty well done.
>> ARTICLE
Finally, the rematch we've all been waiting for. HYPE!!!
>> ARTICLE
One question for the people that read the manga. Is it worth it ?
I allways have the feeling that with sports anime its not a good idea to spoiler myself with the manga because its not so good because its more about the action and not about the story.
And do you know what chapter in the manga is episode 19 in the anime ? 
Thanks alot

Edit: Found the manga chapter.
>> ARTICLE
Just so we're all aware, this has all been the same day, since the first match.
>> ARTICLE
Nice match, interesting new rookie setter for Dateko. They have sick potential.

Yamaguchi x Yachi <3 
I'll be so sad if Yamaguchi fails again. Want to see him and Tsukki succeed.
>> ARTICLE
Aww that Koga/Saku team was so cute why do we only get them for one episode?

I suppose it offered some small hope for a Dateko victory, but considering the big rival is Seijo it was a slim hope
>> ARTICLE
Anyone mind telling me what chapter in the manga this episode ends on?

End of 128, start on 129 if you wanna read from the this point onwards

We're up to 193 in the manga

>> ARTICLE
Iunno, there will be a good 50+ chapters by the time this season ends

If the new season premieres in like a year (2017 spring/summer) there would be 100+ chapters to adapt

The popularity is there for a season 3 for sure
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time experiencing an episode largely focused on a non-Karasuno team/match as it airs. I gotta say, I appreciated them more back when I could immediately go to the next one. Now, for as good of an episode as it was, it feels like I waited all week just for the sake of building even more anticipation for the next episode.

If only I'd stayed strong and waited until it all aired. But it's too damn good.
>> ARTICLE
When he was doing his nails, cringe.... I hate that sound so much :S
>> ARTICLE
anyone know how much source material would be left over after this season to pull from, i took a pause from the manga around the 113 during the boot camp iirc, curious if they could start straight backup for s3 late this year or early next
>> ARTICLE
Enough for half a season? Depends on how long [manga spoiler](/s "the match against Shiratorizawa takes. It's 5 full sets.")
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they'll wait until [manga spoiler](/s "Until the manga finishes Nekoma vs Fukorodani before making Season 3? Because then, if they're planning for a next season, Season 4 will be the Nationals!")

I believe it's something like 45/46 chapters since this season should end near 147/148

How popular is Haikyuu in Japan, does anyone know?  Can this series go on for like a million episodes like One Piece, please?
>> ARTICLE
i assume it must be pretty popular since it has spawned a stage play so far. (and dear god there's tons of merch for it!) 

personally, i think it's going down the yowamushi pedal route, i.e. 2 seasons and a third one on the way with lots and lots stage plays so there's a whole load of stories to be told there.
>> ARTICLE
Theoretically they have almost infinite material, the problem is highschool/college transition. Can they make it work?

They could prolong and make every season about one particular matchup, and have an entire tournament last several seasons, but then the pacing might turn off a large majority of viewer.

Thing about fantasy shounen like Naruto, One Peace, Bleach, etc. they have unlimited material which they can pace at whatever the hell they want to, without worry about transition. The main issue they face is making characters too strong, and then progression becomes insignificant. i.e. Dragonball, when they were already able to blow up entire planets, it's like... Well w/e man, you leveled and can still blow up an entire planet.
>> ARTICLE
Don't know about how much material but I am visiting Japan currently and Haikyuu has SO much advertisement around. There are stores I visited with half of it with just Haikyuu merchandise in Tokyo. I had no idea it was so popular until coming here. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh perfect question for me I just came back from 3 weeks in Japan recently. Yeah Haikyuu is super popular right now. Last time i was there all the merchandise revolved around Shingeki no Kyojin and this time it was all about Haikyuu. I actually didn't even know about Haikyuu until my recent visit to Japan.
>> ARTICLE
It's very popular, it was the [#5 best selling manga series](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-31/top-selling-manga-in-japan-by-series-2015/.88770) in Japan this year. I don't think the BD's for season 2 have gone on sale yet, but season 1 averaged 24,884 units per volume, which is excellent as well. Season 2 moved to a late night time slot instead of the earlier one that the season 1 had so we'll have to wait and see how that affects sales. There's a ton of merchandise around, which is also a good sign of how popular it is.

My guess is that it'll end up like Kuroko. It does well and fans love it so I.G. will keep making it as long as there's source material to adapt. Personally, I don't want several hundred episodes of Haikyuu because I don't think the story can sustain itself that long, but I will gladly take a couple more seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, usually the episodes feel longer, but this one felt like it was over in an instant. I haven't felt the hype/tension in these past two episodes mostly because we pretty much know that theyre going to win, but I guess they're used to show off how much they improved. I just cant wait for when we have games that are spanned out into 5 episodes, and you dont know who's going to win. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure I'd watch a show with even just one of these characters.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so happy we get Haikyuu for another fucking 12 episodes! I fucking love this show to death. 
Can't wait for the new OP/ED.
>> ARTICLE
I loved Tanaka whistling Imagination at the end when Daichi glared at him and Nishinoya.
>> ARTICLE
I checked and it was actually Nishinoya whistling, but yeah, good catch, didn't noticed it the 1st time.
>> ARTICLE
Ah you're right! Yeah I had to replay that scene a couple of times to double check what I was hearing but I was just listening to that part, not watching.
>> ARTICLE
One of those five minute episodes again...
>> ARTICLE
Kiyoko-san is so cute! I never thought I'd be this invested in a anime about volleyball... why can't the manga and anime release new chapters and episodes every day?!?!
>> ARTICLE
So for those of you who play volleyball just like me, I am just sitting her like how is Kageyama's super quick shoot set not called for a two touch?

Also based on the preview that serve seemed like Yamaguchi's!
>> ARTICLE
Some refs do call a double touch for a spinning ball, but they are wrong to do that.  It's a common misconception. It should only be called a double if they can actually see both hands not hitting the ball simultaneously.  Some good info about spin and double contacts here:

Ah! Thanks for the clear up I play high school and high school club so it can be dodgy at times >.<

Nothing fills the Baby Steps void like Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
i liked yachi in the manga but seeing her animated just endeared me so much to her. and who else doesn't get a bit distracted whenever kiyoko speaks? like damn, she should get more lines because that voice just *suits* her so well!

yet another great episode. for haikyuu anime-only watchers, if you're thinking of reading the manga, now is pretty much the best time!

someone on tumblr pointed out that the kids who accompanied ukai sr. to the game looks like aoba johsai players and i cannot unsee it ever since.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu threads are the post positive place on the Internet. This show has so much power over the people who watch it, it's amazing! 
>> ARTICLE
I'm worried this was the last episode with the current OP... :'(

Goddamn Hyakuzawa is freaky tall. That's not even fair.

I fucking love this soundtrack so so so so so much. Can I preorder like a dozen copies of it? Also, does anyone know when it will be released??

[Dumbass Hinata](http://i.imgur.com/SOJECtJ.png).

I loved all the shots this episodes that contrasted tall-kun and Hinata's heights.

I am so in love with this show and every single character in it that it actually kinda pains me every week when the episode ends.
>> ARTICLE
>Goddamn Hyakuzawa is freaky tall.

He wouldn't seem as tall if he was surrounded by North American people. 

>I fucking love this soundtrack so so so so so much.

Me too. Me too. The soundtracks released before this season are some of my most listened-to soundtracks from anything, and this season's are just as great.

>I am so in love with this show and every single character in it

My favourite parts are just their little gestures and interactions, bringing out a sense of personality that you don't get in many other shows. For example, [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3ybgcu/spoilers_haikyuu_second_season_episode_13/cycbt3x).

Gotta love Daichi putting Nishinoya and Tanaka in their places a few times this episode.

They're doing well. Thanks for asking.

The blond guy with the tongue piercing? He was shown towards the end of episode 11. I don't think anime-only viewers have been properly introduced to him and his school yet.

Oh man, the OST of this anime is so awesome! I thought that [this BGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSf3myqb3gs) is already awesome for Hinata and Kageyama's weird quick but damn, just as their quick attack evolved, the BGM for their signature quick also leveled up!
>> ARTICLE
ahhhhhh Haikyuu is so good. It's a feels good anime that makes me smile the whole time but with tons of emotion behind it as well. 
I found out about Haikyuu like a week ago, binge watch up til season2 ep.12 then I binge read the manga til the current chapter. SO GOOD.
>> ARTICLE
I swear the mid-episode card comes faster and faster every episode. Like Shimizu did her underhand serve I yelled "NO!!!" at the screen because I knew we were at the halfway point. How come these episodes are 8 minutes long? 
>> ARTICLE
s2 episode 13 @ 17:20: it's a "four consecutive contacts" fault!
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, A block isn't counted as a hit/touch anymore.
>> ARTICLE
my biggest question is why hasn't Hinata learned to serve better?
>> ARTICLE
He's been practicing quicks, etc. The main issue facing age-gated sports is time. You only have so much time to devote to particular things. It's why most hardcore amateur sports have in-house dorms which are probably mandatory, so they can practice nearly 100% of their non-school hours.

If he practiced serves, would he have perfected his quick in time to score the points they needed to win at this regional? Who knows.
>> ARTICLE
who knows I'm just confused why that wasn't one of the things he worked on seeing as how he wasn't a decent server and it seems like he could be a great one because he is a high jumper and very fast with good sense of seeing openings. 
>> ARTICLE
It also requires power, which he has none of. 
>> ARTICLE
if he's very accurate it can still be a good thing. you would think a spiker should be a power hitter but like you said he isn't that powerful
>> ARTICLE
Though, he isn't very accurate either, he is just fast. The main issue of receiving most serves is the power behind it. They are afraid of the overhand serves, precisely because they cannot receive it properly. This leads to issues setting up the attack. It also makes it easier to read where the return will come from, because a botched receive has less options than a perfectly received ball.
>> ARTICLE
Did I just see Kuroo in the previews? Is he watching the Karasuni matches? Is that Oikawa and Iwaizumi bullying somebody? And there's Ushijims too! Next episode is going to be loaded!
>> ARTICLE
Every episode that comes out reminds that the anime is one step closer to getting close to where the anime is

Everything with Ukai was hilarious, especially with Yachi. "Blonde hair and pierced ears! To think that he's a fan too... I'm gonna get killed!"

The scenes with Yachi and Ukai were anime original scenes too. Pretty damn hilarious!

I think the fact that I had a silly grin on my face the whole time speaks enough about my feelings towards this episode.

Why last season and probably this season are 10/10 for me. I can't help but just be entertained the entire episode. Makes me feel so happy

I was about to write this too. Literally had a smile for 23 minutes, this show is amazing.

I think they've shown Yachi as an introvert pretty well. Especially when she was totally spent after being exposed to Hinata's outgoing self for a while.

Very warm and pleasant episode + first few minutes = gold.

Wonder why they've made it only 5 minutes though.
>> ARTICLE
Hinata is a bright ray of light. I'm surprised no-one's gotten sunburn from being around him too long.

If I recall correctly, 'Hinata' means to face the sun, or a sunny place.

How an Anime about people playing volleyball can capture my attention every week and make my laugh/smile consistently.... I will never quite understand.

You should watch Hajime No Ippo. 
>> ARTICLE
Meh. I'm after he loses his championship match to the old guy. Then it got redundant. Oh, tough guy with weird technique, let's adapt. Oh hard fight, almost lose, but we win. Yay.
>> ARTICLE
I understand how you feel, but I believe that all the matches after the Ippo vs Date match are some of the best episodes of the entire anime series (or of any sports anime series, for that matter). The Takamura world title match in the Hajime No Ippo: The New Challenger season, and the main Ippo match in the Hajime No Ippo: Rising season, are especially high quality. It's not just the matches themselves are really good, but the character development of the main cast and the opposing fighters are really well done. I'm not going to lie though, some of the animation in the newer episodes (Rising) are not as good as the older episodes, but that's dependent on personal taste.
>> ARTICLE
Add Cross Game to that list.

My brother likes to call this show "the dancing show"

and Baby Steps. more people need to know about this godly anime
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps is okay. It's a little too focused on the tennis though. There aren't many funny scenes and the side characters aren't really that involved. 
>> ARTICLE
But baby steps has one of the best romantic sub plot compared to sports anime genre.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like that was kinda the charm of Baby Steps. It took a realistic approach to the sports anime genre, which isn't too popular, it seems. Or at least, from the few I've seen/head of. I like all the technical mumbo-jumbo and his technical thought of "How do I get out of this situation" was interesting since it was a change from the teamwork/willpower kinda thing.

That's coming from someone who LOVED Kuroko too. I enjoyed the different approach.
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie, there have been some tears while watching and reading Haikyuu.

Still don't quite know how, but I love it.

I feel like I'm gonna cry during every episode. There's just so much hopefulness and hard work from everybody and I just love that shit

As for the everyone else who just hasn't stumbled across this yet, I really think this season of Haikyuu is gonna hit really big and by its conclusion will have hopefully really grown in popularity.

Yeah, I pounded out the first season real quick before this started and boy, I'm gonna have to get used to not watching it when I need it
>> ARTICLE
Her misjudgment of people and then feeling super guilty later was my favourite. It's a hard thing introducing a new character when we already have an established team of extremely likable characters without messing that chemistry up but I'm really looking forward to her becoming a part of the gang. Especially if it means more lines and screen time for kiyoko.
>> ARTICLE
[*"I judged someone by their appearance again!"*](https://imgur.com/l1XUAYU)

Yeah i like the way they made use of the exams, to introduce her rather than just having it as a standard road block.

If she's there for the practice match in the next episode, she's bound to see it.

While this episode was significantly less hype than last week's, it was still absolutely amazing and showed how entertaining the slice-of-life side of Haikyuu!! is. I can't wait for next week's episode! (no, like really, I **can't** wait *someone help me pls*)

Aaaaaaand villager B makes her appearence! The OST is perfect, especially when Yachi thinks Hinata is a manager. 

The pace is good, ~2 manga chapters per anime chapter. With this pace, the season will probably end with [Manga Spoilers](/s "The beginning of the Aoba Jousai rematch, Damn...  Welp Season 3 Hype!")

Edit: Words 
>> ARTICLE
The OST when Yachi thinks Hinata is a manager is called "Chemical Change" and it is from S1 and it is possibly my *favorite* soundtrack from S1 (it memorably plays during a great montage in one of the earlier episodes) and the *entire* Haikyuu!! soundtrack is so amazing and underappreciated. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure episodes involving matches will do through more manga chapters, since they usually have less dialogue.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, I was just calculating with that pace without counting the chapters with matches on them. Hopefully we get to see that full match animated.

But also Natsu, guys. Natsu made an appearance and we are all so #blessed

Haikyuu is such a wonder for me. Nowadays I usually read whatever becomes anime before it does so when it ends up being animated I can't help but skip some parts yet I re-read Haikyuu several times and still watch the episodes as if they're fresh new. So good.

Oh man, next episode will be super hype! I just can't wait to see the scene [spoiler](/s "where Hinata will deliver his line where he convinces Yachi to finally join Karasuno as Karasuno's manager") animated in its full glory! It's one of my most favorite scene in the story.

Love Yachi already. Her goofy and paranoid personality is really entertaining, and seeing her grow in confidence alongside the rest of the time will definitely be a joy to watch.

You really like playing the melody in octaves, don't you? :P
>> ARTICLE
The entire song is almost in octaves, so I apologize for that lol.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I don't mind it too much. It got a little jarring at points, but because of the transitions not using octaves, it wasn't too bad.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, there, could you say an specific example of that? I mean, I understand what an octave is, but I can't hear those jarring moments. I'm a self-taught guitarist so if there's anything about music I can learn, I'll take it without hesitating. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe jarring isn't the best word. It's just that with a 16 minute piece, playing melodies the same way for pretty much all of it can make it all sound the same and therefore get boring. Octaves do work in this case, but maybe it would've been good to switch it up with playing in fourths or fifths, or just the notes by themselves without harmony.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I see. I thought you were talking about specific moments where it didn't really fit, rather than it being a bit too reptitive. I can definitely agree. 

OP could have been a bit more creative with how he arranged the songs, but I guess that requires even more efforts, and since he admits himself not being the most best piano player out there, I can definitely understand going for such an arrangement as well.

Thank you! For me, when I transcribe/arrange songs and notate them, as I go along, the song kind of gets memorized, so when I finish, I pretty much already know it. Working on this for like 100 hours is similar, just that this entire thing was 17 minutes long lol. But a simple answer would just be yes, I memorized the entire thing xD.
>> ARTICLE
(from someone who struggles at memorising music) That is still incredibly impressive! Great job, an inspiration to us all. 
>> ARTICLE
this is sooooo coooool!!!

[](#excitedyui)
>> ARTICLE
son of a....
>> ARTICLE
Thank you haha.
>> ARTICLE
This is really damn good. And very impressive if you managed to memorize the whole damn thing.

Did you write/transcribe the sheet music for every song?  
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. I memorized it xD.

Yes I did. I pretty much knew Tokyo Ghoul ED already from a friend of mine, but Charlotte OP's scales were inspired by another friend Daniel Nguyen (PaintAMelody). If you find his TV Size version of Bravely You, he does something similar. Other than that, I might have gotten inspirations elsewhere, but I'm not aware haha.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit Kyoukai no Rinne actually got some love. Really good job dude.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah...that was an easy song and I messed up the intro lol. I love the first OP though :3. Thank you very much.
>> ARTICLE
How did he play that all at once? Holy shit.
>> ARTICLE
Uh...derp?

Second "summary of the year" post and again no JoJo.

[](#josephcrying)

Gj on the others though. Finally someone who watched and liked the Arslan Senki ED.
>> ARTICLE
NO JOJO :(
>> ARTICLE
I don't watch JoJo, and I've actually never heard the songs...sorry ;(.
>> ARTICLE
This is a great job, and I love the fact that you covered "Hello, Shooting Star", it's one of my favorite ED's.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad you liked it :). Yep, it's a great song.
>> ARTICLE
kousei arima is that you
>> ARTICLE
Sadly, not even close ;).
>> ARTICLE
I really like these medleys. Here's another one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hLkIsnWKrU
>> ARTICLE
Haha, in my description I said I wasn't as good as marasy xD.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that's really impressive. I tried making my own piano medley once, and the transitions were hard enough for like 7 or so songs, so with one with this many it's really awesome. Mad props to you; it's not the most technical piece but sounds great which is the important thing. Also, I totally understand the mistakes, don't worry about it. It's hard enough to play a minute long song without messing up already, so a 17 minute arrangement is bound to have some errors. 

Consider me a fan!

edit: Really awesome job on the left hand octaves for the Yamada and the 7 Witches OP. Impressive stuff, man!
>> ARTICLE
Thank you very much, and I'm glad you liked it :D!
>> ARTICLE
This is awesome! Great job!
>> ARTICLE
Thank you very much :).
>> ARTICLE
You played almost as good as me, EMOTTTTTTIONSSSSS!!
>> ARTICLE
looool xD.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit man as a musician myself all I can do is be amazed and compliment you for the majestic work, I wish to duet an anime medley with you :')
>> ARTICLE
Thank you, and I'm glad you liked it. Would it be rude if I said I wasn't interested though...I don't do collabs often :/.
>> ARTICLE
Nah man i was joking, Keep it up with the good Work :)
>> ARTICLE
Those octaves.

But you know what, you actually bothered to do this. As a fellow pianist, I salute you. Good job.
>> ARTICLE
xD

Thank you.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno what font you used for the video but that was some cringeworthy /r/kerning stuff right there. I couldn't bear the lack of space inbetween the letters. 

Other than that, wonderful work you've done there! 
>> ARTICLE
Aw, I liked that font xD. Then again, it was kinda hard to see sometimes.

Thank you very much.

There's been a lot of really great anime this year but there's nothing like Haikyuu season 2 announcement.
Man, i love this show and it's characters, the way they animated it and especially all the little things like background chants. It just feels alive. Im super excited what's happening next.
LETS GO

Finally a date! HYPEEEEE

Yuusssss
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, please tell me that it's going to include the training camp please
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, I just finish watching it yesterday too :D
>> ARTICLE
Gotta ask, how is this show? I've finished watching/catching up to a bunch of sports related anime over the summer (Major, PoT, DnA, Baby Steps, KnB, Eyeshield, etc...). I've never been one to follow or be interested in volleyball but I guess that's the same for any sport besides baseball for me.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly what /u/greenpenguinboy said, Haikyuu is quite realistic and basically all of the characters are likable in one way or the other. I haven't seen a lot of sports anime but I don't think many other series execute these elements as well as Haikyuu does! 

Tldr; I'd definitely recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the recommendation, just finished it and I loved it. Not a huge Volleyball fan as I stated before but regardless of my lack of interest in the sport, the story was good. I'd also recommend it to anyone debating on it.

Also, you might want to check out Kuroko's Basket and Diamond no Ace. KnB has a bit of the "super power" thing going on but for the most part it's just exaggeration on players abilities to give you more of a feel of what it would be like being on the court. As for DnA, there is absolutely none of the super power stuff. Hinata and Sawamura (DnA lead, not to be confused with Haikyuu captain) are very similar in the fact that they both came from mediocre schools and less than good teams. Both are definitely worth the watch. Also, Baby Steps is really fantastic, no super power stuff, just straight up tennis. It's really good at explaining everything too without being boring about it.
>> ARTICLE
That's great to hear you enjoyed it! I definitely had my doubts going in too, but it really is a great show.

I've actually finished Kuroko's Basket; what a ride that was! Those last few episodes were crazy, and the very last episode made me completely break down, lol. I think the OPness really worked for the show, it carried that shounen battle feel very well. 

As for Diamond no Ace, I've been meaning to watch it for ages but haven't got around to it... you've definitely convinced me to though! Baby Steps is also one of many other sports shows I have on my [plan to watch list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/uhvocado?tag=Sports&status=7) so I guess this means I should increase my priority to get around to watching them..! 
>> ARTICLE
The level of OP god teir powers isn't there but everyone has their strengths and they show it off. What I think it excells at that others don't is when it shows defeat and failure. Even when the opponents lose it hurts; at least for me
>> ARTICLE
Just finished, definitely right about feeling for the opponents. The last game would have made me sad regardless of who lost. That whole "3rd years" won't be around thing I see often but it never really gets old so to speak. Looking forward to next season!
>> ARTICLE
Just started, Immediate reaction, OP doesn't start with singing "Woooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaa" so that's a good sign that it's different from the norm. 
>> ARTICLE
Any interest in a Haikyuu!! rewatch **before the second season airs in October?** This is all I read when I was looking at the title/ 
>> ARTICLE
I'M SO EXCITED
>> ARTICLE
I'd be interested. Haven't seen it yet, personally, but heard good things and it would be fun to watch with other people on here. I might not be as active early in September, primarily because I'm heading the Yuki Yuna re-watch around the same time, but I'm def interested in doing it.
>> ARTICLE
Awesomesauce! I haven't watched Yuki Yuna yet, so maybe I'll join in on that (re)watch, then!
>> ARTICLE
Here's hoping you do! [:D](http://imgur.com/cRUnwKp) It's my personal favorite and I love getting more people to watch and give it a chance!
>> ARTICLE
Was planning on rewatching it anyways before the second season started, so I'd definitely look forward to a rewatch!
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I'm definitely rewatching it no matter what. And since I figured there would be other people planning to rewatch it before S2 too, I figured why not make it a group watch?
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, keep us posted OP I'm sure there would be enough support for a rewatch the closer we get to the 2015 Fall season.
>> ARTICLE
>  And if there is a lot of interest, any input on how fast we should watch it / starting when? 

[I'd take a look at the rewatch wiki to help decide a date](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rewatches) (A few things need updated on it though. LotGH and Baccano! I believe are now over). I personally wouldn't recommend beginning of September because you'll be against 3 1 per day rewatches (Ghost in the Shell, Trigun, Yuuki Yuuna), 2 every other day (Kyousougiga, Raildex), and several once per week rewatch posts. Mid September maybe would be better.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I'm going to guess that since Haikyuu!! S1 aired on Sundays last year, S2 will continue to air on Sundays, so it'll probably (?) begin on Oct. 11. In order to finish a one-episode-per-day rewatch by then, we'd have to start around Sept. 16; could start later if the last couple days we bump it up to two per day. By mid-Sept., several of the current and upcoming rewatches will be over, so this could work better. Of course, unfortunately we don't know yet when S2 will start.
>> ARTICLE
I literally just finished this show an hour ago <_<
>> ARTICLE
Aw man! Well, if you feel like watching it again in a couple weeks...
>> ARTICLE
I'd be up for a watch, I haven't seen it yet but I've wanted to for a while but I had other shows to watch. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, yes and yes! I think it's my most rewatched anime, I absolutely love it to bits haha.
>> ARTICLE
I'm rewatching it right now. Still on episode 5 though, so if the rewatch happens I'll wait until it starts
>> ARTICLE
I think there's a good chance the rewatch *will* happen, probably not until mid-Sept. though. The more the merrier, but if it can't wait, then it can't wait! :)
>> ARTICLE
YES! Haikyuu! is so good! I'd definitely join the rewatch
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think I might join in on this re-watch as well.

Sports anime is a genre I haven't had much experience with, so it'll be a nice change of pace for me to take a try at one of the apparently best examples.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I was literally just thinking of doing a rewatch when I found this! Definitely in.
>> ARTICLE
I've been considering picking up this anime so I'd be down.
>> ARTICLE
Watched maybe 1-2 episodes but couldn't continue because was busy at the time. I would love to get in on this though! Series seemed really good!!
>> ARTICLE
YES oh my god if no one was going to suggest it I was ~~not that I would even remotely know how~~
>> ARTICLE
A rewatch would be fun! I'm a big fan of sports anime, but I put Haikyuu!! on hold because life got in the way. This'll definitely give me an excuse to pick it back up. 
>> ARTICLE
I would be down, I have not seen it at all but I have heard good things.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to join the rewatch. Haikyuu is my 3rd favourite sport anime + I was planning on rewatching it anyway :p
>> ARTICLE
I'll join!! Watched the first half but it's been a while so this'll be the perfect "excuse" to watch the rest. :p
>> ARTICLE
Yes
>> ARTICLE
this'll be my 5th time re-watching it, cause i've rewatched it 2 times with 2 friends separately and 2 times including my first watch XD
>> ARTICLE
So, when do we start? :)
>> ARTICLE
In 2 days! [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3k5mxz/reminder_haikyuu_rewatch_starts_one_week_from/) is the post I made about it last week; also, it's in the rewatch wiki for this subreddit.

Cool, Thanks! 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's fair to say that One Punch Man has some high expectations to live up to.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I think I'm going to have to give it a go

>> ARTICLE
Which it is living up to so far.
>> ARTICLE
It is so fun to watch, and adapted those first chapters pretty well.
>> ARTICLE
It was 1 episode.
>> ARTICLE
it was an episode that had movie level animation backed by some of the best animators of the industry 
>> ARTICLE
> backed by some of the best animators of the industry

Can I get some sort of explanation or source?
>> ARTICLE
heres a list: a guy named shingo natsume who did a lot of FMAs action, and all of his friends, yoshimichi kameda (other main FMA guy), Norifumi Kugai (one of the best backround animators atm), Ken'ichi Fujisawa (naruto shippuden fight animatior), se jun kim (gundum build fighters animator), Gosei oda (space dandy animation director), suchio (main animation director for Kill la Kill), and arifumi imai (main animator for titan fights in SNK)

Hello senpai! You aren't even twice my age though, so don't feel too old!

Well thanks, but all this 'senpai' jazz is making me feel...not young. (Senpai definitely gives away his age by referring to certain things as 'jazz'.)
>> ARTICLE
lmao, I suppose so. I'm about 10 years older than the average age here, so I kind of feel a bit old too, though not as much I'd imagine. But hey, that just means you're a super cool older person!

http://youtu.be/8Bqi5J7KEr0

I'm curious, what's it like being the senpai amongst hundreds of college age kids (and one 6-year-old)?

In a lot of ways, it sucks.  (I'm almost as old as him.)

Well then let's share old man tips. I'll start by recommending Miralax. You know what I'm talking about without even googling it, don't ya.
>> ARTICLE
Only by guessing medicine name parts  "-lax" is gonna be a certain thing, heh.  Now, if you wanna talk metformin or simvastatin
>> ARTICLE
Wow, suddenly I feel a certain sense of...responsibility? Well, to all my kohai I offer this advice:

- Municipal bonds are a good investment. Except if you live in Detroit.
- Don't listen to beer snobs. Drink whatever the hell you like.
- Also, McDonald's isn't as bad as everyone on the Internet says it is.
- Here's what you should do with real-life lolis: NOTHING.

And lastly:

- Don't trust anyone over 30. Boomers and GenXers fucked everything up (but mostly the Boomers). Do you think we know how to fix it? 

>> ARTICLE
Duly noted. Also I tagged you as senpai 48 so I'll be calling you that if I see you again.

Did you just give us advice and then tell us not to trust you? What do I do senpai!?

Honestly I believe its the most interesting project of this season, even more so then One Punchman imo.

This is easily the show I'm most excited for after the first episode.

EDIT: The second episode only made it better.

Oh boy, I think Heavy Object ain't going to live up to that O.o
>> ARTICLE
I'm more of the stuff blowing up and less of the white knighting but I am a fan of light novels and that's that.
>> ARTICLE
It's been two episodes. Don't we have a three episode rule here lol? Let's save the doubts until then.

^(But I mean, I *kinda* agree with you. *Kinda*.) 
>> ARTICLE
There's no rule, it's just what a lot of people do.  I'm giving it 3-5 myself, but it *reaaaally* seems bad.  First red flag was the MC being afraid to save a broad because tits.  That really rubbed me the wrong way.  Harem antics can be fun, but don't fucking shame the audience for it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, there was some backlash to that on the show thread. It was funny to me for like a few seconds until I basically yelled at my screen for the MC to figure his shit out. I was laughing when I said that, but still.

I really like the action, the other stuff isn't too great though for the most part. Doesn't some of the dialogue seem...rushed or forced to you? Because it did to me, and it was very evident in Episode 2.
>> ARTICLE
>  Doesn't some of the dialogue seem...rushed or forced to you?

Oh yeah, hardcore forced.  His white knighting and all that was *suuuper* forced.
>> ARTICLE
> His white knighting and all that was suuuper forced.

That's the big one. One of the others was the pilot (forgetting her name atm, still waking up) [](/s "going off on her mini-rant about how she viewed other humans outside the Objects as fodder.") I get that she was just in a certain-death situation, but that rant could've been dialogue saved for later in a different situation.
>> ARTICLE
Lupin and Gundam. Good taste Japan
>> ARTICLE
Yeah how the hell is Gundam not on r/anime's Top 10? I am disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly. Look at the last few Gundam shows: 00 2nd season, AGE, and G something-or-other. Build fighters was good and Unicorn is... okay?(no idea honestly). I have 0 expectations for this series. If it even keeps me interested.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't unicorn one of the most beloved series in the franchise?
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen it so I cann't comment on it. My point was Gundam isn't all that great. Just as many hits as misses and it's recently been more misses.
>> ARTICLE
Id say its one of the best mecha shows ever.
>> ARTICLE
Yes... Yes it is. You can watch it without any prior knowledge of the Gundam universe too!
>> ARTICLE
I heard its best to watch a few gundam series beforehand to get the most out of it so that's what I'm planning to do.
>> ARTICLE
I'll admit my heart sank thru the floor when I saw that IBO didn't make the list. I even checked the list multiple times just in case I just missed it or something.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously WTF? How does trash like Heavy object, Rakudai, and Gakusen make it in the top 15 and Gundam doesn't? I mean this is my first Gundam show i've watched but it easily had a top 3 first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Same, it's my first gundam to watch but holy shit it's been good 1st episode. Get your shit together /r/anime 
>> ARTICLE
Apparently r/anime is not a fan of gundam.
Until recently.
>> ARTICLE
Really, western anime fans in general really don't care about Gundam.  Gundam in the west didn't show up until 2000 (Wing), then 9/11 happened and the dubs for the earlier series got canned (notably the original Gundam) although post-Wing series like G-Gundam and SEED still made it through.  It also doesn't help that brand recognition completely died after SEED (~2006); I remember Toys R Us used to have SEED gunpla, but it all got pulled a few years later.  After SEED, Sunrise backed the fuck out of the western market and have only recently started trying again.  Yeah there have been a few official subs and dubs of the other stuff, but 00's TV airing apparently bombed horribly and the other options are scattered among a ton of companies.

On the other hand, apparently Gundam had a pretty damn large influence (1979!) on anime moving from kiddy moving drawings to a full-fledged medium that presents any genre.  The franchise in general is also a prominent, persistent brand with a 36 year long legacy (and counting) and a new series comes out every other year at minimum.

I mean, personally, I actually bounced off SEED while it was airing but got seriously hooked on Eureka 7, then went back to SEED, randomly stumbled across 00 and followed it as it aired, and eventually binged the rest of the franchise.  My becoming a Gundam fan was practically an accident; a very happy accident, but an accident nonetheless.
>> ARTICLE
wing was on cartoon network in '98
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, so many people showed up for Orphans, the veterans in there were actually surprised.
>> ARTICLE
I hope many of them show up for the Gundam 00 rewatch and learn how good Gundam can be.
>> ARTICLE
I really feel like I was the only guy around here who wasn't a big fan of 00. It just felt like a more tedious version of Wing. 
>> ARTICLE
I always felt its a better version of Wing

being that the last gundam show i watched was wing, how so?

makes me want to join in on the 00 rewatch

They better, 00 S1 is my all-time favorite. Hit me like a brick as a child.

>98 responses

!!!! Glad to see that number up from before. Hopefully it'll continue to increase.

The japanese results seem pretty consistent with what I've seen about what they like. (lupin and moe shows being higher)

It's kinda interesting to see the gap between noragami aragato between the japanese and english audience. It almost doesn't seem to to be on their radar, whereas it has a pretty large following here.

how long will it take to marathon it all? i got no plans for today/tonite/tomorow?
>> ARTICLE
2mins an episode. 60~ episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Less than 2 hours

considering that none of the shorts got higher than 35% from /r/anime, I would say that 19.7% is pretty respectable.

Anything less than first place isn't good enough :P
>> ARTICLE
At first I thought this season is ass, now I am watching like 9 or 10 animes. Wellp, there goes me premature judgement.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Japan ranked GochiUsa while /r/anime left it off. They have much better taste than us. Which isn't surprising considering the kind of taste I see here everyday.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting that Owarimonogatari is much farther down on /r/japan_anime's list
>> ARTICLE
Interest enhance by their 2nd place anime being ~~29th~~ 26th for us.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm adding that one to the list as well.
>> ARTICLE
Osomatsu-san slipped completely under the radar in both subs? Gotta love them sleeper hits

Looks like we English speakers were 33% more hype for One Punch Man than Japan was. Not to mention it dominated both gender lists. Forget "the new Attack on Titan," OPM is gonna be the new Bebop if this keeps up, which *it will.* (I *dare* you to say otherwise)
>> ARTICLE
Isn't it a parody-sports anime, I mean I just don't think that has the wide-appeal that Cowboy Bebop can muster.
>> ARTICLE
No.. Superhero, not boxing
>> ARTICLE
Japs actually have better taste than /r/anime.

Who would have thought. [](/s "Everyone :^)")
>> ARTICLE
isn't "japs" considered a slur?
>> ARTICLE
> Females  
> > Haikyuu!! Second Season 38.1%

Very great taste here, I'm actually surprised this wasn't a bit higher on the list for the males.
>> ARTICLE
From what I've seen at least, sports anime with a cast of young males tend to be more popular among females than males (i.e. Free, Kuroko no Basket, etc.). I think it has to do with some kind of fascination over shipping the dudes together.
>> ARTICLE
It's totally about the shipping for me. Eye candy fanservice isn't that interesting to me, but yaoi bait fanservice? Wonderful. Yuri bait's good too actually. 
>> ARTICLE
I've watched a bit of kuroko and hakyuu, and Free S1.

Honestly, it's not about shipping, it's just refreshing compared to the more fan servicey male target audience series. 

Also, Hakyuu is actually awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like /r/japan_anime never had their hopes up for Heavy Object to begin with :p

One Punch Man is unsurprisingly the king of this season
>> ARTICLE
Second place: 50%              
First place, One Punch Man: *EIGHTY PERCENT*

wow, as someone who's also extremely hyped for OPM, that is still insane to see

>> ARTICLE
Kinda  feel sorry for One Punch Man the hype is so big its going to be impossible to lived up to. Its by far the most hyped show this 2015 even surpassing Fate/stay Hype and Charlotte(yeah this was hyped big especially in Japan).

I mean its a great manga for the things it does but some people are making it out as some 10/10 masterpiece deconstruction of genre and saviour of anime.
>> ARTICLE
I've hyped it up as a wacky shounen like JoJo. :x

Trust in your lord and saviour boxing jesus

Once again proving I fit in better at /r/japan_anime than here.  I really should ~~buy a boat~~ ~~learn Japanese~~ become an English teacher in Japan.

I didn't realize the average age here was so low.

No wonder /r/anime loves memes and Attack on Titan so much...

yeah i'm only 23, and somehow I'm older than 77% of people here.

memes and AoT are alright tho

I didn't realize there were so few females on the subreddit
>> ARTICLE
Well maybe they frequent the subreddit less and missed the survey? Because that's what happened to me.
>> ARTICLE
Same. It feels kind of weird, considering that the vast majority of people I know in real life that are into anime (that I know of, at least) are females. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never met a girl who likes anime.  Where are you meeting people?
>> ARTICLE
I think it depends what type of anime you're into. A lot of girls who like anime like sports, shoujo, ect. that guys tend not to watch. So there's not much overlap in interests. Of course, there are girls who don't like that stuff and guys that do. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, when I was taking courses on Japanese, about 3/4 of the group was female, and they all liked anime. Apart from that, on the conventions I've gone to, a large amount of the people there were female, too. I didn't pay too much attention on the proportions when I last went, but there were still plenty.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's influenced by Reddit's overall demographic? I know several women who enjoy anime, but I know of none who will use Reddit.
>> ARTICLE
holy god I didn't realize how rare it was to be a female on this subreddit
>> ARTICLE
that's why /r/xxanime is a thing

Hmm interesting, Whilst OPM is undoubtedly the most hyped and most popular so far. Noragami isn't as popular over at the japan sub when it is here. Over there it barely made the most popular list and it didn't even make it in the others. 2 episodes in and it's been great so far, I guess the lack of hype over there will work out in its favour.

Look at Lupin III. 2nd for them. Not even top 20 for us.

Which is scandallous.

Wow, Noragami's 2nd season is on opposite ends for each sub-reddit.  For a really good show it's popularity is drastic whether you go across the ocean or not, I find that interesting.  Guess it's under-whelming for them compared to other shows or just not their thing?
>> ARTICLE
I saw the OP for Noragami Aragoto last week and immediately knew I wanted to watch this show. So I flew through the first season and now I can say I'm a big fan.
>> ARTICLE
I mean... I'll definitely watch noragami this season but, it really does feel like a generic anime. I don't really find it all that engaging, but I guess I'm weird like that cause I didn't find parasyte engaging either.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, looking at this, I feel like I don't make sense comparatively. Like a character in a moe anime who has a penchant for blood and gore.

As much as I love OPM, I'm very surprised with the hype it's receiving, as I'm still not sure how well the style from the Manga works in a 25 minute show format.  And I expected Owarimonogatari to be the most hyped up show this season.

Can't say I'm too surprised about Owari not being popular with girls though

I mean, most people assumed Gundam was just giant robots doing nothing but just fighting each other Transformers style or thought it was power rangers.

I guess it depends on your introduction to the series.

I watched Gundam Wing back when I had no clue what anime even was. I loved the politics, the tension, ^^^^ThePurpleExplosions , and of course, all the stupid stuff Heero Yui said and did.

This just painted a pretty impressive image of what Gundam had to offer in my mind and that's how I got into it. I imagine most people don't see it like I do.

What I could gather and confirm from this:

Concrete Revolutio is polarizing as _fuck_
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's pretty rare to see someone say "Meh, it was okay." and leave it at that. There's a vocal minority that passionately loved it and will gladly sing its praises at every opportunity, and there's a slightly less vocal minority that failed to like it at all and will gladly chip in on how disappointed they were at any given opportunity. 
>> ARTICLE
It went _okay_.
>> ARTICLE
My only issue is that I don't handle watching the shows with out of order timelines very well... 
>> ARTICLE
> Concrete Revolutio is polarizing as fuck

that seems to be the trend with modern tokusatsu anime. Gatchaman Crowds and Samurai Flamenco also had very vocal fandoms and very vocal hategroups on both sides, and that's a bit dismaying as a fan of the genre myself.

Huh, guess I should've watched Rakudai instead of picking up (and dropping) Asterisk. 

I love that /r/japan_anime enjoyed Valkyrie Drive so much :p But they didn't watch Shinmai? I guess it's because it was a sequel maybe...

Happy to see Subete ga F ni Naru at number 3 on the female /r/anime users list :3 It was my personal favourite from last season, although it had a few flaws, it was overall extremely enjoyable and interesting.
>> ARTICLE
> Huh, guess I should've watched Rakudai instead of picking up (and dropping) Asterisk.

If you want to watch a generic fantasy battle-academy type show, then Rakudai is probably one of the better ones.  If only because some of the fights were absolutely breathtaking and the music was on point.  The romance actually progressing throughout the show was also pretty unusual for its sub-genre and was pleasant to see, and the humour was entertaining enough.  It was leagues better than Asterisk which was super bland and uninspired.
>> ARTICLE
>Huh, guess I should've watched Rakudai instead of picking up (and dropping) Asterisk.

I did the exact opposite and I'm quite glad I did.
>> ARTICLE
> Huh, guess I should've watched Rakudai instead of picking up (and dropping) Asterisk.

Honestly, you didn't miss much either way. There are definitely better options from the season to watch.

Edit: Looking at the full results, Shinmai was low-scored by r/japan_anime, rather than nobody watching it. Possibly because it became really disjointed and incoherent as the season went on. Valkyrie Drive really does seem to have performed better than one might expect from the premise.
>> ARTICLE
> Shinmai was low-scored by r/japan_anime, rather than nobody watching it. Possibly because it became really disjointed and incoherent as the season went on

That's a shame. I was hoping it would became new leader of the ecchi genre (after the awful DxD S3).
>> ARTICLE
> Huh, guess I should've watched Rakudai instead of picking up (and dropping) Asterisk.

I did that after the advice of some fellow anime watcher in a previous thread. Rakudai was slightly better, but in the end it's still below Valkyrie Mermaid for instance.
Also, the Digibro youtube series on Asterix is fun to watch as a bonus for watching the series.
>> ARTICLE
> Rakudai was slightly better, but in the end it's **still below Valkyrie Mermaid** for instance.

Are you...... are you actually serious right now?  [This](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30385/Valkyrie_Drive:_Mermaid) ridiculous thing? O.o
>> ARTICLE
Actually...yes ( ;)

It was suprisingly nice and coherent.
When big boobed lesbians orgasming are a central part of the story, it means that there is no need for the more clumsy usual kind of fan service/tropes:
- the MC accidently stumbling upon girls changing clothes
- girls getting battle hits only to show panties and/or underboobs
- yuri baiting that doesn't even match the character's definition
- every girl appearing on screen having a crush on the MC

You still have some side fan service, but it has a more comical effect than anything.


On the other hand, the series explored how each character was evolving in consequence of being exiled in the island or in reaction to the two MCs arriving, and it was pretty decent IMO. The range of characters was large, very varied, they all had their own motivations and acted upon them in a logical way.
As far as I remember there was very little "she did that because .......uhh.......reasons" moments in this show.

The SF plot was pedestrian, but then, it wasn't egregious either, and the hand waivy part where left on the side to be ignored as needed.

It's not a masterpiece, but I definitely enjoyed it, and was looking for the new episode every week.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I'm not saying it couldn't be enjoyable, but pretending that it has *less* fan-service than Rakudai merely because it is more "on-the-nose" about it is kind of absurd.  Just because the show was more intentionally designed around the fan-service, doesn't make it less existent or trashy :P

Rubbing nipples together and finger banging a broad to turn her into a sword is probably one of the most stereotypical fan-service things I've ever seen that more or less trumps everything in Rakudai in that department outside of maybe the bro-con bullshit from Ep. 2.  Rakudai kind of front-loaded a lot of its trashy fan-service and then most of the way through abandons a lot of it.  Valkyrie Drive was all about dat Yuri-service all da time.

No, it's because of the massive censoring. As if it weren't enough with the lightrays and chibiSprites getting in the way, they also cut entire scenes from the episodes. 

I can understand though. It's lewder than Valkyrie Drive.

I'm glad osomatsu-san is getting so much attention in these polls because it damn well deserves it.




***Hussle Hussle, Muscle Muscle***
>> ARTICLE
Like others, I'm glad to see that Osomatsu-san highly ranked since it's a damn good comedy and I'm really glad it got that second cour that's now airing.

I personally liked Concrete Revolutio and am looking forward to its second cour in April. I wouldn't say it surprised me, since I was looking forward to it ever since it appeared in the fall lineup charts. 

Oh man, GARO: The Crimson Moon...it really pains me to say it, but yeah, it's been a disappointment. It's disappointing because for those of us who were fans of Garo: Honoo no Kokuin, we were really looking forward to this one and it's just...not been nearly as good as the first (unrelated) season. 

I mean, Seimei is a great MC, but the other two tritagonists aren't very compelling, and the overarching plot doesn't feel like it has kicked into high gear yet. The Horrors' designs are much more uniform and less memorable than the first season designs too. 

...as you can tell, I feel strongly about this. Well, at least we have a GARO movie to look forward to (esp. considering it's set four years after season 1!)

I'm disappointed that Young Black Jack didn't make the top ten lists. It was a darn good 12 ep series--heck, I'm still hoping it'll get a second season someday. 

> /r/anime Male 89.4% | Female 9.8% | Other 0.8%

So much for some people saying that one punch man isn't that popular in Japan. It's done very well in both subs. That being said, it saddens me that noragami aragoto is 30 in popularity over at r/Japan_anime. I guess Yato really is a minor god.
>> ARTICLE
> So much for some people saying that one punch man isn't that popular in Japan.

as of now, OPM vol. 1 has sold [6,708 BDs](http://www.someanithing.com/4338), which places it well above average for most shows (which usually break even at around 3,000), so despite not being as successful as Owari, IBO, or Gochiusa, it's still a top contender over there. Noragami S1, though, was only a minor success as is, so the lukewarm reception was sort of expected really.
>> ARTICLE
For both one punch man and noragami, the source material is more important to sell than the anime volumes. OPM came [11th] (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-11-29/top-selling-manga-in-japan-by-series-2015/.95913) in sales for 2015 beating Naruto, Gintama, Nisekoi, etc. Food wars also sold pretty averagely yet a 2nd season has been announced, which means opm could get a 2nd season because of how much jump are pushing their anime adaptations now.
>> ARTICLE
>which usually break even at around 3,000

Those 3000 come from the 2,899 sales of Manabi Straight by ufotable. A producer said that it barely broke even, and the Manabi line meme was born.

Each show has vastly different production budgets, and the money is split differently every time. For example, because they own the IP, KyoAni will be making way more money from each Phantom World sale compared to each Amaburi sale.

In a recent article, someone from a studio said that most anime do become profitable in the long term, even if BD sales were low.
>> ARTICLE
cool info; I'd heard it be referred to as the Manabi line but I didn't realize where the term originated. I use the number as a sort of shorthand average, but I could definitely make sense of some works being able to make profit at different margins, with a 50+ episode hand-drawn mech series probably requiring a substantially higher amount of sales to make profit against a 12 episode late night LN adaptation. do you have a link to that article? that sounds really interesting to me, and would help clear up some things I've been wondering about.
>> ARTICLE
>50+ episode hand-drawn mech series

Only Sunrise would do that. Only Sunrise does that.

People can bitch all they want but that was surprisingly good for a show that has lesbians that turn into weapons by giving eachother orgasms.

It's also interesting since by the Most Popular percentages I'm guessing more japan_anime watchers watch more shows which is why their Top 10 is better distributed. Hell, their most underwatched has 33% which is higher than the top 8th in here.

I also find it strange that Owarimonogatari is not there while also being the best selling show of the season by miles.

true, I can see all of those as being entry barriers and factors towards its lack of popular support on here for sure, I just find it strangely compelling how even his other works, newer properties without a franchise behind them, are also skimmed past and ignored (Mardock Scramble, Heroic Age, Chevalier D'Eon), and the only shows he's known for, he's infamous for (Psycho Pass 2, GitS Arise). heck, back when Fafner was still relatively new blood I hadn't heard much about it on mechatalk. it's just a whole phenomenon I can't quite make sense of, like there's an aura around his anime that keep them from people's sightlines.

3. It had some absolutely [amazing fight scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhy_xw6l-ig), some of the best of the year imo.

4. It had a [*personality* to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T9IIDwWcqg) that was quite interesting and different, whereas a lot of shows in the sub-genre are pretty happy just riding on their respective tropes and don't care to differentiate themselves.

And I've been holding out on watching it but, maybe I should finally watch One Punch Man. I mean I've only heard it get constant praise but, never got around too it.

Edit: Man, maybe I judged Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry way too fast. I dropped it pretty quick, so maybe I didn't give it a good enough chance. Will have to re-watch it.

> Edit: Man, maybe I judged Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry way too fast. I dropped it pretty quick, so maybe I didn't give it a good enough chance. Will have to re-watch it.

It gets *waaaaaaay* better after episode 3.  The fan-service drops off significantly and it starts focusing more on the story, the relationship pairing, and some god damn ridiculously impressive fight scenes (one of which I would argue is probably one of the best of the *year*, top 3).

I was about to drop it after episode 3 myself, but there's a reason that it's score on MAL and ANN went from like last place for the season up to the top 3 non-sequels by the end of it :P

You should definitely give it a chance and at least get half-way through before you decide to drop it or not, because it becomes a wholly better show after a rocky start.
>> ARTICLE
Alright man, I'll take your opinion into consideration. I will most likely 100% give it a shot again, mostly because it's on crunchy roll.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, most people I talked to that actually saw it to completion really enjoyed episodes 4+, so I'd love to hear what you think if you make it past there!

Also, fun fact about it, every 4ish episodes is a new "arc", as it were, within the show, and the OP changes animation to indicate this.  It's a pretty cool detail.  It has a bunch of small details like that, like the lightning girl's meta affect on the screen letterbox and such.  Anyway, hope you enjoy it!

Does anyone know why there is such a discrepancy between the Japanese list of most popular/top anime compared to actual sales lists? Are /r/japan_anime users not representative of average anime fans or anime buyers (younger perhaps)? For example [the first volume of Owarimonogatari has sold 26K copies where as the first volume of Yuru Yuri S3 has only sold 5K](http://www.someanithing.com/4384), despite these numbers suggesting that Yuru Yuri is way more popular?

Rakudai Fan-service no Harem in third place. Wow...
>> ARTICLE
Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is overrated imo. The romance is bad, only the fights were good
>> ARTICLE
How is it bad?
>> ARTICLE
when lowering the bar to just LN anime, objectively speaking rakudai's romance isn't bad at all. in fact my problem with it is that the show and series doesn't use or develop it enough, and is bogged down by typical shonen bs, poorly written plots, and worst of all unnecessary pseudo harem cliches that have no business being there. if the series spent less time baiting and switching the flavor of the month girls like shizuku and ayase, perhaps the romance would have more room to breathe and not feel contrived to some. but by doing the opposite, rakudai wastes the best thing it had going for it.

In a lot of ways, it has the same problems as SAO, but because it's nowhere near as popular(especially when going by those bd's...ouch), people aren't as quick to bitch about them.


>> ARTICLE
it seemed to me that... the male character wasnt really in love. He didnt have expressions on his face, like a robot xD 

Idk comparing it to other romance shows, this one seems to, how to say this, to lower the value of love
>> ARTICLE
I found it level headed, actually realistic. Most romance animes either have 1. Nothing happening or 2. Over-the-top fairy tale love that never ends. Real love isn't like honeymoon stuff that lasts forever. Atleast IMO.

Well to me the love seemed out of place and didnt seem real, but i understand what u said

Yeah I can see that. You don't really just go from one person disliking the other to loving each other in literally a week. But I found the actual events that occurred in their relationship to be realistic. Out of curiosity did you finish the show?

yea i really like the animation of the fights so i watched it all and i will probably watch the new season too, i want to see what happens there. I actually like the anime just the romance part i dislike

Compared to an actual romance, yeah, probably, but for the sub-genre it resides in, it had one of the most reasonable romances I've ever seen, even *with* all the ridiculous tropes.

I'm a J.C. Staff fanboy, but even I have to admit Madhouse killed it this year. They chose the right things to adapt, and they adapted them beautifully. Every show was entertaining as hell, and not a single one of their projects this year is below 8 on MAL. OPM is just the icing on the cake.

Agreed. I am also a JC Staff fanboy but this year wasn't the best, Food Wars alone can't save them from the unstoppable train that was Madhouse in 2015.

Madhouse for some of my favorites this year (eg. Death Parade).

and 

JCStaff for making me not give up entirely on ecchi (and making one of my favorite comedies Shimoneta)
>> ARTICLE
For me, it's Bones easy. Kekkai is one of my favorite shows of all time now, and Noragami and Akagami were both among my favourites of there respective seasons. Hell, I really love Concrete Revolutio too.

Madhouse would be a close second, for Death Parade, OPM and Ore Monogatari, but Bones just takes it.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed! Akagami, Concrete Revolutio, and Noragami were all amazing, and while I haven't seen the other two, having 3/5 shows they made this year be solid 9s or 10s is pretty good in my book
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree. Other studios made like 1 good anime this year max, but these two made several quality shows so they both got my vote.
>> ARTICLE
Although I am a huge fan of ufotable and Kyoani, I feel like Madhouse wins this easily. One Punch Man is the only show listed in this thread that is both bolded and italicized (unless my eyes deceive me). Also having Parasyte, AND Death Parade AND Ore Monogatari!!, 2015 was crazy for Madhouse.
>> ARTICLE
I'd go with Madhouse. Death Parade was probably my favorite show of the year and Parasyte, OPM and Overlord were solid.

Not very active this year but I'll draw a Wildcard for:

Studio TRIGGER, because I'm a filthy fanboy.

Little Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade was average plot wise but does pretty well for itself Animation and characters.

Ninja Slayer: Very controversial but for what it set out to do, it took it and soared. Brilliant stuff, beats out a lot of shows with an actual budget IMO.

They only assisted a little for Hackadolls but shared a lot of TRIGGER style jokes but this time in referential and industry depreciating humour, enjoyment of this is proportional to how many references you could get.

Okay I'll end my shilling/fanboying here.

Silver Link

They have done a lot of shows, but some of them are of good quality, like Fate/Kaleid and Non Non Biyori.

Fate/Kaleid especially is beautiful. It integrates 3DCG better than ufotable's F/SN IMO. It might not have as much special effects as ufotable's F/SN, but it holds on it's own in art and animation.

I'd have to put my vote behind Madhouse; every show they put out in the list are just so solid, and most of them have made my all-time favorite list. Bones is a close second, with Noragami Aragoto and Kekkai Sensen being the stand-out shows. MAPPA's definitely a studio to keep my eyes one, but A-1, Shaft, and P.A Works were a bit inconsistent.

KyoAni only released Hibike (and it was amazing), but they're probably the most progressive and employee friendly workplace in the industry. That and the big players in their shows are not freelancers, so they have my vote.

Okay, two best anime of the year by far were Death Parade and One Punch Man, so I'm going to vote Ufotable just to mess with people.

It might be better to bold everything over 8 and bold/italicize everything over 8.5. There are literally only 12 entries in [all of MAL](http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php) that have scored 9 or higher (and 5 of them are Gintama). Over 8 is generally considered a great show.

A-1 pictures

That's a tough call.  A-1, Bones, Madhouse, PA Works, Sunrise, and Ufotable all have good arguments going for them.

If I had to I would drop Ufotable and PA Works for quantity.  Leaves what, A-1, Bones, Madhouse, Sunrise.

- A-1 has a ton of titles, several of high quality.
- Bones has three great shows.
- Madhouse has a few great shows.
- Sunrise has one great and a few good shows.  I guess Sunrise now drops off the list.  IBO+Origin with a backup of Cross Ange and GBFT can't quite match the competition IMO.

I guess that makes for 3, good enough to vote.

Toss up between Madhouse, J.C and A1 but I think A1 gets it because Shigatsu was the most beautiful anime both visually and storyline I've seen for years.

Visually (animation) One Punch Man is by far the best on any list. OPM has a simpler story but it's just as beautiful.

J.C. Staff for Kangoku Gakuen, Heavy Object, Shokugeki and Shimoneta.

A-1 Pictures for Gate and Saekano.

Bones for Concrete Revolutio.

First studio that I'll go for is Shaft, all of the anime listed I watched and they are responsible for what Monogatari has become. No way I can not vot for them for the enjoyment they gave me /fanboy

Objectively is Madhouse without discussion. But we must wait if this is another "anime of 2015 poll" with the difference they are voting the studio and not the anime directly

Wow, some studios have a lot. I was under the impression that KyoAni was one of the bigger studios, how is it that some others are able to make 6-7 a year while they just make one? Do they really put 6-7 times the resource into one project? 

Regardless, they still get my vote(along with MH). Reason is, most of the best shows this year, a lot of the credit goes to the original work. But KyoAni made a 10/10 show out of a 6.5/10 source material.

Yeah, the way this poll is presented makes it look like you're judging studios by volume of output, but it's Kyoani's business practices that give them the clear lead for me.

It would be interesting to see a table giving how much each studio pays its animators.
>> ARTICLE
Downvoted huh. I didn't realise allowing animators to afford to eat is a controversial notion.
>> ARTICLE
Reddit downvotes anything that is even remotely controversial. I, for one, agree that KyoAni's business practices are among the best for an anime studio, but that's because KyoAni makes a ton of money for the number of people they employ and the relatively few anime they put out. Most anime studios are not that successful, and budgets are extremely, extremely tight. Even studios that do find success put out anime that fall short of expectations, and they end up paying for those with the profits from their successful ones. In addition, most studios are just contractors, so they might not see all the profits that a show gets.
>> ARTICLE
Bones #1 cuz they managed to release the final episode of Kekkai Sensen before the end of the year XD
>> ARTICLE
ITT: People sucking Madhouse dick and pretending ratings on MAL matter (parasyte and nanatsu no taizai are rated higher than shirobako lmao)

Anywa, I think Bones is the best studio of the year.

Kekkai Sensen, ConRevo and Noragami Aragoto were all absolutely amazing in their own right with Akagami being a  very solid shoujo.

With Madhouse on the other hand the only thing I can truly give a thumbs up for is Death Parade, which was amazing.

One Punch Man hardly deserves to be credited to Madhouse (everything that made it exceptional was done by Natsume Shingo and his team of S-tier animators who jump around studios a lot, and even beyond that they mostly got animators from other places like bones).

Parastye shat the bed in it's second half really hard (not to mention the CG background characters) and Overlord was a pretty terrible adaption that had potential.

Ore Monogatari was a solid shoujo which got most of its strength from its source manga (like akagami), and Dia no Ace's pacing in the 2nd season has been atrocious so I dropped it a while back.

Probably gonna get downvoted into oblivion by the madhouse circlejerk but just wanted to put this out there because it was boring seeing every comment riding Madhouse's dick.

I'm pretty stunned at how much karma each ERASED discussion thread is getting. The only other episode threads I've seen get 2000+ upvotes have been the Your Lie in April finale and One Punch Man. 
>> ARTICLE
It's just that there seems to be a ton more people discussing in /r/anime every season. Your average OPM episode had more upvotes than the finales of the biggest hitters of previous few seasons, and didn't even compare to the ones from 2014. Now Boku Dake is having this much success, despite the near absense of hype before it aired (especially compared to OPM). I imagine SnK 2 and Steins;Gate 0 threads will dwarf even Shigatsu and OPM's.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised it got a bump in Karma at all, this time last week there was a 4pt gap between episode 1 and 2 so I expected it stay steady until it ended or it began to mess up. 

And with the comments it's getting there is hardly a bad word to be said about it. Which is amazing when you look at the show's it beat that are made up mainly of discussions of whether the show is good or bad. 

Good to see it doing so well though, it's the first show in a long time that I feel I could recommend to anyone, anime watcher or not.
>> ARTICLE
I think it increased because of the influx of people picking up the show after hearing such good things after the first two episodes. Just looking at the members on MAL, it was around 80k at episode 2 and it's now closing in on 110k after just a week.
>> ARTICLE
It has also rocketed up the MAL Top Anime list, currently sitting #15. Even with its unstoppable hype train, One Punch Man took 9 episodes to reach the same [position](http://anime.daanst.net/anime/show/30276). The score may be premature but its heartening to see a series get so much attention for simply being pretty damn great. If the show maintains its level of quality, it might even make a run at knocking FMA:B off the top position (unlikely, but definitely possible).

>> ARTICLE
Outside of Rakugo, it's the most mature and least "tropey" show this season, so it easily stands out from the crowd. Despite a supernatural premise, it manages to treat its characters and subjects seriously and with respect. Fantastic direction, too. They even manage to do a double-voiceover effect that doesn't seem gimmicky. I really can't say enough good about it so far, and I hope it stays this great.
>> ARTICLE
thank you!
>> ARTICLE
It's a show that takes itself seriously (so far) and has an interesting concept; it's a refreshing bit of anime in what usually is a large pile of the same old stuff we get every anime season. 

The music is done by [Yuki Kajiura,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Kajiura) too!
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't sell it to you well, but I like how the characters are presented (characterization, VAs, fitting mood, etc). It made me intrigued/care about the characters and the plot much more quickly than expected.

I would say you'd find it worth your time if you get hooked by the first episode, but no promises as I have no clue where the story will go (but hey that's the fun of watching right?)
>> ARTICLE
From a cursory glance, I think you might want to update Akagami's values. Probably due to when you ran the script, values are quite low.

Also thoughts on using an Exponential Moving Average over the period? It's an average but it'll put more weight on the most recent results. (Since you're ranking by average)
>> ARTICLE
> From a cursory glance, I think you might want to update Akagami's values. Probably due to when you ran the script, values are quite low.

Nope just double checked they are correct.

>Also thoughts on using an Exponential Moving Average.

Could look into it, not really sure on the best way to implement something like that into google sheets. Don't have a lot of knowledge with different methods of obtaining averages either.

But I was thinking that the current method might mean show's with strong start through hype might still beat show's that should really be above it because they had no hype for the first few episodes. (Musaigan and Kono Suba)

Phantom world will drop super heavily...

There was a lot of unrest and uneasiness about the kyoani fanservice, and my guess is a huge amount of people will drop it at the 3 episode mark. ^^^^^Not ^^^^^me ^^^^^though
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I nearly dropped it last week not because of the fan service but because I found episode 2 to be a bit meh, episode 3 convinced me it's fun enough to keep watching but I'm not expecting a masterclass in character driven storytelling here.

Still expect it to drop pretty heavily though, along with Grimgar and Sekkou Boys. (Grimgar is one of my favourites this season but it isn't an easy sell)

Expecting Prince of Stride to build slowly now the majority of people who were turned off by it's subject material have dropped the show and with knowledge of the constant matches coming up for the EoS trials.

Put my own into the hat, think Kono Suba will surpass or get on the same level as Musaigan as it has yet to air it's 3rd episode and the hype is building whereas Musaigen is losing viewers at a steady rate.

Karma for Erased will be even higher since the fanbase is growing rapidly. It just needs to maintain the quality of directing (as a manga reader I know the story is strong enough) that it has shown in the first three episodes.

Judging by the discussion in this week's thread, Grimgar is either going to have an incredible episode or take a hard fall.

Thanks for putting these threads together, this sort of data is *exactly* what I'm into. 

Overall, I'm very pleased with what's getting attention and what isn't. Of course, ERASED is just... so good, it's so difficult to find anything bad about it. I'm also pretty pleased to see KonoSuba moving up, however slightly, as the comedy in it is top notch. 

It'll be interesting to see how things will change next week, with what I imagine will be a pretty significant decrease in activity across nearly all of the anime, especially those near the bottom, as people drop them after their third week.

Aha no worries, I'm the same hence why I've become known as the spreadsheet guy among my friends, make spreadsheets for the most ridiculous things because DATA.

Technically KonoSuba has an advantage next week as it hasn't aired 3 episode yet. It's also been absolutely brilliant so far which might help.

Oh, I feel you. I've got spreadsheets for everything: tracking eSports stats, movie scores, books I've read, to-do lists, and, of course [anime](http://i.imgur.com/hoX0Qed.png). I get a little bit obsessive when it gets to quatifying and ranking things, and I've had a lot of fun putting together spreadsheets for everything I can think of.

Yeah, it's one of the later airing ones, so I'm hopeful that it'll keep bumping up! More people need to see it :D

Here's a big one: tsukkomi is a very Japanese type of humor. A lot of Western viewers who hate comedy anime just don't get this type of act.

We not too long ago had someone asking what a straight man is, so that might not be a type of comedy that's as well known here? Or maybe it is - I don't watch comedy or even more Western shows, so I wouldn't know.

I'm not sure if this might be the kind of thing you're looking for, but these are a couple of things I've been thinking about blogging about because of the shows I've been watching this season. Both probably fall under the general topic of 'how characters refer to themselves and each other'. 

=====

(1) The significance of using surname vs. first name (and the nuances in this, for example, the variation across different parts of Japan). 

One example I remember is from ERASED / BokuMachi, where Airi switches from using "Fujinuma-san" when having dinner with him and his mother, to "Satoru-san" when they're on the bicycle later. The significance of this is actually explained in the manga (and in the anime, it did come up with Kayo, Kenya and Satoru in episode 7), but I'd hazard a guess that most Western viewers probably missed the Airi one in the anime. 

======

(2) The significance of different pronouns / address terms / how people refer to others in 3rd person. (i.e. what people use to refer to themselves, to the person they're speaking to, or to a third person who might or might not be there)

One example that was explained in the Boku Machi manga is Airi using "Airi" as her first person pronoun in front of Satoru -- Satoru wonders if that's because they've become closer.

Another example that comes to mind at the moment is how Miyokichi refers to/addresses Sukeroku vs. Kiku in Rakugo--though I'm not sure this is as significant as I think, so I was wondering what your thoughts on it are. In episode 12, the translator translated "Anta" into "Darling"...I'm not sure that gives off the right implication, because whilst "Anta" is a shortened version of "Anata," which I understand many Japanese women use to address their husband, "Anta" is really rude. 

What do you think of that translation of "Anta" as "Darling"? (Or, more generally, what Miyokichi/Yurie's way of speaking to or about Sukeroku implies about what she thinks about him?) 

=====

There's also a more controversial area that I've already written about, but it's more about Japanese politics than about culture per se: anything to do with Japan's security policy. I find that most people who comment on this online don't really know all the nuances about the issues in Japan. That said, I understand that many younger Japanese people also don't know that much about this either... 
>> ARTICLE
Well perhaps if Airi got some damn screen time it would mean more to us.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that's a great one! 

I'm well aware of the ~~second~~ first one, I can understand how non-Japanese can have hard time, but didn't think much about the ~~first~~ second one and yeah, it is something I completely overlooked. Switching from Fujinuma-san to Satoru-san is more about being clear whom she is addressing (cause mother and Satoru are both Fujinuma-san), but yeah, Airi calling herself Airi instead of watashi is indeed a big deal. Do Japanese learners study about this "change of perspective" thing, maybe at advanced classes? 

As for Anta vs Darling... It's a bit bewildering, as I cannot think of any other candidates to take place of Anta in English. Can you think of any? Anta(by female and Omae by male) can be rude when you use it to talk to someone you are not close to, but with this context and the era it can show their closeness and certain down-to-earth affection, and a bit of "age" or "history" of the relationship as husband and wife. (In modern day Japan, Anta sounds rustic and Anata sounds classy, but if Miyo says "Anata" in Tokushima in Showa era, that would sound too snobby and unreal.) 

> There's also a more controversial area that I've already written about

That sounds interesting too. 
>> ARTICLE
> Do Japanese learners study about this "change of perspective" thing, maybe at advanced classes?

Ah, and I forgot to reply to this point. To be honest, I don't know, having never studied Japanese formally--I'd assume it was an advanced thing, though. But I'll try and ask some of my friends whether they did. 
>> ARTICLE
You know how "perspective" changes and we use different ways to address others depending on who is around. I think there should be a lesson about this iirc, using family conversation. We usually say, the perspective is changed to that of the youngest in general. So, people call others by the youngest child's way of addressing others, like "Onee-chan", "Otoo-san", "Ojii-chan", and so on. Older kids often call themselves "Onii-chan" or "Onee-chan", to use his/her younger siblings' perspective at home, while the only kid or the youngest often use their first name. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, that makes sense. In English, we do a similar thing  my brothers family has changed all address terms to those that his kids would use (Mum, Dad, Nanny etc). He even forgot to change back once when he was talking to me, calling our Dad our dialect's equivalent of Ojii-chan instead of Dad. It doesnt really extend to siblings, though, because everyone just uses first names (and I for our first person pronouns). 

But come to think of it, though, we do a similar thing with Chinese (my familys ethnically Chinese). Although my own parents were more likely to say your brother to me, I remember aunts and uncles using the equivalents of Onee-chan etc in their own families. 

And this extends to society as well. I work at a university, and whilst I use first names when I am speaking with my colleagues (superiors, really, but unlike in Japan, even PhD students are considered equals with regards to how we speak with each other in an academic department). But in public forums or in classes, then the lecturer/speaker is addressed more formally, with Mr. / Mrs. / Dr. / Professor + surname etc. 

I think that the major difference between English and Japanese (and a few other Asian languages) is how degrees of closeness in more casual settings are expressed. In all cases, its a matter of the language used, but I think its actually a bit more obvious in Japanese because of *keigo* and stricter rules about who can/should be using first names (or nicknames derived from first names) vs. surnames (and nicknames derived from them). In English, there are also differences that indicate how close you are with the person youre speaking with, but there arent set rules so it doesnt actually hold as much significance. Furthermore, things like Airi switching from atashi to Airi as her 1st person pronoun in front of Satoru are difficult to capture in English as succinctly as in Japanese. Its possible, but I dont think all the translators know its significance, so its not always captured in the translation.

p.s. I asked a friend of mine who tutors for Japanese courses, and she said that they teach about changes in first / second person reference terms in relation to relative status of the people speaking with each other, but that it's not something practised in class. So learners may learn about it, but not really think about it outside of a school setting until they have to live in Japan (on exchange etc). 
>> ARTICLE
Airi calling herself Airi shows how she feels comfortable like at home, talking to Satoru at that point. Getting rid of the part where she called herself watashi in the beginning would mislead a viewer and make a big difference in her character itself in anime, as a rather immature girl who does not care about how she would sound to others. But then, also, some Japanese are not careful enough to notice the differences :P

That said, yes, it is super-hard to express this in subs, and probably one of the most headache causing. I hope translators are aware of this, and yet cannot find a reasonable enough way to do it. There are many troubles translating English to Japanese too, though I don't have a good example at hand now. 

It's a shame if this practice isn't generally done in classes, but may not be necessary unless the learner is seriously planning to live here or plan to be a translator of literature. You can't teach/learn every single thing after all, and I'm sure there are so many things I don't know happening in English conversations that I haven't learned too. 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for explaining more of the nuances of Airi switching from watashi to Airi. Because I had thought that using ones one name as a first person pronoun was something that people grew out of, Airi puzzled me a little. So the details about how it sounds to others help me understand it a bit better. 

For English to Japanese, I would think that sarcasm and irony might be two of the more difficult things to translate, especially if youre working only from text and thus without tone of voice etc (which is how we normally tell). 

Also, back to your original question, a conversation elsewhere reminded me of another example of things that things Japanese people take for granted that (foreigners) might miss: how people behave.

Its relevant especially for Rakugo this season, but also for shows like K-ON!!, which a lot of Western/English-speaking viewers call out for baiting. I think that there are differences in how people behave around each other (depending on how close they are but also on whether they are the same or opposite sexes, and even whether theyre in public or private) that people not from Japan or other East Asian countries. So what some Japanese peoplelike yourself, going by some of your comments on Rakugosee as quite normal rivalry/really close friendships/sibling-like relationships, people in the West tend to see as yuri- or yaoi-baiting. 
>> ARTICLE
He he, good point, but a lot of Japanese called out for 'baiting' on internet forums too! But yeah, maybe the level of seriousness in those posts may differ. Like I said in other comment reply, basically Japanese are liars and whatever comes out of mouth does not necessarily mean what they have in mind. I've realized that in the final episode discussion people note how Kiku doesn't treat Konatsu well, but I'd rather say his love as a father and the mixed feeling stands out more obvious and looks less fake by his 'hate speech' (kinda) than by normal straight-forward words. It's just that he doesn't treat her as a child, but treats her as a person.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think I've seen comments in Japanese discussions. And I remember reading a few Japanese bloggers who were a bit uncomfortable with what Yamada et al did with episode 8 of Eupho (they were novel readers, and they thought she went a tad overboard with the 'baiting'). But the English speakers I've interacted with online have taken it a lot more seriously...a few interviews about the series have been translated, and they tend to think that Yamada's being...let's say 'facetious', when she says 'it's not yuri' to her. They think that she's dismissing what GLBT or queer people feel, whether as a 'phase' people go through, or worse, that Yamada/KyoAni's main aim is to use it as something to "appeal to viewers who like that kind of 'bait'." 

> basically Japanese are liars and whatever comes out of mouth does not necessarily mean what they have in mind
I've found Rakugo to be really interesting as an example of this. I'm always thinking: "why did he/she say that and why?" and it's difficult to know when a character is speaking the truth and when they are lying, or what the mix of truth/lies is in any conversation. I suspect that's where a lot of the differing interpretations come from. We know that there are lies and half-truths in the story that Yakumo has related to us, but no one agrees on what they are. 

In the case of Konatsu, I wonder if there's an earlier line (or translation of the line) that might be responsible. The following line by Kiku: 



Does it mean something like: 

"In the end, I was alone. That I had no choice but to live on alone was something that, in this time, I felt deep within my bones." ?
>> ARTICLE
A lot of Western viewers seem to be bothered by certain morals such as sexism along with glbt, age difference in romance, and racism, while not many have problems with their moral related to killing, considering how MCs in death note and ajin are so popular. It's quite interesting that many get offended and feel the need to push their own morals towards the chars in anime more seriously than what I have observed in Japanese forums.

> Does it mean something like:  
> "In the end, I was alone. That I had no choice but to live on alone was something that, in this time, I felt deep within my bones." ?

That sounds fine to me. What about this line?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that's a good point about the Fujinuma-san/Satoru-san one in the manga (although it makes me wonder why the anime writers chose to go with just "Fujinuma-san" then...) 

What I found interesting about the Rakugo example was that Miyo called Kiku "Anata" once in that scene. She also used "Kiku-san," if I remember correctly. But Sukeroku is "Anata" (prior to episode 12) and then "ano hito" (when she's speaking to Kiku) or "Anta" when she's addressing him directly in this latest episode. Whilst I feel it's probably about the "history" of their husband and wife relationship, I'm really not sure about what we're meant to take from it, if anything...  

In terms of translating "Anta" without using "Darling" or other terms that indicate real affection ("Honey" Dear" etc), I can't really think of anything, either. I'd probably have just ignored it and had Miyo go "I-" as if starting to say "I'm sorry." But that's only because I don't think "Darling" is right for their relationship at this point. It could just be me... 

(On the topic of Rakugo, though, I've been skimming some of the episode discussion threads, and I'm really appreciating some of the things you've shared--such as details about the rakugo stories etc. I really feel like this is a series I have to go back and watch again after it ends next week!) 

As for the one on Japan's security policy, I'm not watching GATE, but I've seen people criticise it for being 'right-wing', a fantasy about 'invading other countries' etc without really understanding the debate within Japan. I wrote a lot of notes about it when I translated an article related to GATE (https://karice.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/p496/), but I'm not sure [EDIT] how to summarise exactly what western audiences don't understand/simplify etc... 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, anime's sudden "Satoru-san" change was rather strange, but I didn't think much before I read manga. There are quite a few things I didn't quite see fit in anime. I enjoyed the anime, but I personally wouldn't have enjoyed it much if I had read manga first, due to the different interpretation and presentation.

Using Anata to Kiku is most likely because she wasn't close enough to Kiku, imo, or possibly their relationship took place in Tokyo - Miyo is from Shikoku and was trying to act classy in front of Kiku. Whatever the reason behind it, Miyo calling Sukeroku "Anta" just reminded me that they were really husband and wife. 

As for Darling, how would you describe the right situation to use the term? 

Gate is a bit controversial topic and I'm actually trying to stay away lately :p I'm really tired of being called both netouyo and busayo on internet. It's just that there are too many people who love labeling others when it comes to politics and refuse to accept there are people who are actually neutral but with opinions that could be seen either wing. But it's always interesting to read what others say. Thanks for the link! I actually didn't know that discussion was wide spread to English speakers too. 
>> ARTICLE
On BokuMachi: I agree. I only started reading halfway through, so I didnt have a problem with the changes in the first half when I was watching. But the last two episodes were a bit of a let down because I had already read the manga by the time I saw them. 

Terms like Darling Dear and Honey are used between *loving* couples, even ones that arent married. Where a couple have fallen out of love and remain married only because they have no other choice (whether for children, because of societal stigma etc), then I dont expect them to use any kind of term that indicates even a little bit of affection. Maybe just a name (mostly when they're not angry with them). So, whilst I would agree that Miyos use of Anta for Sukeroku is a marker that they really are husband and wife, Darling indicates a level of affection that Miyokichi just doesnt seem to have for her husband...

Though it could be just how I see their relationship: one where any affection she had for him has sunk largely into indifference, frustration or even distaste. 

I know what you mean about GATE. I rarely talk about Japanese politics when discussing anime/manga, even when its relevant, because I find that most people dont understand the nuances of the debate, which a number of Japanese people, like yourself, would. Trying to explain those nuances just gets us attacked, usually from both sides, because we either not right-wing enough or not left-wing enough. I thought that the debate of Miyazaki Hayaos last film, *The Wind Rises*, was pretty reflective of that. 

>> ARTICLE
On BokuMachi, my gripe is not with the changes, but more about the presentation by the director. I now see the manga and anime as totally different works now, and it's hard for me to see any respect towards the original work from the production side. It was changed into a complete different entertainment show to fit the director's liking (and many people liked it). On the other hand, I just started reading Rakugo's manga, and even with so many changes added and made in anime, I still see it as a faithful enough adaptation and the director or production side showing respect and love to the original source. I'm not saying one is better or worse, but I'd definitely appreciate the latter if I were the original creator. 

So these small language sensitive differences you can see in BokuMachi are just another part of what the production side ignored as irrelevant, and whether it was good or not is up to each viewer, I guess. 

Thanks for the explanation on "Darling". Miyokichi used to address Sukeroku as "Anata" before, like after the kabuki play (where Kiku played Benten-kozou with makeup). So, using "Darling" was probably the best translation available to show the difference. I'm not sure how else that could have been done, really. And also, [Rakugo manga spoiler](/s "considering the manga's later part, it actually didn't matter how Miyokichi actually felt about Sukeroku, but how Kiku wanted it to sound, anyways") so it may not be a bid deal. 
>> ARTICLE
Im a bit ambivalent about those aspects of the BokuMachi adaptation myself. I read some interviews last week, including one where Sanbe-sensei said that he was really happy with the anime adaptation, and he implied that he thought that they were basically trying to cover the same ground. Of course, he might just have been trying to be polite Personally, the thing I liked least about the anime was how blatant they made the message. I liked the subtlety in the manga much better. 

Yes, I had realised that Miyo had changed from using Anata for Sukeroku/Shin to Anta. Its still something Im thinking over though, and Im going to try to remember to ask a friend of mine next week, as shes actually researching the use of this word, albeit in modern Japan. 

Personally, if Id been *writing* these three as English-speakers, Id have had Miyo use a nickname of some sort, probably just a shortened form of his name. To me, that leaves approximately the same impression that Anta gives meit shows theyre close but leaves it a bit more ambiguous as to how she feels about him. (And yes, Id do that even knowing that spoiler, which Id learnt about after last weeks episode) Though of course, Im speaking as someone for whom Japanese is a second language
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes, the author said he liked it. Like you said, most Japanese hardly say negative things in public, and he even says he loved the live action movie, which makes me believe he is another Japanese who would only say nice things in public - as a sort of virtue here. (I read this isn't good in Chinese culture.) He may really love it or may not, I can never tell. 

I'd also better tell you again that I did enjoy the anime, otherwise, I wouldn't have started reading this manga (I don't read the magazine, so I probably would have missed it out if I didn't get to see this in anime, so I am grateful to anime too in that regard). It's just that my interpretation of the original manga was very different from that of the anime staff - and there are things I despise, like how some characters were treated, Yashiro and Airi are obvious ones, but also the manga editor, Yuuki, and Kenya esperically. The things that bugged me so much while watching the anime became very clear after reading it in manga, and if I didn't read the manga, I would have misunderstood the author so badly.

The hardest part of adaptation in anime is that manga(or LN) is generally very ambivalent and allows readers more imagination and processing(in brain) than anime where you basically passively receive already processed info one way. So, if the anime production staff and your taste match, then you will likely find the adaptation successful. And to be honest, there aren't many anime that I find better than the original manga, so it is very hard to please me anyways ;) 

As for Miyo, maybe making her say "Shin" or something in English may have been interesting, but then, that may stir up another debate on "translation accuracy". It's really tough. I wonder what it would have been if Miyo had called him "Touchan" by Konatsu's perspective :P
>> ARTICLE
Oh, it sounds like our feelings about the BokuMachi anime are quite similar, though I might be slightly more forgiving about the cuts the anime team made to fit the show into 12 episodes -- I [wrote about it last week](https://karice.wordpress.com/2016/03/27/p499/), straight after the show ended. To be honest, I found the pacing in the 2nd half of the manga a little too drawn out...though I do prefer how Sanbe-sensei presented the themes the story was concerned with. 

That said, Sanbe-sensei sounded pretty excited talking about the anime in that interview, so I know really know how to interpret that. Of course, he had only seen the first four episodes at that point...

> that may stir up another debate on "translation accuracy".

I used to prefer more accurate translation, I think--but the more Japanese I learn, the more I realise that it just doesn't work. To me, the important point is to get the meaning that's conveyed across. If Miyo had used "Touchan," then I think something like "Dear" would have been appropriate. Even "Darling" -- but then, "Touchan" would also have indicated a more loving household than what we were presented with...
>> ARTICLE
I think the roof top ending was one of the many options the author had in mind when the director started working on the anime ending and talked about it with the author. I don't remember where I read this, but Sanbe once said that he was given more pages (and/or more episodes) for the ending (or towards the ending) at some point and he could expand his story more to do what he wanted to do or something along that line. I didn't find the 2nd half "a little too drawn out", but it's probably more about personal taste. 

Either way, it is Ito who insisted on having it on one cour according to some of the interviews I read. Probably Ito already had his own interpretation of the story of how it should be after a few episodes when he decided he wanted to direct it. And the live action movie release date (March) must have also pushed them to do it in one cour. The anime is a fine entertainment, but the whole theme was dumbed down to me when compared to the original.

As for Touchan, we all know Miyo would never call him that and I merely meant it as a comparison.

Oh, my point was.. there are some series that sometimes goes pretty alien to western viewers

There are lot of things that will miss the western audience or people who don't have enough experience in Japanese culture. It has parodies of movie posters, politicians, advertisements, wordplays, mocks some systems like arranged marriage.. I don't even know how many jokes I missed when I saw and all I could imagine is how well japanese would be laughing their stomach off while watching that show

Ah I see what you mean. But that sort of thing is actually not always taken for granted even for Japanese audience to understand. Sometimes only a few fans notice such first and talks about it on forums and the majority learn later, too. But yeah, there are probably a lot like those hard things. Thanks. (Checked out the zetsubou sensei OP and it looks pretty hard to understand it all!) 

I had something more simple, like, it is now very well-known that sakura flower petals represents spring, and often graduation or academic year starting, but someone, for example, maybe a Scandinavian who images summer with flowers might not think that way if he/she was not familiar with it.

Ahhh. Yeah, but that thing too is not used to scare of birds/animals lately, and many do not know the original usage.

Is there any symbolic significance to a shishi-odoshi that you can think of? I've seen a few shows where they will cut away to one falling multiple times in mid-conversation (most notably, it's associated with Kanbaru in the Monogatari Series) and I could never figure out what the significance of it is.
>> ARTICLE
Well, first of all, I'd have to warn you that this is my own opinion, and not necessarily all Japanese think the same way. That said, whenever I hear of that sound, I think of silence or quietness, and the only sound available there confirms that it's dead silent and nobody around. (Something or someone may be secretly hidden but not noticeable.) If it's night, then everyone is already asleep, but you (and whoever is with you). 

But then, it may mean something else depending on the context, so I'll have to see the scene to be precise. If it always appears as a house of the char(I'm assuming that Kanbaru is a name of the char), then it may represent that she is a born-rich girl in Kyoto, or if it's cut in the middle of the conversation, then it may mean silence.

It happens pretty much every time Araragi and Kanbaru are at her house. [Here's a crunchyroll link](http://www.crunchyroll.com/bakemonogatari/episode-7-suruga-monkey-part-2-610933) to the first episode where that happens. They have a big conversation from about 3:00 to 14:00 with a ton of *bonks* scattered throughout it.

Can't really think of an answer to your question but something related would be western anime fans calling themselves "otaku" thinking it's a positive term.
>> ARTICLE
People who use it positively don't understand what it means in Japan. The otaku are the people who have no social lives at all and just stay inside playing games and watching anime. Almost always they are unemployed. It's not a desirable lifestyle and is understandably looked down upon.
>> ARTICLE
Aren't those called "hikikomori"? As for "otaku", in a recenly finished "Oshiete! Galko-chan" that was used as a pretty neutral term referring to subculture, just like "gyaru".


>> ARTICLE
The terms cross over. Technically, an otaku is just a 'x geek' like 'computer nerd', but the connotation is always negative. It's not a neutral term. Think of how nerd was used 20 years ago. It technically wasn't bad, but the connotation was always that the person in question was wimpy and didn't socialise.
>> ARTICLE
You mean, western anime fans use "otaku" as a positive term in general? 
>> ARTICLE
I think (hope) that's something that died out in the early 2000's.
>> ARTICLE
Haha nope, I see people calling themselves otaku all the time on anime fan pages on Facebook, which is the reason I disliked most of them.

You'd love [Mononoke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2246/Mononoke) and [Ayakashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/586/Ayakashi__Japanese_Classic_Horror).  I actually had to read some some side notes for the episodes to begin to understand it.

I remember that discussion on Rakugo episode 5, as well as [what you posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/47rakt/spoilers_shouwa_genroku_rakugo_shinjuu_episode_8/d0fhfih). Between those episodes I had changed my mind on what the words might have meant and the relationships. I still think a lot of scenes/lines are left open for interpretation on purpose (not the one in episode 5 in particular) and that brings a lot of interesting discussion that's related to this topic, since different knowledge of the background/language/influences will bring different opinions about what things might mean.

Thanks a lot for those notes, once again, by the way. Was quite interesting (and helpful) reading them.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you :D It really was interesting for me too! I do agree that there are many things open for interpretation, and I'm not gonna say I'm always right (except for this "sonnanja-nai" phrase!) and quite often taking things for granted can blind/intervene us too. I really enjoyed reading many people's interpretations there and I'm gonna miss it so much after rakugo finishes!

> I really enjoyed reading many people's interpretations there and I'm gonna miss it so much after rakugo finishes! 

I bet there will be more opportunities in future shows (or in another season...). Looking forward to them!

Pretty much all of [Kyouougiga](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_TV) is deep symbolism and casually missed. There's so much in there there's whole [lostinanime blogs series](http://lostinanime.com/tag/kyousougiga/) dedicated to putting it out. 

Death Parade is the same way. It is really easy to get lost and not 'get' it.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, but as for Kyousougiga, like I said to others, those obvious Japanese aspects are not what I have in mind - it is easy enough for me to spot what you would have trouble with. Those, like Buddhism, Shinto, Choujuu-giga, or traditional cultures like kabuki or rakugo, are also the things young Japanese do not know well either, and very often anime fans know a lot better than an average Japanese. 

With Death Parade, did you see anything unordinary other than obvious traditional aspects?

Characters addressing each other without honorifics. Especially if they used to before.

This happened recently with Grimgar, Mary started calling Haruhiro just "Haru" as of episode 8. A lot of non-Japanese don't realize that this is a big deal.
>> ARTICLE
Calling someone their given name is really a big deal.
>> ARTICLE
Good point, yeah. I think I once heard that it can be translated using "tu vs vous" in French, but probably not in English. I was wondering how it gets translated. So, that part is often ignored in subs? 
>> ARTICLE
"Tu vs vous" is on the right track. I don't think there are many other languages out there that have equivalents of everything going down the scale from dono - sama - san - kun - chan - tan and more.

It depends on who's writing the subtitles. The trend I'm seeing is that most professional subtitles will ignore them. Fansubbers are more likely to keep them in.

It's pretty recent. As late as 2008, I remember that prof. subs still kept honorifics in.
>> ARTICLE
Ah I see. Thanks. I guess the choice/trend of the terms used on subs change as time goes by. 
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that part/most? of Anglosphere is very prejudiced against romances between adult people (even if they are barely adult, like 19, 20) and high-school teenagers to the point they might treat them as something which is really worth noticing, or even condemning.

If I understood correctly from the anime I saw Japanese might not have the custom of sending people to prison as sex offenders for being engaged to a high-schooler, on the contrary it seems to be a relatively frequent scenario, which doesn't raise many eyebrows. Or am I wrong?
>> ARTICLE
Like going back to GTO?
>> ARTICLE
> on the contrary it seems to be a relatively frequent scenario

First of all, you must not believe everything happening in anime to be true. Many anime has its premise set to a fantasy world. If you try to have sex with a high schooler in Japan now, you will be arrested. I do see/hear news about it too. The thing is, it is not bound by the national constitution but by local government's bylaws, so details can vary, but most, if not all, governments definitely say no to such sex offending to those younger than 18 yrs old, afaik. That said, just walking together or talking or maybe some pure platonic relationship with marriage in view (like McGillis in IBO) is not necessarily considered evil (yet, that can of course cause misunderstanding in real life, then you know you can get in trouble easily.) 

If you are talking about Erased, 29 yrs old protagonist and 17 yrs old heroine being *friends* is not a problem. For romance, he has to wait at least for a year, but I'm pretty sure he didn't try any sexual offense to her in the show no matter what his mother said, and [in Erased final episode](/s "the girl is already 20+.") 

*edit*

That said, I think I know where you're coming from, and we had a bit of discussion on it before, hadn't we? So, yeah, thanks for reminding me that!
>> ARTICLE
Some group of characters will be talking about someone else, and at some point the camera will cut away to that character and they'll sneeze, before the camera cuts back to the original discussion.

This one is pretty common in anime, and almost never explained (though you can figure it out after a few times).
>> ARTICLE
Oh right, so "sneeze" = "someone is talking about you" is often not clearly understood until you get used to it? I was expecting this "myth" was rather popular elsewhere! Maybe I should ask about this in askreddit or somewhere else. Thanks. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never encountered the notion outside of anime, so I don't believe it exists in the west.

Actually, I just did a bit of googling, and found this on the wiki page for 'sneeze':
> In certain parts of Eastern Asia, particularly in Chinese culture, Korean culture, Japanese culture and Vietnamese culture, a sneeze without an obvious cause was generally perceived as a sign that someone was talking about the sneezer at that very moment. This can be seen in the Book of Songs (a collection of Chinese poems)^[12] in ancient China as early as 1000 BC, and this belief is still depicted in present-day manga and anime. 
>> ARTICLE
That wiki page also lists many more and looks like it's basically a sign of something. Maybe not "being talked about", but does your culture have any kind of signs or whatever implied/foreshadowed by "sneeze"?
>> ARTICLE
Not to my knowledge. The wiki page suggests that sneezing was associated with loss of life in Europe (whence my culture derives), but I don't think any of that association survives.
>> ARTICLE
That's interesting. Thanks. May I ask where you're from?
>> ARTICLE
The number 4 is pronounced the same as death in chinese and japanese making it an unlucky number in asian culture. Showing this number can usually foreshadow a death or deadly situation.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. I thought recent anime don't really use the unlucky number concept (like 4 or 9) as signs or metaphors as often as before. In what animes have you seen this from?
>> ARTICLE
This season, Active Raid. Unit 8's Willwear squad goes from Oscar I - III and then Oscar V - VI.

There is no Oscar IV. The anime never says why and the topic never comes up. So to answer your question, it appears to still be present but it is rather subtle. Full disclosure: I am Chinese-Indonesian and live in California and I understood that  =  immediately on a subconscious level.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I'll check that.

The one I specifically remembered was Owarimonogatari during the Sadochi arc.

There were lots of great OPs this year, but I think the one that stuck with me the most was Kachizuke diamond from Yamada and the 7 witches. I really liked the visual style of the OP too.

As for EDs, Climber from Haikyuu was by far my favourite and I loved listening to it at the end of each episode. It really 'worked' as an ending too, the music and visuals combined have a 'so the journey continues' feel to them.

Yamada's OP was a very close second for me. Kekkai Sensen just won me over.

It's called One Punch Man circle jerk. I was fine with the song the first time I heard it and I'm now at the point where I think the song sucks. I'm personally upset with Identity being so low cause I think that may have been my OP of the year, not counting the Parasyte one which was not eligible for this.
>> ARTICLE
Even as good as Identity was, it was kind of a niche song for a niche show.  And I realize battle-academy shows themselves are clearly mainstream as fuck, but positive critical reception of them or any parts of them is not.  It would have been nice to rank higher, but it isn't surprising that it didn't really.

Flyers was definitely #1 for a little while. They were neck and neck all the way to the end though.

I don't want to come across negatively to the people who voted for Hero, but I find it quite absurd to see it get so many votes. It's just my opinion, but I never would have imagined it beating Flyers or Kyoran Hey Kids!!

>> ARTICLE
I think I'll just go against the anti-jerk here and say it, One Punch Man's character designs are actually great. Saitama's design complements his character perfectly. Genos' is rad as fuck. Watchdog man's design is genius. Even if a lot of characters in the series lack depth, literally none of their character designs are dull or boring.

I've watched a lot of the shows in the running for best character design and I'm not one of those rabid OPM fanboys. I honestly think OPM deserves to win best character design. 
>> ARTICLE
Half of Saitama's design intention *is* to be bland and mundane.... which, yeah, compliments the show, but really isn't something to win "best character design" awards.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that depends on what criteria you use for judging a character design. Personally, I think a character design that isn't flashy can still be considered to be good if it serves a greater purpose. 

For example, I love the use of wide eyes and distinct irises in the characters of Haikyuu. Haikyuu's eye design does a great job of showing where and what the characters are looking at. This is great because the show often emphasizes reading body language and aiming in the volleyball matches.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose, but I feel like all other things considered equal, minimalism is almost the laziest way to try and be "artsy".  So it bugs me to see OPM beating something like Shirobako where a *ton* of time was put into complicated designs that were consistently changing and interesting to look at.  You can tell a lot of thought and effort when into Shirobako's designs, whereas OPM it seemed like someone just chuckled and said, "why not red rubber boots and a yellow suit!?"  I mean, shit, is that literally not what happened?  Wasn't the original web comic of OPM just ghetto sketches?  OPMs minimalism wasn't the product of some higher art grand design, it was a lack of resources, and that deserves accolades now?

Yeah, it suits the tone of the show well, but... just... really?  It's like the new age abstract art movement where you can throw shit at a canvas and call it beautiful.  Such as Canada's National Art Gallery spending two *million* dollars on [this fucking thing](https://intrigueimports.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/vof2.jpg)... are you kidding me?  My taxes went to three stripes? Mother fucker.  This isn't something that should be winning awards over beautiful paintings people actually spent more than 5 minutes of effort on.
>> ARTICLE
>You can tell a lot of thought and effort when into Shirobako's designs, whereas OPM it seemed like someone just chuckled and said, "why not red rubber boots and a yellow suit!?" I mean, shit, is that literally not what happened? Wasn't the original web comic of OPM simple as fuck art-wise?

It isn't like there's zero thought put into Saitama's character design. His design is supposed to be the opposite of your standard dashing superhero and it works for that purpose. Besides, Saitama isn't the only character in One punch man. It's pretty clear that a lot of thought went into Genos's design. His customizable arms, the variety of weapons he carries, even the different ways he could use his flame propulsion are part of the character design process.

Even if we're going to compare OPM to Shirobako, I'd still give OPM the edge. Unlike Shirobako which features your standard PA works character look, OPM showcases a wide variety of characters that look vastly different from each other.

>> ARTICLE
WTF??? Hibike, Shirobako, and Shokugeki are all easily better than OPM when it comes to character design. People need to take a hands off their dick, take a step out of the circle, stop jerking it to OPM, and actually pick as  show based off of a more critical and less subjective/emotional decision. 


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, OPM is a lot of things, but impressive character designs it is not.  It made a point of how bland and unchanging and simple characters could be.

Shirobako should easily have won this one.  Fuck, all the characters had a new set of clothing every other episode, *that* is impressive character design.

OPM over-hype strikes again.
>> ARTICLE
The sets of clothing also did a good job of telling stories about how they were feeling (Miyamori has her set of favorite clothes that she puts on when in a good mood or worried about an important event, sometimes characters are using the same clothes two days in a row for when they pull all-nighters on the studio, etc).
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, I didn't even notice that.  Really cool detail!
>> ARTICLE
The entire show is all about details! Best rewatch show ever :D.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pining for a proper dub of it, it's so hard to keep up with all the details while trying to read subs, especially when they sub all the Japanese text and background convos.
>> ARTICLE
well it's a close vote. They could possibly win but it also depends how the vote is split. I could vote for Hibike but I decided to vote for Shirobako.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I had a tough time choosing. But you are right, it may just be that the votes are being split between Hibike and Shirobako, which is what's keeping either one from pulling ahead of OPM. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't fucking believe Rokka no Yuusha didn't make it. Like, how???????????
>> ARTICLE
Well, it almost got in. 7th when the top 5 get in. Ehh
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, as bad as I thought that show was, it had some pretty kick-ass character designs.  Certainly more so than Fate.
>> ARTICLE
I mean...I love OPM...and I even expected it to win half the categories... But I'm still disappointed. So many good shows/songs/characters have OPM beat, but they will be defeated by pure hype and recency bias.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I feel the same way. Everyone loves OPM so much that they're not even considering anything else. I think the character design in OPM is fine, but I don't think it should win the best of the year...

**Character Design: Kekkai Sensen**. Runner ups for me is Shirobako. While Shirobako gets an edge by having good character design with unique fashion outfits for each character (at least the main ones), the wide range of diversity of alien and otherworldly life form character design sends Kekkai Sensen over the edge for me. Designing non-humans well is hard. 

**OP - Too hard to choose** - For real. I have five of these on my playlist at work to get me through a tough day. (Flyers, Hello World, Hero, Kyoran Hey Kids and Raise Your Glag).  Plus shotuouts to  Dream Solister for actually sounding like it would be something a marching band could play. If anything I think I'll vote Flyers - It really was the standout of its partciular season and the subtle symbology shown in the animation (see Mothers Basement What's In an OP Series) really adds a lot to it. 

**ED - Sugar Song and Bitter Step** - On the other hand, this is a head and shoulders victory for Kekkai Sensen here. Maybe I'm biased,but I really do love funk and that catchy tune and the silly dancing animation just gets me everytime. No other anime got me to sit through the ED every single time it came on. 
>> ARTICLE
**Fuck.**

I *just* noticed that Sono Chi no Kioku is sung by all the previous singers of JoJo's openings together.

I guess this solidifies my vote then.
>> ARTICLE
Damn I didn't know that. That's fucking awesome! Definitely voting that. 
>> ARTICLE
*Keep in mind these opinions aren't 100% accurate due to me not watching a lot of shows this year*

#Best Character Design

I find it hard to judge something like this. Just looking at the characters in some of the shows though, I think I have to go with Shokugeki no Souma based on the grounds that I like things to be colorful. If you just look even at the hair colors here, you'll see what I mean. I never watched Kekkai Sensen or Noragami S2 but they'd probably be my runner up. Idk how to really critique it, so I might not even vote here <_<

#Best OP

It's really tough here too, but not because I don't know how to judge it. I don't know how to pick #1! I wasn't the biggest fan of Death Parade, but Flyers is amazing. Jojo's OP is awesome, Raise Your Flag (from Iron Blooded Orphans) is really cool, and has a great song too. I guess I'm gonna go with Jojo, lots of foreshadowing and hinting at what's to come, not even mentioning the second version [Jojo Part 3 ending spoilers](/s "with The World stopping time and whatnot. Really cool how they did that.") 

#Best ED

This one is a little easier than Best OP to decide for me. I fucking loved Shokugeki no Souma, and just watching the first ED gives me chills! So, Spice all the way! No competition here imo. (Okay, maybe not *no* competition, I liked The Last Theater and Sugar Song... but Spice is superior.)






>> ARTICLE
**Best Character Design:** This was a really tough choice for me. It came down to Shirobako, Shokugeki no Soma, and Hibike! Euphonium. All of which had beautiful character designs to go with a large cast of characters. I ended up choosing Hibike because KyoAni went so far as to add detail to *every* character in the band so that they were all discernible. 


**Best OP:** When it comes to openings, I find the best to be the ones that are able to pump me up for the show and also make me watch it every single episode. FS/N UBW's won this for me with Noragami Aragato's coming a close second. I cannot remember once skipping FS/N UBW's opening, and the song for the opening is so good that I could listen to it on repeat.


**Best ED:** Goes to Shokugeki no Soma. While it may not have been the most exciting ED ever, I looked forward to it at the end of each episode. Every time I watched it I was given a blissful, happy-go-lucky feeling that no other ED this season could create. IMO, it complemented the tone of the show very well.
>> ARTICLE
Quite a few of these tracks grew on me, and ended up on a playlist I have. It's tough to pick, especially since recency bias plays a big factor (Just got done with Noragami Aragoto & Yamada-Kun).  

As far as character designs, do you vote based upon stock looks, animation, costume/clothing designs, expressions, or what? I'm truly curious what that encompasses, as it stumps me.
>> ARTICLE
> As far as character designs, do you vote based upon stock looks, animation, costume/clothing designs, expressions, or what?

All of those except animation I guess. [This](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-12-13/my-hero-academia-anime-ochako-tenya-character-designs-revealed/.96432) might give some idea about what goes into character designs.
>> ARTICLE
>character designs

I honestly have no idea. Lol

I'm just going with the ones I think look the best/most colorful if I decide to vote on that at all. I'm pretty sure it's mostly personal preference. 
>> ARTICLE
Gotta hand the character designs to Shirobako, and probably Shokugeki.

Shirobako still tops it for me though. Those character designs + outfits. 10/10. Miyamori Aoi is love.
>> ARTICLE
I gotta give the character design vote to Shokugeki because BASED TOSH.

As for the ED award, "Climbers" without a doubt. Before you vote, go watch it because it's freaking brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
**Character Design:** The **Shirobako** voting block perpetuates. It's actually a tough one. Character designs across most of these series is absolutely phenomenal, in particular for OPM and Kekkai Sensen. But Shirobako took an enormous cast of *mundane* people and made it work *so well*. Not superheroes or aliens, but fucking office employees. Not only that, they were all well-rounded, distinct individuals whose names I could remember (or at least their titles) before it got annoying. 

**Best OP:** Where. the. fuck. is Harumodoki from Oregairu S2? That out of the way, this is a tough one. But my vote has to go to **Flyers** from **Death Parade.** A close second to Hibike! and Kekkai Sensen.

**Best ED:** No contest. **Kekkai Sensen, Sugar Song to Bitter Step.** This is easily one of my favorite EDs of all time. No, fuck it. This *is* my favorite ED of all time. Close second to *Aria the Natural's* "Natsumachi."
>> ARTICLE
I think best OP will be the hardest category to pick out of all of them. 3 of them (Flyers, Kuchizuke Diamond and Hey Kids) help make up my top 5 ever.

Shirobako and JoJo are the best in their respective categories (Character Design, OP) by a landslide. For ED, I've gotta vote for the ED I nominated, Climber, even if it is going to get trashed by Kekkai Sensen's ED. I wouldn't feel too bad if Sugar Song won, because that ED is pretty incredible.

I think it has the best combo of the year, but neither of them are the best. Flyers is definitely closer to being the best OP than Last Theater is to being the best ED, but as a combo they're fantastic. I think I already mentioned this to you, but I think the best combo ever is Barakamon.

Yeah that's a fantastic combo. And I agree that Flyers is closer to being Best OP since I think it's hands down the best OP of the year. :)

>> ARTICLE
I voted him since he entertained me the most out all the choices here.

That said, if we removed all sequels and restricts it for new anime only, I would hugely chip in for Miyamori Aoi simply from seeing the great growth of her character. She handled so much bullshit plus had her own share of downtime as an adult in the working world. Seeing her able to grow from all that is quite something. Oregairu 2 almost clinched it as well but not yet there (especially with that kind of ending).

Well BokuMachi fans don't get too comfortable. Someone wrote a bad review about it on MAL. Karma's gonna way down from here on out  

^^^^^/s
>> ARTICLE
No /s

I suspect at the current rate of inflation the backlash is going to be *massive*, deserved or not, especially since it doesn't have the solid source material fan backing One Punch Man did.

I can taste the salt in the air already.
>> ARTICLE
How do you backlash something that has practically no flaws at this point? Or do you mean hate from people that haven't seen it and refuse to because of the hype?
>> ARTICLE
No flaws? That's laughable. Like actually hilarious.

But I'm not hating on the show by any means. I'm just telling you how things are going to be two months from now, because what's the point in sugar coating it? Anime fans will do what they've always done.
>> ARTICLE
I understood that you're telling me what you think will happen, but I just wanted to know what form you think this backlash will take.

I'll clarify I didn't mean no flaws as in every camera angle and frame and dialogue choice is perfect, but simply that I find there to be very little to criticize that isn't wildly subjective like "I don't like that he's a kid..." Don't worry I'm quite capable of keeping a level head about new shows. I didn't give it a ten either.
>> ARTICLE
Tbf I'm struggling to spot any flaws thus far, it seems to be doing everything right even down to scene composition. But as they say (probably don't say as I'm just changing the saying) one mans flaws is another mans treasure. 

Steins;Gates gets noted that it's flawed because of it's slow first half, whereas I feel like the first half was nothing but positive for the show and in terms of quality actually had less flaws than the second half. But what we perceive as flaws are very subjective and sometimes very personal. (Golden Times Banri being far from being a bro and just ditching his mates for the crazy chick is a flaw of the show very personal to me, but I still count it as a flaw) 
>> ARTICLE
A show could be literally perfect and it would still get haters just because of how its plot is formed or the direction it goes.

People could hate Boku Dake ga Inai Machi because they don't like the time travel story. Or maybe they don't like the main characters. Or maybe they just don't like the setting or artstyle. They could hate the sound design.

Just because you see no flaws in it, doesn't mean everyone will like it. I don't really see much flaw in how Vash's character from Trigun is written, but I still hate him because of how acts and his attitude.
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait.  This is going to be glorious.
>> ARTICLE
> I suspect at the current rate of inflation the backlash is going to be massive

I really really dislike this trend, it just seems so ridiculous that the opinion of a show gets swayed more by the audience of it than it's own quality.
>> ARTICLE
I'm inclined to agree, but I think it's somewhat necessary to properly place shows that get hyped to no end.

If the fans downvote everything negative about a show and the haters stay silent because "well it was still a good show so let's just let the negatives slide" then you end up with a skewed disposition.

Obviously it would be ideal if everyone stayed calm and evaluated a show rationally - whatever that means to them - but evolution hasn't taken us to that point yet.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like I was right about Boku Dake increasing in karma every week because of the extremely rapid growing fan base. Sadly, as it keeps going up in popularity and rankings on MAL, it will continue to be compared to shows like Steins;Gate more and more which is sort of unfair to both series. I've said it before and I'll say it again: It is true that both shows take advantage of time-travel but that's about it in terms of similarities.

Steins;Gate used time travel as a central plot point that needed to be explained, examined, questioned, and generally revolve the plot around. It explored time-travel as the main driving point of the show.

Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi does not do any of this but that's because it shouldn't. Despite the use of time travel, it is not the focus of the story. It is an unexplained phenomenon that should be left as ambiguous as an act of god or just something the universe wanted to happen. Having explanations or just generally spend any focus on time travel will be out of place. This is a mystery show, not a show about time travel.

I hope as this show gets closer and closer to top 10 and maybe even top 5 on MAL, it doesn't get overly criticized when compared to something like Steins;Gate. Let the sci-fi show explain the science and let the mystery show be a mystery.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that it will be strange if they would explain the time travel..... but on the other hand, if they will leave that unexplored, then we have a supernatural ability that is seemingly exclusive for one person, with no clear rules and frontiers and unknown origin in an otherwise mundane setting. 

On top of that, it will most probably always come in pretty conveniently whenever the plot demands it exactly because we essentially don't know anything about it. 

Yes, unlike Steins;Gate, Erased's main focus is not really about time travel, but it is still an important part as it basically kickstarts the whole plot and makes it stand out from other mystery shows.


I don't see how this is going to end well, in my opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
The problem with time-travel stories is that it sparks a greater curiosity in people than other science-fiction topics. Compare time-travel shows with other shows that establish unexplained phenomenon like superpowers or mind-control powers (like the Geass in Code Geass) and those aren't nearly as questioned.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. 

Kinda off-tipic, but I honestly don't like time travel stories in general and as of now, Erased is not an exception (yeah, downvote me to hell, but I don't like it nearly as much as the rest of /r/anime.)

Just like I already implied, I think that this show is pretty flawed from the beginning. 

Time travel gets explained -> Out of place and will mostly make no sense ("god" gave him that because we need to have a story).

Time travel will be left unexplored -> See my previous comment.

I will watch it until the end I will hold out my final judgement until then, but as of now, I just can't really enjoy it sadly and not only because of the time travel, but that is enough for today.
>> ARTICLE
Although personally I'm fine with it I can understand your frustration. Some people can overlook this while others can't so it makes sense that some people would be desatisfied without an explanation. It's just not that big of a deal in this show because it seems like the right call to me. 
>> ARTICLE
> How does your top 5 compare to r/anime top 5?

I don't agree, but I do understand.
>> ARTICLE
To answer my own question (a thing I do much too often) my top 5 would look in comparison;

**[1]** Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (1)

**[2]** Prince of Stride: Alternative (21)

**[3]** Hai to Gensou no Grimgar (2)

**[4]** Haikyuu!! Second Season (9)

**[5]** Kono Suba (4)

\* If I were to discount leftovers from last season then it would be Rakugo Shinjuu (11) in 5th.
>> ARTICLE
So...  
Grimgar turned it up a notch, Konusuba seems to get more popularity lately, and people seem to get tired of Dagashi Kashi and Phantom World.

Apparently Utawarerumono has a reason to get picked up again after cour 1, and people slowly realize that Koyomimonogatari exists.

>> ARTICLE
One of the biggest problems with Koyomi is the lack of simulcast.

That and yeah a lot of people don't know it's going on...
>> ARTICLE
It also helps that this week's episode was fucking glorious.
>> ARTICLE
> One of the biggest problems with Koyomi is the lack of simulcast.

Yeah it actually only started even being discussed on here from episode 3 because of the lack of simulcast and I believe a sub about it's universe or source material (not too clued up on the monogatari tings)
>> ARTICLE
r/araragi exists
>> ARTICLE
That's the one. :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda sad that Active Raid and Aokana don't get too many comments... but then again, small discussion threads about shows that not many people are watching are my favorite. 

>How does your top 5 compare to r/anime top 5?

ERASED and Konosuba are one of my favorites this season, but Active Raid, that is another one of my favorites, is on the bottom of /r/anime.
>> ARTICLE
How's Active Raid doing, anyway? I dropped it because mecha but episode 1 seemed fun enough.
>> ARTICLE
Active Raid is super generic but it's reasonably well-executed, so it's a smooth filler anime.  I'd recommend it as being "good" filler anime.  Nothing to write home about or remember this season for, but worth watching after the big titles.
>> ARTICLE
It's going great. At least for me. It's super cheesy and campy and there are some really sweet mech fights. 
>> ARTICLE
Meh. Sounds like exactly the kind of show I wouldn't enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
That's basically why I dropped it. I think if that was taken out is enjoy it a lot more.
>> ARTICLE
>  Active Raid and Aokana

Two shows I dropped after 1 episode aha. Active Raids first episode especially bored me, but with the subject material and the style of dialogue that was generally going to be the case.
>> ARTICLE
Even Gatchaman Crowds didn't really get much attention on here. /r/anime doesn't give two shits about neo-tokusatsu, which is weird considering how much they like over-the-top parody-action stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Well at least Tantei Team didn't finish in last...
>> ARTICLE
It's hard to be a cute shoujo mystery short in this world. 
>> ARTICLE
The spikes in Grimgar and Utawarerumono are no surprise given that both of them finally have some plot happening.

Steady growth of Konosuba, not surprising.
>> ARTICLE
> How does your top 5 compare to /r/anime top 5?

1. Haikyuu!! Second Season (9)

2. Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri (7)

3. Koyomimonogatari (18)

4. Musaigen no Phantom World (6)  

5. Dagashi Kashi (5) 
>> ARTICLE
>How does your top 5 compare to r/anime top 5?

1\. Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (1)

2\. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime (16)

3\.  Haikyuu!! Second Season (9)

---large gap---

4\. Osomatsu-san (31)

5\.  Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans (10)

So we agree on whats the best, at the very least.  I'm not watching (nor interested in watching) Grimgar or KonoSuba (that is the abbreviation, right?), I'm finding Dimension W to be good but not great, and Dagashi Kashi is...alright.  Its not living up to the hype that it seemed to have before the season started, but I'm not going to drop it any time soon. 

Also, I just realized that Ojisan to Marshmallow is a short, so I'm going to spend the next 12 minutes catching up on that.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad to see Grimgar getting more love, it really deserves it. I went into it expecting a generic stuck in a video game sort of thing, but I was proven wrong. It is by far one of the best fantasy anime this season.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know. The premise is definitely good but the execution is awful. I dropped it the other day because I just couldn't get into the story at all. For me, the difference in quality between the top 2 shows on this list is gigantic. 
>> ARTICLE
> I dropped it the other day because I just couldn't get into the story at all. 

I feel like this season in general is focusing on creating a world and a narrative then posing the question of whether it is to your tastes, especially in regards to the more popular stuff.

I know that sounds like every show ever, but I mean the more popular shows don't really sell what they are, like last season you had shows that from the premise alone you could sort of compare to another show and get a feel for what they are, but this season with the popular shows you have to watch a few episodes to understand what the show is trying to sell you.
>> ARTICLE
It's almost misleading for me to post a top 5 since I've only gotten around to watching ~5, but it would go something like 

1. Boku Dake ga Inai Machi
2. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu
3. Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!
4. Dimension W
5. Koyomimonogatari

I'm planning on    

* catching up on Hai to Gensou no Grimgar and Sekkou Boys  
* watching another episode or two of Tabi Machi Late Show
* trying Koukaku no Pandora, Momokuri, Nijiiro Days, Ojisan to Marshmallow and Oshiete! Galko-chan


I dropped Dagashi Kashi, cause I really don't care, as well as Schwarzesmarken, which I imagine you have to be a die-hard Muv Luv fan to possibly enjoy, and Ajin, although I might give Ajin another chance with better subs.

If I have more time, I might get to Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu, Price of Stride: Alternative, and/or Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm.

I don't plan on trying Musaigen no Phantom World, Luck & Logic, Norn9, or any of the other new shows I haven't named.

I haven't seen the first seasons of any ongoing shows aside from an episode of Gate, which I subsequently dropped, but I plan on eventually seeing Durarara, Osomatsu-san, Yami Shibai, and Akagami no Shirayuki-hime. *Edit:* And Haikyuu!

>> ARTICLE
> Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu, Price of Stride: Alternative

I would say these two are worth checking out, Shoujo's 3rd episode was a bit lackluster and the 4th wasn't amazing but overall it's still engaging, and Prince of Stride is still currently my second favourite show this year, it treats the sport it has created with respect but outside of that it does comedy really well.

With that in mind I would say give Haikyuu! a shot aswell, it blends comedy and drama to a brilliant degree and is one of the best series going at the moment.

But a lot of your plans seem pretty solid, Durarara!! definitely requires a binge session as watching it weekly makes the plot stupidly difficult to follow, but when you piece it together it becomes a brilliant narrative.

We both gave Toradora! a 10 so I feel obligated to make these comments. :P 
>> ARTICLE
Hehe, Torodora! buddies. Umm yeah I meant to include Haikyuu! actually, but I forgot it was airing. I'll edit it in
>> ARTICLE
My own Top 5, 

* 1. Boku dake ga Inai Machi
* 1. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu
* 3. Ojisan to Marshmallow
* 4. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime S2  
* 5. GATE S2

Now if I could just get Boku dake and Rakugo out of that tie, I'd be much happier. Yet they seem to be intent on running neck-and-neck for AOTS honors all the way to the end.
>> ARTICLE
I felt like Rakugos last episode was pretty lacking, the Rakugo show was directed really well as per. But everything outside of that was directed quite poorly and the pacing with Kimiko at the end was especially bad; it felt like a race to end on a specific scene rather than working towards properly developing a character.  

Still a good show but I find it hard to put on the same level as Boku Dake atm. 
>> ARTICLE
Seems like both my predictions with a significant drop or rise for Grimgar and Kono Suba rising now with a larger fanbase. Also, Sekkou boys is still over Haikyuu thanks to the memelords on reddit.

Predictions for next week aren't that adventurous:

Grimgar will probably hold it's spot since next ep will be reprecussions

Dagashi Kashi will continue to fall, the hype train is starting to slow down, not much happening

Big episode for Gate this week, will probably take 5th next week.




>> ARTICLE
Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is super underwatched!!!
>> ARTICLE
I think these tables are great, very concise and I think the changes you made this week are definitely better. The only thing that would make it better would be hyperlinks to MAL :P
>> ARTICLE
My top 5

1. Durarara

2. Haikyuu

3. Kono Suba

4. Boku Dake

5. Gintama

>> ARTICLE
My top 5 would definitely be 

1. Boku Dake ga Inai Machi

2. Dimension W

3. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar

4. Prince of Stride: Alternative

5. Ajin

Ajin and Prince of Stride are pretty good, but I'm not surprised that they aren't higher up. The top 4 or so shows have been crushing it this Season so far, along with Ajin being CG and Prince of Stride being a Sports Anime turns a lot of people off them. 

I dropped Divine Gate and Schwarsemarken already. Divine Gate was pretty terrible, and Schwarsemarken I just had no drive to continue. That said, Schwarsemarken was pretty decent, but it's really hard for me to keep any interest in Mecha anime for some reason.

My favorite part of Grimgar was in episode 1 when they skipped the thief training (which would have been an interesting thing to see in this show's world) and immediately went on to talk about boobs for 5 minutes. 
>> ARTICLE
Tbf I can't explain why I'm enjoying Grimgar so much, but when an episode ends I'm excited for another, unlike shows like Phantom world and Dimension W where I'm just sort of meh.

I can see and understand the flaws, but I'm invested in the narrative none the less.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the initial premise was kind of cool, how they don't know where they are or how they got there, but other than that I really didn't like anything about it. My top this season so far are Erased, KonoSuba, HaruChika, and Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu.

Edit: The deleted comment above me was 'the rest of the links for the anime this season,' but /u/Banjothebear kindly pointed out that there's no limit on the text posts like there used to be. So I just deleted them and re-added them to the main post again.

Here's the streaming links. They are in the same order as above. Anything that has a previous season/part that are on a streaming website (like Lupin III and Yuru Yuri for example) but have NOT been announced for streaming themselves ARE LINKED BELOW, so if they end up not being streamed on the site (whatever the site is), my bad. If an anime from the main list isn't listed down here, it has not been announced for streaming at all yet, and either is a new anime or has a previous season that was also not streamed. Anything that is 100% confirmed has the streaming site **bolded** These are only legal streams. Please let me know if I'm missing any. Thanks! :)

Owarimonogatari just got announced for Crunchyroll it looks like. Also, I don't see Komori-san on your list of links but it's also confirmed for Crunchyroll

Huh. Seems like Mondays are dedicated to OPM. Same with Shomin Sample during Wednesdays (since it's the only thing I'm watching).

Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, Shinmai Maou S2, and Valkyrie Drive on the same day? I like my battle ecchi/harems, but watching them back to back is gonna be mentally exhausting. Good thing Rakudai Kishi is more of a romance than anything. Also GochiUsa2 as palette-cleaner is really nice.

Thank you for compiling this, U. I and many others appreciate it!

Just a small suggestion: due to recent reddit, site-wide changes, you should be able to post the entirety of your text into the main body message as opposed to breaking it up. Before, subreddits that allowed links were limited to 15k characters in their text-only posts; text-only (no-link-allowing) subreddits had 40k characters to work with. The limitation has been removed, meaning that you have 266% more room to work with. :3

How's it looking Banjo? Anything that might look good?
>> ARTICLE
> Anything that might look good?

I am actually not the best when it comes to knowing what is good and what is bad *before* the three episode rule, aka my "Should You Watch It?"

I do not follow anime news much and I do not read source material (manga, LNs, VNs, etc.), so I have limited knowledge when it comes to predetermining shows and their overall quality.

However, from a precursory glance, the ones I am most interested in are: The Perfect Insider, A Corpse is Buried Under Sakurako's Feet, Gundam: Teketsu no Orphans, GARO: Guren no Tsuki, and Concrete Revolutio.

Also, Rakudai Kishi apparently has a very good romance element to it, and being the romance connoisseur that I am, that one has also piqued my interest! :3

(Sequels are fun in their own right, but it is the newer, fresh stuff that usually captures my attention more.)
>> ARTICLE
> Also, Rakudai Kishi apparently has a very good romance element to it

Did you actually read it or are you nothing but an echo chamber like usual?

Why are you interested in the opinions of a person who rated chuuni s2 a 10?

Did you even read his entire comment? He already said (for the upteenth time) that he doesn't read source material.

I didn't read his entire comment, and I also didn't see the word apparently. I still don't like that he's echoing other people's opinions with nothing to go on.

Yeah, that's exactly what a rumor is in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean. I also usually go in. I pick up the source stuff after things have aired usually though this only happens every so often.

OH SO THAT'S THAT ONE. I thought it was another battle harem. Alright I'm in. Thanks.

Honestly only excited for Gundam and One Punch Man. That could totally change though. Who knows what the new season might bring?
>> ARTICLE
never watched any of the series but the music in that gundam trailer was fucking spectacular.  Its my ringtone now(from 1:05).  Is this a gundam you can drop in on with no context or will it be too confusing?  
>> ARTICLE
This Gundam is set in an alternate universe and is completely stand alone. Contrary to what the other commenter said. There are Gundam shows that are directly connected as sequels, prequels, etc. and share plot threads, characters and settings. This is not one of them, so you should be fine. 
>> ARTICLE
Guess I was too late. Several series are extremely slow at posting their PVs this season so I had been waiting for the past 2 weeks.

Either way, [here's the post I was meant to link](https://tentacleactions.wordpress.com/2015/09/27/2015-anime-autumn-season-pv-collection/)
>> ARTICLE
Cool, thanks. I'm on mobile right now but I'll add any I'm missing later.
>> ARTICLE
Several things:

* You put the NachuYachumi+ trailer instead of the one for season 3, the "season 3 confirmation" pv is more like it but doesn't really include anything substantial.
* you also put the music video for Comet Lucifer in as its trailer (which kind of is true but not exactly)
* The one for YBJ could be updated to an official [one with cleaner audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKoRIBQNg0o).
* The one for K is more of a recap trailer instead of one for the new season, up to you on this one, but just feel like pointing that out.
* I feel [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Nd_CM5mmKY) would be a much better PV for Kowabon since it has the actual visual and the music
* If possible, try to get your trailers from official sites instead of rehosting. For example, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L5_Uyz2Oi4) garo trailer is longer than the one you got. Your GochiUsa clip is also missing the initial narration found in [this official pv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=awfptUKbWEo). The easiest way is to go through their official websites first.

~~Will update once I find more "interesting" choice for the trailer links~~

Also I don't think your bot friend got every trailers in that playlist. It just stops at XYZ
>> ARTICLE
Heh, as I said before, I'll fix these later. Thanks for letting me know!
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone tell me what I might like?  Don't know anything about any of these other than one punch man.

I love Gate and Shokugeki from this last season otherwise didn't watch anything.

http://myanimelist.net/animelist/dewwatson
>> ARTICLE
If you have even the remotest interest in Haikyuu, then check it out. It's extremely well done.
>> ARTICLE
Check out Noragami (first season) and maybe K (project). As far as I can tell, you and I generally watched the exact same anime. And maybe start Guilty Crown.
>> ARTICLE
Someone should make a playlist out of all the trailers :o

Technology is amazing! What a wonderful time to be alive.

Looking forward to Sakurako-san and Subete, hopefully these mysteries blow my mind.

And of course I can't wait to see Owarimonogatari or One Punch man. Nothing else really seems to stand out to me though. 
>> ARTICLE
You are my hero. Take my upvote bro!
>> ARTICLE
Will it be possible for Europeans to watch One Punch man online without resorting to illegal means? 
>> ARTICLE
All in all, pretty sparse.

As is, the only ones I'm looking forward to are:

* Young Black Jack (Maybe.  Could go either way.)

* Owarimonogatari (Yes)

* One Punch Man (Hyped beyond belief.)

* Shinmai Maou no Testament Burst (fite me)

Obviously, this list is subject to change depending on how everything does when it actually airs.

 I'm also thinking about picking up a currently airing mecha.  Any mecha fans want to weigh in on what they're excited about?
>> ARTICLE
Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans is a mecha airing this season, but considering Gundam can be more of a love it or hate it franchise, it might not be for you.  I can't check your MAL to see.  Otherwise, I don't know of any currently airing mecha shows.
>> ARTICLE
There were a couple listed as mecha in this list. 

Chobits was probably my favorite mecha I've seen.

On a more serious note http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Bradyhaha

This isn't comprehensive of all I've watched.  I also enjoyed the shot out of Arslan Senkai if that helps.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Arslan Senkai or Chobits, which is probably an error on my part.  But considering how much it appears you liked Code Geass, odds are you'll find something in Gundam to enjoy.  They were both made by Sunrise.
>> ARTICLE
Chobits was a joke, but Arslan Senkai was fantastic, but needed a bigger budget. 
>> ARTICLE
One Punch Man comes out on my birthday. This is gonna be awesome!
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how many people from /r/onetruebiribiri are as hyped for Heavy Object as I am.
>> ARTICLE
Never heard of it before but it definitely looks interesting, hope it'll be good
>> ARTICLE
I have no clue what /r/onetruebiribiri is but I'm intrigued by Heavy Object just from reading about it and really eager to check it out.
>> ARTICLE
It's a subreddit where we worship the best girl of the author's most notable work, Toaru Majetsu no Index (And Toaru Kagaku no Railgun)

When I heard Heavy Object was getting an anime adaptation, I immediately went into full-hype mode.
>> ARTICLE
The only one that really looks appealing is One Punch Man. Hopefully something else catches my eye or it's going to be a long season.

Another season of anime

Bring it on

If Summer was the Season of Ecchi, this could be the Season of Mystery.  So many potential good ones.

But the biggest mystery to me:  will Comet Lucifer be good?  The trailer was but no one on the staff inspires tons of confidence and neither does 8bit.  I think I'll leave it up to CR to decide if I watch it.
>> ARTICLE
I was catching up a lot the last couple weeks for this Season, most stuff seems to be worth it I'm especially excited for Noragami.


Still couldn't bring myself to finish Maou no Testament though.
>> ARTICLE
A few might be fun. Overall same shit as usual.

Young Black Jack looks the most promising of the new stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Young Black Jack is the one title I'm most anticipating out of the entire suite. (Of course now that I've said that, I'm expecting it to be crapped on all over this sub all season long.)
>> ARTICLE
I'm just glad to see something that doesn't look like a pile of generic moe
>> ARTICLE
It's sad that they don't want to animate Tezuka Osamu's Black Jack. Maybe the theme is too dark for current anime.
>> ARTICLE
That moment when you feel guilty for only anticipating the A-1 show...
>> ARTICLE
Whew, dodged a bullet there. I'd hate it if one of the shows I'm anticipating landed on a Tuesday or Thursday again.
>> ARTICLE
Chivalry of a failed Knight is going to be amazing!!
>> ARTICLE
One Punch Mondays is real!
So many animus to watch but so little time...

Not to mention my ever increasing backlog lol
>> ARTICLE
I have difficulty sorting through crap. Anyone got some recs for me to check out? I'll watch pretty much anything as long as its good.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like Ecchi Saturdays and OPMondays will be my anime fix. Godsend for me because i can play catch up with other series now. Charlotte, Gangsta and Gakkou Gurashi here i come!!
>> ARTICLE
I generally like ecchi, but I didn't find Shinmai Maou no Testament good enough for me to bother watching the second season.

and

"Just when they think all hope is lost, Mirei kisses Mamori, and Mamori turns into a sword. Mirei then wields the sword and launches a counterattack against their enemies." sounds stupid as shit.


>> ARTICLE
Shinmai Maou no Testament to me is like DxD Lite. Doesn't match up completely but is just ok enough for me to find it fun to watch. Valkyrie Drive Mermaid...yea sounds stupid xD. More interested with Asterisk War instead and MAYBE chibi titans.
>> ARTICLE
I hear that Shomin Sample is way better than it looks...

I'll watch the first few episodes of pretty much anything.
>> ARTICLE
Someone should make a calender for the anime airing this season
>> ARTICLE
So aside from the obvious Owarimonogatari, Gundam, and One Punch Man, what are the shows to watch out for this season?
>> ARTICLE
"Young Jack Black" could become something good.  

If "Lupin the Third- Lavventuria Italiana" can keep up with the Quality of its predecessors, then itll be certainly enjoyable.

The Wildcard in my Eyes is "A Corpse is buried under Sakurakos Feet" . If they manage to get the suspense I expect from a Mystery-Anime, then it could be the dark Horse of the Season.

And last, but not least, "Heavy Object" may be to your liking if you liked "A certain scientifical Railgun" and "A certain magical Index" (same Author).
>> ARTICLE
>Heavy Object

I'm actually watching the Raildex series right now, and if Heavy Object is anywhere near as good, I'll probably like it. Thanks for the recommendation!
>> ARTICLE
18 new full length series, 19 sequels

I just find it amusing how [Real Akiba Boyz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMmO8fiv0J34qc0qIO6t31A) will be performing in the OP for [Anitore EX](http://anime-training.com/)
>> ARTICLE
These guys are fucking legendary. I didn't know they made their own music though, I thought they were a dance group.
>> ARTICLE
I highly doubt they made the music, but it'll be nice to see more dances from them. I'm still at lost as to how this thing will work. Their studio set up is their signature, so it would be interesting to see what the OP director would want them to do.
>> ARTICLE
Shit I better start binging monogatari
>> ARTICLE
So what are you all most looking forward to? I always get super overwhelmed around this time in the mid-season and could use some suggestions on what to look forward to!
>> ARTICLE
It's no Season 2, but I'll gladly accept the Hidan no Aria AA adaption 
>> ARTICLE
Would it be ok to start with this Gundam? I heard that across the many iterations that they're not related.
>> ARTICLE
This one is in it's own Alternate Universe so prior knowledge to previous Gundam series is not necessary to enjoy Ironblood Orphans.
>> ARTICLE
Not much for me this season, just Monogatari, Noragami, and K
>> ARTICLE
I just have one thing to say , Cya in winter :D . I don't wanna see one punch man because i already read it twice and owari no seraph is bad .  
Maybe some comedy will be good but then i will simply watch them later .Poor season incoming ( especially after this glorious season) .

I'm kinda disappointed Komori-san is a short.

I just got done watching Kuroko before I began Haikyuu!! and now I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to sports anime XD 

I'm going to immediately binge watch season 2 until I'm caught up! :)
>> ARTICLE
Yay, another convert! Sports anime are awesome! If you're looking for more sports anime to watch after Haikyuu, I recommend [Chihayafuru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10800/Chihayafuru), [Baby Steps](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21185/Baby_Steps) and [Cross Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5941/Cross_Game).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, sports anime are really great! I'd also personally recommend Chihayafuru, for sure, and maybe Cross Game. Cross Game has a different tone from your standard sports anime, but I'd give at least the first episode a try without looking into the anime too much (don't want to get spoiled). It's one of my favorite anime ever. 

I'd also suggest Ping Pong The Animation, Hajime no Ippo, and Major, though I haven't watched them myself- I just always see a lot of praise for them here.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched Chihayafuru, though it was awhile ago now, and I remember liking it a lot. I'll definitely look into the other ones that are being suggested though, I must have more! :D

My favorite OP is SGRS's (I'm tired of writing out that whole name), but as far as ED it's a lot closer.

Ah, thanks, I was too lazy to find these.

Also, what style of music would you call this?

I'd say I think of jazz lounge music when I hear it. There are probably other influences that a more trained ear could point out.

I found a pretty awesome [official music video version, as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_UxWeBT1BY)

That's sort of what I was thinking, but I really don't know this genre well enough to make an informed guess
>> ARTICLE
Hold on there, Active Raid! I will love you even if no one else will!

I think Haikyuu has both my favorite OP and ED. Hell, OP4 is probably my second favorite Haikyuu OP after OP1. Erased OP is also exceptional. 
>> ARTICLE
Favourite OP this season: ERASED

Favourite ED this season: ERASED

I feel like there's a trend here.
>> ARTICLE
Erased's popularity seems to be growing at an unbelievable rate.
It's ranked #10 top anime on MAL though rankings 7 to 10 have the same score of 9.09 . I wonder how much more it's going to increase as it goes on and how much it will fall after it's finished.

The rest of the ranking looks to be as expected though I hope Rakugo gains some more popularity. It's at least Top 5 material.

My favorite OP is a tie between Rakugo and DRRR! Ketsu. Favorite ED is probably the Alice in Wonderland-themed one from Dagashi Kashi with Erased ED a close second.
>> ARTICLE
ERASED is blowing my fucking mind. This anime is gonna be one of the greats I can tell
>> ARTICLE
My favourite OP's this season would atm be;

1. [Boku Dake ga Inai Machi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9G20wV0KHE)

2. [Divine Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_yfHitBhjU)

3. [Rakugo Shinjuu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nAnJAgfE8)

4. [Dimension W](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XMUi6x2d4Y)

5. [Prince of Stride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV1RHNzHxAs)

**Honourable Mentions**

Visuals | [Shoujo-Tachi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIzUdpC7LKY)

Best Moment | [Kono Suba's episode title](https://youtu.be/3PBjj75JymI?t=43s)

Best Song | [Grimgar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCMn1a-WsM4)

There's some really good OP's this season, I know Boku Dake is a pretty stale choice at this point, but I can't stop listening to Re:Re and once someone pointed out the opening scene is Satoru sitting down in the cinema to watch his life from both the perspective of his old and young self then I viewed it in a completely different light.

Dimension W has already become episodic, so I'm not surprised it dropped a spot. Although maybe that's unfair, it was probably always meant to be episodic.
>> ARTICLE
I read complains about it being uneccesarily confusing in the last episode thread
>> ARTICLE
It was a bit convoluted, but I just sorta assumed that came with the 4-dimensional territory and didn't think to much about it.
>> ARTICLE
I still haven't watched last weeks episode, even it was meant to be episodic it's still causing it to drop off my radar. I felt the set up and premise made it feel like it was more story driven though, so maybe that is the issue.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still holding out hope for a character/relationship-driven show that's just starting out with some short arcs before it gets to the main conflict. Like Psycho-Pass or something.
>> ARTICLE
It's not episodic? Episodic means that every episode is mostly unconnected with each other. Dim W is done in arcs. 
>> ARTICLE
Well it's not every episode, but I was hesitant to call 2 episodes an arc. And events like Loser's arrival were just a single episode
>> ARTICLE
Those early episodes were introductions, but they also served to further bleed the overarching plot of the numbers into the narrative. Compare that to something like Nichijou which is purely episodic where the episodes are basically unconnected from one another. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't even call Nichijou episodic though. It's flat out doesn't have a direction. Maybe I'm just flat out mistaken, but I think of something like Cowboy Bebop (for most of it), Katanagatari, or Doctor Who (if you'll let me use filthy non-anime examples), rather than a comedy or slice-of-life.

As far as the numbers go, I'm not convinced they're anything more than a plot reason to go investigate a bunch of weird occurances/places. All they seem to do is find a "numbers," break it and move on.
>> ARTICLE
Direction and a sense of continuity is something episodic stuff lack. Katanagatari is not really episodic in that they are travelling to collect swords and there is a sense of progression plot wise. In Cowboy Bepop, once you have the full crew, you can honestly watch any of the episodic episodes and not feel like you missed anything.

In the case of Dimension W, each case you learn more about the numbers as you go along. You wouldn't be able to view the last 2 episodes before the introduction of the loser for example. I imagine each case will be set up in mini arcs of collecting number coils and progressively learning more and more about them and their past, which builds up on previous knowledge before and will likely go towards the over arching conspiracies that sparked the numbers in the first place.  
>> ARTICLE
To my thinking it's a spectrum. Maybe truly episodic shows can be watched in any order without losing anything, but while you didn't say whether you agreed or disagreed, I feel like entire genres like slice of life and comedy aren't even labeled episodic when it's an inherent trait of the genre. Perhaps Nichijou is the epitome of an episodic show, but there's no need to call it that because that's a given. I call shows episodic when they progress incredibly slowly in favor of what are mostly throwaway events that may or may not reveal some small hint in relation to the main conflict, or may give you a sense that the characters are becoming closer. You're right that in recent Dimension W episode you would miss something if you hadn't been introduced to Loser, but I think you could skip this entire "arc" and be mostly ok. It's not 100% episodic, but I think the word is a good description of what it's currently doing that might be putting people off.

Edit: contrast an episodic show with something like Boku Dake, which has different events that are nevertheless tied directly to the characters and relate directly to the main conflicts. If there was an episode devoted to Satoru's elementary school class going the zoo, that would be episodic (granted that would have to happen at least another time or two for me to label the show that way) even if Satoru became better friends with Hinazuki or if something important like her birthday was revealed.

KonoSuba and GATE continuing to gain ground? I'm okay with this. Grimgar seems to have a lost a lot of comments and some karma from last week, but that's not particularly surprising given what's happened in the plot. 

Dimension W with the biggest karma fall! I know that quite a few people on this subreddit didn't like the way they handled the two-episode-arc that just ended, so I wonder if it will continue to fall into next week?

And sitting way down there is AoKana... it almost feels like a guilty pleasure show at this point. I can't even call it good, I'm just such a fan of the color palette and aesthetics of the show. I can't help but wonder how good it might have been if a bigger/better studio had picked it up... Sorry Gonzo, your ability to handle a show like this isn't particularly impressive. 

Overall, it seems like the movement of shows has calmed down now, and is only subject to episodic variation from here on out, with probably a few exceptions.

**Top OP's for me:**

* [*Dimension W*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XMUi6x2d4Y)
* [*HaruChika*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PT_m92yFf8) (based fhana)
* [*Phantom World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPGZU-gnqkY)

**And for the ED's:**

* [*ERASED*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5F5DunePxI)
* *Koyomimonogatari*
>> ARTICLE
> Grimgar will probably hold it's spot since next ep will be reprecussions. Dagashi Kashi will continue to fall, the hype train is starting to slow down, not much happening. Big episode for Gate this week, will probably take 5th next week.

And for my next trick I'll tell you that Dimension W has been slowing down still, but probably won't fall since those below it aren't doing anything special next ep.

I would have loved to see more of them! Would satisfy my need for a girls sports anime :p
>> ARTICLE
You know, I hadn't considered until now how utterly underrepresented female teams are in sports anime.

Of course, there are great female characters/athletes in shows like Chihayafuru and Cross Game, but the only sports anime featuring an all-female team I can think of which isn't completely awful is [Bamboo Blade](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2986/Bamboo_Blade). Unless you count survival games and tankery as sports.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I always want to try out Bamboo Blade because it's like the only one but just not interested in Kendo at all :/

As for survival games and Tankery I guess it's close but still I'd want something more actual sports like :p

Did you turn the video to HD?  I had it on SD at first and it had that effect.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I did. I don't have the greatest constitution when it comes to motion though, playing Portal for more than an hour is a guaranteed headache. Don't mind me.
>> ARTICLE
No, it's a problem with the method used here. The artifacting is HARD in these. Like... these are pretty low quality upratings.
>> ARTICLE
Probably somewhere in my AviSynth script since I updated it since last season, guess I'll fiddle around with it some more.
>> ARTICLE
It's a common problem in almost all of these 60fps interpolation videos for anime.

EDIT: Guy on another branch of this comment already posted an image as I was uploading some. [Here's a few that show it well though.](http://imgur.com/a/jXvin)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the pics. Yeah it's the reason I really only do OPs and EDs and not watch whole shows in 60fps. I can use the animation preset sometimes and it's the same issue. Big motion with characters moving and the background changing like in your last picture is where the prediction of the interpolation method can't quite "guess" what the in-between frames are well enough and you get what shows in the picture. 
>> ARTICLE
It's because the algorithms don't know how to deal with the animation being drawn a lower framerate than the video itself.

[OP](https://streamable.com/57pm) / [ED](https://streamable.com/8zgc)
>> ARTICLE
Can you do Ajin? The anime that gets the hugest improvement from 60 fps is always CGI.
>> ARTICLE
A somewhat related question; why can't CGI anime be recorded at higher frame rates? I can understand the constraints with traditional anime since the in-between frames are hand drawn, but isn't it easier with CGI? Or am I completely misunderstanding how CGI works here?
>> ARTICLE
CGI still has the in-between frame issue. In some ways it's even more important, so even if it's easier to do with CG than hand-drawn, any flaws will be glaring. You can drag a model across the screen with CG, but you can also drag a cel with traditional. If you want the model to look good at it moves or to do a lot of other things on the screen all at once, you need to individually manipulate a whole bunch of things all at once and add detail/modify models/tweak particles as needed. It's a lot more labour at 60fps even with CGI, and most anime already struggles to pay for animation. Adding more than double the labour for visuals that don't directly translate into more profit is not a good idea.

***Wild Card***

If something was wrongfully shunned and *not* submitted, add it as a reply to the second level comments below, each saying a season! The comment I have responded to this with will be the judge. If your nominee for the wild card is in the top ***5*** replied below ***AND*** above my comment in points, then it's in. 

This one is a little different, make sure that your anime ***ended*** in the season you're submitting it in. For example, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders started in Spring but it's only valid for Summer, because that's when it ended. Similarly, anything that's still currently airing but aired last year as well belongs in the *Fall* category. An example of this above is Naruto: Shippuuden.

* Haikyuu!! episode 24. That was one of the best anime episodes I've ever seen. It was simply incredible. In fact, I'm gonna rewatch the final scene again after I finish this comment!

* The latest episode of Active Raid made me squeal. [Seeing Section 8](https://40.media.tumblr.com/993269c851938a2e6f09fe85fc820d6a/tumblr_o4dwzluK1D1qfxg40o10_1280.jpg) just march in line all badass-like reminded me of watching Power Rangers back in early school years. Edit: Oh yeah, what was hilarious about that marching scene, was that it had no purpose except to make this awesome shot. Moments after this scene they all had to retreat and then ram the building with their police train/car. It's just the kind of thing you'd expect from Active Raid. 

* This season overall was really good for me. There was a bunch of shows that I really, really liked and will remember fondly.

> Seeing Section 8 just march in line all badass-like reminded me of watching Power Rangers back in early school years. 

Exactly the same feeling. Got Power Rangers vibes from this episode. Loved it!

To offer a counter to the video/podcast suggestions:
I really appreciated being able to read the reviews. So many things are only available in video format. I do enjoy podcasts on occasion, but they cost me much more time than a review and they're harder to flip back and forth through. Also, it's harder to share with my hearing-impaired girlfriend. If you were to do a podcast or video, I would appreciate a transcript or a text alternative.

Thanks for your appreciation, the plan for next time is to make both a recorded version and a text version as I will write down what's being said on the pod. however it depends entirely on how willing people are to turn this into a podcast.
