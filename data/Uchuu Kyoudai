The show has been going at a deliberately slow pace so that it wouldn't catch up to the source material, but it's getting relatively close to catching up, so I can see a hiatus coming here at the end of a major story arc.

There's also a Space Bros animated movie in the works, so that's probably part of their plans going forward.
>> ARTICLE
It hasn't helped that since December the author has only put out about 1 issue a month because he has been working on the movie.  I always thought the anime was very good about adding in background filler and not burning through the source material but a hiatus kind of can't be helped for the anime.  

>> ARTICLE
The tweet says:   
   
Next week's Space Brothers is the last part, then there is preparation for a plan. What kind of plan? Please, see Space Brothers tomorrow.

What.

This week's episode better be crazy awesome, then.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. I don't frequent MAL or any other forums so I had no idea this was coming.

This makes me a little sad. Uchuu Kyoudai has been one of my favorite anime ever since it started airing about 2 years ago. Definitely gonna miss it.

Guess I'm gonna be reading the manga then. Is it a weekly release? Or monthly?

And Maoyu Maou Yuusha, which *coincidentally* has the same VA's and director as Spice and Wolf 
Especially because [Spoilers](/s "The Pope declared a Crusade in the final episode, which is a pretty big deal in medieval Europe") 
>> ARTICLE
Now THIS one gets me salty, because it was S&W only better in some ways. 
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I liked how the romance was a lot more subtle in Spice and Wolf compared to Maoyu.
On the flip side, the scale of the politics and economics of Maoyu were absolutely massive compared to the smaller, local transactions of Spice and Wolf. (if you exclude things like the Trenni silver coin business, that is)

Serious question, why do you think Maoyu Maou Yuusha is better than S&W?

And Baccano. And D-Frag.

Really anything by Brain's Base.

I liked the Baccano! ending

Yeah, they did great at tying up all the plots they focused on, but there's so much more left to tell. (Just as /u/revriley1.)

Let me find the list of anime which only has one season to promote the manga....

Also you mention HxH, although i'm extremely sad the manga is having the infinite hiatus, i think the anime ending is overall quite satisfying. (Especially if you don't know there is a continuation in the manga.) 

I do have quite a few shows, Index, NGNL which has been mentioned, Rokka no yuusha, D.gray-man, Ao no Exorcist.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I don't know if you can put Rokka no Yuusha there, considering it hasn't even been 3 months since it ended if I remember correctly... unless they confirmed it as a single season only?
>> ARTICLE
The sales flopped. Hard. We won't be getting another season unless some producers get suicidal.
>> ARTICLE
> Also you mention HxH, although i'm extremely sad the manga is having the infinite hiatus, i think the anime ending is overall quite satisfying. (Especially if you don't know there is a continuation in the manga.)


Agreed. They ended it at a perfect place. 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. They literally [](/s 'set up what could be the biggest arc ever and just ended it there')
>> ARTICLE
I mean the whole show was about [](/s "Gon trying to find his dad so ending it with him actually meeting him felt appropriate. Since there's a new main goal for the series in the DC arc, it feels acceptable for them to have stopped when they did.")
>> ARTICLE
I won't be satisfied until we get closure for Kurapika. 
>> ARTICLE
[What probably happened](/s "Hisoka probably killed Chrollo. His conversation with Illumi hints that his obsessive chase amounted to something. Knowing Hisoka, it makes sense that he fought with Chrollo and, because he's still there, he won and killed him.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s  "They showed that he completed his mission by finding the eyes of his people. However they never showed how. They showed nothing of the Phantom Troupe and their quest to free their leader from Kurapika's ability or if they ever faced off again.")

[ ](/s  "Instead they spent about 5 episodes towards the end of the Insect arc slowly narrating characters running in slow motion to draw out the story line. There was so much more they could have done with that series.")

You know under normal circumstances I would usually heavily penalize a show for having such an ending that NGNL did, but considering the show was really really stupid in the stupid fun department, I couldn't take the story  serious enough to judge it heavily for it.

NGNL is a glorified 12-episode manga commercial

weird when the sourcematerial is a light novel...

actually there are both, I've just assumed it was manga since I have first volume on my shelf.

The Neon Genesis Evangelion. Strange is all I can say about it... Obviously the budget issues had their impact but that doesn't change what it is.

Very true.  I watched NGE for the first time and didn't really care for it or the ending.  I went to college, took some philosophy classes that focused on existentialism, read a bunch of Satre and Camus, then watched NGE again and was enthralled.  The last two episodes are just brilliant IMO.
>> ARTICLE
I hate when people tell others to skip those beautiful, final episodes. It's the meat of the series in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
As much as I love the last two episodes of Eva, they do kinda spell out the existentialist themes at the end a little bluntly. 
>> ARTICLE
Did you even watch the series? It's all about extremes. Nothing was subtle in this show, especially when they start spoon feeding you philosophy.

Nana: I had way too many questions left with the 'read the manga ending'.

Charlotte... I could forgive the filler-like episodes, but not the ending 
>> ARTICLE
What exactly was wrong with the ending anyways?
>> ARTICLE
The only problem with Charlotte is the same one its spiritual predecessor, Angel Beats, had. Not enough time to develop storylines properly. The last 3 episodes or so were horribly rushed. 
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion they pack all the most interesting stuff, which could have and should have been the lion's share of the series, into the last thirty minutes. 
>> ARTICLE
The last few episodes felt condensed and rushed. It had a lot of potential for building up a very emotional ending.

The last 3 episodes really could have and should have been an entire season.
>> ARTICLE
Everything from episode 10 onwards. 12 is not enough to redeem it.
>> ARTICLE
- the ending episode could have fit into 4-6 episodes easily

- the [](/s "descent into madness of the MC") would have been much more fulfilling if they had stretched it out. The whole scene with the [](/s "Girl that uses her powers to heal people") could have been a whole episode alone. 

- [](/s "The last power the MC steals is Courage") I am not sure whether this was supposed to be a joke, a heartfelt moment, commentary on the bullshit lessons some shows try to teach or just shitty writing.

- Deus Ex Machina after [](/s "the main character gets shot with an arrow")
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, the main thing wrong with the ending is that it was an interesting enough concept to be at least a couple episodes. Given more time, the ending could have been pretty interesting.

In my opinion though, the ending is not the only thing wrong with the show, and a change like that wouldn't have saved it. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd argue they could make the last episode or two a whole cour if they stretched it out. They could have even let Nao or the whole student council go with him and give them all more character development.
>> ARTICLE
fuck they could make the last episode be the show (with more episodes even) with the first episodes as backstory filler stuff and it would be A LOT better. 
>> ARTICLE
Courage
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, as hilarious as the joke is, I don't think that was her actual power. I think it was just supposed to be "This girl is quite brave," considering she still tries to protect him.

At least, I seriously fucking hope that wasn't the power.

Great Teacher Onizuka for me. I've seen a lot of shows with unsatisfying endings, but GTO is the only one where it was good enough to where the ending did not effect it as much.

It was a pretty rushed ending, and more depth could have been added to it. Kind of felt like the ending sneaked up on the writers. I still think it is fitting though, and Onizuka kind of makes the "ultimate sacrifice" for the good of his students in a way. Still good, but it definitely could have been more fleshed out.

Usual advice - you don't have to read everything after you finish the series. Just be sure to read the last volume (chapters 292-301), and you will see the ending without really losing anything prior it.

I just thought of a more satisfying ending, with an almost equal amount of figurative slap to the audience. [](/s "Oreki goes in for a kiss, but not all the way because kyoani. Then it cuts back a few seconds because that was just in his head. Then, he says the same line that he only imagined in the original version, but real this time").

FLCL - just the last minute is so different from the last 6 pages in the manga. She's so much more of a dick in the manga, but it plays out so well that she at least leaves him her original guitar and vespa, and dips like: "idk come get me if you can." In the anime she's so much nicer to Naota, but in the end just dips like: "maybe I'll come back for you." He's stuck on earth until such a time she comes back.

Either "Yona of the Dawn" or "The Devil is a Part-Timer".

I've never loved an anime as much as I love Yona. I think it subverts so many tropes and is so fun while tackling some big issues. There are some scenes that come later in the manga that I would PAY to see animated. Come onnnnn! I want s2!
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say it subverts tropes, it kinda of uses quite a few of the standard ones.  I'd say what it does do really well is provide a genuinely strong female character, which is fairly unusual in this medium.  And I don't mean bullshit Giant Tits and Giant Guns McGee strong, I mean a real emotional strength tempered in some severe loss and heart-ache.  A strength built through relatable suffering and humanity.  Yona's strength was something anyone can relate to in their day-to-day life.  It's overcoming little things to be a better person.  It's being positive for others no matter what your situation.  It's trusting and loving and self-improvement.

Such a good show!
>> ARTICLE
Been reading the manga for Yona, can't agree more. The anime stopped at precisely the point where things truly started to ramp up. Season 2 when...:(
>> ARTICLE
Really? I got bored as fuck after all the dragons were "collected"

I can see that, especially since the next arc focuses on a side character who previously got at most few minutes of screen time.

I would do unspeakable things to get another season of Yona of the Dawn.... it was just so great!  I need more kick-ass Yona and more hilarious Yellow Dragon (I forget his name).

If they did a proper dub and brought it overseas so I could buy Blurays of it..... oh man, ooohhhh man.

I don't think it's going to happen though unfortunately.  It really seems like a show just meant to push Manga sales :(

Also Fate/Zero. Pretty much no one gets anything remotely close to a happy ending, and it just gives off a general sense of being unresolved. Many aspects of the story only exist to set the stage for Stay Night, and while it does do a good job at that, It wouldn't have hurt if it was a little bit better at being a standalone show.

This show was extremely special to me over the course of the past two years, through laughter, through tears, and through inspiration. Sad to see it end so abruptly, but the movie is just around the corner. Here's to hoping they continue it sooner rather than later.

>> ARTICLE
What's the movie going to be about? Is this a cancellation or a hiatus? I'm so confused, I hadn't heard about any of this..
>> ARTICLE
It is probably a hiatus. There is still *so much* going on. New manga volume (#23) actually came out three days ago, and will be accelerating again soon.
>> ARTICLE
I sincerely hope it is, because this anime really speaks to me. Do you know if the manga also had a six-month time skip? If it didn't, then that's worrisome. If it did, then they chose a pretty excellent way to enter a hiatus.
>> ARTICLE
It did. This is at the very end of #19.

They extended the email bit by a couple of minutes and skipped out the thing at Vince's house (and the background for that), but it's best kept for later if there will be a break anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Great! Well, hopefully it'll resume some time later this year or early 2015.
>> ARTICLE
The movie, luckily, is written by the mangaka, but it's a prequel that focuses on younger Hibito and Mutta.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good to me.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same way. I didn't actually get into the series until it was somewhere in the 50 episode range, but now that I've just watched the episode.. I feel like I'm not going to know what to do with myself when next week rolls around and there isn't a new episode.

In regards to your link... I wasn't expecting as many feels as I got when that song started playing. It's kind of funny, after hearing it so often in the show.

>> ARTICLE
Following this from day 1 has been a great pleasure and I'm happy I stuck with it until the end and it was nice to see stuff wrapping up in a happy way.

Was the time skip also in the manga or did the anime jumped to that point in order to have some sort of ending ?

I really hope that after the movie they'll be back with more episodes.
>> ARTICLE
In the manga they had a few pages of what was talked about at Vince's house. Then they jumped straight to his launch. I can't recall if they had the date or not, though.

What happened at Vince's house will have to stay for when they continue the series.
>> ARTICLE
Bummer, I really wanted to see Vince warming up to Mutta and how they because more closer.

It's actually really sentimental. Just wait. Or pick up the manga. I am not sure if they have translated versions out yet, though.

Crunchyroll has a new-ish Manga section that has volumes 1-22 listed on it. I'm not sure if the Manga section is included in anime only subscription or if it's a separate one though. Either way, it'd be a legit way to enjoy it.

Wait, this was the last episode!? Where did that come from? Why? When did they say this? I just ended this episode thinking it was so great, and I was looking forward to episode 100.

Damn it, I have so many questions!!

[It was announced on twitter a week ago](https://twitter.com/animeuchukyodai/status/444481517482303488).

Apparently, from what I understand, the anime was getting too close to the manga.  
And that would be because the manga is being published in a slower pace because the author is too busy with [the movie, which is canon and will be about Mutta's and Hibito's childhood.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22583/Uchuu_Kyoudai_Number_Zero)

So there's a chance that the anime will resume after the movie is released (on theaters or, most likely IMO, on DVD/BD).
>> ARTICLE
Ah, okay. So it's not a cancellation, at least. I'll patiently wait, then. I would've read the manga if it was a cancellation, but if there's a chance of the anime resuming I'd rather wait. I really need that soundtrack in my Space Brothers!
>> ARTICLE
There is a soundtrack out there, but it doesn't have all the tracks.

That awesome main theme that plays is on there, but it does smt have all the variations.

Edit: Nevermind, you meant you wanted to hear the soundtrack as you see what's happening.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, your edit is correct!
>> ARTICLE
I'M FUCKING CRYING
>> ARTICLE
Good stuff abound. Everything is going well. But this is the end, for now. It is a good place to end it, in my opinion.

Also, I figured out why the moon rocket Hibito rode in was called MARES I (and the cargo one MARES V). We had originally thought it was a misspelling of Mars. They are based on the ARES design. Orion is the same as IRL.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I'm really going to miss Space Brothers. I've never watched a series this long, much less watched it week by week for almost two years. My Saturday mornings will be so empty.

And as a heads up to anyone who wants to pick up the manga, chapter 187 is where you should start.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the heads up. Noted in case I ever decide to pick it up.
>> ARTICLE
But, it can't end. What will I do on Saturdays?

Although, at the same time, I feel like if they drug it out, it would just get stale.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you feel. This is the only time I watched TV all week.

> I feel like if they drug it out, it would just get stale.

I don't think so. The manga has awesome new developments here.
>> ARTICLE
Cool. I'll start reading it on CR
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait for the movie, anyways, this was a nice finale.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I really enjoyed this episode! The end was great and so heartwarming. Godspeed Capcom-san!

And then I come here and learn it was the finale! I'm glad it was a success in Japan, it means it's not really over and we have a movie waiting for us.


>> ARTICLE
It's been a long journey for the brothers, I can't wait until the movie and here's to hoping we'll get more episodes in the future.
>> ARTICLE
I never thought I'd be watching it until now when it first started. Those episodes in the capsules were a drag, but the show really grew on me.
>> ARTICLE
I'm heartbroken that this was the (possibly) last episode of Space Brothers. The show inspired me to get into astronomy and now I'm the proud owner of a Dobsonian 8" telescope.

I guess it's onto the manga now for me. Hopefully there'll be other realistic space animes like this to watch in the future (or ones I don't know of), but even then I doubt they'll match the emotional depth that Space Brothers has. 

Here's to hoping the anime renews, especially after the movie releases. A great show like this deserves to keep going for a long time. 


>> ARTICLE
> Hopefully there'll be other realistic space animes like this to watch in the future (or ones I don't know of)

When I asked a friend who likes anime, I was recommended  and . I have so far managed to watch , and I have to say it is absolutely awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Planetes before Space brothers and was totally blown away. However I think Space Brothers is much more realistic and the story is quite solid.

>> ARTICLE
I second  /u/masasin , Planetes is DEFINITELY worth the watch. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt sad watching this and thinking that this is it for now. On the otherhand it was a ending I was happy with, no complete ending but leaving the story on a happy ending. Kinda disappointed to not see Hibito with Olga.
>> ARTICLE
> Kinda disappointed to not see Hibito with Olga.

He did go to Roscosmos. He will probably be working with Ivan, in that case.
>> ARTICLE
We still never saw it. :(
>> ARTICLE
True. And it wasn't in the next few mangas either.
>> ARTICLE
> True. And it wasn't in the next few mangas either.

Ah ok,so did thanks for letting me know. Guess I have to start reading the manga to get my Space Bro's fix.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know if we'll ever get a second season after the movie? I agree with /u/lastorder, this anime started slow but picked up quite a bit after a while. I've loved watching this series for the past two years and will miss it dearly.

I do think this was a fitting way to end the anime though.
>> ARTICLE
This is the finale? Goddamn it, I was SO looking for episode 100.

Can't believe this is over. It's been on freaking amazing journey here.
>> ARTICLE
You can continue it with the Manga. See the other comments here for if you are not in Japan.
>> ARTICLE
Now I'm just sitting here, listening to the OST...crying.

Goddamn it. I'll miss this show.
>> ARTICLE
I am utterly shocked that this is over, I'm a long term anime fan and no anime has ever spoken to me as well as space brothers. Been watching it every week religiously since ep 10. I am so gonna miss this, I really hope it's on hiatus and not totally cancelled. Here's hoping they bring it back after the movie, Starting back on ep 100 would be brilliant. 

The only thing I can take from this is we fans have a lot of "catching" up in real life. Spend life aiming high. It's the only way to do such a story justice!!! I will most probably be reading the manga though. This is way to much an important part of my life these days to suddenly stop! Here's hoping for future releases. 
>> ARTICLE
So I marathoned this show in 3 days I was blown away. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck. Come on. Literally one more week and I could have had my two year pin. Guys. 

Anyway, TEARS. MUTTA PLEASE COME BACK.
>> ARTICLE
Goodbye Space Bros... Hello Kindaichi Returns. I hope Kindaichi has another 100 or so episodes, then Space Bros comes back.
>> ARTICLE
http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
>> ARTICLE
i've only watched this show till somewhere episode ~30 where [  ](/s "the brother has this accident on the moon and gets rescued in the last moment"), because it got kinda boring. Did he ever go to space?
>> ARTICLE
Not yet, but lots of stuff in the meantime
>> ARTICLE
Huh, you felt like it got boring there? That's odd.
>> ARTICLE
that's why i watched the anime at the start, because i thought it would be the story of someone going to space.
>> ARTICLE
Well, from episode one it became quite clear to me that it was about an older brother catching up to his younger brother who was already an austronaut. If you ask me, when Mutta goes to the moon, that's pretty much the end of the story. Because the story was never about Mutta being on the moon, it's about his struggle to get there.
>> ARTICLE
Waiting for this to go to /r/all and the shitstorm that follows
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I came here from /r/all and I have a question for the people here. Don't you find it kind of creepy that most of your animes **hypersexualize underage girls**? Doesn't the fact that underage girls are considered fanservice indicate that perhaps most of the anime you guys watch are for **teenage boys**? I mean that's why it's called a **Shonen** right? So I guess my question is, assuming most of you are over 18 and I don't mean any offense: **aren't most of you too old for the animes you guys are watching?** 

Edit: Also, I'm not generalizing all anime or looking down on anime at all. I used to watch alot of anime in the past as well. Outlaw star and Honey and Clover series were my favorites. But I only ask this because when I look at the anime today, they seem alot more pornographic than I remember.

Edit2: to clarify, I don't think anime is weird. I just think that the people in their 20's and 30s watching shonen, anime targeted towards teenage boys, are weird. 
>> ARTICLE
I, myself am 20 years old. I just started watching anime last year, actually. Watch something like Corpse Party and tell me it's for kids.
>> ARTICLE
Well that depends, is Corpse Party a Shonen?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, didn't see the Shounen statement. Watch Hunter x Hunter. Since you probably don't care too much about watching the show start at the yorknew arc. I think it starts around episode 50.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're overestimating the average age of people in this sub.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you are asking an honest question, so I will give you an honest answer. Do keep in mind that I am answering solely for myself and do not claim this to be the answer for all of /r/anime/.

Yes, most anime are aimed at teenaged boys, and those are called shonenen, they compose a large amount of anime released now a days.

Second of all, although most fanservice in anime is underage, it is highschool. Those girls are all fully mature and developed, and other than names, they do not display any of the characteristics of teenage girls (typically speaking of course, there are exceptions), because, and you might have guessed it, they are't real boys and girls.

Now, allow me to point out that although some anime have never ending fanservice (highschool of the dead comes to mind), in most of them it is moderated and used for humorous effects. Although this may ruin the moment if thrown in at the wrong time, from time to time it is fun. Not gonna complain for the occasional fanservice.

As for too old for anime. Aren't most people on /r/gaming/ or any similar subreddits too old to play video games? Yet they still do (and me!). Why? Because they enjoy it. Because it is fun. Because it takes my mind off the long day of work I have. I enjoy doing it.

Lastly I will bring up the point that shounen, action, and fanservice are not in my favorite anime. Unlike what most non-anime viewers I have met think **Anime is not just mindless action and loli fanservice**. There is so much more to it. Believe it or not, you can do much more with animation they you can do with live actors. It is great seeing all the forms of art. I view anime kind of like I view books, as a way to see what I will never happen in real life. Weather it be magic, dragons, super-powers, or the occasional fan service.

My favorite anime of all time doesn't even include any action scenes, fanservice, or aimed at teenaged boys. That anime is called [Charcoal Feather Federation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei), and it is beautiful, philosophical, and just overall amazing. It is also a great entrance anime for people who aren't into the action fanserviece kind of stuff. (not that I'm advertising it or anything *cough cough*)

One last note is that when people here discuss fanserviece, incest, lolis, or the recent bath thread that got into /r/all/, they typically aren't taking it seriously and more doing it as a joke on everyone, including yourself and me.

Hope that clears up all your qualms, if you have any more questions or arguments feel free to respond to me.

Some of the people here might be a little bit offensive, but that's because nobody likes it when other people insult their favorite activity, so please don't feel insulted by it :)
>> ARTICLE
Well I never said all anime were for teenage boys, I enjoyed Honey and Cover when I was 18 and loved it. I can definitely appreciate it as an art form and I think that it can be for all ages just like videogames. But I think it's kind of creepy when people in their 20s or even 30s are watching **shonen's**, which is targeted towards teenage boys with their endless amount of fanservice of teenage girls. 
>> ARTICLE
First: not all of the anime featured in the OP are shonen. Many are notable seinen and ecchi titles with clear R+ ratings. Also, not all shonen has "endless amount of fanservice of teenage girls" and just because a show has a *target* demographic doesn't mean people outside that demographic are forbidden from enjoying it.  This behavior isn't even exclusive to anime; American cartoons like Adventure Time, Sponge Bob, and Steven Universe have a ton of adult fans.

Second: just as with books and movies, anime is a medium with many different genres.  Yes, shonen is one such genre, based on an age demographic.  You, apparently, prefer josei titles like Honey and Clover.  There's nothing wrong with either preference.  

To be honest, I'm not into fan service, but you won't see me giving people shit about enjoying all their love for ecchi and harem anime.  *It doesn't hurt me for them to like it, and it doesn't hurt you either*.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually with you on that. The amount of never-ending fanservice in anime is really annoying, especially when it spills over to shows I actually like.

However after a long hard day of work, I can sometimes appreciate some mindless action and teenage girls. That is all I have in defense of fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
K.
>> ARTICLE
I like that, totally an /r/all reader with little ties to anime who knows what shonen means to bring it up on their own out of no where.

Wild Card test

This is specifically for the people that didn't see the nomination thread. Basically, I'll be doing this for the rest of my threads. Each thread, I will have a maximum number of wild cards (for this one, it's 5). The top 5 (or other amount for another thread) will get a second chance and be in the final vote which will be held sometime after the end of the other polls, which is Wednesday, February 4. I'll probably end up posting it the 7th or the 8th. 

TL;DR, if you want characters added, comment them here.

Edit: forgot to add, I will include up to 5 for *each category*. So 5 girls and 5 guys.

Edit 2: someone just posted a girl for abs, so 5 girls (man boobs will not be counted, sorry :p) and 5 uh... sets of abs?

Edit 3: Forgot to put 2014 anywhere in this thread, only characters from 2014 are valid.

Exciting and creative asspulls do not a good show make.  "Oh no, I'm losing this chess match.  Better seduce the opposing player's queen.  Because that's a thing I can do, apparently."

Not to mention the characters are written poorly.

The only interesting part of NGNL's characters are Sora's and Shiro's debilitating social anxiety when separated.  Yet they never play on it for more than a joke.

>> ARTICLE
They have no depth to them.  They're paper thin.  I don't see how it isn't obvious how poorly written they are.  They are literally *just* tropes given shape.
>> ARTICLE
A show being good is completely subjective. You may consider it bad writing and as such think its bad, but thats only because you are comparing it to other things you've experienced. Therefore it is only an opinion. You can only attempt critical evaluation and objectivity, but its completely impossible to actually achieve it. That is because whilst you may have some logical criteria that you use to rate a score, how highly you weight each criteria and score each component is 100% subjective. For example you might consider OP characters like Sora, Lelouch and Light as bad characters because they are tropes to you and it creates no intensity or tension in the plot. However some might consider it good writing because to come up with logical asspulls requires linear like thinking that has to make coherent sense throughout the show. For example Sora against Jibril, took an entire episode for his asspull to play out. Also some people might see depth in the tropes. I know I found depth in the trope characters of Date A Live as it made me think it was a satire, where some others disagree. Read an essay called ["The Author Is Dead"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkQsRVrWM6c) or just watch the youtube link. Its essentially stating that everything you come up with is an opinion based on your own experiences, the original authors intent is pointless and that there is no objectivity in your review of anything. Just because you think its bad, doesn't mean its bad to people like me and /u/Pozsich, and honestly if you think you can be objective when discussing things like this. You're more mentally challenged than myself.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the old "all opinions are equal so let people think what they want" argument.  There's no point in moving forward with that particular discussion if that's how your going to act.

Just got to point out though:

>I know I found depth in the trope characters of Date A Live as it made me think it was a satire, where some others disagree.

Projecting your own misunderstandings onto a show doesn't make that the author's intent for the show.  That's like saying "I considered Frankenstein a comedy" and telling everyone the author's intent for the book was comedy.  It's clearly not.  Speaking of which.

>Its essentially stating that everything you come up with is an opinion based on your own experiences, the **original authors intent is pointless** and that there is no objectivity in your review of anything.

That is straight up bullshit.  The authors intent is *everything* when it comes to a story.  One clear and *huge* hole in that theory is fucking Shakespeare.  What was his intent when he used the words he *created?*  Is it up to us to *interpret* these wholly original combinations and words?  No.  It's the author's duty to tell us his intent.  Saying that an author's work is borrowed from his experiences is only half the truth.  It's up to the author to organize those experiences into something *injected* with his intent.  To guide his reader/viewer along a preordained path *he* set up.  Different interpretations come from readers/viewers straying from that path and finding themselves at the end.  Sure, they made it to the end, but not the way the author intended them to.  If people had no intent towards their creations, we wouldn't create them.  The author's whole purpose when writing a story, or taking a picture, or painting a landscape, is to deliver a message.

In short, don't use a theory as some absolute truth when discussing subjectivity, objectivity, and opinions.  It looks incredibly silly of you.
>> ARTICLE
AH, the old "you are so incredibly misinformed that I pity you" argument. There's no point in moving forward with that particular discussion if that's how you're going to act.

>Projecting your own misunderstandings onto a show doesn't make that the author's intent for the show.

Authors never explicitly state the purpose of a show. With Date A Live it is under the impression of Poe's Law which states that unless the author purposely states that it is satire, it is both satire and not satire. It is up for the individual to decide. 

>One clear and huge hole in that theory is fucking Shakespeare. What was his intent when he used the words he created? Is it up to us to interpret these wholly original combinations and words? No. It's the author's duty to tell us his intent. 

Did you even study English, holy fuck man. Do you even understand why Hamlet is so famous? Its famous because there are so many different interpretations of what his words mean because it resonates a different aspect for different viewers. William Hazlett stated "it is we who are Hamlet", meaning that how we perceive Hamlet and his intentions is correct, because we see ourselves in his character. Source (http://shakespearean.org.uk/ham1-haz.htm):

>Hamlet is a name; his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage of the poet's brain. What then, are they not real? They are as real as our own thoughts. Their reality is in the reader's mind. It is we who are Hamlet. This play has a prophetic truth, which is above that of history. Whoever has become thoughtful and melancholy through his own mishaps or those of others; whoever has borne about with him the clouded brow of reflection, and thought himself "too much i' th' sun;" whoever has seen the golden lamp of day dimmed by envious mists rising in his own breast, and could find in the world before him only a dull blank with nothing left remarkable in it; whoever has known "the pangs of despised love, the insolence of office, or the spurns which patient merit of the unworthy takes;" he who has felt his mind sink within him, and sadness cling to his heart like a malady, who has had his hopes blighted and his youth staggered by the apparitions of strange things; who cannot well be at ease, while he sees evil hovering near him like a spectre; whose powers of action have been eaten up by thought, he to whom the universe seems infinite, and himself nothing; whose bitterness [75] of soul makes him careless of consequences, and who goes to a play as his best resource is to shove off, to a second remove, the evils of life by a mock representation of them - this is the true Hamlet.

Your entire point there is complete and utter bullshit. Texts are famous for having so many different interpretations, none of them are correct and none of them are wrong and none of them are correct. As long as it is correct to the individual that is all that matters. Different viewpoints from different things it what makes a text controversial and famous, however none of these viewpoints are correct. If people could reach an objective truth, then there would be no disagreement on anything. This discussion forum wouldn't even exist as there would be no discussion, just people agreeing with each other.

>In short, don't use a theory as some absolute truth when discussing subjectivity, objectivity, and opinions. It looks incredibly silly of you.

You realize you're doing the exact same thing right? Whilst there is no official name for what you are doing, its the exact same as mine but with the opposite meaning. You have come up with a theory and belief that the authors intent is law, and have argued as such. I have come up with the theory of "The Author Is Dead" and argued that point.

Don't be condescendingly retarded, it looks incredibly silly of you.
>> ARTICLE
> Did you even study English, holy fuck man.

Heh, it's been about 4 or more years since I studied English.  We didn't cover Hamlet for very long either.  In fact, I believe we only watched the Mel Gibson movie.  We did read Julius Caesar, Romeo and Juliet, and Taming of the Shrew.

I actually just found you and Pazzu's discussion a couple days ago about *the exact same damn thing* as we're doing now.

After reading through that and giving your position some more thought, I can see it's merits.  I will say that, when given, an author's intent trumps personal revelation every time.  Take Bradbury for instance.  His intent in writing Fahrenheit 451 was to illustrate mass media's (specifically television's) affect on people and how it makes them less able to digest complex forms of media, like books.  You probably know the story of the college lecture.  One interesting thing is that this certain debacle was possible thanks to personal interpretations.

I *would* like to probe your mind some more on this theory and hear some more of it's counter arguments on some ideas I've come up with in regard to measuring objectivity.  For instance, you mention this:

>thats only because you are comparing it to other things you've experienced.

When comparing opinions does one defer to the other when they have more experience?  That would seem logical, as with any field, you defer to those who have more experience (as I'm doing right now).  And how does this work with art?  Some artists are considered better than others, but if left up to the opinions of the masses, wouldn't it not matter?  I might have more to think on this, but I'll wait for your response.

Now this is in regards character writing specifically.  Say you and I have different opinions on Sora as a character.  I say he's well written, and you say he's poorly written (I think we likely have the opposite of these opinions).  What would happen if we took a character we *both* agreed was well written, and compared him to Sora?  Wouldn't we be able to quantify the characteristics that are well and poorly written between the two?  For instance, backstory, motivations, etc.

Two last things.

>I have come up with the theory of "The Author Is Dead"

[](/pointandlaugh)

Come now, we both know your name isn't Roland Barthes.

>Don't be condescendingly retarded, it looks incredibly silly of you.

Shit, that *was* condescending of me.  Sorry.  That happens when I get into heated discussions. :(
>> ARTICLE
Besides that all this is true, he's not even trying to be unbiased anyways. He says the characters are written poorly because they're thin tropes, but what's the line? Most anime characters are tropes or slight variations on tropes, few have the time to go deeper into the characterization than what is necessary for story progression. I don't see how holding a flaw that is extremely prevalent in anime versus a single one makes it outstandingly bad. Is it a good trait? No, I would agree not. Is it a bad one? No, it's a normal one.                         
Also to your points; we can approach being objective. Some people can come quite close to it. However, you are correct in that it is ultimately impossible to be unbiased in opinions of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Well like the video said every character is based on the authors own experiences and other mediums hes seen. Everything that is ever written is borrowing different components of different shows because nothing is a completely original idea, and has been taken from elsewhere. I agree with you here.

>we can approach being objective. Some people can come quite close to it. However, you are correct in that it is ultimately impossible to be unbiased in opinions of shows.

That is where I disagree with you. Its not that you can approach it, but you can attempt it. You will never get near a point of being objective, but you can attempt some form of a logical criteria. However what you use to deduce that a show is "good" is different from another person. I could say the only shows that are good are the ones that are entertaining. Others could say what makes a show "good" is it has to be pretty. Someone else could say it has to combine those two elements. There is no set standard for "good", its completely subjective. You can only sort out your own subjectiveness and explain your personal criteria for it, but it doesn't mean its any more objective. It is still utterly 100% subjective.

I don't think so. I would hope not. Because even if I'm not attracted to large breasted women, and don't want to be large breasted. It would just be another kind of body shaming and body policing. 

Women can be large chested and still have wonderful, attractive, wonderful personalities. And being attractive isn't everything.

But I'm not attracted to breasts. And I'm tired of being expected to. 

I'm also tired of people treating large breasts like they're better.

As for people treating them like they're better - that's just their preference? Like subjectively they are *better* to certain people.

>> ARTICLE
Sorry if I was taking people too seriously.

And sadly, there are people who seem to act like larger breasts are *objectively* better. And try to make arguments from nature as to why. 

The whole flat chest thing is a bit like the fat acceptance movement. There's a pressure for women to be skinny, yet curvy. Not so much flat chested, or plus sized. So maybe some of us, including me, get a bit overzealous about that. Sorry.

A lot of us get loud and proud, because we don't want everyone thinking that "bigger is better". Maybe a bit too loud and proud.
>> ARTICLE
S'okay~

Lol, well, I wouldn't do that, it's silly. Nothing is objectively better, appearance wise anyway. 

I kinda get what you mean... um, I think? If you're skinny but flat chested people tell you to be curvier, and if you're fat but apple-shaped or whatever (aka not curvy), people tell you to be curvier, too. So really only hourglass shapes are being accepted on either end of the spectrum of weight.

Lucy heartfilia for the win, you cant have really great body without a cool name and personality or its no fun

lucy followed closely by honey. Some of those picks are just awful. just plain boring, they have to look good clothed. Allows for more fashionable options.

That stance where they cross their arms under their boobs is always so weird to me.

 Go Isuzu Sento and Joutarou Kuujou!!

So, what about those of us who like the way flat chests and pecs and muscles look on women than men? And that the best boobs is no boobs?

And that the best muscles on anime guys is no muscles.

Boobs on women and muscles on men? Sorry, but no thank you.

Lisa Mishima isn't small enough for you??

You can submit muscular women for the best abs part of it, it's just that no one did.

I really think an opportunity was missed for Rin Matsuoka in the ab/muscle category.   I just think it's funny that this show is a show about *swimming* and the sample pictures are of his child self, his face, from the chest up, or his fully clothed body... I'm actually amazed there were so many pictures of him fully clothed out there.

Edit:

Here's some representative pictures so you can witness the [muscles](http://31.media.tumblr.com/2fc969c907aabb5464b847b1e78ee424/tumblr_n7yt66FUXu1r1wpwoo1_500.jpg) [in](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2013/219/4/c/gou_and_rin_matsuoka_by_somthinandnothin-d6h4kgt.png) [all](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/54/27/d8/5427d837c3e24ebcdfa9e13c58a7843a.jpg) [their](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/miz4tune/11648188/4978/4978_900.jpg) [glory](http://www.tapeciarnia.pl/tapety/normalne/224291_free_rin_matsuoka.jpg) [at many](http://www.crymore.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NSOnii-Free-03-1280x720-x264-AAC7A0D1A79.mkv_snapshot_23.03_2013.07.20_18.15.33-640x360.jpg) [angles](http://static.tumblr.com/16037981702b94dc4d54ab241f026446/z5alk1f/Cy1mqaytm/tumblr_static_rin.jpg).

And in keeping with the Ghostbusters theme: the new character Tully; who is obviously based on Rick Moranis' character, Louis Tully, from Ghostbusters. Though the character in Space Brothers looks very different (other than the nerdy glasses).

[Raws Spoiler](/s "http://raw.senmanga.com/Uchuu_Kyoudai/174/20 Granted I don't read Japanese so I have no idea what they are talking about.")
>> ARTICLE
He just wants to hear his piano!

edit: Watching it live now. What I said is technically correct, but there's a deeper meaning.
>> ARTICLE
It looked like he's hoping that Mutta will bring the team together, like he has done previously with his other groups. 

Initially I thought the missing spot was reserved for Hibito, but at the end when it slow pans to someone at the window and they were wearing the US flag on their shoulder. 

But I double checked and an astronaut's nationality is shown on the right shoulder, so Hibito would still be in it. He's had the requisite training, was second in command on his first trip to the moon so having him be captain this time round would fit.

Only thing that wouldn't make sense was that Butler implied that the person who he offered captaincy of the team turned him down, which would seem at odds with it being Hibito.
>> ARTICLE
Butler said that he was initially turned down. I doubt Hibito would pass up a chance to lead his brother's team. My guess is going towards Azuma. Or given Brian Jay showing up in the preview a bunch it might be his brother.
>> ARTICLE
Hibito has just officially recovered from PD, so I'm not sure Nasa would pick him so early. My initial thought was Asuma, who would have agreed to be captain because of the presence of Mutta in the team.
>> ARTICLE
I'm drawing a blank at the moment, is Azuma up on the moon still or did his rotation finish?
>> ARTICLE
Azuma was back when he told Hibito to speak to his brother about PD. 
>> ARTICLE
Azuma's rotation was immediately following Hibito's rotation.  Unless he was sent back for a second mission ([](/s "his last appearance was at Brain's grave where he encountered Hibito as he was dealing with his PD.")) he should still be available.

I believe Chief Butler selected Hibito to be in command since pretty much everyone is expecting Mutta and Hibito to visit the moon in honor of Brian and his brother.  Besides, he's qualified for the job and he has proven that this affliction no longer has a hold over him.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or did it look like Hibito has a chance to be the captain of the team? The USA flag worried me, but I think he has used it before.

Since the backup crew members tend to be the same members of a main crew of another mission, this would set the route towards Hibito and Muta going together to the moon.

>> ARTICLE
I would love it if that were to happen. Finally a resolution. 
>> ARTICLE
As I said above, I thought the same thing initially but the left arm is always the US flag while the right has their national flag, so the candidate for captain is not necessarily American

Am I the only one who dropped the anime to read the manga instead (after 50 episodes)? I loved it, but the pacing was just way too slow, and it give me very little incentive to watch it weekly with its relatively low quality production value. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a slow-paced anime, and I like that about it. It's very relaxing.
>> ARTICLE
I had recently discovered the anime about a week ago, and spoiled myself by watching 1-62 in a week.

Watching many episodes at once the series is fantastic, probably one of the best I have watched, but now having to switch to weekly, I agree it's just to slow to wait week to week. 

That isn't a knock against the anime itself, I love the pace and detail, but more so how the schedule works out. 

I am perhaps going to wait a few weeks, and watch this monthly rather then weekly.  Get more out of it that way. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, a marathon sound very nice. I watched it weekly for a little over a year, but when i tried the manga, i realized it was the exact same deal in 5min instead of 24. I didnt look  back after.
>> ARTICLE
I highly doubt it, but is the Manga available in English? 
>> ARTICLE
You can easily find the scanlation on most manga website. I havent read it in a few weeks, but it was a little ahead the anime last time I checked.
>> ARTICLE
The anime is probably 60% caught up. They were selling the 20th book or something last month.

I agree that the pacing is a little slow but I think I prefer it like this. It just means a nice long anime.

How much can be considered succesful?
>> ARTICLE
IIRC 4k has been considered the "magic limit" an average show should reach in order to earn profits, however it's probably not that accurate today as animation standards and production costs have increased in the last few years. 

Shows by high-budget-studios such as KyoAni obviously need higher sales than 4k for them to be considered successful.
>> ARTICLE
7300 for YRYR. Seems legit. Promising for Season 3, especially now that there's enough content for it, too. Or even the spinoff of Sakurako's family.
>> ARTICLE
Please Hibito, tells us if you are dead or alive...

Not a lot of stuff was going on but I'm happy to see Hoshika coming back, I like that guy.

Also after the credits the Hibbit short has said that it's the end, I really hope they are done with those.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if Hoshika knows something we don't know. Jaxa maybe able to get some nice words in for Hibito or?
>> ARTICLE
I dunno about that. Back when it was revealed that Hibito had the panic disorder, they seemed to cave pretty quick on him. Now, maybe *individuals* can have an influence, but I wouldn't hold my breath that JAXA the organization would put muscle behind it.

He might be asking if they are in contact with Hibito since they didn't hear anything from him...
>> ARTICLE
I really do, they can't leave us hanging like that.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they are going to kill Hibito. It's just not the type of anime this is.
>> ARTICLE
That will be depressing not being able to see Hibito standing next to Mutta on the moon. Would be as if the show started to saw it's own head off then.
>> ARTICLE
Assuming NASA won't have him back, though it seems Butler is still unsatisfied with where things are at, the other thing I thought of last week was that the elderly guy Mutta went through JAXA testing with went off to a company that was developing rockets.

That would be a good way to tie in some of the previous characters into the story again, and have Hibito go to the moon as the captain of a privately owned company's astronaut team. 
>> ARTICLE
Either that, or with Roscosmos.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting thought, considering how the show is "sponsored" by JAXA it will be fascinating to see the show go this direction.
Many of the characters are being intertwined in the show so plausible.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I know, just repeating the little joke Mutta put in the message :P

Still [I fear the day Sharon's disease takes her over.](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
Wonder if he's off to Russia for some fun with Roscosmos  and with Olga, of course. Mean, it's obvious that she's going to be of further importance to him at some point.

> I really hope they are done with those.

Me too, but I'm afraid this also means that the anime is heading for a pause. It's been running for a crazy long two years now uninterrupted and we're close to the 104th ep ([the schedule](http://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/2478/time) doesn't even go beyond the 100th atm).
>> ARTICLE
The show is reported to be stopping after the next ep (99). I just [posted a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/20ouuf/uchuu_kyoudai_stopping_at_ep_99/) about it
>> ARTICLE
I doubt there's a pause. The story is still going strong. The new manga is coming out next week. So we have at least double that amount of episodes left.
>> ARTICLE
Next episode will be the last. (99)

Holy mother of recap and flashbacks, they sure dragged this more than possible, at least no Hibbit short this week.

Wow so I believe with next weeks episode, we'll have caught up with the translated manga releases (chapter 157 of the manga).  
The last manga raw I read was chapter 221 so with the shows current pacing of approx two chapters per episode we're about 30 episodes or so from catching up with the raw manga releases!
>> ARTICLE
Chapter 214 is the latest one, in the 22nd volume. Interesting things are happening.
>> ARTICLE
Chapter 221 is the latest raw out (last week) I've seen and some extremely interesting things are going on. :)
>> ARTICLE
I wonder what they plan to do when they catch up. Space Brothers isn't like Naruto, it would be possible to add filler that actually had to do with astronaut training etc. Not entire bundles of episodes dealing with a fake enemies and missions etc.
>> ARTICLE
Yes this thought crossed my mind too, without spoiling anything, the current arc isn't something I'd consider to be a satisfying point for a series break, but if the story continues as expected then the arc that follows could potentially be one depending on the authors plans of course.  

I'd also forgotten that the manga is released either weekly or biweekly so potentially there could be another 30 chapters/15 episodes of content before we get to the stage where we'd be too close to the manga releases to animate the episodes without knowing the storyline beforehand.
>> ARTICLE
Where is the manga released weekly/biweekly? The last volume came out more than a month ago, and the one before that was back in June.
>> ARTICLE
It's released in Kodansha's Weekly Morning magazine, I believe.
>> ARTICLE
Any idea how much it costs? edit: 330 yen.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder what Chief Butler will be notified of.
>> ARTICLE
The little silver lining we have for both of them to go to the moon, I'll be crushed if only one of them eventually goes to the moon.

Please Butler, you are our only hope.
>> ARTICLE
one of the other neemo modules will retire or have an accident, mutta will be the backup crew of someone and he will backup him, or something like that, so we will be having mutta, kenji, nitta and the serious one that can't remember his name on space
>> ARTICLE
Isn't that how he got in in the first place?
>> ARTICLE
I'm on episode 73 right and getting caught up. I took like a 5 month break from this anime because it does get kind of cheesy. 

I'm just curious on how popular this anime is right now.. I guess it's not that popular but the people who do watch it seems like it.
>> ARTICLE
In Japan, The story is still relatively popular. I know many people who have read the whole thing. As a result, not everyone is watching the anime (which has the exact same story), but they do like it.

As for me, I love it. Read the whole thing too. It was the first [anything] to affect me emotionally in years, and that was just the first episode. It does go slow from time to time, but it's the same in the mangas. It's also kind of realistic, which I definitely like.
>> ARTICLE
yeah it does get slow sometimes, about the popularity i think its okish, but i also think that if it wasnt for JAXA the anime wouldn't be around now.

It goes a long way to air this and inspire people and children to seek out and learn more about space.
>> ARTICLE
Man i love this show, I think it's really well made, and it deserves more than any show I watch to be popular
>> ARTICLE
I love that it seems both of our Space Brothers will be mentored by one of the brothers that didn't get to go to space together.

Also, damn. That Mr. Hibitt has to suffer the same fate.
>> ARTICLE
> I love that it seems both of our Space Brothers will be mentored by one of the brothers that didn't get to go to space together.

Who what why?

> Also, damn. That Mr. Hibitt has to suffer the same fate.

Yup. He should have held his breath, closed the door, and reopened it as soon as the fire stopped. (Incidentally, in real life, a low (~13%) oxygen environment is perfectly fine for humans, but cannot sustain a fire.)
>> ARTICLE
Brian was sort of a mentor for Hibito, remember? Now Eddie, Brian's brother, seems like he'll most likely be some sort of a mentor for Mutta, as the captain of the back-up crew. Brian died before both him and Eddie went to the moon, remember? They've both been to space, but never together. Seems like Mutta will be mentored by Eddie, like Hibito was by Brain, so that Mutta and Hibito can do what Eddie and Brain never got to: Go to space, and the moon, together.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, Okay. That makes sense now. And it's beautiful 
>> ARTICLE
The Lunar telescope might actually be implemented! But it seems that it's not Hibito who is going to lead the crew after all, at least according to the lancement.

Tears were shed today.

And for the first time I felt sad for Mr. Hibitto.
>> ARTICLE
Will be interesting to see how the dynamic of the group changes now that Eddie joins. :) good inner warm feeling appeared in me when I saw that the lunar telescope might be built.
>> ARTICLE
"If you are going to try something, you might as well aim for the top."

Really good episode!
>> ARTICLE
I love how Space Brothers is really motivating all the time. 
>> ARTICLE
That's what I like about it and why I stuck with the series. Makes me feel good every weekend.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much yeah. It's a good anime to watch for relaxing purposes 
>> ARTICLE
This week i feel it was pretty cheery. Had to laugh at the jokes being bad but funny. I like the pace not to fast but not to slow and it leaves enough time to think about the deeper story or meaning.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing *major* happened this episode, but it was a necessary step forward. Mutta finally figures out what he's doing and manages to do it well. Looking forward to what happens next!
>> ARTICLE
Everytime Mutta accomplishes something, it makes me feel extremely happy.
>> ARTICLE
Mutta taking leadership was so.... Mutta !
The training where they had to draw the landscape seems directly inspired by the show about Apollo space program called "From the Earth to the Moon". In episode 10 "Galileo was right", the Apollo 15 astronauts follow geology courses for their lunar mission, and they do the exact same training. Great show.
>> ARTICLE
I liked this episode, light hearted and funny. Had some good laughs and was interesting to see Eddy change the groups dynamic. I wonder how Mutta will grow now with Eddy taking the lead of this ragged group! :) Mutta trying his usual charm was funny!
>> ARTICLE
That dang Jamaican xD 
>> ARTICLE
Where's Mr Hibito? Did they all die the last time?
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it will happen, but Kenji through some serious death flags.
>> ARTICLE
Don't you dare joke about that...

It's enough with Sharon.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, the more I think about it, the more the flags seem possible.   
    
* They showed the affects of his absence has had on the family.      

* They show his family saying goodbye, and he explicitly mentions not to worry because he will only be gone a short time.   

* He made a promise to his daughter right before leaving for a mission/arc.   

* He has a pregnant wife waiting for him.   
    
Maybe I'm over thinking things, but, the 'promise' flag is huge. It's just short of telling someone, "I have something to tell you when I get back."
>> ARTICLE
Poor Chief Butler. He'll remember that heart forever.
>> ARTICLE
I love the music at the start of this episode. Looks like we *might* be getting somewhere.

Also, I keep expecting Mutta to deduce something correctly (re: scene with Hibito and Mutta at breakfast), but it never happens. He's the comedic scapegoat.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe add a quick summary of what happened in the post comment. It would be nice. No need for many details since the pace is kind of slow. 

I missed it today, but I know the story. What happened this time? 
>> ARTICLE
Hibito came back to Houston. Mutta, Kenji & co. started prep for NEEMO. Not much else.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry i usually end up watching this on sundays, i make the thread so that people have space to discuss it but due to this i can't really say what happens on the episode.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Hibito getting some help in Huston. Will be interesting to see when and if Olga returns, and how Mutta will react to her!
>> ARTICLE
Woah are we already at 80 episodes? It's been so long, and such a fantastic trip.

Anyways, I'm so freaking glad Russia is over. This episode was really good. I'll take 20 seconds of Mutta looking at the sky over that silly part at the end of each episode with the astronauts as animals. 
>> ARTICLE
Nothing happens, neato!
>> ARTICLE
At least they cut out the Mr.Hibit Sketches so we get slightly little more story time, though they sure know how to pad it.
>> ARTICLE
Really like the new ED but I miss the last OP, I guess this one will grow on me eventually.

Really liking the new character Olga but if they make her Hibito's love interest I find that a bit awkward due to her age.
>> ARTICLE
The age of consent is in russia 16. The part about her becoming 16 in the near future could be important ;)
>> ARTICLE
She doesn't even look 17, much less 15?! 

Anyone else agree? Maybe her height? 
>> ARTICLE
It's crushing seeing Hibito in that state and even when they showed Sharon at the beginning I was afraid it will be [THAT episode](/s "I don't see how she will recover and when they'll finally get to it I'll be depressed...")

[Also best advice ever](http://i.imgur.com/oRxCGcg.png)

When I heard the church bells I kinda freaked out for a second.

>> ARTICLE
This show needs some more love, its really good
>> ARTICLE
Ahh Olga bending herself around freaks me out. My poor body would snap in half if I tried any of that.

Olga trying to act all cool and mature seems so awkward.
>> ARTICLE
It's to show that she's forcibly trying to act older. It's supposed to be horribly awkward and obvious. 
>> ARTICLE
Because she's 15?
>> ARTICLE
That too probably but I don't know something about her face seems off when she does it.
>> ARTICLE
i feel like olga will fall in love with hibito but to him she will be important in helping him get over his panic disorder
>> ARTICLE
As a Russian myself I'm very glad that they decided to show Russia so realistically, without always-winter and balalaika nonsense. The part about "only 60 days of sun" impressed me the most.

Learn Japanese and jump ahead. Or be patient.

Well, actually since this is single character, time for that Itachi greatness.
>> ARTICLE
The way I see it, Itachi was [a better patriot than brother.](/s "Sparing Sasuke still doesn't change the fact he slaughtered their family and left Sasuke an orphan. He also left a jutsu inside Naruto to BRAINWASH Sasuke into being loyal to Konoha. In Itachi's mind, Konoha always came first. Sasuke was too young to know the Uchiha-animosity, so he may just have gotten lucky when Itachi eliminated the clan.")

Itachi is one of my favorites from that series, but I believe too many of his patriotic feats are being twisted into brotherly feats.
>> ARTICLE
Itachi greatest of all time for sure.

On a side note, come join us over at /r/NarutoCircleJerk. 
>> ARTICLE
Kyousuke from Little Busters Nominated. Hes the best bro!
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking this also, but I know most people on /r/anime aren't aware of Itachi.
>> ARTICLE
Itachi, by far one of my favourite character from Naruto. Such an awesome brother...sobs....
>> ARTICLE
I would totally love having my brother kill my own family and just repeadetly telling me to hate him after that! Like who wouldn't !
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing you haven't watched it yet or you really just don't get it at all.
>> ARTICLE
na i am watching it (skipping fillers, oh boy the amount of fillers...) and finished manga already.
>> ARTICLE
So you don't get it?
>> ARTICLE
Well, my first comment was somewhat meant as a joke, of course i get that itachi sacrificed a lot in order to achieve what he did.
>> ARTICLE
Ooohhhh...
>> ARTICLE
The way I understood it is this: Itachi feared Sasuke would develop some sort of hate towards him simply because he looked up to him, and would get frustrated and blame Itachi for not being able to surpass him. Itachi' fear was shown in the moment he asked Sasuke: "Do you hate me?", and that's most likely the reason he acted the way he did. Also, I believe Itachi sensed a bondwas forming between Sasuke and Naruto, which would later be the only thing that would save Sasuke from being left alone after getting his revenge. 
>> ARTICLE
I nominate [Killua Zoldyck](/s "in relation to Alluka/Nanika"):

* Plays along with all of sibling's games (never dismisses sibling's desire for bonding time)
* Never judged sibling for supernatural powers like rest of the family
* Never used sibling's power for evil or greed (relatively speaking)
* Didn't lose sibling's body in a misguided attempt at resurrection
* Didn't slaughter entire clan (yet) and traumatize the sibling
* Threatened his own mother's life for the sibling's sake
* Took sibling's feelings into consideration before following through with his own plans and intentions
* Freed sibling from family's restrictive clutches
* Presumably will not try to add drama by trying to bang sibling (but shippers may argue otherwise)
* Canonically, is still being a fantastic big brother

TL;DR

Rescued sibling from their prison of a life, was not and is not the source of their troubles, and is providing a free and happy future. 

If I could have an anime sibling as my own sibling, Killua tops the list by leaps and bounds.
>> ARTICLE
The 13th Chairman Arc was actually one of my favorite because of its depiction of Killua and Alluka's sibling relationship. Killua for best big brother.

I'm glad to hear that. Unlike some of the characters being mentioned (*cough*, Oreki...), Misaka's relationship to her sisters is a vital part of her character. Here's hoping this doesn't turn out to be just a "favorite character who happens to have a sibling" bracket, and people actually vote for characters with an established track record for good brother/sistering.

That's what I was hoping for. Obviously I can't force people to vote for the actual best sibling, but I'm going to put in the voting threads that you should think about who the best brother or sister is.

It's supposed to be best sibling, not siblings. I look at it this way because, Hachiman and Komachi work with each other really well and are both good characters.

I assume Mutta's idea has something to do with reflecting light. Not really sure what it was, but the preview seemed to hint that it was for the astronaut's "enjoyment" and an idea from somebody who had already been on the moon.

I guess it has to do with the shining light on the moon. Perhaps a way to communicate in case radio fails.

...Also, Mutta has been hitting the gym.
>> ARTICLE
> ...Also, Mutta has been hitting the gym.

Hadn't noticed. You're right.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I was thinking it was more of a way to light the station when the power was being conserved since it was mentioned it is dark/gloomy during that time, and hard to reading.  Also, I think he was looking at a window at the time too when he was coming up with an idea. Using an alternate light source like the sun, would probably save power or make it more efficient.

Edit:  Of course, what ever it is could have multiple uses too.
>> ARTICLE
I assumed it had to do with power, like generating solar power or something, because of all the electricity conservation foreshadowing. But, the preview suggests it's something to boost astronaut morale. 
>> ARTICLE
> But, the preview suggests it's something to boost astronaut morale.

Hot showers maybe?  He might have devised a solar-heating concept as opposed to solar power.

>> ARTICLE
It actually seems to do with the same concept of conserving power on the station, because of the addition of the high power antenna which would draw large amounts of power.  Similar to how the NEEMO pods turned off power, but it created a gloomy environment for the astronaut.  The moon would have similar situations with the increased power draw, so why not naturally light the moonbase using mirrors to keep morale up? right?  Mutta seems to be thinking not just about the mission, but the people as well, and that's what makes him stand out.

Bottom-right to left is launching from the moon, a rendevous with the CSM, return to earth, and landing. On the other hand, why SURGEON would have this particular map up I have no idea.

Totally got teary eyed this week. Amazing episode!
>> ARTICLE
It felt like they added that line with the sensor failure to scare us in the last minute.

Great to see Hibito back on terra firma and funny to see how casual he just tossed the moon rock to Mutta.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad Hibito is back on earth.  Everytime an episode revolves around him, I have this fear that he's inevitably going to die.

Having seen live Hadfield's return to Earth, I really appreciated this episode. Obviously not as exciting as the freaking real thing, but still pretty good.

"Why Serika-san? Are you in love with her?"

Well that's putting things bluntly haha.
>> ARTICLE
I really expected Mutta to accept the spot for backup crew until I learned it was for the ISS, so it makes sense to give it to Serika, but I wished that they could have given Mutta some props since if it was not for him she might of have not even gotten that spot. 
>> ARTICLE
> but I wished that they could have given Mutta some props since if it was not for him she might of have not even gotten that spot

Well, it is for a good cause, since she can start research on the ALS disease cure in the ISS so that [Spoilers](/s "Aunt Sharon can be cured!") It was too late for her father, but definitely not too late for others!

[Irrelevant, but still Spoiler!](/s "But then again, it's probably too late for Aunt Sharon, who probably won't live that long, haha...OH GOD, NO! THESE MANLY TEARS WILL NOT STOP POURING OUT OF MY EYEBALLS!")

EDIT: Damn, I'm so stupid, edited for fucking spoilers...
>> ARTICLE
Hawking is still alive. It's been decades since he was paralyzed by ALS.
>> ARTICLE
>Hawking is still alive.

Doesn't guarantee anything, as Serika's father isn't alive. Hell, Hawking is regarded as a special case, as only 4% live longer than 10 years.

Granted, the realistic timeline would be 3 to 5 years. But this is fiction, and someone could kick the bucket whenever they want to decide that the time is right for plot convenience. Or someone could make a miraculous recovery, who knows?

Anyways, I was merely joking in the irrelevant spoiler I mentioned above (all them MANLY TEARS), so death won't probably come at all in the next couple of episodes.
>> ARTICLE
He gets the feeling of knowing he is following his dream and helping another person with theirs. Is it not enough that he knows it and he doesnt need others saying "nice guy Mutta"?
>> ARTICLE
I wanted him to get props for it so that it could bring him and Serika more together, not so that other think more highly of him, but  to show Serika how much Mutta cares. At least tell her in private.
>> ARTICLE
But this way Serika may find out in the future and they still can find their way together. I think it would be much better if Serika doesnt get told by Mutta, but if she finds it out through someone else. As otherwise it can be seen as emotional leverage and not a gift. I am sure she will find out it was him, it will be sweet to see what she does or how she reacts, especially if she is in Space when it happens. 

My thoughts. What do you think to this?
>> ARTICLE
Interesting, I was surprised to see where he ended up. It could be so much worse, atleast there he can practice with all the luna vehicles as he carries on training.
>> ARTICLE
Kinda sad that the episode was cut short again for the hibbit short. I thought that would have been a 1 time thing. Also was surprised how Vincent helped out Mutta.
>> ARTICLE
Not a bad decision by the Chief to send Mutta to work on upgrading the buggy. Get the first person who has commercial auto designing experience to help with the inhouse vehicles and give him the opportunity to be a backup crew. Win win for both sides. I bet that mission would be for the parts to fix and upgrade the buggy or be sending a new one up there.

Gonna be interesting to see what Mutta's solution will be.

OMG! Ghostbusters! Harold (Ramis). (Dan) Akroyd. (Peter) Venkman. And I assume Winston. I was like "Harold looks like Egon... wait a minute!"

Alright, to someone who posted here... Never seen an episode in my life, of this show... Convince me to watch it... 
>> ARTICLE
Its a more mature (meaning no action at all, only talking) anime about  achieving your dreams and pursuing a path even when difficulties arise.

If you need an anime to cheer you up, chances are this will. It also has it's fair share of drama. Meanwhile it's not overly chessy at all, but of course it has it's japanese perks.

If you want to get into it, watch the first few episodes. Since you're likely to be spoiled already watch it at the very least until Mutta decides to become an astronaut again.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I know nothing besides generic plot... didn't read any spoilers... just looking for new shows, and not many can make it 70 episodes.... 
>> ARTICLE
well it's not really a spoiler since it's the main premise of the anime, but yeah the entire show is about Mutta and being an astronaut. If you are into space it does a very good job of portraying it, also because it's sponsored by JAXA (japanese space agency) as far as I know so there's a chance it will be airing for a while.
>> ARTICLE
And supported by NASA.

This is what I wrote about space brothers and bakuman at /r/animesuggest


I love these two anime for their animation and plot. They're realistic and long running which I love. They show the MC working hard towards their dream and overcoming obstacles and competing against rivals. No monsters, mecha, Gag, and nothing unrealistic. I want to watch a character grow up before my eyes through the good and bad times, i want it to bring me joy when something happens to the character, I want it to make me want to go on an anime marathon like how Bakuman made me do, and I want it to make me laugh and cringe at the romantic parts from happiness. Basically slice of life, comedy, Drama, and Romance. The animation has to be similar on the part where the characters don't have those giant puppy eyes(especially the males, but the females have come exceptions like in Toradora). Anyone have any suggestion?

Sorry for the long post, but I love these two anime because they have brought me so much joy, so I would love to watch something similar.

Edit: Drama

I might get downvoted into oblivion, but meh. This show has seen better episodes. Honest thoughts: I'm starting to get tired of Hibito and Olga's story. I can't wait for Hibito to get better and be done with this arc. 

Not that it's bad, but this show has always had a more or less slow pacing. And when what you're watching isn't really too exciting, you start to feel it. 

PS. I sure hope the creators aren't turning Hibito rabbit to Hibito (pedo) bear :P.
>> ARTICLE
What you need to do is do what I do - stop watching the show for a month or two, then come back to it and marathon the episodes you've missed.  The show's pacing is abysmal when watching on an episode-to-episode basis.  But when you're watching on a marathon-schedule (and can skip the recaps, op and eds, and episode previews), episodes go by in a flash and it's a lot more enjoyable show.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I like it when it's good. I personally think week by week is better. If you sit week by week through a slowly paced show, it's alright. I can lose my patience if I marathoned it. 

Plus this show pulls some pretty good cliffhangers sometimes. Usually you're really left waiting for next week, it's just this arc that I'm not enjoying too much.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's what I started to do so too. Early on the pacing perfect but now, its kinda lackluster 
>> ARTICLE
"That counted as a date?"

I hope not. 15 years is quite a large difference in age, especially with Olga only being 15.

Seems this could get real bad for Hibito. Here's hoping that him dressing up in different suits will help speed his recovery.

Wait, is Noragami not on there?
>> ARTICLE
Despite airing in 2014, it's part of the winter 2013 season. That probably has something to do with it
>> ARTICLE
Noragami was aired completely in 2014. Also, the way the split the seasons is (roughly): Winter Jan-Mar, Spring April-Jun, Summer July-Sep, and Fall Oct-Dec. The last season of the anime cycle is the fall season, winter is the first, so the winter 2013 season would actually be the season two years ago, not one year ago.

But your reasoning might make sense, maybe people forgot it was part of this year since it was so long ago.

Shit taste confirmed.  
>> ARTICLE
You mean great taste.
>> ARTICLE
No I don't.  
>> ARTICLE
Yes you do.
>> ARTICLE
there is a reason for this. the second season of log horizon especially in episodes 6 to 8 (when they where setting up the end of arcs because they did paralel arcs instead of going with the VN) where really lacking. And SAO is still a really easy anime to get into, even though in 2ch they arent new to anime there would be a part of them who would still vote for this anime, and even though i disliked SAO one thing i have to agree is that the animation is really good.

I really enjoy log horizon but this season wasnt as good as the previous and log never had really high rating to begin with
>> ARTICLE
Meh, they are both +/- for me.

I find SAO2 takes things too seriously, and LH doesn't take enough things seriously.  If LH stayed on track and focused on its lore and the MC got more screentime than those retarded female characters than the show would have been better.

Seriously, all the female characters of LH have the mentality of a 5 year old. Its like they're all competing for the Imouto title.

Season 2 especially has been pretty awful. There's been a couple of decent episodes here and there, but on the whole its just a snoozefest.

> There was more work put into that than my high school essays...

Ha, well I'll be linking to that nice debate for Chu2Ren probably forever. It demonstrates (from me) why Chu2Ren is actually perfect in execution and deserves the highest score attainable. :3
>> ARTICLE
Question, were you thinking that while watching it or only after trying to analyze the anime ? Basically I'm asking about your first impression. 
>> ARTICLE
> Basically I'm asking about your first impression.

Good question!

I remember re-watching the season multiple times while it was airing. At first, I was just floored that my favorite anime had received a sequel. I automatically gave it a 10 to go with Chu2Koi, because at the time, it was all about enjoyment with me. And since I was madly in-love with both seasons, they (understandably) earned that top spot.

So, months later, I see how people took the sequel, and basically it was a mixed reception. Either it was loved to death (me) or hated for "ruining" what the first started. I was perplexed, because "there's no way that people can hate what this one did!" I just chalked it up to people just not being as big of fans of the series as I was/am, and just accepted the fact that people had their differences about it.

Then, about six months ago, when I started to critically look at the shows I watch, I turned my attention to my favorites, aka Chu2Koi and Chu2Ren. And I began to look at and analyze what the seasons did. And while I'm still heavily subjective towards them (that will never change), I am able to easily provide logic/evidence/trains of thought for why the first/second season are executed perfectly, and did exactly what they set out to do.

Long story short: at first it was entirely enjoyment, but now with my newfound skills I can justify and provide reasoning as to why Chu2Koi and Chu2Ren are perfect! :3
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for taking the time to reply, you've convinced me to watch Chu2Ren. I'll get to it after I'm done with Mobile Suit Gundam 00 :)
>> ARTICLE
Woah, Ping Pong still ranks that high despite the very.... unique art. Don't get me wrong, I've watched it and enjoyed it very much but still, I expected the art to bring down its overall rating.
>> ARTICLE
Just so you know, the Japanese really love to make fun if it, but not in the same way as they did with Aku no Hana.

They love it, but a huge part of it is because they love to laugh at it while watching, and they make many streaming sessions to watch each episode together.
>> ARTICLE
I found the art to be one of its strongest points.
>> ARTICLE
I think he's talking about the fact that it's Japan. They're the type to buy large numbers of Infinite Stratos 2 DVD's and rank Glasslip high enough to get it on this list.

You haven't been here long, have you? Western fans and Eastern fans have had a rivalry with each other for at least a decade.

This over SoreSekai and Haikyuu!!?

>27.Gokukoku no Brynhildr

Shittiest list ive ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Weird that there is no Hunter x Hunter 2011. Space Brothers should be higher.

Hm. A few surprises in there. 

* Wake Up, Girls! being so high up. Even for an idol anime, it was fairly average.  
* Brynhildr being on the list at all, unless they're talking about the BD release rather than the broadcast version.  
* Space Brothers, Silver Spoon, and One Week Friends being in the 40s, as they were much much better than that.  
* An absent Hanamonogatari.

Not surprising at all:

* Yama no Susume 2, as the moe mountain climbers were absolutely amazing. If only CR had been able to maintain the license without interruption, it might have gotten better numbers outside of Japan.  
* Usagi higher than Hanayamata. While Usagi didn't exactly have a plot to mess up, Hanayamata was simply a gigantic mess at the end.  
* Nourin. Even though I couldn't get past the first episode, I can easily see why Japan would like it so much.
>> ARTICLE
> Wake Up, Girls! being so high up. Even for an idol anime, it was fairly average.

I disagree.

Wake Up, Girls! was unique in that it showed how hard the idol girls actually need to work to get even a tiny bit of recognition in such a volatile and aggressive industry. It showed the dark side of the industry and unlike most other idol shows the girls didn't suddenly get good. [finale](/s "even at the end they're not fully triumphant")

I liked this episode, but I honestly watch the show for Mutta's story. So having this episode, and seemingly the next one too, dedicated to somebody else is a bit boring. 

Rick is probably going to die. And then Pico and Vince went on to accomplish their dreams anyways. Something like that.

Anyways is good to see Vince's opinion towards Mutta improving slightly.
My guess is Vince is the cold person he is right now because of the incident that happened with Rick.

Still a good ep though. The show does give a lot of the characters good backstory and characterization if they are going to be popping up frequently

I'm surprised no one has pointed out the connection between this episode and **Red October**. Small town, Coal miners, and they were going to watch the ISS pass by (Sputnik from RO).

A little, so I can understand the general gist of things, but not in great detail.

Another great episode. Fuck Mr. Hibito though.

Yeah, I'd have preferred if it had been a one-off thing and there's the perfect opportunity coming up in the Russia arc for it to have been done.
>> ARTICLE
This show is so great.
>> ARTICLE
I don't like the fact that there exists a character who is capable of fortune telling. That just doesn't feel right, considering the realistic/scientific plot. The magical skills of Amanti are beginning to influence the story to much right now...
But it keeps being very interesting nonetheless.

What about the UFO?
>> ARTICLE
The UFO wasn't *magic*, it was *science fiction* \^\^
>> ARTICLE
It's a Japanese thing, they're very supersticious.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. The whole UFO thing is alright, because they were kids and there's room for doubt. It's just their inspiration. It'd have bothered me if there was a UFO on the moon, but it ended being that toy and that was great.

But having a character that can tell the future is annoying.

ALTHOUGH, I freaked out when she dropped the phone. Goddamn it. Still, the phone looks pretty damaged from constant falling, and Mutta is going to the hospital next episode according to the preview.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy feels are incoming. I wonder if it'll happen next episode.

I had a feeling it was Sharon, ah I don't wanna watch the next episode the feels.

[Cryptic(?) Answer](/s "It's something related Serika.")
>> ARTICLE
Probably the same as Serikas father had. Her being such a big fan is suspicious. The symptoms at the end matches it IIRC. Good way to give her more development. Most of the side-characters are to bland.
>> ARTICLE
GAH!

They had to end there, can't wait for next week.  Judging the preview there will be lots (**lots**) of flashbacks and little actual progress shown, but we'll know for sure (I hope) if Hibito passes this test.

I was starting to feel a little like Kenji's daughter (minus the flailing) about him not going into space and was about to be depressed for the rest of the day after this episode but Butlers words suggest that they'll go into space eventually, I didn't get if their zero gravity training was proof of that so I'm not feeling totally crushed about Mutta not going to the moon with Kenji.

I'll be happy to see how the training of Mutta and Vincent goes.

>> ARTICLE
30 minutes fly so fast with this anime. It is a bummer that they won't be won't be going to the moon together seeing as how this was their goal and how they built their friendship around it. I hope the author won't brush them out of the story. 
>> ARTICLE
One thing I can say about this author and without spoiling anything is that he really uses his characters well and even some characters you might have thought were throwaways might just reappear and play important roles.
>> ARTICLE
Such a shame this show doesn't attract as much viewers that I think it deserves.

["The Spacesuit is on our side"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9094QS-nrds)

Mutta sure knows the right thing to say, just pure joy when the music started kicking in.

That preview, I want to believe that it was edited like that on purpose to deceive us. Looks like next week is gonna be an emotional one for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Space Brothers is probably the best slice-of-life anime ever made. Even after 88 episodes I still look forward to the next one every time.
>> ARTICLE
I feel it's had a couple of times where the pacing felt glacial, but 95% of it has been fine and it's had some fantastic moments along the way.

Also it's had an incredible number of fantastic OPs and EDs.
>> ARTICLE
Man, this really looked like something I would enjoy when it first started airing, but I had a ton going on in life, so I decided I would wait till it finished and just marathon it... Little did I know it would last beyond the usual 26 episodes. At this point, is it worth the effort of going back and watching it?
>> ARTICLE
Definitely.

Definately. There's a couple of points where things slow down a bit but it is an excellent series. 

And slice of life series set in space are hard to come by!

Everything happened so fast this week. I was really enjoying the AsCan stuff and probably could have watched more of it, but it did feel like a very satisfying end to the Deneil arc. I'm so happy for Mutta, that shot of his portrait next to Hibito's was as heartwarming as I would have expected from this show.
>> ARTICLE
such a mutta photo 
>> ARTICLE
A little too fast, I haven't read the manga but does that mean that the show is ending this season?
>> ARTICLE
There is still quite a ways before it reaches the "current" raw chapter in Japan.  This episode was about chapter 129 in the manga, and the last raw chapter I have seen was 214.  There should be plenty of material for them to go a least another 30+ episode.

In case, anyone want to read the manga, it is scanlated up to chapter 140.

I cried. I'm a 23 year old dude and I cried when Mutta became an astronaut and when they were hanging up his picture.

This episode in a nutshell "If it was easy, it wouldn't be worth doing."
>> ARTICLE
I really wanted to like this series, I gave it 25 episodes and still sod all seemed to happen- and usually that doesn't bother me to much, but even the charterers seemed so dull and unengaging. Is anyone actually still watching this?
>> ARTICLE
yes, i find the characters the main point of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Of course! It makes me feel so moon when I watch it.
>> ARTICLE
It feels like the start recap gets longer every week and with the Hibbit bits in the end it leaves with so little of story to progress.  

Enjoyed this little flashback on Mutta previous work before he headbutted his boss. and the music towards the end when he finishes his explanation was fitting bad to bad the credits started to roll so soon denying us of enjoying the moment.

>> ARTICLE
I think Hibbit is here to stay for a while (they do say "See you next week.") I hope the recaps get shorter again though.

They were going on a good pace (each book took two or three episodes) in the beginning, but now that they are more than halfway through, they are getting slower. "It's a piece of cake" to Butler asking him to decide was a single book (#13), and now it's the middle of book 14. They're adding original scenes, too (most of the flying car stuff was new).

Book 22 is coming out in a few weeks, though. My guess is they want to stay enough behind the manga so they don't end up being like DBZ.
>> ARTICLE
Good to hear that there is plenty more material to cover, though I wonder for how long the manga is gonna keep running for.
>> ARTICLE
It's coming out every few months. I think the last one was in July?

I am honestly not sure how they can end it without disappointing everyone. If, say, a few books down the line, they decide to end it with the Nanbas going on a flight to the Moon or Mars together (assuming Hibito gets fixed), then I will want to see their mission and them coming back. And then there's the "what now" after they come back?

Uchuu Kyoudai is still the only thing I can watch (I tend to get bored easily on most stuff, not just anime; I prefer making stuff) which affects me emotionally at all. Started when I saw Ep 1.
>> ARTICLE
Really good episode, but wasn't the recap longer than usual? I hope they don't suddenly go Attack on Titan route.

Up to and including the events of this episode, yes. Though I still don't see anything spoiler-y within his comment.

One more very touching episode. But nothing to discuss as nothing unpredicted has happened.
>> ARTICLE
All those feels. This series has got to be in my Top 10 of all time.
>> ARTICLE
Man, this series can be so heavy hitting. I love of this series, so many great points to it.
>> ARTICLE
I feel so horrible. My feels went all over the place when Hibito nearly suffocated on the moon, now this. Ahhhh mou! 
>> ARTICLE
Nothing really unpredictable; just the continuation of last episode's events.

But still... So sad :(
>> ARTICLE
I kind of wonder what kind of story Deneil hides behind that merry exterior. We know basically nothing about his story at this point.
>> ARTICLE
indeed, but i'm hoping it will not be drama related like Pico's story was. Having another arc like that diminishes the impact when it happens so soon.
>> ARTICLE
Finally watched the Space Brothers live action today, feels pretty fitting since 44 yrs ago we walked on the surface of the moon.

On topic, this weeks episode was really heartwarming I really enjoyed seeing Mutta's determination show through his hardwork since all we've been seeing lately is him stumbling across obstacles.
>> ARTICLE
I am not sure why more people aren't watching this. This anime is simply amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Some people didn't like the slow pacing and some just don't find anything to discuss about it.Honestly I love this show, the issues they come across are believable and the emotions are so genuine.
>> ARTICLE
As somebody who loves the anime but usually doesn't discuss it, I agree. It's an amazing anime, but there are definitely more lurkers out there that just watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Hibito would make a great MC in Btoom, as often as he nearly die in a cliffhanger. It's also interessting to see how robust their spacesuit's are.
>> ARTICLE
While I really like the show and its quite realistic stories, I also feel they dropped the ball on this plot. [There's no way that NASA](/s "wouldn't have charted a safe route to wherever they were going. Coming across a known crevasse unexpectedly just would not happen")
>> ARTICLE
I thought the same way after they almost went off the first time. I mean, JAXA comes out and works on mapping out the crater afterwards, so how was all this area not already mapped out for dangerous areas before?
>> ARTICLE
Probably due to budget cuts. You may laugh, but you know it to be true.
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty apparent that the space industries have been greatly revitalized in this series in my opinion, considering they've already put people on the moon to make a base before the events in the series even occurred. If they have enough money to do that, they'd have plenty of funding to have decent navigation systems. 
>> ARTICLE
If you're talking about something like GPS, that could be more expensive than it's worth. Remember, the minimum number of satellites you need to get any location fix is 3, and I believe that you really want 4 or 5. For the earth, there are 4 satellites in each of 6 orbital planes, or 24 in total. While the moon is smaller, you would think you need less, but I'm not sure about that because of the requirement that you need to have line-of-sight on them. The earth system was designed so that you have this to about 6 satellites at any given time.

While it seems like the space program is adequately funded, it doesn't necessarily mean they have carte blanche. Having a GPS system for the moon might just not be cost-effective since you're only supporting a single moon base at the time.
>> ARTICLE
GPS isn't necessary. This is a small enough region that they're working with (as I recall) that two things on the surface would likely be fully sufficient. Regardless, there would still be more precautions in place, both technologically speaking and through the actions of the two themselves.
>> ARTICLE
I had a real problem with that in the last episode.  The stakes are just too high on the moon for them to say "hey we lost the signal on our automated rover, go find it."  Before sending them out, its likely they would know where is disappeared, what the probable issue was, and what the likely fix is.  There's no, by the way, grab the manual from under your seat and read for an hour about a super complex science rover so we can fix it.

There's also no way they wouldn't have maps and navigation systems for such a long journey away from the base.  We currently have satellites around Mars that help track where Curiosity is.  There would be at least that much when you have 6 highly skilled human lives (or even a single one) at stake.  Over all, its really made me feel like my intelligence and emotional investment in the series is being shit on.  The series hasn't thrown many curveballs lately but this is a real crappy way to do it.
>> ARTICLE
More important: 20+ years in the future, and Mooncar has no securitysystem like most modern cars?
>> ARTICLE
I was kind of bothered by how they fell at the start, since it looked a lot more like regular gravity on earth as opposed to a sixth of it. Scumbag cliffhangers, and the translated manga is only just catching up right now so I can't spoil myself.

My hair is turning gray because of this show. _ 

I'm sure Hibito will get rescued, right? He is a MC after all. The show is half named after him (Space Bros, not Space Bro). 

Oh god, the anxiety.

I'll be sad to see it end.

Wait what I thought it would be far longer going all the way till nanba makes it to the moon. Is there more manga. Another season?
>> ARTICLE
Manga is ongoing with 19 volumes at the moment. And until Nanba reaches anything in space, it would take years. As long as there is no greater timeskip, it's unlikly that they have the time to cover that. So like most series, they will put a decent open end, or something like that.
>> ARTICLE
I hope so too.

First of all, how did the regolith (which is as sharp as glass) not cut up their suits completely when they were sliding down at 15+ mph?! BUT OH MY GOD HIBITO YOU HAD ONE JOB.
>> ARTICLE
And later when he spots Damian after he shoots his flare, sliding down that hill towards him is pretty reckless of him.
>> ARTICLE
I think you can at least ignore part of it because their suits are 20+ years into the future, so maybe there have been vast improvements to it. 
>> ARTICLE
totally and completely agree with you, but still, its glass like. Who knows.

Such a damn cliffhanger!
>> ARTICLE
No kidding! This is one of the few times where I kind of regret not waiting for a series to finish before watching.

Those spoilers are looking very tempting. o_o
>> ARTICLE
From what I've read, the show is on volume 14(manga wise) while the manga is currently on 20.

I really want to read this as well.

Have you seen "Kids on the Slope"? 24 episodes of goodness.
>> ARTICLE
But it was 12....?
>> ARTICLE
I'm dumb, yes 12. -_-

I was suggesting SAO to someone yesterday and it must of been stuck on my mind still.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't see PTSD coming, but this is a big bummer.  Space Bros feels like a show that's trying to be kid-friendly, but it lays on the drama really thick sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
It's following the manga exactly. I was also very surprised when it came. I really want them to go to the moon together.
>> ARTICLE
No way, Mars or bust!
>> ARTICLE
Space Brothers Manga is seinen. But the Anime is now running for some months in the timeslot of detective conan. So i think the Kids-Friendly part, is more the anime which aims to families.
>> ARTICLE
Right, but it didn't start out in that timeslot.  The source material might be grimdark at times but I think the overall tone is positive, kid friendly, and aspirational.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so. The overall vibration is just positive and nerdy. It's the typical seinen which tells an honest story without getting stupidly bloody or fanservice-greedy. And overall it's not even really kid-friendly, besides that Hibbit-Shortstorys, but just the usual mature story.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't see it coming either, but for a different reason. I expected they'd address it right after the Moon arc, it made sense that he'd get some form of PTSD after that ordeal. But then they left it alone for so long I thought they deliberately chose to ignore it.
>> ARTICLE
Finally managed to catch up to this point, they sure know how to pull your heart strings first with Sharon and now foreshadowing Hibito's conditions. 

I didn't even realized until now that they added those little bunny shorts in the end.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how Hibito is gonna deal with this psychological problem of his. I wasn't expecting his near death experience to affect him like this. It's a realistic take.
>> ARTICLE
Well I guess suffocating on the Moon would cause on serious issues. 

Gah dammit 
>> ARTICLE
I never liked Hibito when I first started the show, I mostly hated his hair cut (still don't understand how his hair is that way, did the mother cheat?). But after he went to the moon I started to like him more and more. His heroic save to his fellow astronaut inside the hole solidified his place in my heart and now he's my favorite character. I hope he can pull through this, it might be Mutta who helps his brother overcome his struggles this time.

I also wanted to say hello to everyone. I started this show since early-June and I never thought I'd catch up to join you bastards in the discussions that I see on the front page every week, but I'm here! I feel like taking a peek at the manga lol.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking Gates, I want to slap him so bad.

Thankfully Hibito is pretty strong willed.  
The combination of seeing Hibito playing astronaut as a kid and during the testing was a nice touch.

I miss the previous ED which I watched each week and they brought back the [Hibbit shorts](http://cdn.awwni.me/mzh8.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
So that's why it was so short... But I missed the old ED too.
>> ARTICLE
Oh fuck, Mr. Hibbit is back. I hope that doesn't mean we're getting some recap episodes to stall for time soon.

It's really nice seeing Mutta and Hibito interact with each other more. Sometimes their story lines are so distant, but the brother dynamic is an interesting one. 


>> ARTICLE
How is this show so far?  I feel like I hit a brick wall at episode 42, and just lost all interest.  
>> ARTICLE
Still awesome, and still going strong. The story is steadily progressing for the most part.
>> ARTICLE
It's been riveting for me since episode 1. (Casting aside that recap episode that one time..)

Seeing all of the progress the characters make over time is what keeps me coming back. Either that, or I am just too invested to stop now. :P
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed the first episode. I'm hoping it doesn't screw up.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently there's a manga of it which I'm avoiding as there's apparently like 50 or so episodes planned, all of which must remain unspoiled. 
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know only 10 chapters have been scanlated so far, if you want to have a sneak peek it won't cause much harm.
>> ARTICLE
The first minute of it is pretty good, but then it just gets urgh.

I really like the ED though.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the ED was pretty generic to be honest. 

Maybe I'm the only in liking the OP?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the ED is pretty generic in a way. but I still enjoy it.

Like I said, the first minute of the OP is really good, but I dislike the last 30 seconds (chorus?).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah ED is nice but nothing new.

The chorus part can be weird I suppose. I feels nostalgic to me somehow the way it's done. For me it was the highlight but each to his own.

But damn this show looks quite promising, it's nice to have non moeblob shows. 
>> ARTICLE
This show does look promising, but it has a lot of episodes last time I heard. (somewhere around 45?) So lets hope it continues well.


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, large episode shows like this makes me happy. It's depressing how little anime I'm anticipating these days. 
>> ARTICLE
Can't get enough of realistic space setting anime ! I'll be watching this for sure !

I was barely aware of this show and intended to give it a shot at some point.  But after watching this OP here I immediately went out and hunted down the first episode for consumption.  I'm loving the show so far, so thanks!

Dang that was a sad episode. Hibito is off somewhere, hopefully to meet Olga sometime soon and get on his way into space. Poor Mutta not being able to express himself :(
>> ARTICLE
That ending was unexpected. I was way unprepared for a sad cliffhanger, this show usually leaves me on high spirits.
>> ARTICLE
I don't like Gates. But his arguments do kind of have a point.

Mutta is going to the moon, though, which is good. And Serika is in the next room. So...?

As for Hibito, the Russians wanted him back on his feet as well. (He did train with them to get rid of the panic disorder, after all.) He could go back there.

Or he might instead go back to Japan, and go up with Fukuda, who was working on a private manned rocket program. They are basically the in-world version of SpaceX, except less famous.
>> ARTICLE
Man that was a gut wrenching ending after the previous happy episode.

This is a roller coaster of emotions. ..
>> ARTICLE
This episode was just straight amazing. Watching the suffocation of Hibito was one of the most painful things I have ever seen in an anime, and i was never sure whether or not he would live. Might have to start reading the manga, because I am on the edge of my seat right now.
>> ARTICLE
I felt like i felt the same pain(figuratively) as Hibito and i felt like every second watching that episode, i felt like i couldn't breath.

If i may say, it was absolutely breath-taking watching it.

Couldn't fucking believe it.
>> ARTICLE
There was a thread here, a long time ago. About a live action Space Bros movie. It was a trailer for it, so I decided to watch it. The motherfucking thing spoiled so much. I was thinking "This trailer is going pretty quickly", as it told a lot of things that had just happened, and then I saw it-

Hibito falling down. I closed the tab as quickly as possible but unfortunately I saw it. And then, for months, I tried to forget it, but it was already printed into my mind - oh god, he's gonna die in an accident.

Then the accident happened. And he was still alive. And I was really happy. And then I thought -what if I misunderstood the trailer? What if, after knowing he'd die for months, he actually doesn't? 

THANKS GOD HE DIDN'T. MY MIND IS AT EASE.
>> ARTICLE
Good thing I never watched that trailer (or heard of it).
>> ARTICLE
I saw it too, it freaked me out for ages that I'd seen it. While I felt that he'd probably survive at first, I was a bit worried that we didn't see enough of him in the anime for quite a while, so I suddenly started feeling he might not make it after all.  It almost felt rather ballsy, now we know the series is continuing on after the year mark, to actually kill off Hibito.

But considering the renewed focus on him, plus the way he was saved with Brian 3, it actually was a way I could accept, because those were some awesome feels. :)
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how much time Kibito was without oxygen, I felt like he should have died the way the scene played out. But perhaps I'm overthinking it. I'm just glad he's alive. 
>> ARTICLE
Just when I thought that either Hibito had to die or the show would do something inconsistent as there was nothing they had shown every avenue of rescue failed "Brian" saved him. Words cannot convey how fond I am of this show. Well not within the character limit anyway.
>> ARTICLE
They had already told us they were sending brian out earlier. When azuma whispered into the commend dude's ear when they denied mutta's suggestion it was quite obvious that he was suggesting brian be sent there as back up.
>> ARTICLE
Ah. I missed the whisper, and thought that there was no way they could justify Brian being there without someone ordering ordering that Brian be sent to the point 20km away.
>> ARTICLE
The picture on the back of the Brian astronaut doll with him and his brother really got me.

I'm still a bit upset at Hibito wasting his oxygen like that. He could have saved minutes by just sitting down and slowing down his heart rate and controlling his breathing where Brian 3 would have showed up to save him too.

A good example and pretty extreme is from Planetes episode 20 where the group in training are subjected to a situation where the oxygen supply will run out before the training ends for the group.

But this way definitely got me on the edge of my seat even though I just felt like they couldn't have him die. Now will there be any damage to him for the lack of oxygen or will they overlook it. 

Also for last weeks episode 42. What Hibito did with the flare was genius to heat up the rocks to help heat up Damien.
>> ARTICLE
>I'm still a bit upset at Hibito wasting his oxygen like that. He could have saved minutes by just sitting down and slowing down his heart rate and controlling his breathing where Brian 3 would have showed up to save him too.

The thing is that Hibito couldn't have known that Brian 3 was coming to his direction in in the first place. He had no source of communication and other astronauts was not going to arrive in time to save hibito.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe not Brian 3, but he would have assumed his other crewmates are on his way which I think he did say it in one episode but at the time his oxygen supply wasn't enough for the time from the moon base to the crater.
>> ARTICLE
Sure he would have assumed they are on they way but they still would not have made it on time. It was already shown and explained...

Maybe Hibito shouldn't have ran when getting out of the crater, but still. 
>> ARTICLE
I like how they gave foreshadowing when mutta-kun said "he's going to come back like he was never in danger at all."
>> ARTICLE
I was so happy I was crying at the end.......that is all.
>> ARTICLE
Nail-biting episode for sure.  I still enjoy this show immensely but the past few episodes have kind of rubbed me the wrong way.  With the lack of preplanning before Hibito and Damien took the rover out, driving blind, and Hibito's lack of any attempt to slow his breathing and conserve oxygen.  But that's ok because apparently in this universe, humans use the same amount of oxygen whether they are running or at rest.  Maybe their lack of common knowledge and logic was on purpose to set up this episode.  Splitting resources between where they fell and the most probable exit point would be the smart thing to do but this series did so much dumb stuff in the past few episodes that it made me doubt that logic would prevail.
>> ARTICLE
I knew on some deeper level that Brian would make it in time and Hibito would live, but I was still actually really worried that they might not go that route. This show has been terrible for my nerves.

I can't express in words how much I love it, though.
>> ARTICLE
As a man I have shed tears for Clannad and Grave of the Fireflies, but this one hit home really hard. The connection they made with Brian and how he wanted him and his brother on the moon together made me think a lot about me and my little brother so much. But the final moments that got to me was when Hibito went through that excruciating pain all by himself but Brian and Mutta (He'll come back like nothing happened) were there for him all the way. I lost it when Hibito was desperately fighting to reach "Brian" the music, the emotion, just the whole damn scene itself was beautiful to me. No words can express how I feel right now. 
>> ARTICLE
Finally done with this arc, thanks god. Hoping next week is better. I love the show but this arc was killing me. I'm glad it's over.

Seems like we're finally past the whole Russia arc. Finally! Next episode looks to have some conflict, most likely with Hibito lying to Mutta about his condition.

Anyways, no funny quips or photos and stuff, on the count of the episode being super serious and all that. No real material to joke around with...
>> ARTICLE
This should be an interesting arc.

I miss the last ED.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, i wonder what happened to that T38 with a hole on it.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if it'll be related to when Hibito was his student.
>> ARTICLE
This is my line of thought as well. Probably in large part due to the craziness that is Deneil Young :D
>> ARTICLE
It was great to see the fellow Jaxa astronauts standing up for Mutta. :)
>> ARTICLE
But it still blows that the obvious americans are still relegated to playing the "badguys." 
>> ARTICLE
Deniel is just an all around awesome guy. Can't wait to see how things progress with him as Mutta's instructor.

This eps had me laughing out loud several times, really looking forward to this new story arc. :)

I think she was the best character, or at least the most interesting, character in Nagi no Asukara, and that in a show with rather interesting characters. She has a great design, relatable issues and really grows throughout the series as a character.

Girl is synonym for female.

Best Girl Character

Best Girl

>This is for the most developed/best written/best design/best overall girl character

Also that is completely subjective. Technically I would still be right. I love the word "best" because it easily allows for manipulation of the definition as there is no unbiased structure to determine what equals the "best". For example I could argue that the best written characters are the ones that make me want to sleep with them the most. The best you can do to counter that is state that you disagree, but either way we are both correct and both wrong as our criteria for "best" is different. 

Advantages of doing Extension English back in high school is that it teaches you to argue things like this as its one of the courses where there is no set right, just varying degrees of it. [No hard feelings.](http://i.imgur.com/fbmAXSd.jpg)

You are right. Reading the other responses the actual amount of new material in an episode and the pace this show goes does make it hard to discuss. 

Glad to see people are watching it still.

This show and Shirokuma Cafe are the best things to come out of this season. Still watching both avidly. (About to watch 19 right now.) UK feels like such a breath of fresh air compared to the more generic titles out there. 

I can see how the capsule arc can feel like it might potentially be starting to drag a bit, but it really seems like they're about to wrap that up anyway.

I really hope both those shows get a BluRay western release. (Along with freaking NichiJou)
>> ARTICLE
Shirokuma is one of the best things I've ever seen

Shirokuma Cafe is another one I really enjoy watching too.

Still watching it, it's good, nothing special but I've grown attached to the characters and the story is different from most anime.

I haven't seen 19 yet, but I'll get to it tomorrow, but it's wonderful.

Only real complaint so far is that the arc they're on feels like it's starting to drag at certain points, but then again there's some indication that they're almost ready to move onto the next thing.

I started to fall off the bandwagon, but marathoning about 4-5 saved up episodes was a lot of fun.  The slow pace of this show makes it hard to watch on a week-to-week basis (especially when there's really only ~18 or so minutes of new video a week), but strung together it's a pretty good story.

I feel like it has something that most animes don't these days, and that's characters with 3 dimensional personalities.  None of them are cliches really and all of them are unique.  I enjoy how they've given significant insight into the minds of a lot of the characters.  It's overall a very good series.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still watching it, chill series I watch while eating dinner. Good to have a series like this in my arsenal, not too many expectations and not too anxious to have it released every week.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still watching.  A few times I've thought of posting an episode thread, but for the most part there hasn't been much to say about those episodes... *here*.  The capsule has been good for character development but the overall topics that the capsule arc makes me think of (isolation, group dynamics, etc.) would probably fit better in a science subreddit.  The character development of just about *everyone* they've shown has been terrific, but there hasn't really been a *plot* to speak of since they were put into the box.

The handling of the green card plotline did add some flavoring to the current arc, [edited to put spoiler tag here](/s "but I wonder if the candidates shouldn't already suspect that JAXA would be screwing with them to see how they'd react, or if other people than just Mutta would actually know about their existence.")  It's also interesting culturally, to consider the desire for community harmony versus the desire to excel... and maybe not considering that JAXA wants people that are both good at what they do while also *not* having to worry about team-killing inside a can in space.

Also, as far as the show itself goes: Watching the capsule arc in its 20-minute bits each week does make it seem a bit... long.  I think I would be a bit perkier about it if I was watching it in a single 8-episode marathon.

Other bits:

* The movie came out a few months ago.  Ended up seeing a spoiler in a YouTube comment which makes me wonder whether the movie is another extreme compression of the manga or has a different plotline.

* For that matter, this is one of those weird instances where the manga, anime, and movie are all out together in a big pile.

* I actually saw copies of the manga itself while I was up in NYC.  But this time I recognized it. :)

Random: Are we ever going to see Team C ever again?
>> ARTICLE
I did not know they made a live action movie. I took a quick look at the trailer trying not to spoil anything and I gotta say how quick the plot goes is expected. That brings up the question as a few others have asked, many episodes are they planning to do?

[The Gr...](/s "The green cards. I am sure some of the candidates would have expected something to happen during this part of trial stage, but to find out how it would be executed they never considered it.")

I feel like Team C failed. There will always be a team or an individual that can't take it anymore. If you have ever seen Futatsu no Spica, their plan to weed out people in this similar trial was pretty extreme.
>> ARTICLE
I've been waiting for it to wrap up so I can watch the whole thing in a marathon.  I was watching it on Crunchyroll, saw the first 4-5 episodes, liked it enough that I decided it was a keeper then and there.

However, what i'm reading here seems to suggest it's not as simple as a 12 or 24 episode run.  If I wait for it to end I could be waiting quite a long time.  Should I just catch up and keep up?

And what's this about a movie....?
>> ARTICLE
Stared watching it, but gave up around episode 3.
>> ARTICLE
I put it on hold around episode 13: sounds stupid but this is the first anime I've held because I can't stand the gap between episodes, so I'm waiting until it's aired and I'll finish in one sitting.

I took a break when they started the "capsule" training. I felt a bit too much like Akagi so I'm saving up some episode to avoid annoying cliffhangers.

I watched both, and Space Bros' capsule training is NOTHING like Akagi's. I have no clue how you related the two aside from the superficial capsule thing.

to be honest i really want to like the anime but i just prefer this in its manga format. i might wait for it to finish and then marathon it.

They always end episodes with such good cliffhangers. I can't wait for next season.

I was a bit surprised that Hibito talked about his disorder. I didn't think he was going to tell her. But I guess they just have a really good and open relationship, fills my heart with warmth :)

I forgot his name, but I wonder just how right the guy who said that putting more pressure onto Hibito could help him. I don't know much about PTSD and how much willpower affects the patience's chance of recovery.

I mean, Hibito wanting to treat himself is important. But I wonder if willpower alone can cure you of a trauma.
>> ARTICLE
Frankly, Mutta is going to learn about it, and I don't think he'll know how to help. Hibito might be stuck with the disorder.
>> ARTICLE
> Hibito might be stuck with the disorder.

I doubt that, because that'd just be depressing to watch. I'm sure this show will find a way...
>> ARTICLE
Why can't they just put regolith in the buggy to make it heavier?
>> ARTICLE
Considering that regolith is sharp, I can see many issues with using regolith as a weight. Also 50 kg would be 300 kg of earth. How much space is taken up by 660 pounds of dirt?
>> ARTICLE
I can see space being an issue, but sharpness shouldn't be. They had those regolith sprayer things to cover the habitat, didn't they? The astronauts wouldn't need to touch any of it.
>> ARTICLE
How would you contain it from the constant shifting, though? I still think that the volume of the regolith required far outweigh its advantages. (No pun intended.)

Not much seemed to happen, but I really like how Hibito is improving.

It takes time off the actual show (if you ignore OP and ED), so you have less frames to animate. You'll notice this in *loads* of anime filled with action sequences (especially Shounen), but the odd recap actually is kinda nice if you haven't watched the show in a while. Even if it is such an obvious way of saving the budget.

Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

Good to know. [Those liars at MAL!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)
>> ARTICLE
How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.
>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.

Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.

Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.

Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good

Holy shit.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

IIRC it was at 8.70~ after it ended. It dropped only by a little bit.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

They're not cannon but they still count as much as the Steins;Gate movie counts :/ unfortunately

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

Seriously? I don't want to say it's overrated especially after seeing the thread earlier about calling something overrated but come on. If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people. Maybe I just don't see it but can someone please tell me what is so good about this show cause I rated it a 7(and I think this may be overdoing it)and that is mainly due to the animation. The jokes can only be funny for so long and I didn't even find them that funny in the first place.
>One Punch Man | 9.02 | 12 Eps | 2015
>> ARTICLE
OPM is a really good show. But no way it should ever be above Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people don't agree with you on this as seen by the rank. It's not worth complaining over because you personally dislike it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not blankly complaining. I actually want to know what it is that makes people go nuts over the show and want to have pseudo discussion.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why people like game of thrones but i'm not just going to complain about its imdb rank am i?
>> ARTICLE
So this is clearly going over your head. I said I want to hear what other people are saying as to why it's so good. Do you not want to hear people's reasoning for their differing opinions?
>> ARTICLE
Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol
>> ARTICLE
It bothers me cause I have a friend that during the entire Fall season only talked about OPM and it was starting to piss me off.
>> ARTICLE
Lol, u prob wanted to stay off of /r/anime during the entire fall season then.
>> ARTICLE
the guy probably wanted you to get the same enjoyment he experienced, I dont think he meant any harm. 

I think anyone would be pissed off if they experienced what you did with any show, not just OPM.
>> ARTICLE
I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.
>> ARTICLE
recommend a show of yours he hasnt watched, if he likes something you like, youll solve that problem lol.
>> ARTICLE
It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.

True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.

>> ARTICLE
I don't know how or why this trend of being obsessed with female characters started (okay, I guess I can have a small idea given the main demographic of this subreddit and the anime community in general), but to be honest I find the VAST majority of the best anime characters to be males, so it's a bit sad when they are overshadowed due to shallowness.
>> ARTICLE
Part of it might be because a good amount of male MCs are boring, generic self-inserts or the occasional whiny Shinji-type. Of course they're not all like that, but I'm sure this also contributes in some way.
>> ARTICLE
Most popular shows have many more female characters than male (SAO, Akame Ga Kill, Steins; Gate, and the entire 'harem' genre come to mind) so theres  significantly more competition in the female character bracket.

Edit: After I posted this I started thinking of all the immensely popular shows with predominantly male casts, so allow me to modify my statement: Most shows which are popular *on this sub* have more female characters than male.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is that it's usually the females that are the "gimmick" or more unique in those series. There are simply more fun female archetypes that they are willing to play around with compared to male archetypes.

I found it touching seeing the aspects of having a family compared with that of Mutta. Not much happened per se but ending on them finding out they were competitors was nice.

Honestly, I have a feeling that Mutta is going to be the good guy and let [Kenji] (/s "go to the moon. I think showing flashbacks in this episode, featuring Kenji and his family's struggle, kinda cemented that speculation.")

Sure, he wants to fulfill Sharon's wish, but we all know Mutta is a good dude due to his past actions (you'd have to watch the series to find out). Of course, in the end it's all up to NASA for the final decision...

Anyways, from the sound of the preview, there will probably be a grace period of deep inner monologues and an eventual confrontation (maybe even some more flashbacks), leading to a satisfying and heartwarming conclusion, haha!
