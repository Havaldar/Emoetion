It looks real simple. You can probably easily replicate it from what they tell you in the episode.

Quarter/half potatoes (just to speed up cooking time, you can leave them whole if you're really lazy), steam until soft. It doesn't seem like Souma peels the potatoes, so you don't gotta if you don't wanna. Mash the potatoes in your preferred method. Don't make mashed potatoes btw, just mash them. It seems Souma mashes it so they're nice and chunky, but still moldable.

Finely dice both a white onion and some mushrooms (specifically eringi, but any should work if you can't quickly find one). Mix and lightly caramelize the onions with the mushrooms in a pan. 

Mix everything you have so far together, and lightly season with salt. Shape it into a shape that can be easily wrapped with bacon. Then wrap it with bacon.

Truss with twine if you wanna depending on the structure integrety of the whole thing. Sneak in some rosemary inbetween the twine. Alternatively, if you're not twining it, putting it on a bed of rosemary should provide similar results. Bake until bacon's nice and crispy (usually something like 350F for 20 minutes?).

The sauce looks to be just a reduction. I imagine one half red-wine, another half sweet sake. Season with soy sauce, add butter for glossy luxuriousness. Reduce to preferred consistency. If you lack sweet sake, omitting both sweet sake and soy sauce should be fine. Alternatively, you can probably maybe substitute it with sweet vermouth. Something like 1/4th vermouth 3/4th red wine should be fine. Either way, the sauce will taste quite a bit different, and you should add some salt to replace the soy sauce.

Remove the roast from the oven, remove the twine, dress with sauce. You should probably cut it into reasonable portions prior to dressing though. Garnish with watercress.

No exact measurements, but it shouldn't be too hard to eyeball. 1/4 mixture of equal amounts onion+mushroom per mashed potatoes seems about right to me.

Also minor warning for Americans. I'm not too aware of Japan's standard style of bacon, but in America it's fairly hard to find unsmoked and unglazed bacon outside of butcher shops. I think it's safe to imagine that if you're using bacon found in typical American grocery stores, the end result will end up being a lot sweeter than it should be. So, potentially cut back on the sauce.

Edit: Clarified on mushrooms+onions, mashing potatoes, and added sauce alternatives.
>> ARTICLE
> The sauce looks to be just a reduction

What's that?
>> ARTICLE
A term for boiling a sauce until most of the water is evaporated. More concentrated, rich flavor. 
>> ARTICLE
When do you stop boiling the sauce? Is there a certain texture/colour to aim for? Or a certain amount of time?
>> ARTICLE
It varies depending on the sauce and what you're putting it on. Honestly the best way to learn reductions is trial and error because you can do them quickly and messing up will almost never ruin a dish.
>> ARTICLE
Can you use any red wine or is there specific cooking red wine?
>> ARTICLE
The rule of thumb when cooking with alcohol:

Don't cook with what you wouldn't drink.
>> ARTICLE
...i dunno I wouldn't drink single barrel jack daniels, but it is really good in a marinade 
>> ARTICLE
Plain red wine is ideal for sauces. I've only used specific wines for gravy, but my cousin (who's the best cook I know) insists that you also need to be super picky about wines when you're using it to make gravy.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest... "when you're satisfied." Generally when it's 1/4 of the original volume or so, depends on how much seasoning you have and what you stick in it.

A reduction is usually not that thick, so it's really based on how much flavor you want. 
>> ARTICLE
A reduction's a basic cooking technique, primarily used on initially loose sauces, but it can be on a variety of other things. It's probably called something else in those cases though.

Essentially, by simmering a loose/wet thing for an amount of time, you're *reducing* the water/alcoholic content via steam or whatever. The less water there is, the more thick it'll become.

Edit: Also more rich and concentrated flavor due to less dilution through water.
>> ARTICLE
For unsmoked unseasoned bacon you can go to a Korean grocery store (H-mart) if you have one nearby. 
>> ARTICLE
You can get plain bacon at most grocery stores (at least where I live). I actually ended up trying this recipe when I read the manga a couple weeks ago. Here are a few things I learned:


1. Only add a little bit of butter to the mashed potatoes. They'll absorb quite a bit of fat/juices from the bacon.

2. The mushrooms have to be finely diced/cut or else it will have a weird consistency

3. Make sure you have enough bacon to wrap the whole thing. I underestimated how big it would be and had to defrost another pack.
>> ARTICLE
What was the taste? And did you take pics? 
>> ARTICLE
It was pretty good for a potato dish, but I'm not a huge fan of potatoes to begin with. My only major mistake was that I used too much soy sauce in the sauce and it clashed with the bacon a little too much (both are salty, but they have pretty distinct flavors).

I usually just eat food after I make it, but I might do some of the recipes from the show and take pictures. The finished product didn't look as good when I tried it because the bacon collapsed a little while it was in the oven and it's pretty greasy.

to go against what they're saying. 

**I had no background** into this series and honestly the fan service was wayyy too much. Gonna give it a few more eps to see if that was just a way to rope in viewers but if every ep is like that I don't think I could commit.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm a huuuuuge fan of the manga but to me it felt like they rushed the cooking scenes (they were literally sped up) and stretched the ~~orgasms~~ foodgasms a bit too much! It was simply awkward watching the whole thing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a gay man that really doesn't care for fan service. But this fan service was just so over the top that it has fallen right back into the "This is fucking hilarious and I love it" stage. I was dying with laughter that whole episode!
>> ARTICLE
I think you came in with the right attitude. It's kind of like Kill la Kill with more food and less clothes.

Edit: and better writing.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone keeps saying how good it is despite the *plot* that ain't my kinda plot. I'll give it a try later maybe, but initially I'm just as apprehensive as u are. 
>> ARTICLE
The actual plot is standard coming of age. But still *very good* in a sense that the characters are maturing hard into professional chefs. I don't think the anime will fully covers it. Also, there's a lot of technical stuffs that goes into the cooking too.

The other *plot* though is just what make Shokugeki no Souma as what it is. They kinda both go hand in hand to make it more interesting. This combination made the series more grandeur and "fresh", instead of a snoozefest coming-of-age story you can just find in any other medium.
>> ARTICLE
From someone who has read the manga: you may want to give it the old 4 episode try. Manga is great and this first episode indicates that the anime could be a great adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
Like others have said, give this a 3 episode try, please. Obviously everyone is commenting on the ecchi and that's all fine, but just know that if you dont care about ecchi, the plot and character progression is actually really good, and it would be a shame to not give it a try just because of that. It's not one of those shows that has nothing but fanservice; it's got everything PLUS fanservice, if that makes sense.

It's great, watch it. Both the plot and the plot are actually really good (based on the manga and the adaptation quality of the first episode).

As a huge fan of the manga, I am really satisfied. In addition to fine performances and good animation that lives up to the original (hentai) art really well, the best part is how JC Staff is making it even *more* over the top. The cheesy shots (focusing on the eyes, slow motion, super fast hand movements, and dutch angles) don't detract from the show at all; rather, they make you enjoy it even more without inflicting stupidity on the anime. The bombastic music really sweetens the deal, giving off a setting of epic proportions.

But as we all know, Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking anime.

Can't wait for more. If you like the manga, definitely watch. If you haven't read it, give both a try.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, I'm so immensely satisfied as fan of the manga. It put a hugeeee smile on my face, and I've been worried about this since they announced it was getting an anime!

The ending and opening too are pretty awesome, I couldn't help but laugh at Isshiki in the ending and the little bit with Megumi,Soma, Takumi and Isami at the very end of the opening made me chuckle. Also, dat smile in the ending.

Surprising I don't mind Yoshitsugu as Soma, but I'm really waiting for a few scenes until I'm completely sure.[spoils](/s "Like him challenging Shinomiya to reverse Megumi's expulsion. That'll be fun!")

Great episode, but the thing that annoyed me was they messed up his catchphrase from the manga, I don't know if it was a translator mess up or they just didn't include it.
>> ARTICLE
Translator error. 
>> ARTICLE
What is it, or what was it...
>> ARTICLE
His catchphrase in the the manga is "it wasn't much".  It was changed to "I hope you liked it".
>> ARTICLE
"It wasn't much" is probably a more used phase in Japan, I thing in English it would be something like "it was nothing". They can't just translate word for word or else it won't make sense but yeah "hope you like it" is no good, it's missing the cockyness (if that's a word)...
>> ARTICLE
i really dont like that translation its his typical catchphrase which he uses after he destroyed his enemy in a cooking battle to show his superiority. Its similar to Prince of Tennis echizen "mada mada dane" 
>> ARTICLE
How would you translate it or which phase would you use..
>> ARTICLE
wait i'm lost,

is it just a translation error because of the sub groups? Or did they literally change what he said in Japanese? 
>> ARTICLE
> catch

He said  (, o-somatsu) after having "killed" the land sharks. It literally means something like "It is low-grade" or "It is crude", or more colloquially "it is lousy". In actuality, it is used as an expression of humility. For example, when one gives a gift and someone says "thank you" (arigatou gozaimasu), one often responds "ieh, somatsu na mono desu". That means "No, it's just a low-grade/poor quality thing". If someone gives one a compliment or thanks one in Japanese, one always negates that compliment. The translators rendered this "o-somatsu" as "hoped you liked it", which is totally wrong, and ignores the subtext. "somatsu" always implies that the thing being referred to is poorly made, making it particularly ironic in this case, when combined with Souma's smug face.

The intrigue of the phrase also comes from the fact that the first part of "somatsu" sounds very similar similar to "Souma", which is his name. It could be compared to something like "You've been Souma'd".
>> ARTICLE
I never thought about looking up the raws for his catchphrase, but I always imagined it to be "", so I was disappointed that wasn't the case. But this explanation makes me feel better. 
>> ARTICLE
> "It is low-grade" or "It is crude", or more colloquially "it is lousy".etc

So what English phase would you use cuz all those really aren't used or have any colloquial meaning for English speakers. that's why I was saying some like "it was nothing" or "don't mention it" would work even though it's not a word for word translation but it is a well know phase conveying the same meaning...

Also Shonen jump uses "Happy to serve" so there's that..




>> ARTICLE
"It was nothing" or "don't mention it" are not comparable, because they don't get the nuance of the phrase. There are ways to say "it was nothing" in Japanese, and this isn't it. "Somatsu" implies shoddy workmanship, which is particularly relevant in this place. Translating it into English will never do this phrase justice, as it is very uniquely Japanese. If I had to try, I'd say the best possible translation is "It was nothing special".  
>> ARTICLE
This is why you never watch a show you haven't seen before in the living room when there are people around.

## Episode 1 Manga to Anime Comparison.

**Note**: I will be linking images from the manga, but I may crop some frames out for various scenes (like some of the foodgasms, for instance).  

**A Typical Day at Yukihara** - Adapted


* **Father vs. Son** -  The adaptation begins with Yukihira Souma eating a rather ~~disgusting~~ unique dish of squid with peanut butter.  It's so terrible he wants to laugh.  After making such an abomination of a dish, Souma's dad calls out to him informing that his friends have arrived at the restaurant.  He makes his way in and immediately begins another cooking competition with his dad.  This time around, the childhood friend Kurase Mayumi is judging their fried rice dishes.  She tries both of the dishes, and then after a few moments go by, she picked Souma's dad's dish; hence, making him the winner.  [His dad teases him about it being almost the 500th loss he dealt him,](http://i.imgur.com/zdhFQHS.jpg) [while Souma angrily replies it was the 489th time.](http://i.imgur.com/uazGgi1.jpg)

* **Being a childhood friend is suffering** - Kurase goes on to try to cheer up Souma after his loss, by telling him that his fried rice dish was very delicious.  However, Souma has other plans and asks Kurase if she wanted to try his new dish and she innocently agreed to it.  After learning it was squid with peanut butter, she tried to get away but Souma wouldn't let her.  After having squid with peanut butter shoved in her face, [she had a foodgasm (but not the good kind).](http://gfycat.com/ComfortableSecretAfricanjacana) [(Manga Version)](http://i.imgur.com/xItxaTm.jpg)

* **Cooking is an Endless Wilderness...** - After the foodgasm, Souma says how he wants to see what's beyond the horizon of the endless wilderness that is cooking (which consists of things that taste good and bad), to which one of his fellow friend/classmate tells him to shut up while tending to the incapacitated Kurase.  A couple other classmates said amongst themselves that if Souma wasn't always so happy about feeding people his failures for dishes, he'd become a pretty decent chef.  At this point, Souma's father then remarked about how bad his sardines with strawberry jam was, to which Souma agreed but insisted that his squid with peanut butter was worse.  As the father/son duo got into an argument about who's was worse, those same two classmates were pretty much like, "Ah...like father, like son".

**Unruly Customers** - Adapted

* **The Land Sharks Arrive** - We then jump to night time, where Yukihira was pretty much done with business for the day.  Souma's dad then asked him to put out the fire from the shichirin while Souma was thinking about how he could have done better with cooking his fried rice dish from the competition earlier that day.  He then goes on to think to himself that he'll graduate from middle school and then focus more on cooking, in hopes of one day surpassing his day and taking over Yukihira.  At this point, a group of people enter the shop, led by a female who introduces herself as Minegasaki, an urban life planner.  Souma asks her what she wanted to order, but then tells him that she's there to talk about what the apartment they wanted to build in their area.  Souma then remarks about how they're the land sharks that wanted them out, and then tells them that they weren't going to close Yukihira.  She then gave Souma her business card and makes a remark about how tough it is for smaller business to maintain stock, to which Souma said that their restaurant doesn't have such problems and how they take responsibility for giving the customers what they want.  She then asks if he'd take responsibility if he couldn't serve a dish that the client wanted, to which Souma then said that when that happens, they'll close the shop (while burning her business card).  She then says that a man doesn't go back on his word, and leaves the restaurant while thinking about something.

* **Who Did Such a Thing?!** - After school the next day, Souma heads home and gets a phone call from his dad, who tells him that he closed the shop for a day because he's out on some business and will be back the next day.  His dad also asks him what his plans were for after middle school, to which Souma says that he plans to practice cooking at the shop.  His dad said "I see..." and then hangs up.  After wondering what that was about, Souma continued to head back to Yukihira.  Upon entering the shop, [he was shocked to see that all the meat in the restaurant was destroyed.](http://i.imgur.com/FBsfJgZ.png) He first thinks that a thief could have destroyed all of the meat, but then realized no thieves would do that.  He then ran to the front of the shop to find that the Yukihira awning was vandalized.  At this point, the land shark from the previous day shows up.  After making remarks about how the shop looked better now that the annoying sign was covered up, she then said how she wanted to have a meat dish.  The other land sharks with her started sneering Souma, saying "Oh, it can't be? You can't do it ? Your client wants meat, you know."  Minegasaki then continues the act by saying how Souma had promised her that he'd close the restaurant if he couldn't serve the client what they wanted.

* **Challenge Accepted** - Souma is not amused by what's going on; after inhaling deeply, he asked if that is all she wanted to order, much to her surprise.  [He then said that if he made a dish that satisfied her, she would swear never to target his restaurant again.](http://i.imgur.com/BCgY57b.png)  She then asks her subordinate if he really did destroy the meat as planned, to which he said he did. With this, she then wonders what kind of dish he plans to make.

* **Roast Pork (Just Kidding)** - Souma proceeds to make a dish that consists of potatoes wrapped in bacon.  They're surprised that he's able to make such a dish, to which Souma says how he used said potatoes and back to make a dish he calls ["Roast Pork, Just Kidding".](http://i.imgur.com/d1kXkWQ.png)  Minegasaki then gets angry and asks if he's messing with her because she had asked for a meat dish.  She further insists that there's no room for negotiations and to close the shop, while going on about how this shop is a failure and shouldn't exist.  Souma at this point has had enough of it and slams the dish down on the table.  He then says that she can tell him if Yukihira is worthy or not only after eating the dish.  She proceeds to try the dish and shows that she enjoyed it through her body actions.  Yukihira then taunts her about it, after which he goes into detail about how he made the dish and how he thought of it after a mistake he had made in making a previous dish.  She asks why it matters since it's not a meat dish, but her body still wants to eat more of it.  As she goes to take another bite, Souma swipes the plate away and tells her to swear that she won't target the restaurant ever again if she wants to eat more.  She then says who would do that, to which Souma said that's too bad and then prepares to dispose the dish.  At the last second, she cries out and says that she'll swear to never target them again, and [that she wanted to have more.](http://i.imgur.com/0PSzZLv.png)  At this point, foodgasm #2 takes place.  It was rather long in the anime (and cracked me up, btw), but the manga version was only [two](http://i.imgur.com/VsUNzau.png) [pages.](http://i.imgur.com/gzT0UZC.png) After the foodgasm, Souma said his catch phrase "It wasn't much" while the land sharks are passed out from food ecstasy on the floor.

**Dad Has Other Plans** - Adapted

* **I'm Closing Shop for *Only* Two or Three...Years** - The day after, Souma's dad returns home to see Souma cleaning the awning that the land sharks vandalized the other day.  While Souma thinks to himself how he plans to work on his cooking at Yukihira, his dad catches him off guard by saying how [he's going to close the restaurant for two or three years.](http://i.imgur.com/Pu7tlXb.png) His dad then goes on to say that an old friend of his wants to work together and how he needs to apologize to the regulars for closing the shop.  Souma is pretty upset about this and as he was saying how he wanted to always be in this shop and to surpass his old man, his dad gives him a tap the chest with his fist and tells Souma that now it's time for him to go out and measure his abilities [(in a very shounen-esque way).](http://i.imgur.com/FqLGCUS.png)

* **This Cooking School Isn't What I Imagined It To Be Like** - A few days later, we see Souma walking towards Tootsuki Academy.  On his way there, says how paying to learn how to cook is stupid.  Furthermore, he imagines that the classes are taught by old, frail men...but then gets a rude awakening when he reaches the campus.  He sees students crying about how they failed their promotion exam and how their lives are over.  He then sees an older man begging a guard to withdraw his son's drop out if he gave a 10 or 20 million yen donation.  He then calls his dad, and his dad said that Tootsuki was one of the best culinary schools in Japan, and that it was a super elite school where less than 10% of the students graduate [(page from manga).](http://i.imgur.com/sbT9bu3.png)  Souma stood there in shock after hearing this.  (We will hear the rest of their phone conversation in next week's episode.)

* **Who's this Beauty?** - The ~~foodgasm~~ scene of her standing under a waterfall and then getting hit on the head by a jukebox because the soup she tasted was so bad [came from the *one-shot*](http://i.imgur.com/pcbKoyU.png) (thanks /u/ProfBamboo for pointing that out).  The analogy she used in the serialization was actually in response to a horrible fettuccine dish (not a soup dish; another soup analogy will be for next episode): "it was as if -- while walking in the quite country, 50,000 swimming crabs crossed by, that kind of flavor!"  She then went on to saying how she couldn't even laugh because the dish was so terrible [(page from manga).](http://i.imgur.com/03UhyJ1.png) We will learn her identity next episode, which will be rather "fun"...hehehehehe.

---

Next week's episode will probably start with the few pages that weren't covered in Chapter 1, and then move on to Chapter 2 ("God's Tongue"), which will pretty much cover the entrance exam to the school.  It's understandable that the first episode only covered the first chapter of the manga since it was pretty long (54 pages), but I'm thinking we'll be getting around 2 chapters per episode from this point forward (hopefully).  Unfortunately, [best girl](/s "Tadokoro Megumi") won't be introduced for another episode or two.

Anyway, thanks for reading my post this week. I hope you're looking forward to next week's episode as much as I am!

How this anime essentially got onto my watch list.

Me after a 4 show anime marathoning:  Finally these series are over, time to take a break.

Little sister:  /u/Daishomaru, why don't you watch this show?

Me:  I just got back from a 4-show anime watching anime spree.  

Little sister: I know you will love this show.

Me:  Dafuq is this?

Some time later:

Me: Okay, I take back what I said.  best.  thing.  Ever.

Me 30 seconds later. (I Dunno, It's just exaggeration)

Me:  I think I will need to watch this in the dark.  With tissues.   And alone.

Me some time later

Me: I never watched anything so dramatic about food since the days of Iron Chef Japan.  It's a keeper. 



>> ARTICLE
I guess I'm a bit late to the party but I made [a whole bunch of gifs](https://imgur.com/a/YvFqp) of this episode. Some of them turned out really big so maybe I should finally invest some time and figure out how this whole gfycat and webm thing works.

And btw the food looks so much more tasty than in Koufuku Graffiti and I'm really hungry now.
>> ARTICLE
The foodgasms, the *plot*, the animation. This anime is ridiculous and I love it.
>> ARTICLE
This was...

[I](http://i.imgur.com/JA0QD7M.jpg) can't [believe](http://i.imgur.com/A6kqTxG.jpg) how [lewd](http://i.imgur.com/pKGEdeU.jpg) this [became!](http://i.imgur.com/Gbtd7YN.jpg) I [was](http://i.imgur.com/RL0OM1Q.jpg) expecting [a](http://i.imgur.com/bZ2rJDQ.jpg) happy-[go](http://i.imgur.com/YnCqxeh.jpg)-lucky cooking school!

I fucking loved it though, I had no idea what to expect and what I was given was a whole lot more then I had been.
>> ARTICLE
What did I just watch....
>> ARTICLE
***MEAT JUICES***
>> ARTICLE
I really can't watch this anime with other people around..
>> ARTICLE
I'd give her meat juice, if you catch my drift. 

Also we get pseudo tentacle rape in the first 5 minutes, something I wasn't really expecting from this show.  
>> ARTICLE
Wow this is impressive so far. I'm honestly blown away with the soundtrack and the presentation of food. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep it's exactly what I wanted beautiful art, great music, action behind the cooking. I am so happy Soma if finally here.
>> ARTICLE
OMG YES!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait to get home to watch this shit!
>> ARTICLE
This was a great first episode! Oh man.. Can not wait to see him take the test!
>> ARTICLE
Been waiting awhile for this show to start up. Really excited, the manga is great and for the people just discovering it, don't let the tentacle "foodgasms" hinder your view on this show. It is the epitome of a shounen food show that proves itself to be an amazing watch.
>> ARTICLE
This is looking great so far animated, can't wait for next ep :3

I was expecting it to be good, but JC Staff really did a great job. Can't wait to see more of the cast next week!

The long awaited foodgasms have come to anime! :)

I studied his manga art for educational reasons and i recommend other artists do the same...

ooo this show gonna be good I can just smell it!

God I am hungry, can't cook for shit so ordering a pizza.

Holy crap the animation was incredible, the characters are likeable and the script is golden. So far so good and will defiantly recommend this to my friend's.

Even re-reading the manga did not prepare me for this anime, my god..

[Man, this is anime is going to be HYPE!](http://puu.sh/h0ApS/5e7e497e68.webm)

Thank the lord I watched this with no one around. 
>> ARTICLE
The setting sounds like a lot of fun, the voice actors are all doing great, the animation is unbelievable and the attention to the food's detail is amazing!

If this wasn't ecchi shit, I'd be totally on board for this show!
>> ARTICLE
Idk I get that he wanted to prove a point, but trashing the whole place was obviously their act of vandalism and the logical thing to do would be to have them arrested for it. 

Also, not knowing the manga, I expected the whole show to be a slice of life taking place at the restaurant. Got surprised when it seemed to be moving to a school. Looks like that's where he'll be meeting the other main characters.

No opinion on the food orgasms, I don't think I get them quite yet.
>> ARTICLE
I don't even have words to express what i'm feeling right now...
>> ARTICLE
Just started watching the series expecting a fanservice bombarded cooking show with an over the top reaction to food taste - and I was right. But there is enough content and the exposition of how a particular meal was prepared is so good that I'll actually add this to my weekly shows now.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic. I loved just about every moment of this episode, can't wait for more.
>> ARTICLE
J.C. Staff is really going all out for this anime, it was really good (espacially the OST  & Foodgasm<3)

Preview EP2:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_NX-5ZRHEU
>> ARTICLE
They're really going out this season in general. DanMachi was equally as impressive in terms of art and animation. I don't really know how they're going to pull through with this quality week after week for two shows, but I'm having my fingers crossed!
>> ARTICLE
So this is a show.

I think that just... that just wasn't quite the episode I wanted it to be. I'm not actually entirely sure what I mean by that, considering I haven't read the manga or anything, but I honestly thought there was a certain charm to the episode and I could definitely feel its sense of fun. There just wasn't anything *smart* about it. It's the sort of thing that tries to play off its shallow worldviews and human understanding for humor and by "not taking itself seriously", and it never really tries to be much more than that. So I think that if it just wasn't so, uh, *icky*, I would've seriously appreciated the style and genuine passion to its approach. But if this is what you're going to serve me, then I can't say I'm too hungry for more. 

>> ARTICLE
I didn't like it. Honestly I thought it would be a very interesting show about cooking.

In reality its a show with cooking elements, but it seems like the focus is on comedy and ecchi.

All of the fan service shots could be skipped, I'm not a fan of showing ecchi for the sake of showing it like in this show.

As for the comedy, its just not very good, maybe its just not my cup of tea but I didn't find it funny at all.

As for characters, are there any? its only the first episode but the main character seems like another cliche and he's not interesting in the bit, and it doesn't seem like they gave us any other interesting characters to focus on for now.

TL;DR - Didn't like it much, it can still get much better so I'm not giving up hope yet, hopefully there's more cooking involved and less ecchi going forward.
>> ARTICLE
It's adapted from a JUMP manga, so it's pretty shounen/seinen in style. So the over the top ecchi and foodgasm scenes were a big part of it. 
I'd treat it like a sports anime more than a cooking anime although they do try hard to explain the dishes and all the parts of the dishes.

But honestly, the rest of the series follows fairly closely to the format shown in this first episode. 
>> ARTICLE
This show gives me a bad first impression. It's like Yakitate Japan, except with dumb ecchi reactions. Those'll get old fast. At least the food looks beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Sigh, again my distaste of ecchi comes into conflict with what would've otherwise been a good anime in my eyes. I'm going to follow the 3 episodes rule though, so as long as it doesn't get worse I'll keep watching, because it's pretty entertaining.
>> ARTICLE
The foodgasms vary. You've got ones like the ones from this episode, and then also [funnier](https://data.archive.moe/board/a/image/1381/06/1381066386746.png) [ones](http://i22.mangapanda.com/shokugeki-no-soma/17/shokugeki-no-soma-4041407.jpg) [like](http://i.imgur.com/oNVCt3ql.jpg?1) the jukebox one which I greatly prefer.  I'm also not a fan of ecchi stuff, but if you can ignore that parts when it comes up (which admittedly will be harder for the anime than the manga), the story itself is pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
I like the VA for Soma, it fits really good.

Great episode 1! Can't wait for more!!!
>> ARTICLE
It pissed me off way more than it should have that they were holding the knife wrong. >.<
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's just me, but as someone who has read the manga I'm not quite sure if I enjoyed this or not. Maybe I just need to get used to longer action sequences or extended plot... Anyways I have big expectations for the future episodes and will defiantly keep watching to see if it gets better! 
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand this, this episode was perfect 
>> ARTICLE
My body is ready. Let the Soma-ing begin
>> ARTICLE
I need to remember to not watch this when I hungry. This show makes me want to cook.

So far good first episode. I have never heard of this manga so I came in to it blind. I thought it was a good hook of a first episode. I don't think I've seen an show with ecchi and food together so this will be an experience. I wonder how long it will be until the MC gets his harem or becomes OP knowing who the main voice actor is. 
>> ARTICLE
IT'S HERE! IT'S HERE! IT'S HERE! IT'S HERE! IT'S HERE!

AWWWW YISS! To see all the food in glorious colour, cannot wait!!
>> ARTICLE
Great episode! Excited to see how well J.C. Staff adapts it!

Out of curiosity, did anyone else recognize that Crunchyroll translated Tootsuki as "Engetsu Teahouse"?
>> ARTICLE
My senses are so overwhelmed, but I want MORE!...MORE!...MORE!
>> ARTICLE
I've been looking forward to this series since it was announced. And it definitely won't disappoint me like Koufuki Graffiti did.

Also I wonder what new things I can learn technique wise, and what cool recipes I can learn from it.

Not too fond of this episode's standard fried rice and the super dense looking potato-roast.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so fucking hungry after watching this. And they even gave the recipe... 

Did they change the name of the school to Engatsu from Totsuki in the anime. or is there something wrong with the sub?
>> ARTICLE
Love the manga and loving the anime.
>> ARTICLE
I guess the term "Mouth-Gasm" is going to be a returning phrase 
>> ARTICLE
OK, alright. I-ah, have a few questions; not the least of which is WTF DID I JUST WATCH?!

Although, this looks like it will be a ton of fun. I just might go and read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, do yourself a favor and read the manga. It feels much better to appreciate the foodgasm panels for as long as you want (if that's your thing), rather than sitting awkwardly in front of a screen for way too long. The foodgasms are just too much in your face in the show.

In the manga, you don't waste too much time with them (again, unless you want to).
>> ARTICLE
I held off on reading the manga the last year or so because I knew eventually it was gonna be an anime, after one episode I already want to give it and read it. JC Staff got two hits between this and Dungeon Ni, Fridays are gonna be the best days this Spring.

It wasn't what I expected, but it was all I ever could have wanted. Really hoping that it gets a full season.

As a big fan of the manga, I'm really pleased with this episode. J.C.Staff are my favourite studio and they've kept true to the source material and brilliantly brought it to life. Everything looked amazing, the voices were right, it was funny and I absolutely adore the ED - it's really sweet when they're all talking/dancing/eating at the dinner table.

I hope it's two cours as a lot of their shows are, and there's definitely enough content for it, and I think this will be a really special show this season. I'll watch Dungeon? soon and hope it's just as good as that's also a J.C.Staff show, but I expect to be just as pleased with it.
>> ARTICLE
anime and fan service and its funny ? count me in 
>> ARTICLE
i've been waiting for this, so worth the wait. Lives up to the manga so well so far.
>> ARTICLE
Well ... Holy shit.  
This show has so many ridiculous moments, and it plays them all *completely straight.* It's amazing. I was watching this half in total disbelief, half chuckling like a maniac. I never thought Foodgasms: The anime would be such an exciting premise, and the presentation is able to not only back it up, but to add to the concept. Animation was great, and the music, oh God the music. When that epic song was playing over Souma cooking, I knew we were in for a treat with this show.  
10/10 first episode, eagerly awaiting the rest.

I thought would be sort of like bento, but it wasn't, and thats not a bad thing, it has it's own flavor.
>> ARTICLE
That was actually really enjoyable, Friday's are turning out to be a good day for this anime season.
>> ARTICLE
As some one who has been following the manga since the 1st chapter released.
I feel proud too see my little (and favorite) discovery come so far.

My 1st impressions:

-The anime seems true to the manga, in artsyle and presentation

-The animation is top notch

-The fluid animations of the food being prepared are a nice addition.

-The music is apt and fits right into the theme of the anime

-The over the top lewdness (gender independent) adds a very nice comedic aspect without feeling over sexualised.

A solid 9.5/10 for me
The MANGA is definitely the best Shounen (or even in general..since TG:re has been slow to pick up) manga running right now, so expectations are high.

I hope the anime gets weekly serialization, as the manga seems to be heading towards having 300-400 episodes before an end is in sight.

>> ARTICLE
This is just episode 1 folks, go read that manga!
>> ARTICLE
I thought this was about food, but this anime has to do with Orgasmsing all over the place.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the manga, I never thought I would watch people get raped by food.         
I love it!
>> ARTICLE
Foodgasm as it's maximum potencial.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I had no idea what I was expecting (for some reason I kept on thinking of Fighting Foodons lol) but I was blown away. Like, damn.
>> ARTICLE
I'm having serious flashback of Yakitate Japan! Considering I love that anime, I'm really looking forward to the rest of this anime!
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I'll be able to keep up with the ecchi, anyone know if it'll get worse as the season goes on?
>> ARTICLE
Had a Kill la Kill vibe toward the end.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. This is even more... intense than the manga. That's an achievement.
>> ARTICLE
Just watched it.

I've never been this hyped before about a cooking anime, let alone any cooking show
>> ARTICLE
you don't know how happy i am that this first episode turned out great. looking forward to this.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap. As a reader of the manga, this blew my expectations! The OP, the fluid animation, **THE MEAT JUICES**. I am loving how this is so far! I look forward to next week, as I'm hungry for more! Literally! 
>> ARTICLE
I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT IM WATCHING BUT I WANNA SEE THE TEST HE IS GONNA TAKE!!  I WANNA SEE GOD TONQUE!!
>> ARTICLE
2 questions for readers of the manga
1) do they... react like that in the manga? ecchi and naked?
2) Did not see Akira in the OP. any idea who long the series is for and if Akira would make an appearance?
>> ARTICLE
Didnt expect this anime to be this great.
the over the top orgasms, were very unexpected, time to read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Koufuku Graffiti and now this. I really want this trend to continue, a ~~gratuitous food porn~~ cooking show every season.
>> ARTICLE
This show looks Friggin. Awesome.  It's got food, over the top cooking AND ridiculous eating scenes without boring SOL (sorry, Kofuko Graffiti)!  I gotta give the show props too for having fan service equality with that bacon roast eating scene, usually don't see much of that lmao.  
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think i'd enjoy this more than DanMachi

But... here we are.
>> ARTICLE
Loves it! thats all.
>> ARTICLE
I'm happy that the lackeys got to dig in too. I was worried the poor fodders will be left out.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if I should be happy or dig a hole and hide in it. the adaptation is just too good.
>> ARTICLE
Very well played for the animation and FOODGASMS
>> ARTICLE
Dammit. I literally just read the all available chapters yesterday thinking it'll be a week or two before this thing starts. I was so wrong. CAN'T FUCKING WAIT FOR [Manga](/s "Alice and Erina")
>> ARTICLE
I have a huge phobia to seafood and sealife in general. Each time there was shimps and squids and tentacles shown and eaten I chringed so hard and closed my eyes during it. It's my biggest fear. :'(

Other than that, it was so worth toughening it out. My goodness, this is the first time I ever seen a foodgasm and I laughed hard with the over-the-top reactions that came with it. That was a crazy ride for a first ep.

I want to try that potato bacon roast.

>> ARTICLE
This is my fiance's favorite manga, and he was practically in tears throughout the entire episode from how happy he was. We also watched it with a friend who was entirely unfamiliar with the manga besides what we told him of the fanservice, and he also got a huge kick out of it.

They did a pretty good job to keep the first episode mostly covering just the first chapter. I can't imagine the rest of the series will be that ratio, but for the first episode it worked really well. Not to mention the animation of the cooking scenes was really cool and made me crazy hungry. And the fanservice was actually more ridiculous than in the manga, if I'm remembering right, which is really, really funny to me.

So yeah A+++ first episode. I can't wait for the rest.
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck did I just watch?
>> ARTICLE
Anime is saved, guys.
>> ARTICLE
Pause for a second. Can we talk about how good this OP is? First I didn't think I would like it, but it has instantly grown on me.
>> ARTICLE
The potato bacon dish actually looks so good. One order pls.
>> ARTICLE
I am impressed that the animation studio was forward thinking enough to include both japanese and english versions of ingredients/foods/dishes in their labeling process.  It's quite awesome and saves who ever subs a massive typesetting effort. 
>> ARTICLE
I knew there was going to be service but I did not expect full on service and man service! What the fuck did I just watch.. 10/10 Will continue watching. 
>> ARTICLE
this anime is over the top and insane....i love it.
>> ARTICLE
This one's fuckin awesome :D
>> ARTICLE
Was I the only one bothered by Souma using a Deba to dice an onion?
>> ARTICLE
I'm definitely coming back next week. I've been wating for a long time for a cooking anime to come by. Last memorable cooking show was Yakitate Japan! but that's more of baking.

It definitely reminds me of Cooking Master Boy, with a touch of Koufuku Graffiti! Gawd I miss that anime. I seriously hope there would be more interesting foodgasms.
>> ARTICLE
I put this on the lower end of my interest spectrum for this season as a show that I would likely not watch, however I was very happily surprsied with that first episode. It's funny in a "this show is too much" sort of way. 

The MC is really likable and the set up is pretty cool.

i loved this manga, i cant beleived its in anime form now.

Watching too much anime this season...

Danmachi, Owari no Seraph, Food wars, Kekkai, and bunch of other unfinished ones...
>> ARTICLE
I like the food, kinda disliking the fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
The guy who illustrated the manga used to do hentai. If you're not up for more sexualized eating you'll want to abandon ship asap.
>> ARTICLE
that was awesome
>> ARTICLE
I was really hoping for like a Yakitate Japan or Chuuka Ichiban! deal where the cooking and comedy is what matters but with all these ecchi moments I think I'll have to wait longer for another anime like that.
  
I'm not saying the anime is bad, it's just not my taste and the ecchi moments will annoy me sooner than the plot can bring me in, it's also not a show I can recommend on the fly because of that.
>> ARTICLE
**Presentation:**

**OP** - Very colourful, vibrant. The sound though, it's as if a mouse thought itself a lion and roared. It's a song that gives of the wish of energy, but lacks anything actually resembling it.

**ED** - Silly visuals, energetic, *fun*. A great earworm. I can see losing oneself to the song or humming along as it plays.

Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, as always, delivers a solid performance in the lead role. It's his standard voice, but as he's being type-cast into the same role for being able to deliver the same voice, I guess it's alright. Amusingly, with the manner Souma reminds me of Emiya Shirou visually, especially [in this screenshot with his "eyes-line"](http://i.imgur.com/MycTtAu.jpg), it's quite amusing to me that Koyama Rikiya who also portrayed Ging in Hunter x Hunter and Emiya Kiritsugu in Fate/X, is the father here, so now I imagine it as a continuity, where he's a shounen cuckoo, giving birth to children and then abandoning them so they could become proper shounen protagonists!

On a more serious note, we only got to hear one main character's voice acting, so can't comment on it all that much.

J.C. Staff are seemingly giving us their A Game in this show, with lush colours, crisp character designs, and everything just pops, in general. There's not too much movement called for yet, so I won't discuss that for now.

**Theme / Plot / "Plot":**

Ok, let's discuss the "plot" first, the fan-service. Going into this show, after I've watched the preview, I knew this was going to be a thing. And boy, was this a thing. The real question is how much it'd be the focus, and how much the shounen battler.

Speaking of shounen battler, I rolled my eyes at Souma explaining to the land-sharks how he cooked his meal, and wondered why bother with that, until I reminded myself, it's the same as someone in a "regular" shounen battler techno babbling to you about the chi/nen/reiatsu of their moves. Everything here is so over the top, and we notice it because we're dealing with *food*. Is this a commentary on how all such shounens are ridiculously over the top in their descriptions? [We could read it like that](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2014/07/08/fatekaleid-liner-prisma%e2%98%86illya-fan-service-not-poes-law/), but no, it's just another shounen, but here we can *really* tell what's going on.

This is a shounen battler, and those usually are very much not gripping in their first episode. We've had a face-down, but without a situation we care for, without characters we care for. Why should we care for random kid, or for father who lets his 15 year old kid deal with land-sharks, and then just leaves him behind to cook with a friend? Why should we care about the cooking when we don't care for their stakes?

We don't. But as I said, shounen battlers' first episodes are generally weak. I still remember how much I disliked Fairy Tail's first episode, and how much I liked the show from episode 5 or so onward.

This show is very tentative for me, because much will depend on the food-fighting to food-pr0n ratio, and the food pr0n is even heavier than I thought it'd be. Hopefully the show will make us care quickly. Make us care for the characters, make us care for the stakes, and shower us with more pretty fights.

I'm so glad they are following the manga. I'm fine with them taking liberties here and there to fit the anime process when necessary, but major plot deviations would be a no go. So far though, this is looking awesome.

Though the foodgasms are just as awkward as I expected them to be in video form. >_>

Guess you can sell anything these days if you put ecchi on it. Pretty boring, especially since the whole episode was about a non-existant conflict.

Okay, Yukihira saying "Shokugeki" quietly was one of the most badass moments of this season. I'm so down with this anime.

Legit squealed like a bitch at that. 

Megumi is such a qt3.14, I just wouldn't believe she'd get expelled. Except she did get expelled... Luckily, Soma was here to save the day, or at least, to try... 

Man, that scene was absolutely exhilarating!

yea but did he woned??

I was saying Shokugeki before him. the hype was real.

This anime was already good and now its even better.  As soon as it ended I started calling people to tell them to watch. I'm going to watch this episode again just because it was soo effing good.

I came here just to post that. His delivery was perfect.

Holy fck man. That was amazing and i might die while waiting for next week.

I'm so glad to see this animated. Freaking bad ass moment of the year!

I don't remember the last time I actually flipped my shit watching anything as much as I just did when that happened. OMG that was amazing! Next week couldn't be any further away.
>> ARTICLE
one of the most badass moments of all anime this year. God damn.
>> ARTICLE
This anime is like the Gurren Lagann of cooking. I am so down with this anime. Soma challenging the Chef to a Sogukeki just literally had me doing a single ultra loud clap using my hands and taking the fist in the air pose. I just can't wait for the next episode

Souma: "u wot m8 i'm gonna hook u right in the gabber on a 1v1 i swear on me nan."

I fucking jizzed, I thought it was gonna just be a more calm episode but that fucking ending. I had to text all my friends who watched it and jizzed letters everywhere.

How the fuck do they expect me to wait a WHOLE WEEK when the episode ends like that ?!

They gave that scene the respect it deserves. Soma is stone cold loyal to a fault. I can't wait for the next few weeks.

The excitement that came over me when he said is not something I expected to feel when I started this show.  It's that same feeling I get when a big fight is about to start in one of my battle shonen.
>> ARTICLE
This show is essentially a battle shonen, just disguised as a cooking show.
>> ARTICLE
It's a non-mainstream mainstream battle manga! Or in this case, anime.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, yeah, still it's impressive it can recreate the atmosphere around that.
>> ARTICLE
I legit got chills.

I had to rewind and watch it again. 

Soma is hXc as fuark.
>> ARTICLE
Smart of Soma to play the Shokugeki card.. while Shinomiya technically could just expel Soma on the spot, now he has to defend his honour as a chef
>> ARTICLE
And of course he has no thoughts of ever losing it..
>> ARTICLE
I was just about to say. Very clever. If rumors that this punk backed down from a challenge from some kid, his reputation would be as tainted as his cauliflower.
>> ARTICLE
It's seriously one of my favorite moments in the manga too. Souma just looks so cool when he does it.

Here's the scene: [Shoukugeki](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Al9MxDS9Zrw/UXpl0ovMJJI/AAAAAAAAfhQ/Z17n6_QUYdo/18-19.png?imgmax=10000)
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking about reading the manga because I can't wait a week for the next episode which probably wont be focused on the shokugeki itself but rather on preparation. So could you tell me which chapter that is? :)
>> ARTICLE
You should. Right now the manga is at chapter 121, and a few arcs ahead of this one. Every episode of the anime covers 2-3 chapters, and right now it seems like it stopped off right at the beginning of [Chapter 22](http://casanovascans.com/read/shokugeki_no_soma/en/0/22/page/3). 


You should check out [/r/ShokugekiNoSoma](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShokugekiNoSoma/) as well. They announce, and post new chapters/translations once they come out. 


If you do decide to read the manga, start from beginning as some of the little details were changed (Language, omitted side stories, etc...) 
>> ARTICLE
The Manga version is more cooler as well like look at those reactions and Megumi's face
>> ARTICLE
Imo the anime version is better. Hits you way harder because there's no buildup and it's unexpected.
>> ARTICLE
Its unexpected in the manga as well! All of a sudden it cuts to Megumi and she's being expelled and then Souma is like oh hell no
>> ARTICLE
That's some clean and amazing art.
>> ARTICLE
It's even more amazing that Tosh can dish out this kind of quality weekly. Weekly.
>> ARTICLE
Wait this shit's weekly? I know what I'm doing after the anime finishes!

Props for having the patience to do so, I think if I had been an anime only viewer, I probably would have started the Manga right after.

I hope you enjoy it!

You think that is killer? Imagine if they ended the episode right after Shinomiya expelled her.

That was where the manga chapter ended.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know, hence why I'm a bit disappointed in this week's episode, because the anime viewers will never get to feel the despair manga readers did, having to wait a week while expecting the worst...
>> ARTICLE
Since they're two consecutive chapters, they had to choose whether to end it on the firing or the shokugeki challenge. I think the challenge is a more epic feeling way to end it; plus, having her fired right before the commercial break was a good compromise.
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly where I expected them to end it tbh.

Oh I get it now! Erina is not a bitch... she's just salty. That tasting of salt diversities did quite a number on her.

[*Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking Manga](http://i.imgur.com/vHV9N30.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Because of this suspense, especially in this episode, it climbed finally the 10 in my MAL rating. Too good
>> ARTICLE
Lol yup, she cant stand the fact that Souma, who uses cheap ingredients and creates simplistic food that the ordinary person would eat (like in his diner) is actually a really good chef. Plus she is at the top of her class, so to see someone who, compared to her, is an untrained and unruly jokester actually able to rival her cooking, it is an extreme blow to her pride. And the feeling is mutual, just the fact that erina finished before him bothers him because he is Yukihira Souma, tohtsuki is just a stepping stone in his mind. His ego is friggin huge lol, and it is absolutely the same for Nakiri. She looked down on him and his cooking skills from the first moment they met, and he proved her wrong with his very first dish...but of course she wont admit that lol.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like if they somehow managed to get past the preconceptions they have of each other, they would make such good friends though. But there's too pride for both of them to occupy the same room
>> ARTICLE
I agree, but i think that it could go beyond friendship. And despit romance not really being close to the spotlight in the series(at least atm) i think thats where their relationship will land when the series nears the end. Which is why im on the SS Erina overall, despite quite a few of the other girls being so great, its because it makes the most sense to me for this type storytelling.
>> ARTICLE
Aren't there flags already that the story will go this way, what with Souma's Dad trying to tell him before he got cut off that the secret to good cooking is to do it for someone?
>> ARTICLE
I think we should keep in mind that based off the end of the ep, he is in fact about to cook for someone else. 
>> ARTICLE
>holy fuck. Can this COOKING show get more suspenseful? 

The danger and suspense are so extreme I keep forgetting this is *just cooking* and not a fistfight to the death. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Clearly, you have never watched Iron Chef Japan in your life.

Let's change that, shall we?
>> ARTICLE
Oh my God, Iron Chef is basically Shokugeki... I knew I had a positive gut reaction to this show for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
Iron Chef INVENTED the shokugeki.

And I'm trying to constantly encourage the redditors here to really watch Iron Chef Japan... Because they really have to.  Iron Chef Japan is the greatest cooking show ever (Granted, it's really hard for ANY cooking show to go against the incredibly high expectations to outdo Iron Chef, such as using incredibly expensive ingredients and several of the fights on the show were not just ordinary "People come to fight the Iron Chef" (Morimoto VS Ohta faction, Kandagawa fights, Hattori VS Nakamura in his retirement battle)) and my binge-watching of Iron Chef Japan helped me understand the world of cooking and the like.   
>> ARTICLE
Where can I watch this?

You want to see the anime that INSPIRED Iron Chef?

This show is the show that defined cooking anime. Its the sailor moon of cooking battles.

Souma is actually the biggest fucking badass ever. Never mind Gilgamesh and his infinite Noble Phantasms or Lancer and his Unlimited Bro Works, this is guy just does not give a fuck. Even though he could get kicked out and have his whole life ruined, he doesn't even lose his cool or hesitate because he is that fucking cool that he can just tell that haughty wanker where to shove his *recette* without even fucking flinching.

God he makes me so hard.

"haughty wanker" LOL

Such a breeze of fresh air compared to the typical dense, oblivious and / or untalented-but-hardworking MCs.

This is badass and done right at that.
>> ARTICLE
> Souma is actually the biggest fucking badass ever.

> Only provides extremely recent examples.

Newfriend, pls.  He's pretty good but he's got nothing on old classics like Kenshiro
>> ARTICLE
I actually had a load more examples, one of whom was Guts (so we're talking classics here) but I was like "fuck it" I'm just gonna compare it to UBW to make it more accessible as probably more people here will have been watching it.

Plus I didn't want to get the butthurt Berserk fans on my case. 
>> ARTICLE
Berserk ends with Guts getting cucked.  And he's just a pale imitation of Kenshiro to begin with, so bad example.
>> ARTICLE
Spoilers. 

Also it ends with [](/s "Guts getting wrecked by literal hell,") so that's fucking retarded to use that against him. 
>> ARTICLE
Screw the Guts fanboys, Souma would kick his butt in a cook-off.

Guts just would spit cook demons or something nasty tasty but manly like that.
>> ARTICLE
You da real MVP Souma!
>> ARTICLE
Sorry bro, Souma is up there but Jotaro has taken the spot for most badass protag of this season.
>> ARTICLE
"I have to get close in order to kick your ass."
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Souma is a talented enough chef already that he could still open a restaurant somewhere and be successful even if he was expelled. At the very least he could hire a few assistants and go run the diner again in the town where people already know how good he is.
>> ARTICLE
he was talented enough to do that when he started. but he wants to match his dad, and he can't do that without succeeding at this school. despite what's been shown so far, he *will* have to struggle and work hard to move through the school.

>> ARTICLE
[](/s "You looked, didn't you.")
>> ARTICLE
Oh fuck you.
>> ARTICLE
People forget that, part of the reason why Souma got platinum mad in the scene was because his technique got offended. Megumi did what Souma would have done if he was in her place, and what he's been doing since episode 1: Finding creative workarounds when there are no good materials around.

It's more personal that it seems.
>> ARTICLE
> Even though he could get kicked out and have his whole life ruined

Honestly, I think that's his secret  his life *wouldn't* be ruined.  He could just go back to running a small restaurant and be perfectly happy.  He doesn't really need these people or their bullshit, ultimately.
>> ARTICLE
Idk, I mean you're right, but he really *really* wants to be a better chef than his dad. I mean, if this were a serious slice of life then it wouldn't be a big deal, but it's basically a battle shounen and it's supposed to feel like getting expelled is pretty much equivalent to dying.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he really accepts the academy as the way to do that. As evidenced by his acceptance speech, he seems to value actual work in a restaurant over theoretical haute-cuisine crap.

I think it lends to his devil-may-care attitude to realize that all of this is just a distraction for him while his dad has shut down the restaurant. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't think he really accepts the academy as the way to do that.

Looking at the people at the top of the academy (and alumni) so far it's been almost 50% dicks.

Naked number 7 vs. Erina the Salty one.
Alumni-snack-chan vs. this episodes shipping breaker.

And meat girl may or may not have flipped sides.
>> ARTICLE
Then you realise that Dio is a now a homoerotic chef badass, and it makes it all okay.
>> ARTICLE
I'm don't think Souma would even give two shits about Gilgamesh. He'd be like "Any last words, mongrel?" and Souma would quietly say "just one: Shokugeki." and Gilly would be all "shit I don't know how to cook" and in his state of disarray he doesn't notice Souma's noble phantasm (his monolithic balls) about to crush him. 
 
*or so I'd like to think.*
>> ARTICLE
I'd rather see him fight Emiya. Half because Emiya is a decent chef, but mostly to have the Badass theme song battle. Yes people. Yukihira's Badassery theme legitly rivals the EMIYA theme right now.
>> ARTICLE
Idk.... If he even had the best wine in his gate of Babylon... I'm sure he gotta have the best food.

Thats not really a spoiler since they explained it in episode 8 when they introduced them.

This episode covered chapter 20 and 21. There were a few extra scenes here and there, but nothing of importance. 

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/kk5j3) are all the currently available (scanlated) recipes. 

This weeks foodgasm in the ED is from [Dojima](http://i.imgur.com/W8yfXsj.jpg) and [here](http://imgur.com/a/i1bOa) are all the previous ones.


And [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wMd-dBpMLI8/UXplxxXYvxI/AAAAAAAAfhA/D20GuZGCZu0/16.png?imgmax=10000) is the manga [scene](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Al9MxDS9Zrw/UXpl0ovMJJI/AAAAAAAAfhQ/Z17n6_QUYdo/18-19.png?imgmax=10000) of Souma reacting to Megumi crying. Decided to post it here because of badass Souma. ( From the end of chapter 21 )

Let's add the manga version of [Yoshino with hair down](http://imgur.com/9OPm99i) as bonus. :D

One of Souma's most badass moments in the series captured perfectly. Props to the animation team. 

The extra scene with Erina and Hisako at the front desk was perfect. This is why I like anime adaptions, when they add on material rather than subtract.

Also the ship tease for both Megumi/Souma and Erina/Souma is so real this ep. Love it.

Super excited for next week, I hope we'll get to the Shokugeki right away without a training episode first! And I can't wait for everyone delicious reactions when they see Soma beat an alumni.

That was not just refering to Shokugeki no Souma, that was a general opinion.

All I can say is...

I really like Gin-Sensei.

And it's not just because he's voiced by Takehito Koyasu, the king of mecha voices.

Something just makes me like him.

Then again, Takehito Koyasu did voice the best SEED Good Guy, Mwu La Flaga, so I'm not entirely surprised that his broness was a key factor in playing out Gin-sensei's role right.

Those that read the manga... How important is Gin-sensei?

I never would have thought that a show about cooking would be so damn hype. This episode flew by, can't wait for next week!

I'm relatively far ahead in the manga and that cliffhanger still hurts! J.C.Staff are doing an amazing job bringing the manga to life, easily my favourite show of the season.

This anime...

At the end when things got really tense I whispered to myself "shokugeki" as I saw where it was going. You've done the right thing when you've made a food battle be this badass thing.

I personally would have liked the episode to have ended where Shinomiya fired Megumi. I personally think it would have been a better cliffhanger.

^^I ^^also ^^wanted ^^you ^^Megumi ^^fans ^^to ^^freak ^^out.

Agreed, but this is quite good as well.(Even though I love Megumi.  But the reactions would have been incredible)

Welp, it's Attack on Titan level hype for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Alright guys, I'm sold. Can we all just take a moment and discuss how fucking badass that last scene was? It literally sent chills down my spine the instant Souma said "Shokugeki" without hesitating. This is AOTS-worthy content right here with the right amount of energy to keep the story moving and the right amount of tits. I haven't seen the source material before but I'm pretty sure this series will turn out pretty fucking amazing, definitely an extraordinary one in my book.
>> ARTICLE
The completely arbitrary expulsions are the one aspect of this show that really annoys me. I know it's supposed to make the school "hardcore," but it just feels like a weak gimmick to cause a sense of tension in the show. The school doesn't even feel like a school. One mistake and it's over? In cooking? How the hell do you learn without making mistakes? Not only that but it lets asshats like Shinomiya expel people because he feels like it. Way too much power for one person. A school that makes 100 high level chefs would be more highly regarded and profitable than one that makes 10 monstrously high level chefs.

Still love the show immensely, this is the one caveat that bugs the hell out of me. Hyped as hell for the Shokugeki!
>> ARTICLE
The random explusions by Shinomiya [spoiler](#s "are not a gimmick it's part of his character. Why he's like that will be explained in later episodes. (if not next?)")
>> ARTICLE
I love both the anime and the manga, but its pretty clear that Tootsuki is a terrible school.
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing they don't give a damn about profit. And the principal already owns everything there is to own in the business or at least everything worthwhile. So it's more important to pump out monsters than high level chefs.

Souma challenging Shinomiya to a Shokugeki was pretty badass, but what if, and I'm saying this without having any knowledge of the manga, but what if he had the theme for the Shokugeki be the Nine-whatever they had to cook for the test?

Oh god, I keep forgetting this show is a 24 episode show. *Phew!* RELIEF! Because I can't get enough of this!

Chef Shinomiya seem like a By the Book kind of chef or he's just so stuck up about his own recipes. Megumi figuring out how to preserve the cauliflower is a skill on its own that should be recognized. I hope Soma kicks his ass.

Beautiful. This is the moment I've been waiting for. Next episode, we'll see Megumi at her finest.

Does anyone else think that Soma kinda resembles Saitama from One Punch Man? They are unbeatable

That omake with Yuuki right at the end of the episode is from volume 3 page 106, with added slime monsters



>> ARTICLE
Favorite episode so far, we had Dio's VA and Soma protecting best girl in the most bad ass way possible.
>> ARTICLE
You know that Yukihira Badass time theme?

Ooooh yeah, I had a moment there when it came on at the end

Erina is not a bitch, Erina is not a bitch, Erina is not a.... **GODDAMMIT**

To fight for what you believe is right despite the opposition.

This episode was insane. Especially the ending when he challenged Chef Shinomiya to a Shokugeki. I wasn't expecting that.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Doujima was just there because they thought Isshiki wasn't enough fanservice for the ladies. That middle card was hilarious however.  
We got a more Megumi-focused episode now, which was pretty nice to see. Unfortunately she fell victim to Shinomiya deliberately taking measures to ensure that students fail, which is a dick move no matter which way you look at it. Souma though, *oh man.* To go that far just for a classmate is pretty commendable dedication.

ITT: Boners


This ep was so badass.

I'm honestly not sure whether I'm more hyped by ORA/MUDA or Souma's War Declaration. Today was indeed a good day for anime.

[Epic before fight OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unkflp9vfsM).  [Iron Chef America Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_r0MAMWOJE).  I feel like there is a relation here based on cooking, fighting, violins and horns
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how the rest of the anime is going to be portrayed since at this point in the manga this is around chapter 24 out of 120 chapters. So far the anime has done a extremely good job of not cutting anything out. Now saying that the anime is almost reached the half way point. 

I hope this anime has at least 2 or 3 seasons to fit in all the rest of the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
I wanna see the world too... (   )

On a more serious note, making Megumi fail was certainly unexpected and Souma was an absolute badass right there at the end.

Can't wait for the next one.

That's right bitches.

Next episode is gonna be awesome!!!

I just watched and caught up on this show for the first time, and I'm loving the shit out of it.

FOr anybody else who loves this show as much as I do, you also need to go watch [Yakitate!! Japan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28/Yakitate!!_Japan).  No fan service, but plays out a lot like this show does, with the food battles and stuff.
>> ARTICLE
That intermission card lmfao, seems like every episode has something small to make me laugh my ass off.  The tension to see if the foreshadowing would be true was gut-wrenching :(, looking forward to Soma kicking some pompous ass.  I conclude now with the song of my people: *OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH*

So many things have happened in this Episode and the one thing that strike me was Dojima's muscled toned body full of gourmet cells. It's like he's from Toriko on that bath scene.
>> ARTICLE
SO HYPE
>> ARTICLE
Lol shots fired at the end there.

I have to say though, I agree with Shinomiya. A good chef needs to be able to secure quality ingreients on time, and underlings can't change their chef's recipes without permission. It's a harsh rule but not surprising considering Tootsuki's standards.

By the harsh rules of Tootsuki Megumi would normally have been expelled. But she'll end up staying only because Souma stands up for his friends.

Never make a beautiful girl cry. Soma snapped seeing the best girl cry. Never make best girl cry. Soma about to show them hands.

so competent and yet still has one of the most open minds!

We can only hope this gets a second season to reach those points :/ I think the chances of a second season are pretty good though!

Yeah.I wonder whether the elections will be covered this season(not sure if its 12 episodes or 25 episodes)

The hype is real.

TL;DR: Good times in hotel, bouncy! Gin-senpai with Soma, and then Soma protecting the best girl. Just remember kids, Soma shot first.

Souma is a straight up badass. Next should be a very heated cook-off I can't wait.

I was liking the Megumi development finally doing things by herself but then Soma had to rescue her again.. C'mon how does anyone think she is the best girl when Soma is always rescuing her Erina best girl so far, even though she went all Tsundere but that's ok 


Also was Soma surprise that Shinomiya-sempai didn't have a foodganism was this the first episode without a foodganism, I like say foodganism...

Yup, then his Dad takes his legitimate family to the movies and gets shot, meaning Souma's half brother becomes a culinary batman meanwhile Souma delves into insanity and becomes the culinary Joker, where they eventually fight for supremacy.

At least as far as I remember.

They're actually similar characters. Most the time they don't really give a fuck but occasionally they get serious. Although in Saitama's case it's usually for the wrong thing like he forgot there was a sale or something.

*sniff* It's beautiful.  I'm glad some people on this subreddit thread watched the ~~true~~ ONLY version of Iron Chef. And this show is the closest we got to capturing that dramtic feeling of my childhood.  Well, if my childhood actually contained porn.  In a good way.  

And you think that's bad?!? My family was watching the original Iron Chef Japan, but they had to switch to ~~Iron Chef America~~ that inferior piece of shit because they couldn't handle watching turtles die.  keep in mind we are Vietnamese, where we go to the market and the butchers there do the preparation live in front of us.  I promptly proceeded to declare them all no longer my family members that day.

Going to ask my friend about the details once I convince him to watch it. He used to cook (he still *can* but he's looking for a different career atm) and his father is Cordon Bleu certified. 
>> ARTICLE
100% of all cooking that isn't baking is people doing complete bullshit and wondering if it'll taste good. See: Peanut butter with squid.

Baking is witchcraft and wizardry, and should not truly be considered cooking. 

I personally don't think this week's dish would taste particularly great most of the time. Primarily because the rice and eggs need to be absolutely piping hot to melt the aspic and not have a strange gelatinous texture ruining everything.

At the same time, aspic is still mostly water.  If you don't eat the dish quickly, the rice is gonna get real soggy.

The entire thing might taste good, but seems like a huge textural disaster if anything goes wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I've never had the exact thing described, but iirc (it's been years) chicken gelatin is an actual thing in Taiwan (where I grew up) and when done right it's delicious even if used in the way described here.

While I never made it, what I had was essentially chilled chicken oil / juice / broth. It was pink in color and served cold. (the particular chicken dish associated with it involves chilling the chicken quickly after cooking) When heated it pretty much melts to juice / oil. Most of the time you'd eat it with the chicken (in fact if cooked right some of it stays inside the chicken), but I'd imagine the only reason this is not an actual dish out there is because the number of chickens you need to make that much chicken jelly.

I cannot find a receipe for making the chicken jelly i described, but [here](http://lee60207.pixnet.net/blog/post/256646915-%E6%9C%89%E9%9B%9E%E5%87%8D%E7%9A%84%E7%99%BD%E6%96%AC%E9%9B%9E) (Caution: Blog has automated music player) is a Taiwanese receipe for making that chicken itself - which has a layer of the chicken jelly underneath the skin, shown in the first picture. 

Tl;dr Texture shouldn't be much of a problem. Soggy might be, but it's half oil half water.
>> ARTICLE
> Baking is witchcraft and wizardry, and should not truly be considered cooking.

Baking and Patisserie student here. I agree. Baking is closer to a science than an art. Fold the macaron batter 2 folds too many? Congratulations, you're batch is fucked. 
>> ARTICLE
> Baking and Patisserie student here.

I taught myself how to make croissants after watching yakitate japan.  Initially, I thought the amount of butter required was too much and thought I'd make it more "healthy" by added less butter.

The results were dinner rolls instead of croissants.

For any j-drama fans, Bambino! (which is based off a manga), also went over the point that baking/patisserie is science requiring exact measurements and instructions.

I suck at cooking and this seems pretty advanced so I probably won't make it anytime soon. In the show they're basically top level chefs so making it in real life with the same circumstances might be hard, but if someone does make it I would love to know how it went. 
>> ARTICLE
Where it says sake, what alcohol would you use.
>> ARTICLE
From what I've read dry sherry, white wine or vermouth should be suitable as replacement, but maybe someone else can give better advice, because I'm not really knowledgeable in cooking. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably sake or a dry fortified white wine. Ordinary white wine or vermouth probably wouldn't fit the flavor profile. I'm thinking that the broth should have a slightly sweet taste; dry white wine would be too harsh.
>> ARTICLE
Just get some sake its pretty popular so it shouldn't be hard to find.
>> ARTICLE
The food is actually real food that you can cook! I actually have the potato dish from episode one [cooking in my oven](http://i.imgur.com/lvMMVDZ.jpg)! Not as good as my first attempt because I was rushing and didn't go out for ingredients, but it'll hopefully taste just as good.

## Episode 2 Manga to Anime Comparison.

**Note**: I will be linking images from the manga, but I may crop some frames out for various scenes (like some of the foodgasms, for instance).  

**The Top Cooking School in Japan** - Adapted

* **The Gourmet Ojou-sama** - We start the episode with a scene where Nakiri Erina is tasting a Tootsuki student's soup.  She says that it's terrible and that the flavor was as if [she was bath in a mixed bath with a lowland gorilla.](http://i.imgur.com/4zjTHFB.png) She went on to remark that the whole group served her terrible dishes.  She said to one of the students that she guesses that he omitted a step in the pre-cooking process.  In addition, she mentioned how she was aware that their group was starting an expansion (in which optimization was encouraged), and [asks them if they think they'll be forgiven for staining her tongue.](http://i.imgur.com/i9P3TE6.png)  At this point, the entire group gets on their knees and beg for forgiveness.  

* **Phone call with Jouichirou** -  We then jump back to Souma standing in front of Tootsuki Academy.  He's on the phone with his dad, who tells him about Tootsuki being one of the top cooking schools in Japan with a less than 10% graduation rate.  He wishes Souma good luck and as they're about to end their phone call, Souma hears someone calling out to his dad.  After hearing this, Souma inquires about his dad's whereabouts, to which Jouichirou said he's in New York City, cooking at a VIP party in a Manhattan Hotel.  We then see some of the attendees saying how they're so glad to have some of Mr. Yukihira's food; [even a high priest was willing to throw away his beliefs for a taste.](http://i.imgur.com/DZaqn3G.png)  Jouichirou goes on to tell Souma that he first went to India, then Italy and Spain, and how he had arrived in the US a day earlier and plans to cook in a city along the East coast for a while.  After Souma says that he isn't following, Jouichirou said that he was just following one of his old connections.  At this point, Jouichirou lays it bare to Souma and said that if he couldn't graduate from Tootsuki, then his dream of surpassing him is nothing but a pipedream.  This pisses Souma off, and as Jouichirou was to tell him a secret to being a great cook, he hung up.  Jouichirou then says to Souma (in his head) that the secret to becoming a great cook is [to meet a girl that will make him want to give all of his food to her.](http://i.imgur.com/1Al0nXj.png)

  After Souma's phone call with his dad, we then see Erina asking her assistant Arato Hisako (future nickname: *Hishoko*) what their next appointment was.  Hishoko passed her some documents, which said that she was to administer the transfer student exam.  Erina says something about how she's had to do tasks like these since she's a part of the [executive council](/s "The Elite Ten").  She then tells Hishoko that they'll head over there once she changes.

* **What's this Pleb Doing here?!** - We then jump back to a scene where Souma sees all of these elitist people and hence feels out of place.  Then accidentally kicks a bench where a transfer student was sitting, apologizing to the student after the fact.  He has a little conversation with this student who says that his family owns a French restaurant.  After Souma tells him that his family owns a special-of-the-day shop, the other student kicks him away while calling him a vulgar plebeian and saying that he should not dare to sit next to him.  Other transfer students hear this and say amongst themselves that a person like him (from a cheap shop) trying to enter the school is such a joke.  He goes on to say how Tootsuki academy is a place for the elites and a plebeian like him would be dropped after they review his documents.  At this point, Souma picks up the guy by the collar and says that he shouldn't judge his shop without tasting it's food.  Souma then goes on to say that he's come to a remarkable place and at the rate things are going, he hopes to not end up with a pompous ass examiner as well. (in the manga, he instead says "Damn it, like hell I'll drop out! I have to get the examiner to accept me!")

**God's Tongue** - Adapted

* **The Trail of ~~F~~Tears (Literally)** - The transfer students then gather into a room and the examiner walks in.  Souma is surprised to see it's a girl and wonders if she's a student at the school.  At this point, the examiner introduces herself as Nakiri Erina, and asks Hishoko to read the notification for admissions.  After Hishoko reads them, she says how worthless that was, and then instead decides on a different way to test the transfer students.  She has kitchen tables brought in, and says that if any student can make a dish that satisfies her tongue (where the main ingredient is egg), she'll accept the student into Tootsuki academy.  At the same time, she offers the students one minute to withdraw from the exam.  After she said this, all the students are seen **fleeing** the room.  Souma is confused by all of this and he see's the same student that talked down to him earlier and asks him what's going on.  The boy asks in surprise if he didn't know her, to which Souma said he didn't.  The boy tells him that she's a prodigy at the school, how she's the youngest person to be a part of the Elite Ten council that makes decisions for the school, and how her clients are most of the top chefs.  Furthermore, if you served her a dish that didn't satisfy her, your life as a chef would be over.  [(I also liked how they included this bit from the one shot.)](http://i.imgur.com/LjGKkAc.png)

* **Who Dares to Challenge Me?!** - After seeing all the students run away, Hishoko asks Erina if this was okay.  Erina said how they were all useless and that they didn't deserve to be students at Tootsuki.  At this point, Erina said that she was going to try making a new dish in her room and Hishoko started fidgeting a little, to which Erina said that she'd let Hishoko try a dish.  [~~After our yuri OTP (Hishoko x Erina) set sail,~~](http://i.imgur.com/vxOM9go.png) Erina said that she was going to report to the higher ups that the number of new students entering was zero.  As Erina was ready to walk away, they hear a student ask if he can make whatever he wants.  This catches both Erina and Hishoko by surprise.  Erina said he can use eggs, but then asks him if it's even worth trying.  Souma then gets a little too friendly with Erina while he was saying how he was relieved to hear that he can still take the exam.  Hishoko then reprimands Souma for touching Erina and asks him if he knows who Erina-*sama* is, while going on to explain her position in the school to him.  Souma wasn't really listening to her as he was in awe about the sharpness of the knife he was holding, to which Hishoko and Erina told him to stop loitering around.  Erina then asks him one more time if he wants to do this.  [Souma then flips a knife in the air](http://gfycat.com/SmoggyCoolChick) while saying that if all he has to do is make her say it tastes good, he'll do it.

## Continued in the Next Post
>> ARTICLE
**Transforming Furikake** - Adapted

* **Gourmet vs. "Plebeian"** - After he says that he'll make her a dish, Hishoko shows more information to Erina on Souma.  She sees that he's from a special-of-the-day shop and makes a remark about how he's a second rate chef.  She furthermore says that he doesn't understand her nobility as a gourmet, just like a dog doesn't know the value of a gem when he sees it.  After saying that with his attitude, she'll try the food of the bottom feeders of the food industry, Souma tells her that he's going to make her one of his shop's specials.  As Hishoko wonders what kind of dish Souma is going to make Erina, Erina observes him as he's cooking.  She makes note that he finally started to use the eggs 10 minutes into making his dish and remarks to herself that he doesn't seem close to being done.  She then asks Souma what he's making, and he teases her for not realizing it up to this point.  She threatens to fail him, and asks him if he's even trying to make a dish that will satisfy her tongue.  He said that he's making Yukihira's Secret Menu #8, which is a Furikake Gohan (rice with dried food sprinkled on it).  When she hears this, she says not to screw around with her, that he's really a base chef and that this is such a waste of time.  He tells her to wait and says that it's not an ordinary Furikake.  [He says that it's a "transforming" furikake, which catches her interest.](http://i.imgur.com/hm5Vbg2.png)

* **Transforming Furikake** - He finishes the dish and presents it to Erina.  She looks at it in disgust and says that the exam is over.  She goes on to say that his dish isn't even worth considering, since she sits at the top of gourmet dining and that she doesn't crave a dish made by a second rate chef.  Souma isn't fazed by this and tells her that it hasn't shown it's true form yet.  She asks what he means by that, at which point she notices something glimmering within the furikake.  Souma then says that furikake shows it's true value when served over rice and [proceeds to pour the furikake on the rice.](http://i.imgur.com/6TA8zic.png) The instant it touches the rice, a gelatin-like substance starts to melt and intertwine with the egg and rice.  At this point, Erina notices that there's a scent of chicken in the dish and it makes her weak in the knees.  At this point, she's starting to get embarrassed and said that she'll give the dish just one bite and that if he wants to be judged, he should hand it over.  He gladly hands it over to her, and when she goes to take that one bite, she savors the flavor but forgot to judge it.  As she goes for a second bite, Souma teases her, saying that he thought that she was only going to take just one bite.  She gets more embarrassed and asks if he has any complaints about that, to which he said he's just joking and that she can have all she wants.  After taking another taste, she says that the flavor is given by aspic (jellied meat broth), to which Souma said she's correct, and [goes into explaining the process of how it's made.](http://i.imgur.com/Q6XfJo5.png) He then explained that once its put on top of white rice, the broth "jiggly" intertwined with the rice and egg in his dish. She then says to herself how the chicken broth was like a concentrated soup that made the eggs taste even more delicious, and how this is a flavor that she has never experience before; a world of tastes she doesn't know.  Souma asks Erina if she's glad she didn't leave before tasting the dish, to which she says that she's still judging it.  Souma then said that with creativity and ingenuity, common place food can be transformed into a gem, and this is what Yukihira's cooking is all about.  She starts getting all tsundere about how she, as a high-class gourmet, can't accept this dish that a "plebeian" cook had made.  She says internally that it tastes as if she's getting caressed by angel's wings, which leads into an [interesting](http://i.imgur.com/pzQF2xR.png) [foodgasm.](http://i.imgur.com/ZfKdezN.png)  Her knees weaken and she looses her balance.  Souma acknowledges that his food is ordinary and that she's probably part of the highest grade (of gourmets), but if she reclines on the seat of honor, there are probably things she can't make.  At this point, Souma then asks her what she thought of his dish.

* **And the Verdict Is...?!?!** - [She tells Souma...that...his dish was...terrible, which utterly shocks him.](http://i.imgur.com/4PgMFEL.png) After this, we see Erina walking fast saying to herself who does he (Souma) thinks she is, acting all high and mighty towards her.  She then slams her fist on the wall saying how he won't be forgiven and how people like him aren't needed in Tootsuki Academy.  Shen then proceeds to get in touch with her grandfather (the director of the academy) to inform him that the number of passing applicants from the transfer exam was zero, [while Souma was sitting on the grass dumbfounded by what had just happened.](http://i.imgur.com/VGFftp7.png)  

  (In the manga, we instead see the same French boy from before crying as he's talking to his mom on the phone, and then he sees Souma outside of the examination area.  He asks, in shock, in he had passed, to which a [surprised and shocked Souma said that it apparently was no good.](http://i.imgur.com/pzoOIxe.png)  After this exchange between the two, we flash back to Erina telling Souma (while in denial) that his dish was terrible, which shocks him beyond belief; this then led into the scene where she calls her grandfather to tell him no student passed the transfer exam.)

* **Was the Ruling Overturned?!?!** - The after credits scene showed an [older gentleman (Episode 3 Minor Spoiler)](/s "Nakiri Senzaemon, the director of Tootsuki Academy") tasting and enjoying Souma's Transforming Furikake.  [Afterwards, he then crumples up Souma's results that said he had failed.](http://i.imgur.com/WGtQfRY.png)  (*Aside*: I also like how they [showed him standing by the door to the examination area](http://i.imgur.com/VOhn5Qi.jpg) while Souma was making his dish for Erina.)

---

This week was a fun episode.  I love how JC Staff has remained very faithful to the manga, and hence my hopes for a great adaptation are still intact!  We're introduced to ~~tsundere~~ Nakiri Erina and Arato Hisako this episode; this won't certainly be the last we see of them, although they won't be appearing as much as one would hope.  The future interactions between Erina and Souma will be *great*.  I'm excited that [best girl (and waifu)](http://i.imgur.com/FiYk4k7.jpg) [](/s "Tadokoro Megumi") will be introduced next episode.  [In addition, we will also be seeing a bunch of new faces](/s "i.e. some of the "rivals" he'll be facing throughout the series") next episode!

Many thanks for reading my post this week! I hope you're looking forward to next week's episode as much as I am!
>> ARTICLE
i JUST read the manga (ok, straight after i finished ep1 to be precise)

I was confused this episode, thinking i'd already seen it all. THAT is how accurate the adaptation is so far. Almost literally pixel for pixel, word for word.

Actually after reading ch1, same feeling, how i'd just seen it animated and it was basically identical, just still. I'm so so excited. Shokugeki is the first (or second, danmachi at the same time) manga i've read, and couldn't stop.

When it comes to adapting source material, J.C.Staff do a fantastic job at bringing it to life and Food Wars! is no exception - they're my favourite studio and I don't see that changing. I love the manga and they're doing a great job, and this is the show I'm most excited to watch each week out of the seven or so I'm following.

It might not be a show that'll appeal to everyone but I love the cast, the humour, how the food and crazier moments of the show are animated, the voice-acting and OST are top-notch and I'm in love with the ED - the dancing around the table is so cute and it looks like the face before that scene will change with each episode. It's such a feel-good show and if you're enjoying what you've seen so far, then know that it only gets better - might wanna eat beforehand or have something to snack on during, though!

It's nice to see more of the cast get animated this episode too, even if it was mostly more Erina. Can't wait to see more of them in the coming weeks, they're amazing!

Did you also notice that they added in the grandpa being at the exam and his partial strip? SO GOOD THIS ADAPTATION
>> ARTICLE
I did! Well, not the partial strip, haha. May have to watch it again!
>> ARTICLE
the strip wasn't even in the manga, but by his actions later it certainly fits what the result is perfectly, and i'm guessing was something not decided for teh character to do so early on.
>> ARTICLE
Just picked up the series today and totally loving it.

I don't think anyone mentioned it yet, but [the dining scene in ED](http://i.imgur.com/o0eOTLH.jpg) is a parody of [Leonardo da Vinci's last supper](http://i.imgur.com/b5Qvylm.jpg) painting.

>> ARTICLE
Well, the mangaka did draw hentai, so...
>> ARTICLE
To be fair they are on different levels of lewdness

Perfect Simpsons quote "They call it the penetrata. It makes sex look like a church"
>> ARTICLE
More of what I expected based on the last episode. Turning up the drama to 11 really helps. Maybe that's just me? I understand if some people aren't into that stuff, but I really like when a show either doesn't take itself too seriously or, in the case of Soma, takes itself *so fucking seriously* that you can't help laugh at the ludicrousness of some of the concepts, I just really enjoy it. In my opinion, that elevates the show and just lets you have fun, with something that could be dull or very lighthearted (Koufuku Graffiti was not dull, but it is definitely lighthearted).

JC Staff is really doing some good stuff here. [Light spoilers](/s "The Yuri-esque scene between Hisako and Erina was fucking great"), and the tricks of dutch angles, fast hand movements, etc. work again. What really steals the show is Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Souma. I've heard him in so much stuff, but he's just so undoubtedly *perfect* as Soma that I can't help but enjoy it.

If there's a complaint I have, its that I'm not sure how far of an adaptation this anime can go, since a good stopping point is a bit of the ways in, and this is only the second chapter, IIRC. But overall, this is a strong manga adaptation.

EDIT: Made a quick check. This does chapter 3 as well. Two chapters in an episode is the standard thing for a reason. I slightly take back what I said about pace.
>> ARTICLE
The series has seriously benefitted by getting animated even though the lewdness has noticably increased.

I seriously hope that they keep the referential humor related to Hisako during the tournament if they cover so far.

>> ARTICLE
Not sure where you see an increase.  The entire foodgasm scene is in the Manga as well. 
>> ARTICLE
The foodgasm is, but seeing it in anime form is something else. Quite frankly, it benefits so much from being on screen
>> ARTICLE
yeah like the tentacle scene in the last ep was SIGNIFICANTLY lewd-er vs manga.
>> ARTICLE
It's not that it is or isn't there, but watching it in the anime is quite different to me than reading through a manga. Just the moaning and added color adds to it substantially.
>> ARTICLE
Ah! The moans and the fidgetting... I will probably never get tired of it in this show.
>> ARTICLE
So excited!

Erina's fantasies are always amusing.

_Those eyes_

So far, JC Staff is doing a fantastic job with this adaptation. It's everything I could want and more as a big fan of the manga. Great animation, great voices for the characters, and great foodgasms!

Hopefully we get some Megumi next episode?!?!

You have to be able to smell the chicken broth being released

That doesn't bring anything to the presentation of a dish.

To me it looks like comfort food, which is fine he even said it in the show that it was simple.

But the show made the dish look way more interesting than the picture, doesn't take anything away from the taste.
>> ARTICLE
Well the anime did also emphasize the broth cubes. The picture isn't lighted in a way that would show that
>> ARTICLE
If you ask me the anime does a way better job at presenting it than what it actually looks like.

It might be because I'm not that familiar with Japanese comfort food, but that dish looks kinda dull if you ask me.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's also because, as I mentioned, the food looks best when lighted in a very particular way. It's the same for all dishes. 

I believe your reaction is exactly why Erina had that reaction in the anime as well - most comfort food doesn't actually look that great (in terms of actual presentation) because they don't need to be
>> ARTICLE
Everything looks better in good light.

Exactly my point, but I still believe that the show did a good job at presenting a dish which is otherwise dull as something exciting.

The idea is fun and all, but melting gelatine isn't exactly the most exciting thing in the world, the show however makes you totally excited for it!
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha totally agreed! Well, that's why watching food shows is so much fun, lol
>> ARTICLE
Not Japanese but it looks pretty fucking tasty to me. I am Asian though (Korean) so maybe it's a cultural thing. Our comfort foods tend to be simple or staple dishes and get us salivating despite their appearance.
>> ARTICLE
Well, all comfort foods are simple that is usually the nature of them.

The only experience I've had with authentic asian style food is China, and their presentation was usually more luxourious, but that might have been because of how you ordered as a party rather than your own dish.

I just think the dish would gain more from being rustic if the gelatine doesn't do anything else than soak the rice.

I must say that Souma reflects so much about my issue with cooking.

I've been raised in the hospitality industry, starting from Chinese Restaurants. Our food isn't the best out there, definitely, but we are extremely confident that our food taste pretty amazing honestly. I can bear with all the other issues I had with my financial life because of how content I am of my food life; it's what makes or breaks my day.

Yet, as I move along in my career, I find myself confronted with high class cuisines, and I came to a point of my life I dislike cooking. Everything was unnecessarily elaborate. Here I am, making topped bruschetta's/ crackers that takes the same amount of time for me to make one full main dish back in my Chinese/Thai restaurant days.

Or some Fish that has been marinated, broiled, curled, thrown in the oven. I can make two fish dishes in that amount of time, with much larger portions.

The taste? It was nice, but nothing spectacular that can't be done with correct seasoning/ingredient mixtures and marinate.

Yet this is what people are paying for; the level of cooking you need to have to be able to attract the higher class audience, despite the fact that in many cases, my potato curry puff will taste just as unique or nice, and I can prep a whole party worth at a time.

Souma's idea of using simple ingredients to make the perfected dish resonates with me. Enough with lobsters, scotch fillers, eels or truffles; give me some rice and some eggs and I can whip you some nice golden rice.

This adaptation is everything I wanted so far. The music is good almost to the point of unfitting for a cooking anime. The pace was ramped up a bit which is very much appreciated. I'm looking forward to the next episode which will probably reach the end of the first volume of material.

Guys, I know the show is cool and all, but man the soundtrack! I really dig the music, and it's pretty much my favorite part right now! Godly.

It really reminds me of Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon, which is my favorite anime. The OST sounds so similiar, but apparently they have different sound directors..

Nice of best girl to make an appearance in this episode, even if I utterly hate her at this point. I don't remember the little yuri scene with her sidekick though, but everything else is perfectly adapted, with Soma's personality being as brilliantly smug as ever. Honestly this is just a fun anime to watch in all regards.
>> ARTICLE
That scene did happen. But it was only one small panel.
>> ARTICLE
I won't even discuss this best girl stuff since I'm part of a very small faction. It's not even a ship so far.
>> ARTICLE
Not even in the manga at this point is it a ship since it will requite much, much more frequent interaction between the two.
>> ARTICLE
But she is a romantic potential at least. Yuuki on the other hand...
>> ARTICLE
I'm still loving that it is following the manga perfectly. And based on this episode and what it looks like next episode is covering, each episode will probably cover 2-3 chapters of the manga. 

Episode 3 will be "The Demon King Talks About "Gems"" and "The Chef That Doesn't Smile" from the preview.

And I can see them doing Episode 4 with "Maria of the Polar Star", "Lawless Area", and "A Dish that Calls for Spring".

And it's also pretty awesome that they're throwing in extra stuff, like the scene from when Erina was a baby, which is actually from Chapter 0 of the manga, from the original Oneshot version that was it attempting to get serialized. It's a neat little touch. 
>> ARTICLE
this >>>> koufuku graffitti
>> ARTICLE
The unfortunate part here is that we have more than 100 manga chapters so far, and the anime is actually moving through them pretty slowly based on the first few chapters. How many seasons will we need so that we can see the show in full?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, I'm kinda getting a little agitated at JC Staff oversexualizing the foodgasm scenes to a degree way more than the manga did. They're upping the ecchi even more overall. It's going to get uncomfortable if they keep doing this which detracts from how great the series is in regards to the characters and food battles. It already turned off quite a number of people who otherwise would have loved it.
>> ARTICLE
Just read the related manga chapters. The scenes you critisize in this episode all come straight from the manga, with similar emphasis.

The only thing that seems to happen is that the manga as it is in current arc and the last arc is a lot less heavy on these scenes. But the earlier chapters absolutely had it like in the anime now.
>> ARTICLE
I already did. What I'm saying is that the anime version is more fanservicey compared to the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what you mean about JC oversexualizing it, it seems pretty goddamn accurate to the manga, give or take a few creative liberties they've taken for a couple scenes cough cough tentacle scene cough cough*
>> ARTICLE
Go back to the first two chapters and compare them to the first two episodes. You'll notice a few things. The foodgasm scenes are only a panel in the manga; they are about 15 - 30 seconds in the anime. Just look at the squid scene where in the anime it looked like the squid was penetrating the girl (I forgot her name) unlike the manga.  The manga doesn't have boobs jiggling every time the female characters walk. The manga also doesn't keep framing shots on the girls's asses and boobs. 
>> ARTICLE
you do realize how slow they're going for this. Some shows get the full half a volume in the first episode. So for the beginning pace of 1 episode per chapter make it something that's worth dragging. Now we can judge if the foodgasms change drastically but I don't see a problem when it's something to grab the attention of the audience that is mostly japan. You can criticize all you want and how it's still oversexualized, you gotta accept it because the majority of the animes now include. I hate them too but it's bringing in money for them so it's not going away soon. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they've done anything to make someone who would/does like the manga dislike the anime yet. The only reason the scenes seem "oversexualized" in the anime is because of the added color/voices.
>> ARTICLE
It has made people who don't read the manga drop the series based on the ecchiness alone. So it is kinda a big deal. The scenes are more sexualized because there is more emphasis on the ecchi rather than the comedy of the foodgasms.
>> ARTICLE
They're doing a great job making a faithful adaptation of the manga so far, so it's not like they're alienating people that are already fans. I'm sure there are also people who enjoy ecchi anime but don't read the manga that are watching it too (I personally know a few). If people don't like the ecchi, they wouldn't be reading the manga anyway, and I don't see a reason for JC Staff to try to appeal to a completely different group of people with the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Is the anime there just to appeal to the fanbase of the manga, or should it try to be accessible without making people feel uncomfortable. I have seen people who don't like ecchi but like the manga. That's because the ecchi is not that bad. But I have seen alot of people drop the anime because of the fanservice. The anime has dialed up the fanservice from like 5 to 9. That's all I'm saying. I'm just hoping the fanservice gets toned down just like in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Again, the only reason the fanservice seems "dialed up" is because it isn't just still images anymore. I don't see a problem with an ecchi anime being ecchi.
>> ARTICLE
Because it's not an ecchi anime. At least the manga isn't. That is the problem. People are having the false impression that this series is just an ecchi anime with cooking as a gimmick instead of the other way around. The character interactions and food battles are the focus of the series, not the fanservice. You don't think the anime is overdoing the fanservice just a little bit? 
>> ARTICLE
it's tagged ecchi, I don't know why people are surprised or shocked,  anyone that will watch this would expect stuff like this. 
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering what Souma was doing when he was making a broth and also beating some eggs. That's a combination that I very rarely see in cooking. And by rarely, I mean I've only seen it for egg drop soups.

If you've ever refrigerated meat broth soups, only to see it very gelatinous when you want to have some later, that's aspic. I know a lot of my friends get real creeped out when they discover it, but it's completely fine and safe.

Never thought about putting it on hot rice though. That just seems weird texturally speaking. 

Also 0/10 worst anime, reinforces bad knife habits to the audience.

>> ARTICLE
I can't cook for shit and the show is still pretty good
>> ARTICLE
Would love to see you/chefs chime in on experience or elaboration on anime's cookery.  
>> ARTICLE
i'm planning on starting the manga very soon which i hear is even better so far.

as far as cooking and food in general, most of it, when it does pop up, is pretty generic. i'm sure we all know the whole cabbage quality thing which ive always found hilarious, but this show is on a whole other level from any anime ive seen.  
like in this episode for example, souma's attitude towards experience vs formal education, especially during his introduction at the assembly. that shit rings true everywhere. someone who's been cooking the last 8 years straight out of high school will absolutely outperform a green culinary grad from a top school, even if he cant pronounce the name of the dish he's making.

and learning about the use of honey as a meat tenderizer through trial and error, that's what cooking, especially these days, is all about. this also shows in his really terrible creations, regardless of whether he is trying to make something good or just blowing off steam by intentionally making nightmare-inducing monstrosities.  
in cooking as well as everything else in life, progress only happens when you push the boundaries.

**tl;dr** i'm a total fucking SnS fanboy already

i'd like to hear some opinions from others in the industry too
>> ARTICLE
I only just start reading the manga and it is good! 

I read part of (Shouta no Sushi)[http://myanimelist.net/manga/14775/Shouta_no_Sushi] when I was young and thought that nothing will be able to top those ridiculous foodgasm expressions. Who knows hentai and gourmet manga is a good match!

I'm not a chef but I cook to feed. I always follow pragmatic approaches that allow me to pick up and evaluate recipes for best combination of efficiency, nutrition value and taste. 

There are some techniques in this series (and other gourmet mangas) that seems far fetch. Take this episode for instance: "use honey to tenderize brisket beef to an extent that 15 minutes of simmering is as good as 1 hours of slow cook when without". Is this a common technique in trade? Wouldn't the addition of honey throw off the balance of desire taste or nutrition (I doubt it's healthy to use honey for every single beef dish, is it?)?

EDIT:

> progress only happens when you push the boundaries.

Very true LPT. This doesn't happen to my cooking, but that's what I follow for my profession. I never believe in "trade secret", those are the words from who wish not to improve.

>> ARTICLE
yeah i'm positive the honey trick doesnt work *that* quickly, but can probably save a bit of time compared to other marinades.

and i know it may not seem like much of a difference to non-industry folk, but i just feel the need to say that i am by no means a chef yet. i still have a ways to go lol
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat. The manga really hits home in the later chapters. If you're curious you should check out the [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShokugekiNoSoma). From there you'll be able to find links where you can read each chapter. 


One thing: the manga isn't as food porny as the anime, and it goes in more in depth about the industry. Not saying there isn't any food porn in there, but they also list the recipes and techniques a little more.
>> ARTICLE
The recipes are actually pretty accurate except one dish that you probably won't see until the second cour/season
>> ARTICLE
Well the manga does have an actual chef consultant so im pretty sure all dishes in the manga are pretty accurate

Even with liquid nitrogen those dishes seem a little extreme to me, but then again I'm no chef and I wasn't trained with any techniques to cook.") The cooking skills in this series look legit so I might research them and try them. Would be cool if the honey thing actually helps tenderize the meat. Gonna try that on my next roast if that's true.

Other foods that tenderizes meat are pineapples and kiwis

They did show the spice guy though, which makes me wonder why since he's really only in the latest chapters of the manga, hwo many episodes is this? I mean it would be weird to show characters, but to never get to that arc, unless they're planning for alot of episodes 
>> ARTICLE
The spice guy shows up [manga spoiler](/s "during the autumn elections arc. I'm thinking of Akira Hayama although I dunno if you mean another one.") I don't know how far they can adapt to but if it's the guy I'm thinking of, it's definitely not in the latest chapters. Unless it's a different spice guy. Still I wonder how they can get to that point given all the material before that.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm... [manga stuff](/s "I'm reading through it now and yes I noticed they introduced a lot of characters which will only be introduced in the Election Arc, I'm mid way through that myself, and I wonder if they will skip Training Camp arc... It doesnt make much sense but I don't see the need to show so many characters from that Arc in this third episode if they aren't going to do anything so only logical thought process would be that... But that's in Autumn a lot goes on between Spring and Autumn so I hope they dont butcher it...
They also showed everyone from Polar Star and other characters like the Witch, think I saw Alice in there too, and some other guys but if this is a 24 episode show I can't see them making all the way throught the election arc... so I really wonder... Maybe since the explanations can be done faster in animation than manga maybe they can do one match per episode... but it's still a stretch...")

The most I know is that major Japanese corporations have often been threatened by or otherwise made to cooperate with yakuza. The racket is called [*sokaiya*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%8Dkaiya).

In my opinion the former had more of an impact.

And for those interested, this episode covers chapter 4 and 5 of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Is that a scanlation? I just checked my manga copy and it says "this institute is nothing but a stepping stone to me", so what the anime went with is closer to what's officially translated. I think the former would be way too harsh for Soma to say.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's from a scanlation. I had a hunch that it was not correctly translated, but thanks for checking. 

>> ARTICLE
Scanlation Soma is much more of an asshole.  His catchphrase in the scans is "It wasn't much" while the official translation is "Hope you liked it."  I don't know which one is more correct, but the former is such a jerk thing to say.
>> ARTICLE
Gosomatsu is probably more accurately as 'it wasn't much'. Since its usually said after people say "Gochisosama'. Then you reply with that phrase, which literally means the meal was roughly made/not delicate. It's just a form of being humble. 
>> ARTICLE
It's an awkward phrase to translate, "it wasn't much" is closer to the literal meaning but I think "hope you liked it" get's the point accross to english speakers more effectively. The phrase is osomatsu(samadeshita) and it's japanese humble speech. His response is humility in response to the praise, it's not really a jerk thing it's just kinda awkward to translate in one phrase.

Well the way manga is written it will probably cower the 3 years of high school and Erina is pretty much laid out as the last boss. I guess  they will mellow out in their second year with Soma probably losing to her.

Hmm... that kinda sounds like the Nisekoi hierarchy to me. Where I'm guessing Erina only shows up for the big moments with Souma and Megumi gets all the little moments, with the best girl sprinkled on the side.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, not really.  It's very easy to make a Chitoge/Erina and Onodera/Megumi comparison, but it doesn't really pan out.  Megumi's basically the second protagonist, while Soma and Erina just kind of run into each other now and then.  Long term, that might change, but for now, again, there's barely any romance anyway.
>> ARTICLE
> Nisekoi

You'll be seeing a lot of that...
>> ARTICLE
Erina is nowhere close to being best girl. Literally any side character is better than her.
>> ARTICLE
There are two types of main girl: the bitch queen and the sweet but unattainable. The unattainable girl is best girl right off the bat, while the bitch queen goes through a long character arc and (hopefully) turns into best girl, or at least acceptable girl.

Megumi and Soma confirmed one True Meatbun.

I guess this is what it would look like if Tatsuya Shiba became a chef.

Too early to tell.

Now, if he blew up China with the power of his cooking and the UN didn't charge him for war crimes because it's not nuclear, then we'll be talking.

The long awaited debut of megumi has finally come. REJOICE PEOPLE BECAUSE THE TRUW BEST GIRL HAS ARRIVED. All HAIL MEGUMI 
>> ARTICLE
I will totally ~~eat the MegumiXSoma meatbun~~~ Ship these two! 
>> ARTICLE
I love how J.C.Staff are perfectly adapting the manga so far! Food Wars! is easily the show I'm looking forward to most each week out of the seven or so shows I'm following, and I just can't get enough of it.

Glad to see Megumi and the rest of Polaris Dormitory this episode. I'm absolutely loving the OST and can't wait for its official release, and the animation, humour, voice-acting and everything else has been top-notch again this week.

I'm not sure why but I always imagined Yuki to have a 'dirty blonde' sort of hair colour but it's more like a mix between brown and ginger here. I thought her eyes would be brown too, so I was really off compared to how I imagined everyone else, haha. Absolutely loving Food Wars! though, I hope it's two cours! I think it's likely as Dungeon? (also J.C.Staff) feels like it'll be one cour with how quickly they're blasting through the light novels whilst Food Wars! is pretty much recreating the manga scene for scene.
>> ARTICLE
I can't say it's perfectly adapting the manga since the anime is going overboard with the ecchi and placing more emphasis on the foodgasms rather than the cooking.
>> ARTICLE
The manga definitely explained more cooking-wise but I don't feel like the foodgasms are anymore overdone than they were in the manga. I don't feel like it's losing anything the way it's going.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah and the food preparation scenes are just fantastic. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, I really hope Erina and Souma become friends.

It would be awesome to see them cook side-by-side.

Shokugeki No soma = 24 episode long
>> ARTICLE
Don't think the episode count's been officially confirmed anywhere.

2 cour at this pace would cut off right at the start of the Fall elections, which I guess would work.  Though if it's more than that, I really hope it speeds up at some point.  6 episodes of curry would be too much.  That arc is too long in general.
>> ARTICLE
Confirmed by French's simulcast source (Anime Digital Network)
>> ARTICLE
24 episodes are NOT gonna be able to cover the arc these guys are introduced in.
>> ARTICLE
they are going until the Hellish Camp, and some of them show up there
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember those 3 explicitly showing up during that arc. They'll probably be shoehorned in the arc somehow. Their big "introduction arc" doesn't happen until later.
>> ARTICLE
JC Staff has done this before. Specifically, in Railgun, they introduced a character from a completely different arc and did nothing with her. I could be wrong, but I'm just saying they've already set a precedent for doing so.

Daihaseisai arc when ;_;

^^^^^^misaki ^^^^^^best ^^^^^^girl

I don't mind, it's really interesting I think.

Also given the amount of support and praise the anime's been getting from newcomers and manga readers, it seems that we will be getting season 2

> I don't remember those 3 explicitly showing up during that arc.

The only one that doesn't is [Manga spoiler](/s "Hayama Akira"). The rest get introduced during camp.

Nope, Yandere and China Dress don't show up either.

>> ARTICLE
Still trying to figure out if hes going to be an MC like [Tatsuya](http://myanimelist.net/character/55743/Tatsuya_Shiba) or like all the other MCs that fight through things with friendship.
>> ARTICLE
Soma isn't a genius. He's a hardworker. He works harder than everybody else in the series to perfect his cooking. That's why he has so many failure dishes. He's constantly trying out new and weird shit to see what works.
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking he's going to be more a Tatsuya type character, except for the fact that he's not boring and emotionless.
>> ARTICLE
So, nothing like Tatsuya Shiba.
>> ARTICLE
Add in a ton of cooking defects and you're ready to go.
>> ARTICLE
That guy is the sole reason I dropped that show, all the other stuff was actually interesting. I hope Souma won't turn out like him.
>> ARTICLE
Souma becomes even more likable later on :)

>> ARTICLE
I already like him haha. Yes, he seems OP right now but the way he is is fine in my book. The MC in Mahouka something something was OP too but I could not stand his personality at all.
>> ARTICLE
I recommend you read the manga as it's just THAT awsome :)
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling he is going ti be a Tatsuya like character for most of the show, it would seem weird if he suddenly lost confidence because he wasn't sure how to do something.
>> ARTICLE
I equate him to the MC from yakitate Japan really if people remember that show.
>> ARTICLE
Hell no! I hate Tatsuya's character so much. Too OP without any true weaknesses, whereas Soma actually has defects  and significant ones, at that!
>> ARTICLE
Well his background to suffice that OPness that hes giving off is the ridiculous experience in the kitchen from a kid and competing against his dad so much. So not cop out like Tatsuya but not really relying on friendship power either, easily one of the best/most likeable mcs in a series.
>> ARTICLE
Its funny because there is going to be an arc about everyone coming to terms with the fact that he is a good cook.
>> ARTICLE
He is going to seem OP for the beginning part of the series but as it goes on, you'll be able to see his weaknesses in his cooking style and knowledge. He then works hella hard to remove these weaknesses. He's a pretty balanced MC actually.
>> ARTICLE
You take this MC, throw it in a pot, add some genius ability, characters to make fool of, and a damsel in distress. Baby, youve got a Stu going. 
>> ARTICLE
whats Erina's problem why does she hate him so much, i dont get it...

great episode tho as usual.......... 
>> ARTICLE
Because she is used to be n1 and that everyone knows about. Then comes this random dude and basically laugh in her face and later declare that the school that she has worked pretty hard in is simply a stepping stone and it will be easy because they are inexperienced brats that hasn't worked in a proper restaurant. 

After all she is still a kid even though she is a genius. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it was that she hates that someone of Soma's social class could make such great food that even her God Tongue found delicious.
>> ARTICLE
If you watch this anime youll sooner or later have to accept that every second person is [Character Spoiler](/s "arrogant,boasting and discriminating a-hole at first"). But that makes Souma even more likable! :P
>> ARTICLE
Extreme tsun. She can't reconcile his personality with the food he makes, so she lashes out. 
>> ARTICLE
They're either going to become best buds or arch-enemies.

I'm rooting for friends because her character seems pretty interesting.
>> ARTICLE
>I'm rooting for friends because her character seems pretty interesting.

Why, she's terrible, she failed him because of his social class, that's not cool, also it would be cool to see more of a enemies dynamics between to main character that are male and female instead of the usual romance stuff which almost always goes no where.
>> ARTICLE
Yeeesss, enough love I want *hatred.*
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this guy knows what am talking about....
>> ARTICLE
Well I like erina-sama because 

1) she is a tsundere and I love tsunderes

2) I like her character design the most out of the female characters so that's a plus

3) Zettai Ryoiki is always good

4) she is a tsundere
>> ARTICLE
I like a Tsundere as much as the next person(probably even more) but there has to be something more. All the stuff you listed has nothing to do with the character, except the generalisation of being a tsundere, so far there is nothing to like, at least in the anime... maybe by the end of the season I'll change my mind... but for now she is terrible person even for a tsundere..
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Her overly-cocky attitude just pisses me off and I want to see Souma beat her ass down.
>> ARTICLE
That tasty ZR
>> ARTICLE
her zettai Ryoiki is on point honestly, and they don't even shy away from close-up shots. She's giving other best girl Rin a run for her ZR money. 
>> ARTICLE
NO, NOT RIN!
>> ARTICLE
She's been praised her entire life. She's the top of an elite group of people, people with higher credentials have come in and failed miserably. So for essentially a nobody to come in and first of all not know who she is then act cocky while making a simple dish and lastly make something she's enjoyed has never happened to her. 


>> ARTICLE
One thing I don't get is the fact that last episode we saw how well known Souma's dad is in the world. Shouldn't the name Yukihara bear enough weight to scare at least some of those cooking "elite" or is it more the fact that Yukihira is such a common enough Japanese family name that people think they are unrelated.
>> ARTICLE
This is a spoiler, kinda, but not important enough to tag. He changed name when he married Souma's mom.
>> ARTICLE
[minor spoiler](/s "I believe Yukihira is Soma's mom's last name.  His dad changed his name when he got married.")
>> ARTICLE
So she not judging him(or anyone else) on talent rather on a person's reputation or knowledge of her..... and being praise all the time doesn't equal you demeaning everyone else.... 
>> ARTICLE
She didn't fail him for that reason though, I was just saying why she acts like how she does. She failed him because she felt he was talking down to her, which lets be honest Soma was acting arrogant from the minute he walked through the door
>> ARTICLE
if Erina knew, who his father is, she wouldn't hate him that much ;D
Either way, ErinaXSouma all the way!

>> ARTICLE
I really really don't like Erina. She's actually so Tsundere and stuck up it actively pisses me off.

I'm loving the MC, and the food looks delicious. I'm also really digging the music, especially the OP.

But, does this show ever cool off with the whole ecchi food orgasm thing that it's been doing? I know a lot of people like that kind of thing, but it's a big turn off for me.
>> ARTICLE
The ecchi gets toned down significantly later in the manga. However the anime is going overboard with it and the fanservice. It has so far been way more sexual in the anime then the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, I guess I'll just have to get over it, since I like the rest of the show. I'll have to pick up the manga as well
>> ARTICLE
No, the whole food orgasm thing is very prevalent in the manga and so it will be in the show. Sorry you're not enjoying that aspect but hopefully you continue on watching!

I really like the other aspects of the show, so I'll most likely just get over the echhi as the show goes on. I'll definitely keep watching

Hohowee sweet lawdy that honey scene. Ahem! This show is up there when it comes to entertainment and cooking action. Seems like we're gonna have a lot of new characters introduced next episode. Already loving Megumi and her being paired up with our MC, the dynamic is just great.

I hope the recipes in the series don't get too complicated. I mean, it would make sense in terms of progression but it is funny trying to make these things yourself. 

This one looks like it will take more of a commitment than bacon and potatoes. 
>> ARTICLE
This is an amazing cooking show!

It demonstrates its knowledge of nutrients in foods and how you can use/exploit them in making meals. The best part is that it explains it very well, like Sherlock Holmes cracking the case or something. "Elementary, my dear Megumi!".

This would be worth showing off to people who'd like a good cooking anime! Too bad it's also ecchi shit!

The only flaw of this anime is his catchphrase, everything else exceeded my expectations.

Actually, it was the translation. He always says Osomatsu, in Japanese. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, so was it the manga translation, or the anime translation, that was inaccurate?
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm not sure what each sub group generally says, but the catch phrase in Japanese is always Osomatsu, which is a pun cause his name has Soma in it. 
>> ARTICLE
I see, thanks for clarifying (:

>> ARTICLE
Kiritsugu didn't kill El melloi, he just used a multiverse bullet to transport him here.
>> ARTICLE
From a strict story perspective, Megumi is a bad partner for Soma. Since she'll get expelled for a single E, that means that Soma can't possibly fail at anything.

Unless, of course, the show is willing to get rid of Megumi. But I suspect that the show is not that bold. Or maybe they'll just make the partnership a one-time thing.
>> ARTICLE
All I can say is your opinion's gonna do a complete 180 later on.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll love the last part of hell camp arc if the anime does gets to it.

On the other hand, Soma already lose in episode 1. Saying anything more would be spoilery though, but it's worth to say that Soma does have one of the best ~~character~~ maturity building in the manga.

Bitches about ecchi in an ecchi anime.

*sarcastic clap clap*
>> ARTICLE
You are aware that the manga from which the anime is adapted from has significantly less ecchi/fanservice in it than the anime right? It's not supposed to be an ecchi anime. It's supposed to be a cooking anime with a little ecchi in it. As of right now, the anime is placing more emphasis on the foodgasms rather than the cooking whereas the manga did the opposite. I can criticize the direction the adaption is taking can't I?

I wouldn't say that there is less ecchi elemnts in the manga(except maybe if you count flashbacks), but it isn't nearly as in your face as when it is animated.

[Tsundere Erina](http://i.imgur.com/mwBnWpk.png) vs [Innocent Megumi](http://i.imgur.com/or6vZWT.png) - wonder who's going to win the Soma-bowl in Season 2

Edit: [choices are hard](http://i.imgur.com/jTg2XGd.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
In season 2 no one, in season 5 maybe we can get an answer to that.
>> ARTICLE
Have y'all forgotten the line from, like, episode 3 or 4 where his dad says he needs to find someone to cook for and then Soma says, to Erina, "I'll make something that you can't help but find delicious" or some other bullshit? Erina wins out in the end but it's a fun little love square with Soma/Megumi/Erina/Nikumi.
>> ARTICLE
[Are you implying Erina even has a chance?](http://i.imgur.com/xpPEEZX.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
If this were a romcom, Erina would be the one to bet on.  When was the last time the shy girl beat out the tsundere?
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats!
>> ARTICLE
Megumi is the Onodera of Shokugeki (with better writing/character development though)

She may be the cute favorite of a portion of the fanbase but with how the series is set up she's ~~gonna~~ likely to lose Soma-bowl to the tsundere.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, honestly Erina is not even competing yet, not one single thing has happened. And she is even below Nikumi. There are, even on the manga, only 2 candidates. Erina is not one of them. The story isn't lining anything up.
>> ARTICLE
Except Souma spends no time at all with Erina. Unless a radical change, shipping them would feel forced as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
He starts to spend a lot more time with her eventually.  In the new arc in the manga, it's heavily hinted that he will be helping her greatly.
>> ARTICLE
[This](https://i.imgur.com/mA0G4Xw.png) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/nS7FW7L.png) convinced me otherwise. Megumi doesn't really fit into this foreshadowing since she has already accepted Soma as an amazing cook. Erina's rejection of his cooking and his promise to make her say "It's good" makes believe in this ship since he will have to always impress her and so on. Also on amount of interaction []( /s "The current manga arc seems to be setting up with Soma helping/saving Erina from her father as well as the Academy, so I've dubbed the upcoming arc "Erina Retrieval Arc" or "Tootsuki Civil War" so this will give prime material for Erina winning Soma-bowl or at least getting a good lead.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but that was at the very beginning of the manga and hasn't really been a relevant thing since he pretty much forgets about the whole "trying to make her admit he's good at cooking" thing since he just focuses on improving his own cooking. Megumi has always been by Souma's side throughout the whole thing and still remains at his side. Souma has done so much for her(saved her from expulsion, inspired her, etc.) and she admires him immensely for all of that. They've had tons of cute scenes together like at the end of this episode and in [here](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/03/07/s/read53197dec48d5f/img000019.png) and [here](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/03/07/s/read53197dec48d5f/img000020.png). [](/s "Sure the current arc is probably going to end with Souma saving Erina and she becomes more dere for him, but it's probably not going to give her a huge lead in the Soumabowl since she's barely even done anything in the first place.")
>> ARTICLE
> "trying to make her admit he's good at cooking" thing since he just focuses on improving his own cooking.

Well those two can go hand in hand honestly. Even though she found his initial dish to be good to begin with, it may reach a level (hence Souma improving himself) where she just can't say no to it.

>hasn't really been a relevant thing since he pretty much forgets about the whole "trying to make her admit he's good at cooking" 

And it's going to be relevant in the future or at least it should or it's pretty lackluster writing to introduce that in the first place if it wasn't going anywhere. It's a practice done before, where the author introduces some overlying goal/dream/characteristic trait/ in the beginning of the arc and just have it sit in the back seat until the future. Especially in shounen series. I highly doubt it's going to just disappear and it will come back at some point in the future.


>> ARTICLE
Can't really disagree with the evidence for Megumi ship. I can't really say that he has forgotten about his promise since it hasn't really been the focus of an arc yet. We still have yet to see how she reacts to the reveal of who Soma's father is and the current arc is set up to be quite a meaty one so there will be room for some major development for Soma and Erina that might make it on par with how they've developed Megumi.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with the Erina ship is that everything seems so forced. From the foreshadowing of her admiration of Joichiro's cooking, to the tsundere tendencies and even the recent arc of [how](/s "Gramp Principal who was evicted by his sadist son set-up Souma's enrollment in Tootsuki so he can help Erina.")

Unlike the Megumi ship, it felt natural. Starting off as friends, growing and being best buddies to have each other's back.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly the vast majority of manga story lines have romances, love lines/triangles that seem explicitly obvious on who's going to end up with who. 
>> ARTICLE
I would agree, but I feel like this series is different. Even if for comedic effect, it likes subverting expectations like with Takumi for instance. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Too bad for Megumi. Though the S1 ending scene had my heart twitching with Souma and Megumi's scene in the balcony. <*Doki!Doki!*>
>> ARTICLE
I really like the Souma and Megumi, but the foreshadowing at the beginning is too strong for him to end up with anyone but Erina imo.

Souma's Dad told him to find a woman he wants to cook for the rest of his life (internal monologue in like ep 1 or 2). Right after that who is introduced? Erina. I'm sure they could ignore this as it hasn't really been addressed throughout the series (I haven't read the Manga yet so who knows if there are more hints), but based on just that single scene...Erina probably has it.

>> ARTICLE
Current manga arc says hi.

Yeah for some reason Japan really, REALLY loves their generic tsundere's, regardless of whether they are even a likable or interesting character.

HNNGGGGGGGGGGGG ITS MY SEASON 2 AND I NEED IT NOW
>> ARTICLE
Welp. It's been a fun ride. Here's hoping for a [2nd Season!](http://i.imgur.com/xNm8kZa.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
If you guys want to see how this arc ends, I encourage you to join us over at /r/ShokugekiNoSoma. I'd personally suggest reading from the start since the anime skipped over a really good few chapters (ping pong, anyone?). I hope to see you all there. :)
>> ARTICLE
"Ping-Pong" is text book OVA material tho.
>> ARTICLE
Season 2 when?

This show was so much fun, brilliantly animated and directed which gave the source material all the credit it was due.  JC Staff has killed it the last couple seasons.  Also, they kind of only mentioned it in passing but it looks like they gave Marui the tiebreaker for fourth place, I'm interested to see how he does in the tournament.

I still need to watch Prison School and Overlord final episodes but this might be AotS two seasons in a row.  Is that allowed, can I do that?
>> ARTICLE
So fucking good, now I go cry.   
Don't pull a no game no life on us pls.
>> ARTICLE
Too. Fucking. Soon.
>> ARTICLE
**AOTY** 

All of you need to read the manga. If you can't wait for S2, then you need to do it. Also, the manga RIGHT NOW is so fucking epic. Seriously, it's mind blowing. Don't miss out on the discussions in /r/manga and /r/shokugekinosoma

And do it if you love foodgasms

Dude, i also have (extremly) high hopes for it, but don't judge an anime before it even aired.

(besides, there is still "One Punch Man" when it comes to unaired anime)
>> ARTICLE
Shaft won't fail us and I know the source material is the best monogatari by far. 
>> ARTICLE
Well I mean, the other guy is calling this AOTY without the year being actually finished.

I think it's fair game
>> ARTICLE
>AOTY

really?
>> ARTICLE
What chapter does the anime leave us on?

Edit: Nvm, chapter 60.

bold prediction considering AOTY hasn't started airing yet
>> ARTICLE
Who is the best tl/scanlation squad for it?
>> ARTICLE
Casanova

And some peeps at /r/shokugekinosoma translate raws early for the subreddit. And they're pretty good 
>> ARTICLE
Should I start from Chapter 1 of the manga or can I just start where the anime ends?

How good is the adaptation is basically what I'm asking. Will I be missing out on anything?
>> ARTICLE
You can start from where the anime ends. The only difference in the source material is the chronological order of events. For example, in the manga the Kaarage Arc occurs immediately after the training camp, and afterwards Soma's dad appears. In the anime, these two events go in the opposite order (training camp --> dad shows up --> karaage arc). This misorder of events only occurs twice or so in season 1 of the anime, so you should have no trouble picking up where the anime end. Like one event is skipped in the anime but it literally had no affect on the actual plot. I'm talking about a certain ping pong scene that occurs right after the Karaage Arc in the manga. It's adorable

I do recommend reading from the beginning if you have time.
>> ARTICLE
Okay I guess I'm starting from the beginning! Thanks everyone :D
>> ARTICLE
I recommend reading the whole manga. The anime is pretty thorough, but it skips a few things. The manga is  very to the point with better pacing than the anime imo(plus the art is great). I would just read the whole thing, but it you can't be bothered then start at 61(you won't miss out on too much).
>> ARTICLE
Don't start at 61, the episode actually ends mid-chapter! The end of chapter 60 leads into a mini-arc.
>> ARTICLE
I'd actually say start at 59, since that's the introduction of [](/s "Mimasaka")
>> ARTICLE
Just read the whole thing, takes a day max because it sucks you in and you will be forced to binge and then you get depression because you just read everything in 1 sitting and join us anticipating it every week.
>> ARTICLE
Don't know if anybody is going to agree with me, but I still think [Yakitate!! Japan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28/Yakitate!!_Japan) did the whole "food reaction" thing better.  The reactions in Shokugeki are amusing, but Yakitate was on a whole other level.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, those last two manga chapters, my jaw never dropped that far before.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't have the highest expectations for Shokugeki as I hadn't read the manga prior to watching the show. I absolutely fell in love with characters during the first cour.

The second cour took Shokugeki to another level. Everything about the show was so fun and enjoyable. The supporting characters were treated extremely well and [Soma and Megumi](https://33.media.tumblr.com/c8d38ce6a78a56a81315a68e2b841967/tumblr_nmzan8j5PZ1tyhq3uo1_500.gif) were as lovable as always.

Definitely the AOTY for me as well.

I'm going to miss Shokugeki no Souma. It's going to be a long and hungry wait for season 2.


The autumn election finals are going to be so hype. Such strong cooks (Hayama, Alice, Soma, unknown guy, Takumi). Just give us season 2 now please.

Spice was subtle. The music in this series is top.

Poor Yuuki.  Putting up such a cheerful, supportive front despite her elimination.  But it's in support of best girl Megumi, so it's not for naught.

Ughhhh now the long wait for S2

Manga time, RIP my Fridays.

Friday-monday, depending how fast cassanova can translate

This is the most fun I've ever had since I started watching anime. The hype and excitement for each episode was out of this world, the story was fun and they handled side-characters perfectly. This is going to be a tough one to get over.
>> ARTICLE
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnd.........there goes my AOTY 
>> ARTICLE
So... was there any unexpected jihad made from that scene of Akira's food? And Souma's? Too many bombs this episode to go wasted.. 

Anyway, Hayama's alpha as fuck... he got a 20 from that stuck up curry lady. That's why he won. 

Shut up Erina! Leave Fumio alone... 

[Spoiler?](/s "Where's Mimisaka? They left the audience with a misleading impression that Marui is in the finals...")
>> ARTICLE
I'm really glad a lot of people enjoyed this epic anime about cooking.  

Hope to see you all in the season 2 and manga threads in the future!

Edit: What I tell you last week? In that [endcard](http://i.imgur.com/8fOhtMa.jpg) Daigo and Shoji are the true side characters in this series.


>> ARTICLE
Amazing adaptation of the manga; Season 2 can't come quickly enough!

A question for any anime-only people. Did any of you catch that the anime didn't resolve a certain part of the plot?

[Manga spoilers] (/s "Mimisaka's hilariously evil; I hope if they adapt the next season, they do justice to his antics!")
>> ARTICLE
Everyone here seems to like Erina x Soma, more than Megumi x Soma. Am I the only one here waving the Nikumi x Soma flag?
>> ARTICLE
I'm definitely in that camp, but I think it's more realistic that Megium x Soma happens and Nikumi x Kanichi happens. Even more realistic is just nothing happening.

dat isshiki butt tho,,
anyone else thought it would be a draw between souma and curry dude?

What exactly is that supposed to spoil if I look at it? Is there a specific Mango Chutney Arc in the manga?

He's trying to be funny, since mango = manga, and mango chutney was featured today. They're manga spoilers.

Great show. Changed my view of food. And now I can't watch a dish in an anime without getting ecchi pictures in my mind.. Thanks Souma!

that was a long ride guys i hope u all enjoyed shokugeki and to see you in manga discussions soon!

Man, what a ride it's been. Can't wait till season two for more Umami No Soma!

Thank you, Shokugeki No Soma anime, for getting me back in the kitchen to cook again.  It's been a while since I used my kitchen stuff other than the microwave.

Also, like everyone else said, read the manga.

Just do it.

Also, I will have plenty more commentaries to write down for you all since you all love them so much!

Now that the anime has ended (for now?), for God's sake go read the manga if you're not already. Stop what you're doing and read it. It's absolutely crazy, fucking good. Especially the current arc. It went from cooking manga to Game of Thrones in a matter of 2 - 3 chapters. Words can't even describe the hype. [Seriously!](https://framasphere.org/camo/939966e9f9f4b8e2e72a4ebc24a184b192eae448/68747470733a2f2f33332e6d656469612e74756d626c722e636f6d2f33333463636331346462653336666331356166663439343365373732363162622f74756d626c725f6e706e70613372547264317232616f62676f325f3530302e676966)
>> ARTICLE
Shokugeki was definitely one of my favorite animes this year. I already loved cooking but the show hyped me up to try a bunch of new stuff that tasted really awesome. I think after Episode 2 or 3 I said eff it and read all of the manga in a span of 2 days. It was glorious until I finally caught up and now wait every week along with everybody else. :(

But please, I implore everyone to at least give it a try even if you don't usually read manga! I found myself enjoying the manga even more than the anime and that's saying a lot because J.C. Staff did a pretty solid job on this adaption. If you're wondering, **the anime ended at Chapter 60** and there are currently *136* out.

But if you're interested in what happens after the anime **and don't mind being spoiled**/don't have a desire to read the manga, and, I'll repeat it again, **IF YOU DON'T MIND BEING SPOILED** have a look below for a list of major events, listed in chronological order:

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Souma defeats Alice in the next round through understanding the theme better than she does")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Megumi goes against Kurokiba and loses, but gave a valiant effort")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Hayama beats Hisako and tells her that he will never lose to someone who's happy to be second-best (to Erina), as a result Hisako leaves Erina and goes on a journey")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Subaru and Takumi's match is a full-fledged Shokugeki in which Takumi loses, he also loses the Mezzaluna as a result")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Souma avenges Takumi and 99 other chefs by beating Subaru in another Shokugeki (Subaru's first loss), winning the Mezzaluna back, but Takumi tells him to keep it until he beats Souma in a match in the future")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Hayama and Kurokiba tie in their match, and as a result the final is a three-way between them and Souma")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- In the end Hayama wins the final, but all three participants brought out amazing dishes. There was a remark that Hayama's dish was something only "he could make/a signature dish" which is why he won")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- A training/Stagiaire arc begins and in Souma's first assignment he is partnered up with Hisako who makes her first appearance since leaving Erina's side. In the end the two help a struggling restaurant get back on its feet and actually become friends. Souma also helps mend her relationship with Erina")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Megumi gets paired with Erina and they surprisingly make a pretty good team")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- In the next stage of the Stagiaire arc, Souma trains at Shinomiya's new restaurant he's just opening up in Tokyo (his original restaurant is in France). Souma learns a bunch of new valuable lessons, makes friends with Shinomiya's staff, and actually even contributes a dish to the menu")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- After the Stagiaire arc is finished, Souma is the first one to return back to Totsuki out of all the PSD members. Before they even arrive he starts accepting Shokugekis from a bunch of 2nd years and defeats them all (this shows that he had a shonen power-up through the Stagiaire")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- The Elite 10 is finally revealed through a formal meeting with the Top 8 Freshmen, the 8th Seat, a 2nd Year Named Kuga says that if any of the 1st Years can best him at anything relating to cooking he'll accept a Shokugeki")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Souma takes that as a challenge and decides to directly compete against him in the Totsuki Food Festival, to do this he sets up a Chinese Food cart right across from Kuga's restaurant")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Though Souma did beat Kuga 1 or 2 days, in the end Kuga won in overall sales. Both Souma and Kuga take the whole ordeal as a loss. Souma wanted to beat Kuga in overall sales, and if Kuga could take 1st place in his area for the whole festival, then Tsukasa (the 1st Seat) would accept a Shokugeki against him (Tsukasa destroyed/humiliated Kuga last year)")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- The 2nd Seat of the Elite 10, Rindou, treats Souma and Megumi to dinner at Tsukasa's restaraunt. Souma can't believe how delicious the food is, but Tsukasa's philosophy is a bit different than Souma's. Tsukasa relies solely on the ingredients, removing any trace of himself or his identity from the equation")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Erina's father, Azami, visits her restaurant and demands to try her food. They have a broken relationship and he was banned from Totsuki for some unknown reason (Senzaemon is her legal guardian). Erina goes into full scared mode and can't even function properly. Souma drops in because he also wants to try her food, and Azami leaves after giving Souma a look of pure disgust/disdain")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Senzaemon shows up and demands that Azami leave the premises. Azami pulls out a paper that has the signatures of 6/10 of the Elite 10. They shockingly voted in favor of Azami taking over the director role from Senzaemon. Those who were in favor of Azami taking over: Tsukasa (1st), Rindou (2nd), Momo (4th), Soumei (5th), Nene (6th), and Eizan (9th). Those who didn't sign the petition for one reason or another were: Tousuke (3rd), Isshiki (7th), Kuga (8th), and Erina (10th)")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- Gin and Jouichirou meet in a foreign country for the first time in years. At first Gin is pissed at him for not keeping in touch but they start reminiscing. They talk a bit about Souma before Gin gets a call about Azami. Azami is revealed to have been the 3rd Seat while Gin and Jouichirou were the 1st and 2nd Seats, respectively. What's notable is that Azami was the 3rd Seat as a **1ST YEAR**. They both look shocked after the call.")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "- The next day Senzaemon (now ousted as director) shows up to PSD to talk to Souma. They then have a discussion about Erina's past. It's revealed that during her training Azami both physically and psychologically abused her, which is why she's the way she is. In fact, she was much worse before, but after Azami was banished Senzaemon surrounded Erina with positive people that helped her recover (like Alice, Hisako, Jouichirou, etc.). Senzaemon then bows his head and begs Souma to save Erina")

And that's where we currently are in the manga!

Why do you spoil a character without even taking the time to explain who he is? When it's clear his name won't ring a  bell to anybody since they took him out.
>> ARTICLE
Opening song as the last song never fails to be epic. Season two soon please!
>> ARTICLE
Does anybody know what point in the manga the anime leaves off at?
>> ARTICLE
Chapter 60! The manga is terrific so enjoy!
>> ARTICLE
Okay what chapter do i start reading the manga from? This show was so fucking awesome i can't get enough!!
>> ARTICLE
Chapter 60.
>> ARTICLE
Now I can finally go start the Manga! What a great show.

For Manga and Anime watchers: Do you think I should start from the beginning? Or start from the current arc.

>> ARTICLE
And the best anime of spring bids us farewell.

So damn awesome, the song playing in the last scenes was so good. Totally making up the celebrative mood.

I do hope they make a sequel because this is just too much awesomeness.

Megumi X Souma FTW!!!!

Definitely the best Finale episode this season.

[Thanks for the meal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBqIBXqOOr0)

That's two shows in as many weeks which have driven me to reading their source material (the other being Rokka). Second season when. :(
>> ARTICLE
God I can't wait for the second season. Also the next manga chapter. I just want more Shokugeki in general, love this series.
>> ARTICLE
Don sit at the very center of Nikumi already. She's my favorite girl character. 
>> ARTICLE
Watching this was quite the experience. Also it led me to reading the manga which is also fantastic. 

Foodgasms and plot aside, glad it was a 2 cour. Being a shounen I would expect a season 2 coming soon. 

[**Glorious**](#duckhue)
>> ARTICLE
Season 2, now. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never been tempted to actually read the manga before.
>> ARTICLE
It was a nice ride for everyone. But as to all the others were saying, if you can't wait for season 2 **Read the Manga**. The plot is so good right now and it's getting even better.
>> ARTICLE
THIS 
WAS 
EPIC

I really suggest reading the manga!!! I had a blast reading it, and the current arc is freaking mind-blowing!
>> ARTICLE
24 episodes of pure awesome-ness. I can only imagine what people first thought when they saw this show when it began 2 seasons ago. "Food battles? wtf is this gonna be a lunchroom brawl? wtf tentacle stuff? wtf THIS IS AMAZING."

The anime did a really good job bringing the manga to life. We obviously skipped content (All of it worth reading) to get up to this point, but it did such a good job displaying the story. The characters were brought to life with good VAs, foodgasms were extraordinary, important plot points were not rushed, and so much more. The only thing this anime gets wrong is that it had to end after 2 seasons. People are gonna want more after they stumble upon this show in the future. People right now are gonna pick up the manga (Loads of material that can be found translated with quick google search of Shokugeki no souma manga). The story completes the freshman tournament and goes even further to introduce even more exciting characters and developments. 

Trust me, I will be the first guy ripping off my naked apron showing up my much less muscular body while giving a care free laugh yelling to the heavens SHOKUGEKI NO SOUMA IS ONE OF THE BEST SHOUNENS, WATCH IT, READ IT, GET OVER ANY WEIRD ISSUES WITH THE FOODGASMS, THEY'RE IMPORTANT.

Manga is a 10/10, but anime is gonna have to be a 9/10. Its a god damn good show and a god damn good adaptation of the manga, but it is still held back by the fact that it is an adaptation. Reasons such as skipping material from the manga and having to stop right before the autumn elections tournament actually happens (we've only seen the preliminaries just now) really stops me from being able to claim this show is a masterpiece. Its a damn good show though and deserves the highest 9 rating it could get. FUCK YEAH THIS SHOW IS AWESOME. AND FUCK YEAH I GOT SOME ERINA FANSERVICE NEAR THE END BEFORE THIS WAS ALL OVER!!!
>> ARTICLE
I think when I first heard about it I was expecting something like Ben-to.  This was better.  Much better.
>> ARTICLE
Where will I go now to get my daily dose of foodgasms?
>> ARTICLE
Since shokugeki s2 was not announced yet I'll just go ahead and read the manga. Can't wait that long D:
>> ARTICLE
'My God, it's full of spice.'

Was Soma standing on the Obelisk from 2001 in that shot of spices orbiting Planet Mango?

Great finale, so much epicness there simply has to be another season. Also I need more Megumi cuteness, that white dress with the blue ribbon was quite something.
>> ARTICLE
is season 2 already confirmed?
>> ARTICLE
Megumi best waifu.
>> ARTICLE
You could say that I'll be hungrily waiting for season 2.
>> ARTICLE
10/10 of course but if there is one complaint I have is that I wish Erina did more.. she really did do much but just be a Tsundere.. unlike Megumi which we saw a bit of growth from, even from the beef girl we saw more development. 
>> ARTICLE
well she can't really grow right now as no one of the first years are her equal in terms of cooking but atleast she changes a bit in the chapters further down the road ;)
>> ARTICLE
Megumi is just too cute!
>> ARTICLE
Even though Akira "technically" did better than Souma, it was cool how they described the judges scoring differences. Even the judges didn't agree with each other. 

In my book, that was tie between the two. 

I almost teared up again for no reason. 10/10, gonna go pick up the manga now.


>> ARTICLE
Alright Souma, you just made me start reading my first manga. I hope you're happy! 
>> ARTICLE
That moment at the end between Megumi and Soma is why this anime is so great. It's such a real and beautiful moment I could feel tears welling up. It has been such a great journey for both of them!
>> ARTICLE
Ass Class is getting it's second season in the winter season, if I could get both Ass Class and Shokugeki during the winter season, I'd be sooo happy.
>> ARTICLE
=( i can't/don't want to read the manga. i don't like doing both at the same time. i feel like it kinda ruins both forms of it...

it's such a good anime but you know how books are generally better than it's movie counterpart? yeah, for me if i want from the anime to the manga and then back to the anime, the anime wouldn't be as good/exciting. one of the major factors is, obviously that the plot would be already spoiled.

but then i'd have to wait till maybe next summer (?) till more episodes come out ='(
>> ARTICLE
Damn 2 bombs dropped in a row
>> ARTICLE
This was the most unexpected series that I've fallen in love with. Before watching the first episode I thought it would just be a random lark, but this series instantly found it's place in my top anime of all time. We had better get another season. I don't really read manga because I just don't have the time, but I might make an exception if we don't get another season.
>> ARTICLE
Kind of dissapointed there wasn't a single mention of [](/s "Subaru Mimasaka"). Oh well I still enjoyed this adaptation. Kind of hoping we get a S2 annoucement soon but until then anime onlys need to hurry up and go read the manga!! Start from chapter 60
>> ARTICLE
I've been holding off the manga until the anime finished. Now thats its done where should I pick up?
>> ARTICLE
The is def going in my top 5 been reading the manga since like chapter 5. Love it so much can't wait for season 2.
>> ARTICLE
That was fucking amusing.

2nd Season WHEN!!!

Thank you J.C staff for the (almost) faithful and fun adaptation of Shokugeki no Soma.

Please bring us season 2 as well!!
>> ARTICLE
Welp, on to M A N G A B O Y S  
>> ARTICLE
That episode was terrific, but did they really need to leave out something. They never explained how Marui and Ibu got out even though they were tied for 4th. Manga readers know, but the anime viewers will not. 
>> ARTICLE
I am *so* freaking sad that we don't have a confirmation on the apprenticing arc. I so wanted to see that animated.
>> ARTICLE
What chapter in the manga does this stop at?
>> ARTICLE
Dang, they didn't show Emiya Shirou :(
>> ARTICLE
GOD DAMMIT J.C STAFF YOU ARE SO GOOD. I can't believe you managed to produce my favorite shows of the past 2 seasons (Prison School, and Shokugeki) now... Season 2 when?
>> ARTICLE
Is there a ridiculous food anime in the upcoming season to fill this void? Is it maybe time for a *[Yakitate!! Japan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28/Yakitate!!_Japan)* rewatch?
>> ARTICLE
This show was amazing. I hope this becomes a long running show with multiple seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Solid series and animation it was a pleasure watching it with you guys !
>> ARTICLE
Definitely my AOTY so far. One of the best shounen anime/manga I've seen and read, so I'm *really* hoping for another season.

Also, many have already pointed it out, but one of my favourite charcters, [manga spoilers](/s "Mimasaka Subaru"), wasn't even mentioned, which was a shame.

What a great summer season, i'am very sad now - what i'am going to do with my life ? 
>> ARTICLE
Just just amazing 
>> ARTICLE
What a fun shounen this show is; an interesting take on the shounen battle format!

I hope this show gets a full adaptation from the manga and if it's as faithful as this season was, I have no doubt in my mind this show will last quite a while as the manga has shown.
>> ARTICLE
Sad to see the animated form of an incredible series come to an end. (S2 maybe?) The way the whole anime delivers, with it's funny lines and characters humming themes is just amazing. Definitely a great adaptation and of course awesome anime.

From what I heard from everyone there was supposed to be this giant cliffhanger. Where is it? Besides myself expecting that, amazing show and episode, easy 9/10

[**Over?!**It's](#startled)

Fuck.

With the Final episode complete, I really don't know what else to look forward to. When Shokugeki first started I came into it with no expectations other than it was apparently good, and about cooking.

Biggest understatement of the century. Definitely AotY for me, and it is definitely one of my absolute favorites. The simple fact that I can get hyped up about a bunch of kids *cooking* speaks volumes about the quality of the writing.

Pacing was great, *every* episode was entertaining, which is really rare. Generally you have at least a handful of filler in 24 episodes, but I can't remember a single one in what I watched.

This has become the first anime *ever* that, as a non-manga reader, I really am considering picking up the manga and binging it. My only concern is that when the next season or whatever comes out, and I'm confident that it will due to the popularity, the anime will have less of an impact because I'll already be ahead of the curve.

I'm honestly a little upset that it's over, because God *Damn* if it wasn't a fun ride the entire time.
>> ARTICLE
I hope you pick up the manga if you haven't already because it rocks and I started it after ep 10!
>> ARTICLE
Manga time!
>> ARTICLE
My Fridays are now empty...
>> ARTICLE
God the hype went off the charts with this episode. The killer was 2 fold for me. The first punch was the instrumental of "Spice", the best ED ever, during the party in Glasses's room. The second was the full version of the 1st OP during the balcony scene starting from worst girl's talk with Erina. Best girl Megumi gushing after Souma complimented her food was the cutest thing ever, pretty much their scene before everyone cut it cemented that ship as the best one.

I really hope that there will be a second season, but I guess I'll just have to read the manga to get my fix. Should I start from the beginning or is there a part I can just jump right in to? Either way, this just made me so excited for when I start my second round of college in culinary school next week. I may watch this series a few times throughout my tenure there
>> ARTICLE
What issue of the manga is episode 24 equal to? I want to read from where it leaves off.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, what was the last chapter the anime covered? And can I simply keep on reading or do I have to reread from the beginning?
>> ARTICLE
chapter 60 was the last one and no u dont have to read from start the anime was perfetly following the manga.So read from chapter 60 and enjoy!
>> ARTICLE
They missed the ping pong chapter, though!
>> ARTICLE
Because this was a cooking anime!
>> ARTICLE
thanks! i was just about to ask this question

At least they left it ambiguous at the end for a possible season two if sales are good enough.

Amazing series! I was sceptical at the start, but oh man I was wrong. 

Really glad I didn't pass this anime :) Strong 9/10 for this season! 
And until next year...

I disagree with one thing in this episode: Souma isn't the ultimate sore loser. That title still belongs to [Kumagawa Misogi](http://i.imgur.com/48ofiCC.jpg), from Medaka Box, also known as Best Character. It's a real shame the anime stopped right before it got to the good parts.

Leaving it where they did suggests a certain level of confidence in getting a season 2.

Well titan couldn't go any faster since it's a monthly manga and there wasnt enough material to start a s2 until years later.  This is why I pick up the manga for shows that get me so hyped I can't wait for s2. I started the shokugeki manga after ep 10! I'm reading the rokka light novels after that series just ended last week cause the suspense was killing me

shokugeki no soma episode 24 end song was really good anyone know the name? i was not the req ending

It's called Kibou no Uta. It's the first opening.

apparently we probably won't be getting a season 2?

it doesn't even make sense to make this season if there's not going to be more, the anime is just completely left hanging!

and it's actually BETTER than the manga imo!

No the manga is really popular, a season 2 is not impossible, it's if anything even probably fairly likely.

Decent show through and through. All of the arcs were super interesting and made me want to know what happened next.

Sadly I can't see it happening

It seems like they are setting up the connection with tadokoro
>> ARTICLE
I know, it does seem that way:(
>> ARTICLE
And now we wait for Season 2...

Also, I think what makes Soma the strongest chef in his batch is the fact that unlike everyone else, he has no specialty.

Some specialize is French cuisine, others Italian.

So are great with spices, others with herbs.

He has none of those, and instead absorbs everything. In the end, he can do what the others cannot; master multiple techniques and take all of them to their limits.

A sponge of cooking awesomeness; he shall surpass them all!

Now this is what I call a great show.

The only thing that irks me is the awkward time to end the season. It's not even the finals.

And thus it ends. Life as I know it now seems dark and bleak. When oh when will season 2 be released. For now I shall read the mangas to keep me occupied which will be my ray of hope in these dark times.

I started this anime being weary of all the echi and the first episode had me going wtf Japan. I am glad I stuck around with this, its easily the best recent shounen I have seen and the best anime of the year for me easily. Music choices were amazing, the writing second to none - for a cooking manga no less [and was enjoyable for someone with practically no cooking experience like me] - the fights were amazing, tension well built, arcs well connected, characters were so fun, etc.

To summarize - I didn't expect much of this at the start, but this has easily been the FUNNEST anime I have seen in a while
>> ARTICLE
This sub might explode once the slimmest  hint of a season 2 is seen.

The ultimate hype train generator.
>> ARTICLE
So many great shows which deserve a S2: This, Prison School, Monmusu, Overlord.

I have to say, I like the shout out to earlier episodes with the squid. There really was a change between earlier and later episodes. I, personally, am happy that they cut the ecchi to a minimum and use it primarily for comedy.
>> ARTICLE
I reaaaaaally hope we get more of this animated. This has been the highlight for me each week through these past two seasons. Regardless, time to read the manga. :)

How likely does a season 2 seem?

So where in the manga should i start reading, to keep the story flowing. After Watching everything.

i can't believe this show is over.

it was just *so* good that i think i'm going to have to start picking up the manga now. please tell me we have a season 2! ;_;

Coming in 5 months late to say Alice best girl.
>> ARTICLE
I will miss this show so much. But at least I won't get extreme hunger pangs every time I watch an episode.

Going by the pacing of the anime, they did roughly 6 volumes out of the 14 for the manga. So there should already be enough material for a season 2. But I suppose they can wait a several seasons until there could be enough material for season 3 not too long after that.

One of the most fun manga series of the past 4 years and I am so glad it got a pitch perfect anime conversion. I honestly couldn't have asked for a better adaptation.

Erina is so goddamn cute when she blushes like that. Best girl... Oh wait pyjamas megumi is there too. Nvm i still like Erina more.

Watching the CC finale before this might not have been the best idea haha.

This was a fun series, happy I didn't drop it after episode 1 and looking forward to season 2 since well they have to do it right?
>> ARTICLE
Wait, wait, wait. A show with ecchi that you actually really enjoyed? This is crazy Ame, but it's good you stayed. We need more "cooking shows" like this sometimes :3
>> ARTICLE
The ecchi for the most part was tame so I was able to keep watching :p
>> ARTICLE
I hope I can try to make at least one of these dishes when I start school next week. I've never been happier to be a chef than I am after seeing this show!
>> ARTICLE
Holy hell that was so good. The entire series was super good. So much intensity, a million times more than any other series. One of the smartest things I've ever done was to start reading the manga after the first episode. I was sucked in instantly, and I cannot even being to describe how fun it is. I'm super hoping we get a season two, the fun only starts here, and never really ends!

I also want to point out that Megumi is so criminally adorable and sweet, best girl of the passing seasons, no contest here. I'm on the verge of falling in love. To be honest, hell, every girl had her time to shine this episode, Erina had some really adorable parts as well, I laughed my ass off during that scene, and even Nikumi displayed some cuteness!

Erina is and always will be best girl!

NOOOOO I dont want it to end. I would watch 100 season of food wars

I thought it was pretty lame to have Soma "lose", but still give him an interpretation where he wins.

This show coddles the main hero too much.
>> ARTICLE
This isn't even the first battle he's lost.

Soma lost to his dad 490 times, he lost to Shinomiya, and he just lost to Hayama. 

It's not like Soma is Natsu Dragoneel or something. THAT'S coddling a MC.
>> ARTICLE
Souma's thing is losing.  They even said it in the show.  He's lost to his father over 400 times, and each of those losses makes him better.  That's the whole conceit of the manga and the anime.  That he's not special for his cooking skills or his taste, he's not like his father, but in one way he terrifies his father, in that he never gives up and learns from every loss.  Eventually he will be unstoppable.
>> ARTICLE
But he even points out that he still lost to Hayama. Are you drunk?
>> ARTICLE
Then why not make it an unambiguous loss? The only person Soma loses to is his father. That's pretty lame.
>> ARTICLE
For some reason I felt like Shokugeki dropped off a bit. Started out as a 9/10 for me and then I ended up giving it an 8/10, still very good though. If MAL let me do half points I'd give it an 8.5.
>> ARTICLE
It's over :(

Out of the 14 anime I had in my watching list on MAL, I've finished 9 during the past week and I'll finish 4 more in the next 4 days. 

It's not been a good week

I absolutely love this show. The characters, the over the top cooking, the recipes, the music, the animation, the story, the comedy. I am definitely gonna go read the manga.

This is kind of a crummy point to end this series for the immediate future. They probably should've stopped before the election prelims.

This doesn't make the show bad, but...

Holy crap, Megumi's reaction of waking up and seeing Soma shaking hands with an almost naked Isshiki was amazing.

It will entirerly depend on the chapter the episode is covering. Soemtimes their could be 1 very mild one or none at all or they could be super over the top crazy ones. Usally the really important ones are the craziest

They also seem to trend toward becoming more and more violent toward the person eating. The entire semifinals and finals of the Autumn Election is just brutal to the judges.

Obviously I can't foresee the future for the anime, but as a reader of the manga the foodgasms are only going to get crazier from here.

I think better, if it's too ecchi the white knights of purity would blast this show as shit because it's defintely not an exaggeration of the cooking and how people enjoy good food.

This episode covered Chapters 8 and 9, though they changed the scene after Erina's Shokugeki, from her hearing about Souma passing the class from Chapelle ( that teacher that never smiled ) into her talking with the Meat Master [](/s "Nikumi") ( which was not directly shown in the manga ).

[Here](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-D3_U-grMrhg/UQ13PyxlWoI/AAAAAAAAIkw/EszceB3uYJ4/018.png?imgmax=3000) is the [scene](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hSz_9oYmsKw/UQ13QiL5ChI/AAAAAAAAIk8/qgt77xWkpyI/019.png?imgmax=3000) in the [manga](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KWjhQANpva4/UQ13RGsmoHI/AAAAAAAAIlE/MQ_ZAej0WvQ/020.png?imgmax=3000).

And here is the recipe for Isshiki's [Spanish Mackerel](http://imgur.com/S4MjoPb).

Edit : I just looked into the Staff list on MAL and it seems that several important characters aren't listed there.
I hope that doesn't mean anything and that those characters will be added later on, otherwise that would mean that we will only get to Chapter ~43.
>> ARTICLE
[Based on the preview](/s "It appears we see the end of the shokugeki ... or at least when Soma shows off his dish  -which is more likely as a cliffhanger")
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't that scene in the last episode? I remember it from somewhere, and I have never read the manga, so it had to be there... 
>> ARTICLE
Ah you're right. That scene was shown after the ending from episode 3.
>> ARTICLE
The show is moving so slowly! Its nice that they're taking their time with it, but at this rate its going to become equal in length to the battle shonens because even the manga is nowhere near complete.
>> ARTICLE
The manga will definitely go on for quite a while. I can't see it ending anytime soon. It will probably take 1 or 2 ( or even more ) years till it ends.

I just hope that they up the pacing a bit and that we get to see [](/s "Ryou and Hayama") in action. 
>> ARTICLE
Well the [manga spoilers] (#s "Autumn Election arc will probably go by a lot faster than how we're currently going, in my opinion.")
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I wanna see those two so bad, especially [](/s "Ryou"), who is basically my favorite character, but it is not going to happen this season. 

Oh well, at least we will be seeing  [](/s "the Aldini twins") very soon, as well as best teachers  [](/s "Shinomiya and Hinako")
>> ARTICLE
The [](/s "Ryou") hype is real.
>> ARTICLE
Im growing a hate for Erina more and more every single episode.     
       
Its annoying as fuck
>> ARTICLE
If you want to watch this show you have to get used to characters like her that are overconfident and arrogant like hell at first. Doest guarantee that they will stay like that forever in the series tho
>> ARTICLE
Soma's overconfident as hell too. But that's the best part. Overconfident, oblivious characters are where it's at.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, but I love how he show those rich and arrogant guys how a "simple" cook in a villages restaurant can beat them easily. Those moments are the best
>> ARTICLE
Simple has always been the motif of Soma's cooking. Soma might be overconfident as f*ck but the way his simple nature beautifully comes out of his cooking is a joy to look at.
>> ARTICLE
I'm always afraid that he's gonna flop at some point. Like accidentally burn a dish or get sabotaged. I'm just so frustrated because it hasn't happened yet.
>> ARTICLE
He's already been sabotaged. And he brushed it off like a boss.
>> ARTICLE
He has like 10 years of experience in business I doubt he will do something wrong. Maybe it won't be enough for first place at some point but thats all. But yeah still want him to fuck everyone else up every tournament or shokugeki :P
>> ARTICLE
She is the only character ive seen being a true dick.    
Not even those people who poured salt on the beef were this jerky
>> ARTICLE
Agree, I haven't hated a character so much since Amarty from Spice and Wolf.
>> ARTICLE
She's unpleasant, sure, but I don't mind her bad attitude since it will make her inevitable future tsundere scenes all the more hilarious. But if she is hateful to you now, I can only imagine how you would react to characters in the Fate series, or the bad guy in Accel World. 
>> ARTICLE
Well.

I see what you did there.

You're not alone my friend. Why does she exist?

And there are people who consider her best girl...
>> ARTICLE
>You're not alone my friend. Why does she exist?

Fucking secondaries. Can't realize that Erina is best girl. Stop being deluisional please.

EDIT: People downvoted me for my opinion? How sad.
>> ARTICLE
It's because she isn't best girl. Best girl is Megumi 
>> ARTICLE
Even in the manga she's shit. Just not as shit. 

She has nothing on [] (/s "Alice.")
>> ARTICLE
> Why does she exist?

All will be revealed in time, my friend -- it's a pretty big spoiler so I won't post it, though.
>> ARTICLE
Nope. Nothing happens. She's still a shit character (ATM), even with both gendered considered.
>> ARTICLE
[She plays a bigger role in the long-run given](/s "her past relationship with Jouichirou. Jouichirou represents her ideal cook, so both she and Souma share a common bond in that manner. Likewise, Jouichirou may have also sent Souma to Toutsuki since Erina would be a perfect rival who, as both Jouichiriou and Souma state, Souma can exhaust his cooking on; She has the greatest palette and Souma has the greatest cooking potential -- the two main factors of cooking.")
>> ARTICLE
And the tsundere archetype, the build up of rivalry, the contrast in ideals, etc.

I get all of these, but literally none of this happened yet. Which is irritating considering how long the manga has gone for and there is no actual character development for who supposedly be the heroine/final boss.
>> ARTICLE
If you actually think she won't get development then you're so wrong.
>> ARTICLE
We're not saying she won't. We're saying she hasn't yet. In a 116 chap manga.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah nothing of that happened yet, but there were a few hints to it. I for myself could put 1 and 1 together because of the hints in the manga. But you are right, she need development soon.


>> ARTICLE
You just said my biggest peeve about Erina as a character, she isn't developed at all we're 100+ chapters in and what we know about her is that: she have god tongue, she is a tsundere, her cooking is perfect but very standard, she likes shoujo manga, that spoiler above, [and that she](/s "really sees Hisako as a friend, different from Ikumi whom she just turned her back on after defeat.") Oh. And she haven't changed even a bit after all these chapters.

But, for example, if we get started with Megumi, from where she started to where she is right now...
>> ARTICLE
Or meat master. Hell even Alice seems like she's getting a bit of development after the latest arc.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Erina is a tsundere, I think she's just a rich, arrogant 15 year-old who has been pampered her whole life for being gifted. Souma's existence runs contradictory to her upbringing (as it does for many other characters in the series) which is why she gets flustered/irritated by him. The manga is also only 116 chapters in, which is nothing for a shounen manga -- especially one running in Jump. For comparison, Toriko is another battle cooking manga and it's at 321 chapters. Jump is mainly interested in long-running series (except the odd series like *Death Note*) so *Shokugeki no Souma* is in no rush.

Erina isn't the final boss, Jouichirou is. And right now, Erina isn't important considering the story is focusing on how Souma and his friends are growing as cooks and creating their own unique styles. Souma can't really face Erina or any of the 10 Seats until he moves from copying his father and becoming his own cook.
>> ARTICLE
You know. They could just pull a winry and have her come back when she's really important.

ATM it just feels like she's there because the author is afraid of her being forgotten.

>> ARTICLE
I still love that twist that Isshiki was Seventh Chair.

Also, I can't unhear Suzaku's voice from Isshiki.  Help.

Man, the fun part of this show is finding out how the Soma will counter back and make the meal. Also, all that watching from Cooking Channel and Food Network finally paid off.

Rice in tea?  I know the Koreans do this, but not sure on Japanese.  Someone wanna contribute?

I have watch way too many Iron Chef Japan episodes to understand Isshiki mentioning mixing two cooking styles (in this case, Japan/France) to understand his feelings about it. It IS a rather controversial topic back then in Japanese cooking, not sure about now though.

Megumi, I'm sorry, but I'm really liking Isshiki Senpai (DONT JUDGE ME PEOPLE!) 

Also, A NEW MEATBUN APPEARS!?!!?! IshikiXSoma?!?! (Gotta make the meatbun a meme in food anine, gotta keep that meatbun dream alive from /r/Gundam, Sorry, /r/Anime.)

I love Game Food girl.  I'd totally eat all those animals.  I can go for some deer right now.

Erina rekting Sumo dude is rather accurate to how actual serious business cooking is in real life.  Only... not so serious.  but still serious, nonetheless.

Isshiki saying Soma will bring a new age to Shokugeki: Might as well say "Is Soma the chosen one?!!?!"

Also, new girl?  meat master?  I'm liking this show!  I love the characters!  I love the fact I actually get the dishes!

>> ARTICLE
Could you explain what the Korean variant of rice in tea is?

Either I'm misunderstanding some things or my parents haven't taught me enough about my own country's cuisine. 
>> ARTICLE
I remember whenever I go to a tofu house, after the majority of the rice is eaten in a stone bowl, the rice left in the bowl gets tea poured into the bowl so that the rice gets soft. I'm not sure what it's called, but it's something like that.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen rice in green tea on a menu at a Japanese restaurant. I think it's called Ochazuki.

>Also, new girl? meat master? I'm liking this show! I love the characters! I love the fact I actually get the dishes!

She's awesome
>> ARTICLE
Rice in tea tastes so good, no matter which country's variant you get. Ochazuke is literally as they described it on the show
>> ARTICLE
Can I prompt a discussion on a phrase you keep hearing from Souma:

"*[ (Osomatsu)](http://i.imgur.com/XEG6f1U.png)*"

I believe this is a response to a *gochisousama*, which lossly translate to "thank you for your meal".

This is the first time I heard usage of *osomatsu* and my English sub source translate it as "Glad you liked it" which sounds very off, as I expect it to be some sort of modest response as part of Japanese culture.

Bit of google suggests alternative translation, but what do you think it can be translated in the anime? and what sort of attitude/emotion is Souma attempts to show after serving a meal?
>> ARTICLE
The group that translates the manga uses "It wasn't much", which I think works much better.

I might be using the word wrong here, but I think this is my personal "dark horse" anime of the season.

So far, from episode 1 through 5 my enjoyment of this anime has increased with each passing episode. Thoroughly enjoying, and this is a 24 episode one-cour? Boy, what a time to be alive. This should be a fun ride.

....

So, it's a Best Girl War, huh? Well then, I might as well load up my ammo, my missiles, and screw it, load the nukes too since its no-holds-barred war and say......Yuuki best girl! ^^shots ^^fired
>> ARTICLE
Kinda confused what you mean by dark horse anime? Care to elaborate?
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love the show. It's easily my favourite to watch each week with it's great characters, animation, humour, OST and everything else, it's incredibly feel-good and a near perfect adaptation! So glad this is getting 24 episodes, it really does deserve it. One of my favourite ED's too, both visually and song-wise.

J.C.Staff are already my favourite studio and they're refusing to budge. Can't wait for next weeks episode!
>> ARTICLE
You missed a detail that probably somebody like me, who spends time watching the cooking channels and watched so many Iron Chef Japan episodes would notice: I get how the ingredients work together.  It's fun watching the creativity of this show trying to figure out what the chefs would cook.  It's fun watching Isshiki in this episode noting on how Soma mixed French and Japanese cooking (If you don't get Japanese cooking society, mixing two cooking techniques back then (Not sure about now) was considered VERY taboo), the cooking details are amazing in this story.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently the manga has a nutritionalist/chef on board in order to make the dishes sound, look and actually be possible to make while tasting good.
>> ARTICLE
It's like Parasyte all over again. 2 minute episodes :(
>> ARTICLE
Best Girl finally showed up
>> ARTICLE
Come on. This was way too short. I have nothing to comment on.

Oh what? Am I supposed to be impressed by the rules of the Shokugeki? I'm not. It was pretty intuitive what a shokugeki is ever since they told me there's a ranking system and a top 10. 

At this point I'm just thinking of NFS Most Wanted, and how the elite 10 are going to give Soma the pink slip to their cooking utensils. 
>> ARTICLE
The biggest revelation of the Shokugeki is the bullshit that you have to put something of equal value on the line, especially when you are starting from nothing like our MC. I mean, why would anyone (who isn't OP Erina) put their spot on the line for anything, or on the flip side, only people who already have a lot of stuff can realistically challenge a top 10 person.
>> ARTICLE
I can see some of them putting their spot on the line either for : 

1. Showing Souma that he's nothing more than a third grade cook and that they can "cook miles around him" (blinding pride)

2. They feel disgusted by Soma's very presence at the school, and feel like only they can push him out with the contest, seeing how Soma is still good enough a cook to outskill those who aren't in the top 10. 
>> ARTICLE
Which are both obviously bullshit plot advancement reasons. Nobody would realistically accept a challenge where they didn't get something of actual value to them and risk their spot. Also, due to plot armor, we know Soma can't really get expelled, so if that is on the line, he can't really lose unless the other side cheats and gets caught after the fact.
>> ARTICLE
Just so you know. They haven't actually explained how one can become one of the Elite 10.

Remember, Shokugeki is only used to settle disputes.
>> ARTICLE
In this episode they explained that you CAN use shokugeki to get into the top 10 if someone bets their position on it, or at least they imply that.
>> ARTICLE
maybe he'll bet his knife, after all his father owned it previously I'm guessing from the OP, and I'm also guessing his father is famous because of how mysterious the anime is trying to make him.
>> ARTICLE
We know his father is famous somehow, but nobody will want his knife unless that info comes out
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing if they ever go over the knife it will be something like a character will notice the an engraving on the knife, make the connection it's related to the famous chef, but won't make the connection that the famous chef is Souma's dad.
>> ARTICLE
I don't want to spoil anything for you, but you have some nice theories here :)
>> ARTICLE
Sounds about right, especially as souma doesn't even seem to know
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry [slight spoilers](/s "Soma isn't close to challenging the top 10, even in the manga. There are very few plot progression ass-pulls in the series.")
>> ARTICLE
That's what I figured.
>> ARTICLE
Let me explain it to you.

Imagine if I was really good at poker. If you challenge me to play for $10,000 buy in. I would play with you.

However what you are suggesting is that I should lose $ 10,000 and you should lose nothing.
>> ARTICLE
I see what you are saying, but money has real, non-arbitrary value and the top 10 has both an infinite value and no real value. Apparently you have to be a good chef/student AND have some kind of financial holdings/something value to challenge someone.
>> ARTICLE
That's what interesting about the show. We are going to see what the main character comes up with that's of equal value to a top 10 spot.

I have no clue what that could be, but the fun is watching the creativity.

It's not like the ones in the top 10 didn't have to win it by presenting something of equal value either.
>> ARTICLE
Well presumably they had to have something of equal value. It may never be shown how they actually got into the top 10 spot, which would really be annoying. We shall see.
>> ARTICLE
The way it's set up I believe you are forced to accept a challenge as long as the conditions are met. So he wagers his expulsion for X that someone else has. Now he has 2X and can effectively keep doubling until he has enough to challenge for the top spot. 

No spoilers but can someone confirm I got the challenge rules right?
>> ARTICLE
The other party cannot force his/her opposition into accepting a Shokugeki even if the wager are equal or at least acceptable for both.
>> ARTICLE
They obviously don't have to accept because the requirements are that you give up something equal, which is obviously arbitrary. Erina offered giving up her top spot, which is seemingly worth more than the club house, but she only did that because she knew she would win.

Plus, how the hell do you objectively value the expulsion of Souma (or anyone)? Most people would rate it as zero value, some people would rate it as high value maybe.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain what the taste Umami is like?
What's a dish I can compare it with.
>> ARTICLE
[It's a savory flavor.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami) Like mushrooms or tomatoes or cheese. To me it's like a "full" flavor that makes me wan to eat more. Like the difference between tilapia and salmon or tuna.
>> ARTICLE
From this episode, where i can start reading the manga?

>> ARTICLE
This episode covered Chapters 8 ("A Dish That Calls for Spring") and 9 ("The Ice Queen and the Spring Storm").

If you want to pick up the manga from here, then you should start on Chapter 10 ("The Meat Invader").
>> ARTICLE
Chapter 8 I believe.
>> ARTICLE
So this show is basically a battle shounen ... but with food and orgasms. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Smoker guy seems to be more intense than first expected. He was the only one who wasn't involved in the cook-off food orgasm and that scene towards the end makes me think there's still more to him.

Also an arrogant prick hipster shit
>> ARTICLE
Spoooky~
>> ARTICLE
The desire for reading the manga ugh, its like one piece.
>> ARTICLE
I may have missed this. But does anyone know why they butchered his catch phrase "It wasn't much"
>> ARTICLE
I read that the phrase is something like humbling oneself.  As such it could be interpreted differently.  'It wasn't much' as in not extravagant or anything when praised as such, 'Glad you like it' sounds humble as well.

But I dunno, that's just what I read.
>> ARTICLE
I've never been more excited about cooking in my life...

Holy fuck the cook-offs are gonna be great!
>> ARTICLE
[Isshiki in this scene](http://i.imgur.com/l9alC5w.jpg) instantly reminded me of [Lun Hu from Kingdom](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/220603.jpg). then I realized they share the same VA. 
>> ARTICLE
Dammit, I really wanted Erina to be actually kind of sh*t at cooking... It makes sense that she wouldn't be, though. But I find happiness in that however good she is, Isshiki's cooking can still top hers.
>> ARTICLE
This show has one of the best endings. The animation and the song are just sooo good.
>> ARTICLE
Shokugeki no Souma in one sentence:

**Souma is Cooking Jesus.**
>> ARTICLE
He hasn't even learned how to turn water into rice juice yet, bean sprout's still got a long way to go.
>> ARTICLE
an ecchi at 8.1..... eh?

I cannot wait for Soma to whoop some ass, the salt from Erina's on will give me enough entertainment value for the entire month.

>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
ITT: War over who is best girl.

Also opinions.
>> ARTICLE
When Isshiki said Souma would revolutionize Shokugeki, in what way would he bring a new era to shokugeki?
(Manga spoilers allowed, iam for some reason not affected harshly by them as most of the time i can predict them)
>> ARTICLE
He called out other people at the graduation and isshiki just confirmed that he's actually good. Putting these together, he thinks souma is gonna create a lot of rivals that will work hard to bring him down and will force people at souma's  level to grow and try to out do him thus leading to a generation of great cooks. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not one for battle shounens but this is amazing. Five episodes in and it's one of my favorites this season.

The cook-off between Soma and Isshiki was one of the most exiting "fights" I've seen. The music goes a long way to sell this. If quality stays up this is a strong contender for AOTY.
>> ARTICLE
It'll only get better.
>> ARTICLE
Erina is too brutal. That shokugeki belongs on /r/RuinedOrgasms (NSFW obviously).
>> ARTICLE
This show is still by far the most perfect blend of otaku pandering shit and cooking I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
I can't look at erina without seeing an alien facehugger as her hair.
>> ARTICLE
I want to read the manga but i'm afraid that i won't enjoy the show like i'm enjoying it right now.
Should i start reading the manga 2 ?
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga before the anime started. They're both entertaining, but I prefer the anime because the music, voice acting, and colors are on point.
>> ARTICLE
maybe you want to read the oneshot first
>> ARTICLE
Why wouldn't you? The anime and the manga have nearly no differences so far. Of course the anime cant show everything mentioned in the manga but its very good so far. You won't stop liking the anime. I read the manga until the newest chapter and I rather enjoy seeing everything in colors and hearing them. No way I cant love that anime
>> ARTICLE
I started reading the manga after watching the first episode. I love the manga and anime equally.
>> ARTICLE
I've read the manga and I'm thoroughly enjoying the anime as well.
>> ARTICLE
That foodgasm theme is going to get old real quick.
>> ARTICLE
The author mixes up how he does things.
>> ARTICLE
It's not the foodgasm itself, it's the music that plays during them.
>> ARTICLE
I like how this show is like Iron Wok Jan with a less aweful MC
>> ARTICLE
But Jan being the biggest asshole ever was the primary source of fun.
>> ARTICLE
It could be a really great series, but not. I enjoyed the first 2 episodes, but its kinda get boring. Especially the constant explaining of food and reactions. And why do you need to always recap, why? Erina is a plain bitch who needs to be smacked quite a few times. The cook-off was pretty plain, though I give that for just the introduction of it. And the generic bad guy dialouges you can hear everywhere is also a put off.

So far there are more to like in the series than not, but in the long run these things could be really annoying. I hope it will improve later on....
>> ARTICLE
oooh you are soooo wrong, and Food is ITS main story so wtf are you QQing about?
>> ARTICLE
I know, but its just not interesting. And every episode has at least 2. But do tell me how im wrong? Or your problem is that I dont like everything about the series you love and not fanboying around the internet?
>> ARTICLE
This episode is set up for the next, it'll get better
>> ARTICLE
I hope so
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm going to drop this now. I'm on chapter 78 and I'm bored by both manga and anime. Gripes: Too many sues. Characters vary widely in abilities depending on what is necessary for the story. Some of the dishes are downright strange. For example: the turtle dishin Europe you'd probably get the same reaction as if you're serving monkey or dog meat. The curry calzonejust nasty and inappropriate for this level of cooking. The cabbage rollsthat's peasant food. Too much Japanese cooking for a supposedly international school. Not much actual cooking: you almost never see the actual preparation or techniques. Little discussion of techniques. Little discussion of ingredients. Erina. Subaru. The current arc I'm reading covers maybe three weeks in more than 50 chapters. The sheer failure rate of the school. Who the hell thinks that failing 99% of students is reasonable?  Why are there so many challenges that could result in immediate expulsion? This story is presented as realistic, but it's clearly not.

On the other hand, the ED is great.
>> ARTICLE
There's plenty international dishes keep reading
>> ARTICLE
now, your problem here was expecting realism or normality from an anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'm fine with non-realism. I'm not fine with shows that are presented as realistic but turn out to be unrealistic. There are tons of shows that manage to create great drama or comedy from no or very few departures from reality (e.g. this season's Hibike Euphonium). And some shows do the same by constructing most of their reality (e.g. Evangelion). But shows that are just slightly different from reality in all aspects annoy me and cause me to lose suspension of disbelief. An Shokugeki is clearly presented as realistic, but then has those jarring moments, where suspension of disbelief is just too damn hard.
>> ARTICLE
*shrugs* can't really argue with that, although I kinda enjoy those jarring moments, but hey maybe I just have terrible anime taste.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed, I wonder why people expect a 20 min show or 18-20ish page a chapter manga to focus on like 10 mins of preparations or 3 chapters getting the ingredients and watch over them while they boil or whatever. 
>> ARTICLE
Why do you guys like Megumi so much? She honestly has nothing interresting
>> ARTICLE
She gets much better later on when you have more backstory and characterization. When she has to stand up on her own in shokugekis. 
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT! WHAT IS THIS?! Someone who Soma is actually afraid of and feels inferior to?! Does it mean that Soma will have to learn, struggle and maybe even fail?! Oh, he's immediately back to his former, arrogant and loudmouthed self that effortlessly lands a draw against number 7 of Elite 10. Back to routine, I see...

Show is still very entertaining, but it's getting somewhat boring and incredibly formulaic very fast. It's just not interesting to observe Soma. 
>> ARTICLE
The first chapters are actually the worst ones. Trust me, Soma will become an **amazing** MC. The show also gets better and better with each new arc. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna take your word for it then! 

Just out of curiosity, how long, based on the current pace of anime, it's gonna take to reach that point?
>> ARTICLE
The problem is, this episode in particular was really slow. It worries me a bit. I think that by episode 13 we will see some real development in Soma, but the best of him comes when he faces really strong people, and I don't know if the anime will catch up.
>> ARTICLE
Souma became the second best MC over in the resort arc you know when
>> ARTICLE
I can vouch for this
>> ARTICLE
Effortlessly lands a draw against someone who's not even taking him seriously lol. He's playing along to help develop Souma

In other news, was *not* expecting apron boy to be in the Elite Ten - and higher than Erina!
>> ARTICLE
I believe he is higher because he is in his second year while Erina is in her first.  But they haven't fully explained the basis on how the Elite 10 are (initially) ranked in the manga, so I dunno.
>> ARTICLE
I assume they obtain their spots the same as with everything else, challenging the spot holder to a shokugeki. And I assume if one seat spot challenged another, they swap spots if the lower ranked (higher seat spot) person wins. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think Isshiki's naked butt would be this much more hilarious when it's animated. That wiggle needs a gif.

Also, just a heads up, there's like a good 2 minutes of content past the ending that leads into our next cooking showdown, so make sure not to miss it.

The reason why they didn't include that is because the anime doesn't have a narrator like the manga often does, so they have no way to introduce comments like that. I mean, whose voice would that be in?

At best, they can include short one sentence comments as text, like i'm sure they will once we get to the "Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking manga" bit.

All HAIL BEST GIRL OF ALL TIME MEGUMI. That duck is the best
>> ARTICLE
HA! You havent even SEEN true best girl yet, along with quite a few *almost* best girls. Having said that, i think the series will end with an Erina win, but i wouldnt be surprised if Megumi won just because we see her so much more than Erina.

Although, the series the series doesnt have all that much in terms of romance so it is hard to guess, but i think it works better that way. 
>> ARTICLE
There is still no girl better than Megumi in the manga, not sure what kind of crazy rice juice _you've_ been drinking.
>> ARTICLE
This man speaks the truth. Megumi is best girl it doesn't matter if she doesn't get screen time after she appeared the first time she won the best girl title so I agree 
>> ARTICLE
Luckily she'll be getting plenty of screen time :D
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah. Megumi deserves all the screen time
>> ARTICLE
> but i wouldnt be surprised if Megumi won just because we see her so much more than Erina.

Remember that the manga is still in their first year and it will continue at least for the whole 3 years I bet.
>> ARTICLE
Well, we see pretty much every other girl more than Erina. At this point we have seen her cousin, her assistant and Maybe even her aunt  more than we have seen her. Pretty sure the curry twins are ahead of her on page count at this point.
>> ARTICLE
I bet she will become way more prominent as we head into the second year.

Yeah i picked up the manga after the first episode and i love it. The bad thing is that im all caught up now i have to wait for each new chapter :/

How *dare* you speak of her that way. And Sakaki above her? I mean, Megumi and Hinako are awesome in their own ways, but Sakaki? Even Mayumi is better than her and weve seen her in only like 6 or 7 chapters total. I dont think ive ever disagreed with a subjective opinion more so than you saying that Sakaki is ranked higher than Nikumi.

Listen here nikumi is good there's no doubt about it. But sakaki is better by a small margin. Her explanations of things are always on point. I Didn't like nikumi until the friend chicken arc and I liked sakaki ever since she was introduced

Indeed. They don't even show which rooms the two of them are in in the first page of the chapter while they do for everyone else.

How does the manga compare?

They're both great in different ways. I just feel like this anime adaptation took the manga source and took a couple of liberties with it that just make both versions fully worth watching/reading.

The manga has *wayyyyyy* more detail in the art, but you get moans and color and animation with the anime. This probably one of the few series that's worth both reading and watching.

Finally! Someone else thinks Sakaki Best Girl! :D
>> ARTICLE
I thought Game food girl is best girl.

Mostly because I love game food.
>> ARTICLE
Voiced by none other than Utaha-senpai's VA
>> ARTICLE
If Megumi voiced Megumi I would be happy.
>> ARTICLE
Her tone is closer to Linda-senpai, who also happens to be best girl.
>> ARTICLE
The OP and ED are both amazing. The ED is probably my favorite song of any anime the whole season so far.
>> ARTICLE
This ED along with Kekkai Sensens ED are my fav this season
>> ARTICLE
The ED gives me the feels every time. Also my favorite song this spring season.
>> ARTICLE
I agree on the ED! It's just so fun
>> ARTICLE
Just picked up this anime and watched all 4 episodes.



I fucking love it.
>> ARTICLE
Ever since starting the manga, I really liked Megumi. Her design, personality, everything really, appealed to me immensely in some way or form. Watching her in the series fully animated, with voice, and all that jazz makes me incredibly happy, and with every episode her place as one of my all time favorite best girls is further cemented.

On another note I'll say that I'm loving the series, but the pace seems a bit slow to me. I wonder how many episodes they'll make and how far they'll go.

She's only a supporting character.

Oh my, that naked apron...

Man, I was so afraid when I saw the old lady tasting the food. I had to avert my eyes just in case of echi grandma.

But the episode was great. Plot thickens with the rank 7. The dorm people look interesting. It's pretty awesome.

Well, screw *that*.

***rapidly upvotes /u/Gonraphl***
>> ARTICLE
The angel music that plays when they react after tasting something never fails to make me laugh. This song's going to play in my head every time I eat something delicious. Hell, it's going to play every time I eat something!
>> ARTICLE
Loved the violin that was playing during the short scene which shows Erina, after the ED.

Man, there is just way to much awesome in that ED.

I'm still not sure if I should read the manga or just wait for the anime episodes...I mean, judging from what people are saying here, they say it's a pretty close-to-the-source material adaptation, so I'm fine with waiting, but if it was a case like Tokyo Ghoul anime, I'd probably read the manga.

Same with Danmachi, Denpa Kyoushi & Yamada and the 7 witches manga. 

I'm also interested in the Monster Girls manga, which will have an anime adaptation in the summer season.

Damn, so much manga to read, I don't know where to start. >.<

Has anyone actually tried creating some of Souma's food creations? It'd be really interesting to see how many of them actually works :P

They all work. When I went to a manga discussion thread on 4chan someone explained why one of the dishes from much later wouldn't work. However, I checked some forums and a couple people managed to roughly recreate it. The author actually has a consultant to help him with recipes.

thats why the banner is at the top, cuz people started posting their versions here

Ah, okay. Didn't see that

Mods are no fun.  They don't want people to get foodgasms looking at food.

can we post in the Souma threads?

Yes we can and please do, I definitely wouldn't mind people posting their attempts at last week's recipes in the current discussion thread.

Dear god the last few seconds were terrifying.

I didn't know shinpachi/glasses appeared in this show!

Wow. Takahiro Sakurai nails Isshiki perfectly!

I'm relieved that they didn't showed (*be it naked or not*), granny being surrounded by tentacles.

Or else I would be reminded of that very scene when watching H videos that contain tentacles and it would kill my dick in an instant.

wonder why they cut the scene where the cleaners had no idea where the dorm was?

Who says shows nowadays have no man-service?  Us viewers got an ass-full in this episode...and everyone probably thought it was a female ass until the camera zoomed out, it sure tricked me lol.

Dormitory looks really cool actually :D  

I was already bracing myself for granny fanservice when she was   eating, haha xD  
She seems pretty cool. I like her.  

And that guy with sideburns. Potential favorite :3  

Seems like it's getting really interesting now. I am kinda hyped for   next episode :D  
>> ARTICLE
Well, if there's one thing I learned in anime, it's that School is the place where the phenomenal always happens.  20 dollars betting there will be a filler involving a haunted chef in the dorm rooms.  

And now I have a weird craving for game meat.  I can go for some deer right now.  Or moose.  

And the dorm lady is a Super Saiyan. Confirmed, Japanese schools have phenomenal events going down.  

Souma's reaction pretty much sums up high school settings. "Another freak show!?!?" 

Wait a minute...

With the fact that the principal is King Vegeta (And by proximity, Ghiren Zabi, because his voice actor is Banjo Ginga, he's the guy who you use when you need a voice for any big imposing tyrant), and the dorm lady is a Super Saiyan, I think that Erina's blond hair also makes her Saiyan (And possibly newtype).  It's confirmed now, the school is full of saiyans.

Goddamn do I love the cooking scenes in this show.  I think the most exciting part is the cooking scenes.  It's fun trying to figure out the recipies for the show.

Dorm lady's hair is alive, confirmed Saiyan.

*Reminded that the guy who drew this series is a hentai artist*

*More reminded that the person is a hentai artist #2 with best girl Megumi (As of now) in bathtub*

*and there goes the Evangelion dick censor gag*

Tonight, on the ~~Meatbun~~ Beef pot Chronicles... (Waits until /u/GenesisEra gets here, he's better at this)

Okay, I'm freaked out by that owl.

I like ikkishi so far... I wonder why he sound so famila- Oh, Takahiro Sakurai.  So Suzaku from Code Geass.  Moving on.

Sure... Rice Juice.  And Opening song drop. 

Aww hell no you did not just talk shit about game meat!?!?!

I dunno what's worse, a male naked apron or the fact that due to Voice Actor association, I can't help but see Suzaku Kururugi in a naked apron. 

Isshiki was the 7th?  I knew he was a bad guy!  Challenger! Thing!  I don't know what the word is!

So...is there a reason why purple haired dudes eyes are always hidden or is it just a character design thing? Is he like the characters who usually have their eyes closed so that you know shut is serious when they open them?

This series soundtrack is so good. [Not OP/ED, but the songs in the series]

I wonder when it will be published.

The whole beginning I was hoping they would animate the young Fumio scene, wish granted. This adaptation is near perfect thus far, I'm loving it! 
>> ARTICLE
I really thought the grandma was going to lose all of her clothes there lol. What'd you guys think about Isshiki being part of the elite ten?

it made me wonder if all of the elite 10 had some type of sexualized kink to them or if it is only a special case for 7 and 10.

Also I really want to see how isshiki foodgasms for...uh...reasons..

This show is awesome. Always hungry and want to cook a dish from the episode.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, this show just doesn't stop with the wackiness. So we've introduced a whole bunch of new characters, and they're all pretty weird. Souma's still a badass, Megumi's still cute, Fumio's pretty cool, and her younger version is extremely fucking hot. 
>> ARTICLE
How do they not see his dick from behind?  
>> ARTICLE
His ass is just that damn fine.
>> ARTICLE
great episode  this makes my fridays to fill in for no death parade. Megumi best girl so far. Has it been confirmed for one or two cours yet? 
>> ARTICLE
This is the first time I am so excited about food. This is what MasterChef should have been
>> ARTICLE
Food Wars! never lets up, every episode is so exciting! I could say the same thing as I could every episode about how the production values are fantastic and how it's following the manga so well, but I don't want to be a broken record!

It's nice to finally meet the rest of Polaris Dorm, I already can't wait for the next episode. I expected it to be but it's definitely the show I look forward to most each week this season. The ED song playing into the credits gave me chills.

When updating my MAL, I noticed that it's now /24 episodes. So happy that this is two cours! It's been confirmed to release on eight discs with three episodes each. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm getting a return-to-the-golden-ages vibe from Polar Star now that best guy is there

Were they singing one of the Naruto OP's while partying in their dorm?
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know whether the stronger members of the Elite 10 have higher or lower numbers. 
>> ARTICLE
stronger is lower, so erina is the weakest of the top ten.

.#1 seat being well #1
>> ARTICLE
Could someone explain Soma's obsession making the disgusting foods? Did i miss the explanation given by the show?
>> ARTICLE
It's not clear in the show yet, but he's a great cook because he can make incredible dishes by improvising. He's able to think up stuff on the spot because he has more experience experimenting with random food combinations than most of his classmates.
>> ARTICLE
Soma is trying to be better than his dad.

In episode 1 it is shown that his father made something disgusting with strawberries. Soma is trying to make something even more disgusting just for the sake of being better.

(Keep in mind I only watch the anime and this seems like the logical answer)
>> ARTICLE
That's basically the relationship. [] (/s "You see it more later on when his dad visits the dorm.")  
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense to me, thanks. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually, the real answer is that he's constantly experimenting with recipe combinations.
>> ARTICLE
The reason is that he wants to improve his skills and learn new recipes. He does this by randomly trying out different combinations of food, most of the time this comes out bad, but sometimes it comes out good. If you remember last episode the reason that Soma knew to use honey was because he tried out random things to find if something else had the same properties as pineapple.

His obsession with disgusting foods doesn't necessarily come out of a competition with his dad.
>> ARTICLE
*I did*   NOT   *need to see that today*

Feel free to interpret that however you wish.
>> ARTICLE
I knew that ass was coming but I still wasn't ready. But, Fumio was a babe...    

Still wasn't ready for the second one.

>> ARTICLE
If you're talking about Isshiki's sweet ass then I'd like to interpret your comment as blasphemy. 
>> ARTICLE
If you have any interest in reading manga, this is a great one. It's just one incredible crazy dish -> analysis of said dish -> "but wait there's more" after another. (Especially in the Autumn Election Arc)
>> ARTICLE
so far this is the only episode that's not outright BETTER than the manga

it missed a tiny bit at the start with trying to find the dorm

other than that, still 11/10 for quality.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I agree completely. I wonder if 24 episodes is enough to finish the Autumn Election. Finishing halfway through would be such a tease.
>> ARTICLE
If they're doing 24 episodes and every episode thus far has been 2 chapters, then no. They'll get to around chapter 50, which is the very start of the Autumn Election. They'll be saving that for next season, it seems. 
>> ARTICLE
judging by the quality, i sure hope there's a next season (and then by the end of that, enough material for probably 2 more hah)
>> ARTICLE
If anyone wants a more comedy-centered version of this show I recommend Yakitate!! Japan, definitely one of my favorites. 
>> ARTICLE
Still sticking to two chapters per episode. It looks like that's going to be how the show does things, which makes it easy for us to predict where things are going to stop and end.

Still loving how close they're sticking to the source material.

I like how JC Staff just played the full version of the song, they wanted the ed duet humming, but the ED animation is just too cute to leave out of an episode.

This show's ED is so fun, I love it

Yeah the ED was good but after hearing Soma and Erina humming it. I had to immediately go download the song. . . except the single doesn't come out till June 10. WTF that humming was like such a good promo to get people to buy it. 

I hate it when anime songs are delayed like this because I almost always forget to download it.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I also read that it was coming out June 10th, but this Tumblr just posted the [supposedly full version of the ending] (http://shokugekis.tumblr.com/post/120190271990/shokugeki-no-souma-ending-theme-1-spice)? It sounds somewhat legit to me, but I could be wrong.

Am I the only one who likes thinking he says "It wasn't much!" rather than "Glad you liked it!"? Gives him that extra "cool" factor.
>> ARTICLE
In Japan, the saying of "It wasn't much" is actually supposed to be a humble saying. However, in the west that will most likely be taken as arrogancy. Since they want Souma's character to be appealing to the audience, the translators probably changed it.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly thought Souma's arrogance in the manga was the coolest thing about him. Loved how he was just there to kick ass and make himself #1.

I think Souma and Takumi would make great friends, seeing how they complement each other and with their similar backgrounds.

But I suppose a kind of friendly rivalry works just as well.
>> ARTICLE
I'd ship that ._.
>> ARTICLE
The running gag in the manga is that Takumi thinks he and Soma are rivals but Soma doesn't really give a shit. Like Kakashi+Gai.
>> ARTICLE
It's like Kashima and Mikorin, seeing as Takumi is actually SUCH a Mikorin.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the gag would be that Takumi already seems poised to be tsundere toward Soma?

>Like Kakashi+Gai.

So, will their next fight be decided by a rock-paper-scissors?

Am I the only one, who likes Erina more? This hype for Megumi is weird lol
>> ARTICLE
Erina only breaks through as a very interesting character in about 2-3 episodes if the anime goes through the manga at the same pace.

Her backstory is the best thing about her and it hasn't been revealed in the anime yet.
>> ARTICLE
The manga readers are bashing her as well.
>> ARTICLE
Nope Erina is best girl for me! 
>> ARTICLE
Nice! I like her very much too!
>> ARTICLE
All right, Erina is an old-style, "she warms up over time" tsundere.

Nikumi is the new-style, embarrassed about her feelings, hot-and-cold tsundere.

Everybody got that?
>> ARTICLE
And here I am thinking freedom-tits is my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
You're not the only one. Erina is the most popular female character in the manga. People hate her because she's arrogant. But how many geniuses do we know in real life who don't have a touch of arrogance to them (And yes, she has genius level potential). She's a much more realistic character than nice girl Megumi. People say Erina is a Tsundere. I disagree. I think she's a top class chef who knows and behaves like exactly what she is, the top student  who's better than everyone else in her class . I love the realism of her character 
>> ARTICLE
> She's a much more realistic character than nice girl Megumi. 

No not really.
>> ARTICLE
... I've met way more girls like Megumi than Erina.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, arrogant super genius is realistic but struggling nice girl is not?  Wut?
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, people don't understand the way she was brought up. 
>> ARTICLE
Yup, and she knows that she is the best as well. Compare that to Souma. What background does he have? Street restaurant. Reputation when he joined the school? Non-existant. His attitude? Extremely arrogant with little to nothing to back it up at the time he joined the school.

Of course something like that will rub Erina the wrong way. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if you have read the manga, but the reason why Souma acts like he's so confident of himself because he thought his Dad was the only monster in the cooking world. And even though he failed numerous times to beat his dad, he was improving in every cooking battle to the point that he's desensitize of the another world of the geniuses of cooking.
>> ARTICLE
Yes that his reason for his confidence and he got the skills to back it up, but how are the rest of the world supposed to know this? In their eyes it is someone who showed up from nowhere and started talking big with nothing to show yet.

He basically made a speech declaring everyone at the school was second rate because they lack restaurant experience. He doesn't know if this is the case at all, he just assumes. Of course he will get a lot of hate from this. 

Yes I am up to date with the manga, but since this is the anime discussion thread I am only discussing with information available to the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Her arrogance makes her interesting imo. Especially when she starts to grow as character. People should just keep in mind that her tsundere trait is just an act and it will crumble down sooner and later. Watching this happen will be fun I think.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. She has been my favorite since the start and this episodes ending was super cute! 
>> ARTICLE
Err I might be a bit late but...

I think all of them are cute.

Megumi makes me feel so much at home. Erina is so hng. 

And then there is Inui-sensei who seems to be out of this world cute. Her husband sure must be lucky.
>> ARTICLE
I do.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the Inui camp after this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Megumi over-hyped ? Maybe...

Like Erina more ? HELL. NO.
>> ARTICLE
Erina doesn't come off as much of a bitch in the manga to me. The anime enhances her tsundere act somehow and Megumi is imo a very boring plain character.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, her whole life she has been number 1 among her peers and experts from all over the world values her opinion then comes this seemingly random dude acts like she is a novice and he is better than her without any proof what so ever. Of course she will get annoyed about something like that. 

From my PoV she is pretty fair and will admit that Souma got respectable cooking skills once he actually has done something in the school to back up his boasting. 
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if you're a manga reader or not, but even when he does, she still acts much the same way...
>> ARTICLE
I do, but right here I argued from information that was available from the anime and didn't bring up anything from the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I'm not sure, but I was referring to 

>From my PoV she is pretty fair and will admit that Souma got respectable cooking skills once he actually has done something in the school to back up his boasting.

To be fair, I feel like Soma has already done commendable things in the anime, and she still likes to wrongly put him down as a cook. I will concede that she has the opportunity to become a very good character especially with some humorous developments with her in the manga, but she still hasn't gotten there at all imo.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing he has done so far that is of renown is beating Nikumi, which is pretty good but it isn't at an elite level. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, to be fair, Erina treated him like some pleb at cooking. Even beating Nikumi far destroys that notion.
>> ARTICLE
And there hasn't been any interaction between the two of them since that happen in this point of the anime so unless we start discussing the manga we can't actually say how their relationship changed.

Not counting this episode's bumping since they didn't talk at all and it was left at a cliffhanger.
>> ARTICLE
>From my PoV she is pretty fair and will admit that Souma got respectable cooking skills once he actually has done something in the school to back up his boasting.

But she didn't. Did you watch episode 2?
>> ARTICLE
The first thing she did was not admit him in school when he proved he was such a good cook she loved his dish. Really?
>> ARTICLE
Well, this is not exactly a manga discussion thread and in the anime she has been an outright bitch so far.  

And plain boring nice girl usually beats boring stuck up girl. 
>> ARTICLE
I've read the manga and if I focus on what we have seen in the anime so far she was as much as a bitch in the manga as in the anime at least to me.
>> ARTICLE
That's true, I am just saying...still prefer the tsundere over the plain girl. I understand the hate for Erina, but the love for Megumi is just weird. She never does anything and just appears to be scared and useless throughout the series.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's because she has funny facial expressions, and reacts to things a lot. It makes her the perfect counterpart for Soma, since every badass main character needs an audience to fawn/gawk/faint over them. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes true, I am not saying that she doesn't have her qualities, but people get offended when you don't think she is best girl or have a different preference. That's not okay.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen much of that, but I admit I haven't taken part in any such discussions. It's definitely not okay if people do that, being able to like different characters is exactly what makes shows fun. 
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, I am not against shipping your favorite girl, but the Megumi fanbase can really act obnoxious if you dare to say that you like Erina over her. That alone is my issue. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm kind of split on tsunderes. Some work... Some don't. 

If she's the type of tsundere that remains tsun for the entirety of the show to then turn dere in the last 2-3 episodes, then I'm not interested. 

But a tsundere like Taiga from Toradora or Senjougahara from Monogatari, hands down better than any plain boring nice girls. 
>> ARTICLE
Well she develops sympathies towards Soma throughout the series and even helps him. She doesn't really turn dere, but I think it will get better. I also think that the tension between her and Soma is very interesting.

But anyways I just don't understand the whole hype towards Megumi.
>> ARTICLE
The main thing is that it is most certainly *not* a romance manga. Sure you have some hints at feelings, but the cooking is the focus of the story. Certain character's relationships will undoubtedly develop into that direction, but it will be slow going. And tbh i really like that it is in the back seat, similar to how i like that romance in One Piece is almost nonexistant. True, Erina isnt even a main focus of the manga but im pretty sure she will be the end girl, the one who (like souma's dad mentioned) get him to be the best chef he can be. Based on the way her character is presented. She has slightly loosened up against souma, but it isnt anywhere near romance...yet.
>> ARTICLE
I never argued against your points?
>> ARTICLE
Neither was I? I was adding more to your post with my own thoughts....
>> ARTICLE
> it isnt anywhere near romance...yet.

Something I'm really curious about. 

Everything seems to point at Erina but she's just been back-to-back tsundere reactions and the occasional commentary. It seems like romance would be a really sweet way to further the message of "pursuing your passion" but I agree that it seems very far off. 

>> ARTICLE
Well for me it's just the way she was introduced (literally right after his dad reflects on how a man can reach the peak in his cooking, finding a woman to cook for). Also, they've never directly cooked against each other but they still have this inherent rivalry against each other ("I will make you say my food is delicious") so my guess is that she will be one of his final opponents as he rises through the ranks. And Souma tends to makes friendly rivalries with his opponents. Plus he seems to always be on her mind and she is adamant at not wanting to acknowledge him despite the fact that he deserves it. That will change when he *eventually* (probably) gets into the elite 10, and when she meets her the world class chef she admires more than any other. Idk, there is always the chance I'm wrong, it just really *feels* like erina is his end girl right? Similar to how obvious it is who would really end up with Naruto from the very beginning. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's just the current characterization. 

I also see a lot of potential for Erina because her relationship has a lot more of that "tension" that you mentioned. But at this stage of the series, Megumi's been a lot more pleasant as a character.  
She's showing a lot of growth in these early parts compared to Erina and while being sympathetic/helpful.

I also like Erina more but I don't think it's outlandish to hype the nicest girl of the show. 

>> ARTICLE
You motherfuckers gotta learn that Hinako is best girl, because she is Taihou from Kantai Collection (Seiyuu connection), and since CVs (Aircraft Carriers) are best girls in Kancolle, and Taihou is a CV, and since Hinako is Taihou, that makes Hinako a CV, which makes Hinako best girl.

That's my logic and you guys aren't changing my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Megumi's VA is Shinano's though...
>> ARTICLE
Megumi as Shinano...

*Nosebleed*
>> ARTICLE
She was actually voted the 2nd most popular character in the Manga after Soma. I think she becomes more and more likable as the manga goes on, but so does almost everyone. 
>> ARTICLE
/r/anime seem to be obsessed with Megumi though to a point that Erina shippers get harrassed. At least I normally see only Megumi posts and different opinons doesn't seem to be very well received here.
>> ARTICLE
I think its because Megumi apparently takes several levels in being a badass in the manga. And I for one like underdogs.
>> ARTICLE
> /r/anime[1] seem to be obsessed with Megumi though to a point that Erina shippers get harrassed

I don't know why, but I burst out laughing when I read this. It makes something so trivial sound like a serious issue. It makes it sound like someone's being seriously bullied because of the 2D character they prefer.

If someone's trying to belittle you because of the fictional character you prefer, then they're either joking or they're a truly sad person.

Someone who takes something like that so seriously probably doesn't have much in the way of a life outside of what's on their screen.

I like all the characters in this show so far, male and female. To be honest, the intense focus on the non-existent power struggles between females characters in anime is what turns me off a lot of the episode discussions. That's why I don't go near the Nisekoi threads. I watch the show, enjoy the interaction between the characters, and then I put it to bed, because there's no discussion to be found there other than "X best girl" and a thousand different gif compilations. Snore.

Edit: In fairness, I do accept that there's not a lot to discuss when it comes to Nisekoi, really. It's fluff, even if it is enjoyable fluff.
>> ARTICLE
Anime watchers have no reason to like Erina yet. She is portrayed as a bitch character with no redemption so far.
>> ARTICLE
The manga readers reacting this way as well as far as I know. They are really obsessive with Megumi.
>> ARTICLE
Because she is still a bitch in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
That's your opinion, I never found her to be that bad and I prefer her over Megumi a lot.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's an opinion. She just straight up acts like a bitch. _Liking_ her is an opinion.
>> ARTICLE
For me it's just a tsundere arc and nothing serious to be angry about. She is still far more interesting than Megumi for me. But it's okay if you prefer Megumi, just let others like what they like.
>> ARTICLE
Megumi has nothing to do with people disliking Erina, there's no need to connect the two. The only thing linking them is Megumi being the *other* most popular girl. Haters would prefer *anyone* over Erina.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying people can't like Erina, I'm just saying that the people who don't like her have a perfectly valid reason not to.

She only did some grunt work... nothing that anyone else couldn't do.

If it weren't for Souma's ingenuity and skill in cooking she would have been gone a long time ago, and she mostly acknowledges it.

She just went out in the mountains and collected key ingredients for the dish they just made. She is essential to his success. But yes soma is the main guy 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, this episode she was marginally useful compared to her last contributions... Still far from "she helps soma as much as he helps her"
>> ARTICLE
eh im bias. I'll admit my defeat for now I'll be back next week.
>> ARTICLE
See ya then. Btw it's not that I dislike Megumi, it's that she's not really living up to the "this contest is so hard you can fail at any time" vibe of the show. 

And I really would like that to happen, to see her on slightly more equal footing with Souma. Then she can truly live to the best Girl hype. Maybe shut up a few Erina fans as well.  
>> ARTICLE
Gotta wait for this arc to happen. It's good but The Erina fans come from the manga so they won't shut up

Sorry I didn't comment last week, had Fanime and stuff to do.

However, I did like that that one of the teachers is voiced by TAKEHITO KOYASU, or for us mecha people, Mu from Gundam Seed, Zechs from Gundam Wing, Gym from Turn A Gundam, Gamlin from Macross 7....

Expert Anime Fan: You know, if you are gonna be naming all the roles Takehito Koyasu did on just mecha, we will be here all day.

/u/Daishomaru: Fine, I will save the Takehito Koyasu Jokes for later...


Also, Hinako's voice is played by Taihou from Kantai Collection. That makes her already a massive contender for best girl in a show full of best girls.

Also, I like the Takumi Brothers.  I've watched enough Iron Chef Japan to appreciate fusion cuisine.  

Now for this episode:

I really like Hinako.  Dosen't help that she's Taihou from Kantai Collection.

I kind of saw it coming that the tea crackers Soma borrowed from Hinako were gonna be used to be fried but that's because I watched so much Iron Chef Japan to the point where I got Genre Savvy.

*This is your weekly reminder that the guy who drew this series also did hentai.*

Yo quick food notes for anyone that might want to try and remake Soma's recipe. Maybe someone more well versed in Japanese cuisine can correct me, or add some notes.

The Tamago no Moto is a type of Japanese Mayo, you can find recipes for it online.

The Kinome used in the mayo is an herb that comes from the same tree that bears Szechuan peppercorns.

The green, spiral vegetables used in the dish are called Fiddlehead Ferns, and along with the Kinome, they are harvested in Spring. So you might be able to find some around this time at your local Asian grocer and/or Farmer's market.

The Kaki no Tane rice snacks, if not found at an Asian grocer, can be found on Amazon in packs of 6 for about a dollar each.

And the Devil's Walking Sticks, I've never heard of, or seen. Maybe someone else can help out with that one.

Hope this helps anyone who might have been trying to identify some of the terms used.

And here's a link to the recipe on the wiki, I'll try to find a more detailed one.

Also, the humming at the end was fucking adorable.

But seriously, this is anime of the season.
>> ARTICLE
I was hoping for Hinako to be in the bath, but was disappointed to see Erina instead.
>> ARTICLE
Finally we get the full ED, liking the 2nd part of it a lot!
>> ARTICLE
Food Wars! manages to put a smile on my face every week, I adore it! I love Inui's character and I'm glad that she'll be around for a long time. Food Wars! has one of my favourite casts to date in anime/manga and I'm happy that J.C.Staff are doing such a great job adapting it. The rivalry between Soma and Takumi is good fun and I like how much focus it gets and how it differs with each task.

I enjoy the OP but the ED is one of my all-time favourites and has been since episode one. It's so cute and catchy, and I love how 'warm' it feels! Soma and Erina singing at the end cracked me up, it's so sweet. Can't wait for the OST!

Can't wait for next week's episode!
>> ARTICLE
What the hell kind of training camp is this
>> ARTICLE
Ok Im not a manga reader so base on the anime I never liked Erina but that last scene I thinks she's my favorite girl, (Not that I have one cus Megumi is just riding on Soma's coat tail don't now what her appeal is either) humming duet of the ED song was too Kawaii... best scene of the season so far... no doubt.. 
>> ARTICLE
When I watched the first episode I was laughing because the show is about cooking and food orgasms.

But now I'm enjoying this show and waiting for each episode just like Fate/Stay Night UBW ... which after episode one, I would've said that's impossible.

This episode had me cry in laughter, Soma's humming and face at the end was soooooo hilarious, also blonde Aldini giving a speech he will destroy Soma then has to sit next to him, while Soma gives him a smug face, again I laughed so hard.

I think Shokugeki with F/SN UBW are tied for top 1 for this season.

I love Soma's character so much, and the different faces make me laugh so hard .... he reminds me of Goku when I used to watch DBZ when I was younger.
>> ARTICLE
Any other manga readers thought that the after ED scene with Kojirou was a excellent touch and provides a better lead in to the next episodes?

EDIT: Also [expectation spoiler](#s 'incoming Kojirou hate for next few episodes...')

I like that they threw in the second verse there. I expected it to end as soon as that scene ended.

Finally!!! A worthy opponent for Souma. Inui senpai be the first teacher/senpai I've liked till now. The comedy skit between Souma and Takumi was really fun especially the "Till we meet again" part. This is definitely good shounen stuff.

liked it anyway

next couples of episodes will be really hype. cant wait.

So last week we got a duck-Pavarotti foodgasm, and now we get a mermaid foodgasm? Inui is weird.  
Dat humming doe.
>> ARTICLE
-I'm pretty sure the voice actor for Inui is the same one who voices Mavis in Fairy Tail. Am I right?

-I loved it when Yoshino got trolled with her expectations of a five star dinner!

-Damn. The episode really teased us in that bit with Erina at the end. From the camera shots I was thinking Souma was going to walk in on her in the bath, not afterwards.

-I liked the extra bits they added to give some backgroun to Aldini and Shinomiya-sempai.

They added more lyrics to the end song! Anyone got a translation?
>> ARTICLE
Crap! The show's shipping Erina and Souma!

MEGUMI STILL BEST GIRL!
>> ARTICLE
Great episode! I really like Takumi, he seems like a great rival, both in the sense that he is a worthy adversary and mirrors Soma, and in the sense that his behavior is hilarious and very tsundere. 

And I'm quite excited and happy to see Erina again! Especially shown in a nice rather than bitchy light for a change. I'm eager to see how the relationship between her and Soma progresses. 

My only complaints with this episode are that Soma's dish seemed a little underwhelming, compared to how refined Takumi's was. And that Soma and Erina both humming the same song, which has no reason to exist in the in-anime world, is a bit too much. Especially with them bumping into one another immediately after. I suppose I should simply be thankful that her towel/clothes didn't come off, or he didn't grab her chest, but I think I would have preferred a subtler scene of her simply humming the end theme, giving us a hint that she is actually a nice person. Though the contrast between her humming and Soma's was pretty funny, and made the whole thing worthwhile anyway. In the end, these are just nitpicks, and I'm enjoying the hell out of this show. 
>> ARTICLE
TAKUMI <3

That humming (erina's) was SO FUCKING SEXY. I can't... I just can't...

I'm so glad to see Erina again, really hope we get even more in the coming weeks. I can't understand why she gets so much hate, even as someone who didn't read the manga i still really liked her from episode 2 onward. Also loved how they used the ending, definitely the best ending this season for me.
>> ARTICLE
50 servings in 60 mins is nearly impossible unless they cook more than one steak at a time. Being Generous and saying that you only fry the steak 2 mins per side and you prepare the salad, rice, soup and preserved radish within that time (not to mention season the next set of steaks and prepare the cutlery), it would take 50*4 minutes to complete this task using one stove. Even if 2 stoves are used the time taken would only half resulting in 100 minutes (not to mention you have to twice as efficient as there is twice the tasks to complete within the same 4 minutes)  A minimum of 3 stoves are required to complete the task within the time limit. However, this would be nearly impossible. Efficiency can be raised using a production line as each person only needs to handle one specific task but this does not seem to be the case.(This method would also be reliant on cooking the steak as quickly as possible and this will be extremely difficult)
>> ARTICLE
Other factors I have not included are the time taken to rice to cook(easily over 15-30 mins per pot: this time only increases as more rice is cooked), heating of the metal plate the steak is served on, the preparation of salad lettuce, Boiling of the egg in the salad, preparing the carrot and potato of accompanying the steak, boiling the miso soup etc. Even if all components were already prepared in advance, the assembly time and transit time(between stations to collect materials) will result in time wastage and make it near impossible to complete the task.

Despite the fact that a lot of the animation seems shoddy, it's a complete hype-train anime, the fanservice is off the charts, the lore is as far as I can see nonexistent, the world itself is never explained or fleshed out, all men except the main characters (which now includes a Klein/Ichigo/blacksmith with a shallow backstory) acts as misogynistic cunts which in turn makes the main guys attract girls like ants to sugary gunk on the ground and the naivete of Bell (and what the fuck kind of name is that?)  makes the show cringe worthy at best, I can't stop watching and I'll love it forever.

The most generic shounen MC? True
>> ARTICLE
Nope, he isn't generic. He is one of the best shonen MCs I know of right now..

Watch the anime and you'll understand.

I am watching. What makes him not generic? He's a typical gary stu.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who knows what happens in the future episodes, this is funny to me. 
>> ARTICLE
As someone who also knows what happens in the future episodes, I think he is highly generic as well.

The whole book-dumb, experimental, extreme determination, "average-but-not-really" person from a relatively unknown background thrown into the fire is not in any way original. The existence of future character progression doesn't really change how generic he is at the moment.

>> ARTICLE
But he's not book dumb. He literally talks about how he got one of his ideas from reading about it in a book. Remember the enzymes in a pineapple.

And I haven't seen many charachters fit the description you have. Maybe it's not original but that doesn't mean it's generic. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, my thoughts are very similar. At this point of time, there is and will be no original characters anymore. Whether the MC's OP or average with a bunch of extra traits, he's bound to get called "generic." 

And Soma, a Gary Stu? We all know he isn't. And that's what I found funny.
>> ARTICLE
I dont think you understand that word.
>> ARTICLE
What word? Listen, I am enjoying the show and it's fun. Generic doesn't mean it's bad, but there's no point making him out to be better than he really is.
>> ARTICLE
Gary Stu.
>> ARTICLE
Trust me. HE IS NOT GENERIC. What's generic is the try-hard, but really shit and soppy drama, "I believe in you" type of trash crap that you want to slap in the face and disembowel.

>> ARTICLE
I think the author will make Erina win for sure.
>> ARTICLE
This is best girl contest, not the love Triangle Contest.
>> ARTICLE
I think Erina is best girl then, she has the most potential for character development and her flustered attitude towards Soma is always funny.
>> ARTICLE
when people originally started saying "best girl" it was generally reserved for the character that "should" win, but obviously will not.
>> ARTICLE
Well even if she has potential it doesn't amount to much beforehand.

Even with it there is no way she will beat Hisako^^^^^^as ^^^^^^far ^^^^^^as ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^know ^^^^^^atleast 
>> ARTICLE
I mean best girl is great and all but Hisako is into Megumi, not Soma, so there's not much point in comparing them
>> ARTICLE
Even Hisako herself would gladly admit that Erina is superior, you as her follower should take her as role model.

>> ARTICLE
Well ofcourse the 10th seat of the Elite Ten would be the supirior cook and that she is Erina's subordinate that she techincally her inferior in that regard, but then again you are right, but things get fixed in [arc name]( /s "the Stagiare arc") and thats when I felt like branding her name on my back.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I grew to really like her and I think she is a very adorable charcter, but she doesn't get enough screentime anywhere else. My ranking would be Erina > Alice > Hisako > rest >>> Nikumi.

I'm getting really scared now since if this has me inches from dying from a laughing fit, I am certian I will die during the Autumn Election.

And like many others I would like to watch Puella Magi Mahou Doujima.

Puella Magi Mahou Doujima

There doesn't need to be a plot, Takehito Koyasu is  playing as a dude in drag, the mecha community instantly declares it the greatest thing ever, leading up to an even better sequel, Puella Magi Mahou Doujima alternative, where it is so good that when the scriptwriter read the plot, he instantaneously cried manly tears.

Yummm rainbow on a plate. I was wondering if they would even show what her dish was before the episode ended
>> ARTICLE
Anime team decide to give change the cliffhanger a little. I think that's a nice change otherwise it'll always be "what's gonna be the next dish" cliffhanger all the time.
>> ARTICLE
I really like that Dojima made Tadakoro take the lead here.  All too often in these shounen anime, the female character always ends up either being useless or a damsel in distress (Sakura, Orihime) that the main character has to help.  But here, Souma isn't saving Tadakoro just because she's his friend or because she's a girl, he's helping her because he believes in her and he's willing to stake his future on her skill.
>> ARTICLE
LOL You think Sakura and Orihime are bad examples of girls in anime? Literally every girl in Hitman Reborn [spoilers I think?](/s "ends up in the kitchen.") At least those two, as poorly written as they are, get their own spotlight in someway. KHR keeps everybody oppressed.
>> ARTICLE
I think people get pissed about Orihime's character because they were leading up to something with her in the Arrancar arc that never panned out. 

I still think that the story should have ended up that it was her finishing off the big baddie of the series. (Although, that still might happen)
>> ARTICLE
Kubo had his chance to let Orihime as well as Chad shine and I feel like he failed them both as an author, (I feel the same way about Sakura in Naruto). He is the author, he had every chance (barring some kind of editorial rampage) to *include* the characters he created into his story. But instead he chose a nonsensical route that pretty much abandoned them, and now they've become irrelevant in the eyes of most people (myself included.)

However that's still not as bad as giving your characters *negative* development, like with Hitman Reborn. 
>> ARTICLE
It's funny that you say that when the author of the series is female too
>> ARTICLE
That's the most puzzling part about it all. It's like halfway through the series she said "fuck it girls can't be heroes get back in the kitchen."
>> ARTICLE
It's because Dojima is (VA Joke) Mu La Flaga from Gundam Seed.

Of course he knows how to get teenagers to get out of their ANGST and turn them into MEN OF DESTINY. He's best guy that isn't Rau Le Creuset in that show! 
>> ARTICLE
Gundam references :)

Dojima is a Char after all.  He used his newtype instincts that basically told him "this match would be good".

Megumi's accent is just so cute, I can't handle it man.
>> ARTICLE
I'll just piggyback here since it's about accents a new comment wont be seen. I noticed for the blonde alumni his accent is extremely similar to the dutch diplomat in Champloo. 
>> ARTICLE
The magical cabbage girls scene cracked me up. I've been reading the manga and still these cliffhangers are killer! The episode feel like the fly by in minutes, I'm so happy that J.C.Staff are adapting one of my favourite manga so well.

BTW the ending song Spice by Tokyo Karan Koron just got released yesterday. Just saying.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, all of your best girls are shit in comparison to Hinako Sensei. But at last she will never be the true best girl of the series... Still Hinako has the best taste when it comes to the second best girl though.

This anime has just everything. It gives something like cooking such an epic setting. It can actually create cliffhangers, the characters are all different and enjoyable ( hell I love Hinako ). Soma has already made himself the most badass MC in my opinion. I just have a great time watching this. 

Also Pink Gabbage superior Race lol
>> ARTICLE
Pink Cabbage proves that Takehito Koyasu can be put into ANY role and it's instant gold material better than Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Evangelion, Madoka Magica, Gundam, Gaogaigar, Cross Ange and every other liked anime on /r/anime combined.  Times 10.  Squared.  Cubed.  X OVER 9000!  Out of 10.

ME tooo. That cliffhanger with the epic "DOES SHOKUGEKI APPLY TO ALUMNIS?" got me going to read it so hard. Before that, I've been trying to resist not reading it but that got me there.

I did the same haha. The cliffhanger was too much for me. Now I'm all caught up and waiting for more chapters.

I did the same thing. This wasn't an anime I expected to be so interested in but I can't get enough.
>> ARTICLE
Last episode ending was so good I had to read too, I went up until current manga chapter -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully the anime gets all the way up to the Autumn Election Arc
>> ARTICLE
I really want to see the election arc animated for one single scene; the scene right before [](/s "Tadokoro hang-cuts the fish, where she's trying to calm herself.") That scene might be one of the most epic scenes in shounen without combat, blood, or really anything happening at that scecond. 
>> ARTICLE
I just want to see Alice i guess 2 more episodes
>> ARTICLE
[Manga Spoilers](/s "Specifically Megumi getting her 88")
>> ARTICLE
That needs to be adapted.
>> ARTICLE
It will definitely be adapted, the anime is extremely the most popular out of this season in the west (out of non-sequels), and it is also very popular in Japan.
>> ARTICLE
With the pace we're going, I'm predicting S1's gonna stop somewhere between the Training Camp Arc (the arc we're currently in now) and the Autumn Election Arc.

Season 2's gonna be the whole Autumn Election.

Meaning the chance that we're gonna see best scene- 

> Shokugeki no Soma is a Cooking ~~Manga~~ Anime

-in the next season and not in the current one is pretty high. :D
>> ARTICLE
Whats the best scene?
>> ARTICLE
I thought the anime was getting 24 episodes, so it'll all be one season with no breaks, either way I'm hyped!
>> ARTICLE
yeah but considering each episode covers roughly 2 chapters, we're only going to get to chapter 50 by the end of the 24 episodes, which is like just the beginning of the autumn election arc.

So hopefully they make season 2 so we can see it , because its basically just 50 chapters of nonstop cooking battles and its *awesome*
>> ARTICLE
I'm more interested in the current story arc of the manga and cannot wait to see how it plays out.

I couldn't find the special for Volume 4 translated, so here is the recipe for Chou Farci:

Ingredients:

2 Chicken breasts  
12-14 pieces cabbage
4 strips of bacon  
1 liter buillion  
4 aspagaus stalks  
3 shiitake mushrooms  
1 tablespoon beef fat(Tallow)  

For the mousse

400g Chicken breast  
1 egg  
100 mL fresh cream  
Salt and pepper  
Coarse black pepper

1) Shave off the outer part of the asparagus and cut into quarters.Cut off the stalks of the shiitake and cut thinly. Then heat up the tallow on the frying pan.

2) For the mousse, chop up the chicken into big pieces, add the rest of the ingredients into the food processor until it becomes a puree. Pour it out into a bowl and chill. 

3) Boil the cabbage and remove the core. Remove the skin of one of the remaining chicken breasts and cut in half. Wrap the half in plastic wrap and flatten it with a rolling pin. 

4) On the cabbage, put the chicken breast from (3), the mousse, the asparagus, and the shiitake in the center, and roll it all up with the bacon on the outside

5) Boil in the bullion under low heat for an hour

6) Plate it and top it off with coarse black pepper

This was a terrific episode that showcased Soma's true personality. He likes to joke around and is very laid back but he's a very serious person who looks out for people and helps them develop. Sure, he's a little OP in cooking but he didn't overstep his boundaries because he wanted Megumi to develop on her own. Speaking of which, they have such terrific chemistry together that it's an absolute joy to see them on screen together. It worked beautifully here and I'm looking forward to what else is coming up.

He's also voicing the gun tasting guy in Assassination Classroom. I'm getting him on 3 of 6 Friday show, and it's glorious.

Koyasu also does a lot of Gundam Voices.

When I heard his voice 1st time, I squeed.

Seriously, he's a god upon /m/en due to how many voices he has in mecha anime.
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader (I know, last thing people usually wanna hear), I already know Hinako is great, Shinomiya is scary cool, Souma is BA, and the way the author makes reactions to the food is both hilarious and creative (Dat pink ranger), but I feel like there isn't enough attention given to Megumi in the comment thread from this episode. 

Main reason for this whole section of the story is going on is the author is showing off that Megumi is a capable chef in her own right. This is her first real story-centric challenge and I'm glad the story makes sure Souma takes backseat, but still has his own presence throughout the challenge. There is a really good balance between the attention that all the characters get, but back to Megumi. She struggles with anxiety and confidence, but given support of a friend she can brave through all of her worries and deliver her own dish at the end. I'm sure many people can relate to Megumi's issues and it also provides the idea that genuine encouragement can really go a long way. Her spark in confidence felt like realistic growth, not a random friendship cures all problems.

Besides that, if you love the anime. Definitely pick up the manga, its super AMAZING.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the way they presented Tadakoro's dish at the end there. The rainbow and shininess of the dish was a nice touch.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't be surprised if Megumi actually loses, and having Shinomiya changing his mind after tasting her dish. But, it looks like they just want Yukihira to steamroll everyone, so it might not happen, even if Shinomiya didn't serve his best dish, it would be unrealistic really having him lose.

God damn that was great. I love how they portrayed Souma as a complete badass even in a support role. I'm actually really happy that he added the condition that Megumi was to be the lead chef, she is a great cook on her own, and can't have Souma always carry her.  
  
...and it's a Shokugekliffanger!
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why, but when Megumi had the flashback of watching her mother cooking from her childhood, tears welled up in my eyes. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN? IT WASN'T EVEN SAD.

Honestly, I picked this up almost as a joke at first, and that was when the series was already 6 episodes in. I tore through those 6 episodes and, out of the 20 series I'm watching concurrently this season, this is the one I get the most enjoyment out of. It's just pure enjoyment from beginning to end every episode. There's a good few shows I love from this season, Kekkai Sensen, Oregairu, Ore Monogatari, Yamada-kun, Baby Steps, Arslan Senki, but I honestly don't know how to fault Shokugeki No Soma. I can't see any faults.

NO, what the hell we have to wait another week to taste Megumi's dish!?  Why they do this T-T

Normally I hate Best Girl discussion because it muscles out quality discussion, but Hinako-senpai is just way too entertaining, especially when you have her and Shinomiya together.

The blond chef (there's so many names, and I'm too lazy to check each one) sounds so bizarre.  Is his script just full of French or does he have some other accent?

Magical Cabbage is just one of those things that surprises me in this show, even though I should expect the ridiculous and hilarious by now.  

I think of all the shows I'm watching this season I'm enjoying this the most, it's just so funny and exciting.

Ahhh never change, Shokugeki, never change.  On a serious note I was really liking this episode.  I was hoping Megumi would find a way to flex her chef muscles and have her own spotlight :).

he soundtrack for the episode was excellent. Almost as good as Souma trolling Megumi about her accent and Hinako in general this episode.

This show is too much. Magical Cabbage indeed. My thing though is how did he boil AND steam the cabbage without it disintegrating or becoming total mush? And what is it topped with? Caviar? Or possibly capers? Capers makes more sense. 

Edit: On second look, it's not either because it's too small. Diced sauteed mushrooms in bacon/backfat to reinforce the flavors in the filling?

This show has really picked up for mine! I'm really enjoying the character development of Megumi and how she was forced into being the lead chef. I had my doubts about Souma issuing the Shokugeki and him being the knight in shining armour once again but I was proven wrong. Another thing to note is that this show also makes me genuinely laugh which is a lot more than other shows I've been watching recently.

At this point you know Souma/Tadokoro are always gonna win no matter what, but each time they're going up against increasingly harder opponents or higher standards so it's about seeing how creatively they can make their dish successful.

Megumi so kawaiiiiiiiiii
>> ARTICLE
As a fan of the manga, I'm really loving the anime and how well it sticks to the source material. All the way down to the reaction faces and other small details.
>> ARTICLE
To the manga readers who complained last week.  I think it was a good idea to include the challenge last week.  Because this week we get more details about the challenge.  I can't believe there's another cliffhanger though, I almost thought they wouldn't even showcase the dish this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Oh hot diggity damn just when it was getting to the good part the episode is over. I want more dammit!

Magical Cabbage girls... Dojima was really into it.
>> ARTICLE
Never thought I'd be scared of the color pink outside of a certain anime with a misleading OP. Or of cabbage....
>> ARTICLE
Terrine! I love that Megumi is throwing it in Shinomiya's face that her recipe for the same dish she just "failed" will be better. And its a French dish no less!
>> ARTICLE
It's amazing going from Jojo to Shokugeki and continuing to hear Dio's voice. Especially after this last episode
>> ARTICLE
I see a lot of people joke about how quickly a show goes by some times. Here I was sitting and watching them talk about this dish and then suddenly the credits roll. It was the first time I have been surprised by how quickly an episode seemingly ended. Granted, there was about 2-3 minutes after the credits so that probably helped.

GAH, I can't wait :X
>> ARTICLE
The omake part in the middle of the episode is from volume 4 page 26.
>> ARTICLE
Can we all take a minute to appreciate just how freaking adorable Hinako is? She's even cuter than Megumi most of the time (there, I said it).  
Kind of a weird way to end this episode, but maybe this means the entirety of next episode will be everyone reacting to Megumi and Souma's dish. Or at least I hope so.
>> ARTICLE
If they can't at least get to the fall elections arc I hope they at least adapt the pool chapter cause I need to see erina and megumi in a damm swimsuit

I can't even get mad at that cliffhanger because it was that ridiculous  smh, bravo.
>> ARTICLE
cabbage blue is the best....
>> ARTICLE
The classical opera at ~20:00 of the 11th episode, the one with female vocals. Someone, I beg of you. Tell me the name!

>> ARTICLE
Of course Hinako is taking Megumi's side. She finds Megumi delicious after all. And that Dojima is awesome. Good to see not top end chefs have a stick up their ass. 

That Fuyumi chef, I like her just because she sits like L from Death Note.

The magical cabbage scenes were hilarious. Doujima Cabbage PINKU! 

Last but not least, that a girl Megumi. Doing your own thing , even though Soma is leading from behind, I am proud of you. I just hate that they cut the result to the next episode. But it looks like Shinomyia was crying in the preview so, GG Megumi! 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah ... Sniff ! My little angel is growing to become a splendid and talented cook ! Mommy is so proud ^_^
>> ARTICLE
I love this show so much
>> ARTICLE
The soundtrack for the episode was excellent. Almost as good as Souma trolling Megumi about her accent and Hinako in general this episode. 

I forgot how awesome Souma and Megumi working together was. And how much ship tease there is with this whole thing.
>> ARTICLE
PLEASE, SOMEONE TELL ME WHY THIS SHOW IS SO FUCKING AWESOME, BECAUSE I SHIT IN MY PANTS EVERY DAMN EPISODE.
>> ARTICLE
God I loved that slow piano version of the opening theme. Nice build up for the battle. Nice to see they changed it up and had megumi be the head chef while soma assists. Even if he assists, she is still amazing. I don't think I can wait a week for the next episode so I'm reading the manga

Superb episode as usual. Great to see that megumi will not always be a dead weight and was forced to hold her own this episode. She is officially best girl with hinako chef as well.

I didn't know but it looks like that's what I've been waiting for my entire life.

I thought it was hilarious how Konishi kept on trying to pass the 'Don' title to someone else.

Then again, Souma and Nikumi both are much better than him. It would only be logical the strongest be the Don.

He can't be that bad. He's a second year and with a 90% failure rate in the first year only the good cooks move on.

This episode covered Chapters 12+13. 

There wasn't really anything different from the manga this time. 

I posted the recipe for the Shalyapin Steak Don in the last episode discussion, but [here](http://i.imgur.com/ds8pNaM.png) is it again.

And for those that didn't notice yet, the Foodgasm near the end in the ED changes every episode.

1. Episode we had [Kurase](http://i.imgur.com/Kzj2c1w.png)

2. [Erina](http://i.imgur.com/oUubRzq.png)

3. [Megumi](http://i.imgur.com/9VjxE6T.png)

4. [Ryouko and Yuuki](http://i.imgur.com/qsnSBqa.png)

5. [Isshiki](http://i.imgur.com/M2384pi.png)

6. [Hishoko](http://i.imgur.com/zDugRTX.png)

7. And in this episode it is [Nikumi](http://imgur.com/ACBU2tc)

The pacing is still at 2 Chapters/Episode so I guess I won't be able to see [Name of Character](/s "Ryou") in action. :(.

Edit: Nikumi picture added.
>> ARTICLE
Last chapter though [Chapter 117 spoilers](/s "Souma finally getting a chance of entering the top 10!")
>> ARTICLE
Nah. He doesn't have anything to put up in a Shokugeki against them, so he can't challenge them yet.
>> ARTICLE
Shout out to the anime for not doing the cliffhangers of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
isshiki is best girl
>> ARTICLE
They might speed up the curry arc. I hope they speed up the curry arc
>> ARTICLE
I think season 1 will end after the training arc(chapter 34) though(at pacing of 2 chapters per episode), and that they will reserve karaage arc & autumn election to season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah man im sad too Ryou is my favorite character after alice so its dissapointing. :(

That's a Bikini Line level twist.

TIL: Meat has a grain like wood.
>> ARTICLE
Grain is just a general term used for the right/wrong way to cut things. I work in a deli and cutting meat against the grain is definitely messier and more difficult. It comes out pretty shitty most of the time.

You can also shave against the grain which turns out cleaner, but you're also risking more cuts.
>> ARTICLE
Meat consists of long protein strands. When you cut alongside the grain of them, it leaves the strands mostly intact, which means they're tougher and harder to chew through. Cut against the grain instead, and they become much shorter, leading to a nice tender cut.

Hot damn, well played.  

[](#suave)

[Poor Yukihira :(](http://puu.sh/hOud2/856a76414e.png)

Anyway, another very good episode, even though it lacked a bit of action.

All that meat was just [mouth-watering](http://puu.sh/hOv5M/ccd3c806f6.png) (`)

**I have to say that watching this show while being a poor college student, may not be a very wise decision ()**

^^/s
>> ARTICLE
> poor college student

Wasn't Chaliapin Steak easy and cheap to prepare?
>> ARTICLE
Yup, I've made it for myself, and it's not that expensive. Obviously, the cost of meat will be the main factor, but you don't need that expensive of a cut.

Also, onions are only one way to tenderize tough meat. Honey works too, as the show has covered, and there are tons of marinades and whatnot that you can look up online. Marinate a steak, even a cheap one, and it should come out fine.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't even eaten today so its much worse when combined with the broke college student as well
>> ARTICLE
I'm really sorry dude :| 

We can be *white rice and nothing else* bros probably!
>> ARTICLE
That feel when you look into your kitchen and there's nothing there except a 30kg sack full of rice.
>> ARTICLE
Mushrooms cooked in butter go good on top of rice.  If you have canned fish then it can go on as well. 

Never watch this show hungry and with an empty fridge (also don't go shopping right after watching this show... bad for budget). 
>> ARTICLE
> I have to say that watching this show while being a poor college student, may not be a wise decision ()

Dude did you not see that Souma only used cheap ingredients? If anything, it's the best thing you can do. [Have a look at this, easy as shit.](http://puu.sh/hOw4f/58c443e7cf.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I guess they only have a few of these recipe images and not for every single dish, huh?
>> ARTICLE
Chibi Nikumi is so KAWAII! 
>> ARTICLE
My favourite part about most of the stuff in the first half (quarter...?) is that most of the shit Souma makes involves cheap stuff and doesn't look all that hard to make
>> ARTICLE
I have never cooked with red wine before. That is really the only part that steers me away from the dish. (Plus, I don't know what kind of red wine to get...)
>> ARTICLE
Get a cheap red wine man, you don't need the expensive stuff if all you plan to do with it is make pan sauces.
>> ARTICLE
Eh it only says to add the red wine to the sauce of the previous part. You don't need to flambe it or anything.
>> ARTICLE
Now just the issue of what red wine...

^^^^^^This ^^^^^^is ^^^^^^why ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^don't ^^^^^^cook, ^^^^^^one ^^^^^^thing ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^am ^^^^^^not ^^^^^^good ^^^^^^at.
>> ARTICLE
When you cook/heat alcoholic drinks, the alcohol burns off. This is why people don't have to be carded when buying beer battered onion rings or other things that have used alcohol to add flavor.
>> ARTICLE
The use of red wine is to deglaze the pan. 

There are alternatives to red wine, like wine vinegar, lemon juice, beef/chicken/vegetable/etc stock, broth, even water. It will taste differently though.
>> ARTICLE
Since you would be adding it to a beef dish, a cabernet sauvignon would be a good idea. It pairs well with beef. Really most red wines would work though. Since the wine is being reduced into a sauce you are getting the flavor from it more than anything. 
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, thanks for your input.
>> ARTICLE
Supermarket bought red wine. Gotta keep the Souma cooking style.

I dont have drinking age yet and i dont think the cashier will let me buy "because its for cooking"

Red wine for cooking is a thing.
>> ARTICLE
I kow that, you know that, the cashier knows, the law dont care.
>> ARTICLE
Cooking wine is the exception to the law.  It's salted, so you really can't drink it straight.  99% sure I bought a bottle before I turned 21.  It's actually sold in the oil and vinegar section of the supermarket.
>> ARTICLE
I chuckled at Urara calling Nikumi a Holstein bitch. Holstein (Holstein Friesian) is a breed of cow which is mainly raised to produce milk, but it's also used for meat in some countries.

This show is definitely one of the most enjoyable of the season. I really like Souma's humble yet confident attitude. I wonder if it'll be long until he's utterly defeated and he has to pick himself up again; it'll be interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Im not sure if this has been posted before but here is a picture  of how Soma looks at the beginning compared to after 115 [chapters or so](http://i.imgur.com/nJn0GS2.jpg)

Nikumi is clearly the best girl!

She cooks the menliest of dishes, meat!

She is a badass, not some wimp!

Also she is kinda hot.
>> ARTICLE
I hear she can really handle *meat* with her fingers and lips quite well too.
>> ARTICLE
Awww, Crunchyroll Subs didn't have the iconic line "It wasn't much" :(
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll translates Soma's catchphrase as "glad you enjoyed it."
>> ARTICLE
Not a bad move either since the translation that I have been seeing in the manga is a bit off putting to me
>> ARTICLE
It's a difference in culture.  In the West, you're taught to be proud of your accomplishments and take pride in your work, whereas in the East you're taught to be humble and reserved.  Soma says "It wasn't much" to downplay his work and be humble, but to a Western person it kinda sounds like him saying "I wasn't even trying" or that the competition was beneath him.
>> ARTICLE
Aha! Thanks for setting me straight! This perspective helps me not see the MC as a douchebag when he says this line. However, it wasn't a bad idea for CR to do this either way, knowing the way I initially perceived it.
>> ARTICLE
That's one of the tricky things about translating.  Do you translate what is said or what is meant?
>> ARTICLE
Almost always what it meant (although still keeping it as something the characters would say, we aren't Commie). However, TL notes should be provided if there was some major meaning lost during translation.

There's a part after the credits, if you're to impatient and missed it

FUCK! This show.

Call me a fanboy, but this show caught me SO offguard.

My friends told me I HAD to watch it and I trusted their judgment, but GODDAMN, I didn't expect this.

I marathoned through the first 6 episodes two days ago and I was SAD when I caught up. I honestly wish I had found out about this show at the end of the season so I could marathon through all of it.

It's taking everything for me to not to go ahead and power through the manga. I just don't want to spoil myself or I would've already done that.

Who knew a show about cooking could get me this hype?

I'm having the same feels with this show as I did when watching Beelzebub.

Epic shit. Footstomping humor. Well-timed and unexpected feels.

This show man.

THIS FUCKING SHOW. 
>> ARTICLE
The anime is following the manga really closely, so you can just read the first 13 chapters

so far the anime is doing a realy good job. i love it!

if you cant wait for  the next episodes i really suggest to read the manga. it's so good.

i actually think souma is one of the best shounen MC's ever. He is kind of overpowered but not as much that he stomps everything and everyone and still need to learn many things. 
And he is a fucking badass.
>> ARTICLE
opinion seconded.

I have yet to read a shounen manga as balanced as Shokugeki no soma. It might stick close to well established shounen tropes, however it executes them with total perfection.

Soma in personality, approach, skill and background feels like the perfect shounen mc to me. The manga is up to 117 episodes and I have yet to see a single slip up on the part of the managaka, where I could pinpoint any character inconsistency.

It's because the stakes are too high. If Soma loses, he and Megumi get expelled. This means they have to win, or the show is over.

Megumi is not in this. The bet was:

If Ikumi wins:

- Souma gets expelled
- Don RS shuts down

If Souma wins:

- Don RS will have its supposely allocated budget
- Ikumi has to join Don RS

Welp. Time for a time travel.

Id definitely suggest reading the manga. [](/s "Souma most definitely is *extremely* talented even within the best cooking school in the country, if not the world. But even with 13 years in a kitchen with a world class chef, his dad, to watch over and learn from, he is still just a student first and foremost. Th alumni of totsuki, probably most of the instructors, the elite 10 (well maybe not nakiri, she is an excellent chef, but her god tongue is guarenteed to be part of why she is 10th seat, and we barely see her cook anyways so it is hard to judge her cooking compared to Souma), are all stronger than him. And even though he his cooking is top fucking percentage, there are others at his level. And when he realizes it is the best moment in the series. Which then leads to him trying to improve himself and find his own personal style of cooking besides 'Yukihira menu item ___'. It is a really great imo.")

Yoko Littner Bra?  I dunno, just came to my mind?

Kawashima Urara?  Idol?  Kirara?!? ***MEATBUNS?!?!?!***

*Meanwhile in the meta-verse*

/r/anime: Hey, /u/Daishomaru, stop letting /r/Gundam leak into this thread!

Me: NEVER!  THE MEATBUN DREAM SHALL LIVE AS LONG AS A[/R/GUNDAM](/r/gundam) REDDITOR LIVES, OUR STORY WILL BE TOLD!  ***SIEG MEATBUNS!***

*Epic fight happens offscreen*

*Back to the show*

*Nikumi's Breasts with Yoko Bra*

And Now I want some Yoko-flavored meatbuns.  QUICK, SOMEBODY GET ON THAT!  YOKO FLAVORED MEATBUNS!

I know I said this 10000 times by now, but i'm really glad all that time spent wasting watching Iron Chef Japan is paying off to get the details.

*Must resist urge to fap to Nikumi, must resist urge to fap*

Used to play Piano here, can confirm. 

I love the judging moments, where they describe the food porn.  Makes me want to eat. 

Umm... Uhh... Well that got dramatic.  And somewhat depressing.

*Daily reminder that the guy who animates this series does porn*

***ANOTHER MEATBUN HAS BEEN FORMED?!!??***

#***MEATBUN SUNK IN 3 MINUTES?!!?!?!??!?!?!!***

#***ANOTHER ANOTHER MEATBUN HAS BEEN FORMED?!?!?!?!***

I hope we see Nikumi again.  I really like her, and I hope the Nikumi Nikuman dream lives on.

I'll be the bun if she will be the meat.

>> ARTICLE
I really want to see Soma knocking Erina out of her high Horse.
>> ARTICLE
Dammit, I watched this after dinner and I still got hungry while watching it. :(
Anyway, it was good to see Souma beat the meat this episode (   ), and it turns out Nikumi has a repressed cute side. Brilliant.  
Side note, it took me way too long to realise that Mito is basically the Japanese way of saying meat. I'm not sure if that's intentional, but it's still cool.

Funny how Souma made her join the club when he didn't. 

I really want someone to smack that Erina, but I guess there will be time for that later.

Well I already had a feeling Soma would win but still great episode. Nikumi has joined your party.

Never expected to love this show so much. I think it reaches JoJo levels of mad, insane hype.

The part when he said he got the meat on sale, made me laugh so much.

Also Megumi is best girl so far, her last comment on Nikumi is hilarious

Haha you know, when I read this in the manga, I couldn't help but wonder what she did with the rest of the cow. 

Great episode, still waiting for real best girl Alice though.

Megumi is so adorable! Soma still just doesn't get fazed by anything, he's amazing, haha. Soma pulling out the meat cracks me up, you can't help but root for him.

Urara makes me laugh for only being present for such a short time.
I love how Ikumi shapes up in later episodes, everyone in this show is bursting with character. Ikumi's dad is still a prat, especially as the mother is obviously lovely.

Despite being several manga ahead of where the show is at, I still get excited to see what's going to happen next. The cooking battles get me pumped, J.C.Staff have done great in bringing the manga to life. So, so good.
>> ARTICLE
Coming home after a night out drinking and watching this now is testing my will to not go cook some food at 3am...
>> ARTICLE
The opening scene is from Volume 2, page 134 omake "Day of the shokugeki Nikumi-san in the morning", just before chapter 12.

This episode covered chapters 12 and 13. I like how Megumi slips back into her Tohoku dialect when she gets nervous/flustered.
Nikumi's blushing reaction is really cute too!

Part of 14(polar star farm) was covered in episode 6 or 7, so we'll start from the middle of chapter 14(the last part of volume 2) in episode 8.

Episode 8(covering part of 14, 15 & 16) is the start of the Training camp arc, where we'll finally see Takumi, Isami and the alumni! Yay!

Man, [Manga spoilers](/s "When is the camp arc? I really want to watch that, the op suggests that they will animate it, will they? Will they?")

It should start very soon. It will be animated if we are getting over 20 episodes. Also opening has a bit of it 
>> ARTICLE
Man, I usually wait till the end of stuff and then marathon it (exception of unlimited blade works) but lurking on this thread every week and seeing how much everyone enjoys it, I'm so tempted to catch up.
>> ARTICLE
Based on the preview at the end of the episode, I think the pace will pick up a bit from the two chapters per episode that we have been getting so far. It looked to me like the next episode makes it all the way through the first dish during the training camp arc. IIRC, there's more than just two chapters between the end of the Don arc and the end of the first dish in this arc. If I'm right about this, we could be getting to the end of the Training Camp arc by episode 12.

Or it could be that I'm delirious from finals, and am forgetting some important details. If someone could check my theory for me, that would be great.

After making the baked bacon potato thing, I really want to try making this dish.

Souma's first official Shokugeki complete! If you didn't notice at the end there, Nikumi br crushin on our main MC!

Not much to be said about this episode except everyone is prolly hungry and vegetarians are questioning their life decisions. All I can say is if you thought this episode was exciting, the story is gonna keep getting better and continually find ways to provide cool new interesting challenges as well as rivals for Souma and friends.

I desperately wanna try Soma's Don but beef is so expensive where I am at like $4-5/lb even for "cheap" cuts like what Soma bought and no way they'll be 50% off.

A pound of beef is a lot, you know. A half-pound burger is huge and likely $7 or more, and uses things that probably wouldn't even count as cuts.

So now the question is where is Stalker-san in the audience, since we know she'd have to show up since Erina did.

I really enjoy the plot, the food and even the characters in this but the ecchi is just killing me at times, at least it's not haremy also lol
>> ARTICLE
The manga is written and drawn by a veteran hentai artist and published in Shounen Jump. The over the top nature of the series is what makes the ecchi funny instead of plain stupid (though it's a stupid kind of funny), which I really appreciate.
>> ARTICLE
Guess I'm just not the type of person who finds ecchi funny :/

EDIT: Due to popular request this is an [album](https://imgur.com/a/DSPFQ) with recipes up to vol. 6 of the manga. BE WARNED FOR ANIME ONLY VIEWERS THE RECIPES NEAR THE END ARE KINDA SPOILERS FOR WHAT IS COMING UP

>> ARTICLE
I tried Soma's dish, just the egg part though. We didn't have red wine for the sauce.

Prep part was easy. Whip until the mix is airy. Added a bit of cream like he did in the anime, although it wasn't in the recipe. Then salt and pepper for taste.

I failed on the cooking part though. I cooked on high. I didnt notice it said to cook on medium. (hehe) So naturally the other side was burnt.

So the salvaged parts, I ate.  It was bouncy and springy but not as much as the anime depicted (I guess it was exaggeration or i failed hehe). When I took a bite. IT WAS REALLY FLUFFY! It was so different from the ordinary omelette that was flat. So there...

And the instead of a van it's a kitchen.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... okay... it was quite obvious how this would end, but I really love how they display Somas strength. First the super-student better than the average, than just one of a few, after that we saw him defeated by a pro and now it's the time where his knowledge hit a wall and other students are way better... Finally Soma has some flaws because of his missing experience...

Great way to etablish a strong character without displaying him as overpowered :)
>> ARTICLE
That's why this is probably my favorite shounen manga series. Souma does make horrible mistakes sometimes, and he is not invincible. His pride is his biggest flaw.

And when driven in a corner, he tries to approach the problem from different angles than his competitors.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand what you mean when you say his pride is his biggest flaw. I'd like to cite the Manga but idk how to do spoiler tags. But it's stated that his pride is a non issue and the fact he is so humble is his greatest strength. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a weakness in the sense that he'll generally assume he can do something before actually considering it.

It's pretty common for him to accept a challenge and then people ask him what his plan is and he just shrugs. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's just his good yet bad trait. Where he, unlike most people, doesn't recognize barriers as in "I can't do this". It's why he challenged his dad so many times to cooking contests, but lost each time.
>> ARTICLE
You're right. If anyone has pride as a weakness, it's Erina. I know she's not a truly horrible person, but for me education and getting into the right school hits really close to home, and I've never been able to get over how she nearly ruined Souma's chances of getting in simply out of pride. I really want her to get knocked off her high horse. 
>> ARTICLE
I think a lot of people take his direct and somewhat oblivious personality to be dickish or boastful. It's why a lot of people got turned off of his character during his opening speech.
>> ARTICLE
I'd take the typical "MC surrounded by girls" scenario with an MC who displays self-esteem and confidence over the MC who stutters and looks away at the drop of the hat, any day.

I'm looking at you, Bell.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair that before Soma really got to experience the school. You have to remember he came from a background where he spent all day and night after school helping out at a restaurant. For him, he just saw these "non-chefs" running around playing pretend cooking. I doubt he would have the same speech to that level of cockiness (Not sure if it's the right word), if he found out he literally joined a shounen series tournament school.
>> ARTICLE
Going forward is a LOT of learning. He definitely begins to understand that he doesn't know everything about cooking

I actually never ended up watching the PV for Prison School because I already knew I would watch it, but compared to the manga that looks underwhelming. The audio and animation will have to heavily carry the lack of dramatic atmosphere that the art style in the manga along with the shading provided.

This leads me to my favorite piece of Alice and souma, it's a coloring of the original Manga panels, but the artist nails the intensity of it imo.

Alice is half Danish, which makes her best girl.  

Really hope she makes use of the great danish "cuisine", perhaps our national dish, ['Stegt flsk med persillesovs'](http://www.dk-kogebogen.dk/billeder-opskrifter/billeder/5151/4_300.jpg) at some point, or maybe ['Brndene krlighed'](http://www.udeoghjemme.dk/sites/udeoghjemme.dk/files/media/websites/udeoghjemme-dot-dk/website2/2012/opskrifter/hovedret/12/49-braendende-kaerlighed-612.jpg)(heavy sarcasm implied.)

The alternate version is more popular these days...



My body is made of meals

My blood is steel, and heart is (gas) fire

Undefeated across many Shokugeki

Not once being defeated

Nor once enjoying victory

The chef stands here alone

cooking ingredients on the hill of restaurants.

Then my school life needed no meaning,

And my body was made of unlimited meals.

This thing/ poem is like describing the current version of Shinomiya
>> ARTICLE
That goes more like this...

-

My body is made of legumes

My blood is cauliflower, and heart is Artichoke

Undefeated across many national competitions

Not once being defeated

Only once achieving victory

The chef stands here alone

Cooking masterpieces at the pinnacle of France

Then my career needed no meaning,

And my body was made of unlimited meals.
>> ARTICLE
I am the bone of my dish

Food is my body and cooking is my blood

I have created over a thousand recipies

Unknown to eating out, Nor known to instant raman

Have withstood pain to create many dishes

Yet, this plate will never have leftovers

So as I pray, Unlimited Food Works

>> ARTICLE
No need to be surprised...

These meals are all cheap tricks. Things you call plebian food. But you know! There's no rule that states that cheap tricks can't beat elaborate masterpieces. If you say that your food is the pinnacle of tradition and research, then I'll surpass everything you make and take you down.

Here I come, God Tongue.

Do you have enough recipes?

Fortunately, I do not have any pride. But what about it? Will the name of the chef be disgraced?

Hah, dont make me laugh, Nakiri. You can wash away status with results. You can feed your meaningless pride to the dogs.

I'd change menus to recipes but I like the adaption.

When I "heard" Alice was from Denmark my thoughts went straight to NOMA(DO NOT JUST GOOGLE NOMA, Google NOMA Denmark or Noma Restaurant), and it's the same ideas behind cooking. I guess she was kinda based on that style of cooking, turning ingredients around to something they weren't normally used for, I recall one time they served ants and yoghurt at NOMA and it was supposedly rather delicious.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it's more along the lines of [Mugaritz](http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners/Mugaritz). Noma doesn't really do molecular gastronomy as much as a number of the top 50 (e.g., [Dinner by Heston Blumenthal](http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners/Dinner-by-Heston-Blumenthal)). Noma uses local ingredients but sticks with more traditional cooking styles (from what I recall of the film Three Stars). But, both Mugaritz and Dinner by Heston Blumenthal use a lot of molecular gastronomy techniques to give you something unexpected like Alice.
>> ARTICLE
So...why shouldn't I google Noma? I got the same results searching for that and "Noma Denmark". Is it the name of a Danish porn star or something?

Edit: Nevermind, went to images. Gory shit for others looking. Rull fucked up.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... It ain't SFW.
>> ARTICLE
You tried to warn me, the only one I have to blame is myself haha. Luckily I got desensitized to that sort of thing by my asshole friends in high school.
>> ARTICLE
I love Alice's character. She deliberately made her dish look so ridiculous to troll everyone. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say she wanted to troll everyone.

That's just how she cooks: with extremely precision and via Gastronomic science
>> ARTICLE
This entire battle reminded me of the quickfire challenge on season 5 of Top Chef, for Wylie Dufrense, who is a genius in molecular gastronomy. This man [knows his eggs](http://www.eater.com/2014/10/29/7087147/let-wylie-dufresne-teach-you-how-to-make-perfect-poached-eggs).

So I guess he's an apprentice of both Nakiri cousins...

Well, if you read the manga, you'd know Alice is pretty trolly. Especially in the latest chapters.

She IS best girl.

This is why Soma is best MC.

I'd like to think that this episode is alternatively titled [The Food ](http://puu.sh/iMivp/bf96f49987.jpg)[God Only Knows](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1pxsdl56uvs/UHg4I-V4JGI/AAAAAAAAADk/FPQzhMUYZho/s1600/God_of_Conquest_Mode.png)

I love Soumas character design, a [single frame](http://i.imgur.com/zfdXfBp.png) does wonders to show how badass he can be.
>> ARTICLE
And that's not even his most badass frame to date...
>> ARTICLE
Remember in the beginning when it seemed like Soma could steamroll his way to the top? He's already hitting so many walls in his first year. And he'll have to figure out how to climb each one of them. It's only gonna get harder from here on out.

It looks like they'll be skipping a small arc where Soma returns home. Shame. (OVAs please?) If you want to read it, the chapters are 35-38. Features more character development for Nikumi.

For those curious as to what the Autumn Elections entails. Two words for your hype. [](/s "Shokugeki Tournament")
>> ARTICLE
That explains why I didn't know wtf was going on in that preview. I've been trying to not read farther ahead than the anime, and I finished volume 5 last week, and I was really hoping for the trip home.
>> ARTICLE
They could still include the chapters of soma returning home can they not and end this season at the end of the election arc
>> ARTICLE
Here's my predicted pacing (note that we will probably be skipping the [](/s "Karaage Arc")

https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3bh7v4/spoilers_shokugeki_no_souma_pacing_for_the/
>> ARTICLE
[Manga](/s "Technically only the Mimasaka vs. Takumi and the Mimasaka vs. Soma were shokugekis. The others were just normal competitions.")
>> ARTICLE
While true, it's still gonna be HYPE AS FUCK. [Manga](/s "Everything from Megumi getting an 88 to everyone in the building realizing Souma is OP. It will be GLORIOUS.")
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait for [Manga](/s "Megumi's hanging monkfish cutting and her battle against Ryou!")
>> ARTICLE
Watching this in my living room, I was glad the loli didn't have a  foodgasm, because someone would have definitely walked by and misunderstood the entire situation. 

And Soma is best MC, because he realizes his faults and knows he has to do his best to overcome them. Can't really say that about alot of MC's. 

Also, Alice is Best Girl. 
>> ARTICLE
[This image](http://imgur.com/3cOEj3X.jpg) was the first thing my wife saw of this anime, completely out of context.  Luckily, she's as pervy as I am.
>> ARTICLE
So this anime is so enjoyable it's treading masterpiece status in MAL. (IMHO)

The moment he beat the clock with 1 second left, my body jumped from my chair unconsciously. and when Dojima and the chefs watching said he had a quality that will really help him, the "adaptability", I said FUCK YEAH! ... Soma then gives a smug face as victory had me dying of laughter.

This anime's tension, excitement, hilarity, well written unique characters, and best smug MC ... all make it one of the best 2015 anime for sure, and to be about food and a cooking theme just shows how well written and executed this show is.
>> ARTICLE
Will say that this show has really surprised me since that first episode. Really happy I stuck with it, that ending when they announce the end of camp with the ED blend was so simple but I loved it :)
>> ARTICLE
Same.  I just love all the miniature details that while they do explain, accurately shows the unseen side in the actual cooking world, such as how racist the French Chef community is in Paris or shows details only somebody who knows a bit about the cooking world like me, who watches cooking documentaries on my free time, would notice.
>> ARTICLE
Finally, Soma's inexperience sets him back but survives by playing up his showmanship. 

I think this adaptation is finally going to skip some chapters because the next episode is called The Man called the Demon which is Chapter 41 in the manga and this episode just wrapped up Chapter 33. I don't think we'll be seeing the Fantastic Fried Chicken arc or the proper introduction of the 9th seat.
>> ARTICLE
JC Staff has no choice at this point. My guess is that the anime will stop at the very end of the Autumn Elections arc and if they stay faitful to the manga, it wont make it in 24 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I hope not, that is 60 chapters
>> ARTICLE
Heard huge hype about the autumn election arc. I'm excited.
>> ARTICLE
I just can't wait to see Megumi [Autumn Elections Spoiler](/s "Butcher an monkfish.  for those of you who say why the monkfish, it's because monkfish is one of the hardest fishes to prepare, and most traditional Japanese Chefs usually only teach their students how to cut and prepare monkfish after at least a very long time (Read: several years) because of how much a delicacy monkfish is. (Read: 150 dollars, 100 dollars of the monkfish's worth is in the LIVER alone")
>> ARTICLE
What chapter is that? I wanna read into that.

lol in the manga he used 8, but in the anime he used 16
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think the manga dealt with this episode better. They didn't even show how much better he was getting at making the dish like they did in the manga. 

Example: The timer he was using, in the manga he kept going back to reset it and he was getting faster and faster at inputting the time. In the anime, they skim over it.
>> ARTICLE
The screentone used [here](https://i.imgur.com/t3CnBrh.png) on Souma, really gives away the fact that the mangaka use to draw hentai.
>> ARTICLE
I don't get it... what am I missing?
>> ARTICLE
Why is that?
>> ARTICLE
Besides the fact that he draws female characters extremely well.

He should teach Oda how to draw females
>> ARTICLE
You know i dont get why Oda sometimes gets bashed for how he draws women. Putting aside the fact that pretty much all shounen manga provide a decent amount of fanservice, the females arent the only characters he draws with bodies that are anatomically incorrect. Pretty much every character in the One Piece universe has weird body proportions; i mean fat guys have abs, everyone skips leg day, and there is a race of people with 2 elbows on each arm....
>> ARTICLE
[Zoro definitely doesn't skips leg day.](http://s13.postimg.org/jp0fchbhj/zoro_weights.png)
>> ARTICLE
Considering his arm position and straight legs that looks to be an upper body workout.
>> ARTICLE
Alice's dish was pretty creative for something that initially looked very plain and boring

Of course Souma would overcome his issues


God I love how quickly Alice goes from "mature seductive woman" to "pouting child"

YES! we're getting to the good stuff next week with the autumn election arc. I'm guessing the arc that comes before it will be an ova or not at all? Sucks since it introduces a somewhat important character.

We're really only skipping 5 chapters worth of the manga it looks like. I wouldn't even call that an arc, more like a side story. Would make for a good 2 episode OVA.

This episode covered page 7-19 from chapter 31, chapter 32 and chapter 33. And with this the Training Camp is over. ~~Next up is my least favorite arc the [Upcoming arc](/s "Karaage arc"), I enjoyed it, just not as much as the other arcs.~~ Nevermind that it looks like they will skip that arc ( Chapter 35-38 if you want to read it ) and go straight to the Autumn Election. And that, my friends, is damn fucking awesome.

I think that Soumas cooking in the manga looked better than the one in this episode. I'm not sure why though.

If you wanna watch cooking shows that pump you up, I recommend Iron Chef Japan.  I'm glad that so many people I know who watched this show also watched Iron Chef Japan after I used the joke that "Iron Chef made me Genre-Savvy in this show" because of it or admitted that they also watched Iron Chef Japan before watching this show.  All the episodes are on youtube and everything!

Seriously, though, Iron Chef Japan made me appreciate Shokugeki No Soma a lot more.

I miss the old reruns of Iron Chef. "KAKUI-SAN!!" "Yes, go ahead."

Isn't this season set for 24 episodes? How they will do a 60 chapter arc in 10 episodes is beyond me.

Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches just finished doing a 90-chapter arc in 12 episodes. It was a mess, but it's possible.
>> ARTICLE
Man... This show is literally too good. I want for it to have a One Piece amount of episodes for me to abandon all worldly pursuits and watch nonstop until I finish, engorged and dead from bliss, much like Soma and the others are about to be after their banquet. 
>> ARTICLE
God dammit. This is a cooking show. A show where people prepare and serve meals to other people. Why is it so awesome?  
In all seriousness, I'm glad they actually managed to turn Souma's victory (which to be honest, was completely obvious, and in any other show would have been called plot armour) into a chance for character development. He's finally being challenged by Totsuki, and he's taking the chance to learn from his mistakes. Well done, Food Wars.  
Also Alice seems pretty cool. I'm looking forward to seeing more of her.
>> ARTICLE
I still can't believe I am this hyped about food. I really like how souma is not actually OP, people are better than him, he makes mistakes and loses. His skills are still impressive and the way he can think on his feet. The soundtrack is glorious and adds to the exciting tone of the show.
>> ARTICLE
*Meta-Universe, aka Real Life*

I can't believe I read the manga all the way up to... I give up...

*Daishomaru's imouto appears*

Imouto: You read all the manga chapters did you?

Me:  Yes, I can write so much commentary on the show.  All the details!  All the details that I can talk about due to watching cooking shows in my spare time!

*/u/Daishomaru faints due to reading so much chapters in 8 hours*

Imouto: I'm glad I recommended the show to you!

*Now on to the episode*

Soma's omelette is basically why very few chefs serve buffet styles nowadays (Which is to say, almost no chef nowadays) . It's impractical, inefficient, and the food gets ruined easily.

Erina may be a dick, but she has a point.  
  
Cooking in front of people is always entertaining and the appeal of cooking in front of people is one of my favorite cooking styles, but it requires a lot of practice and a lack of stage fright.  Soma doing so is practically the only way of serving omelets in an actual buffet because eggs after a while tend to catch moisture from the air and ruin the flavor of eggs.

I know that there's an actual world record for serving omelettes in 30 minutes, but I know Soma didn't even come close.

Alice's Molecular Gastronomy is sadly one of the few cooking styles I do not understand. As far as I get about Molecular gastronomy is that it's essentially "food science", exploring the scientific world of food, the why of food, the manipulation of your senses such as eyes, smell, and the mouth, and I do know that in real life the professional chefs either really love molecular gastronomy "for exploring the world of cooking" or really hate "for not being an cooking style" and people who are against it include famous chefs such as Gordon Ramsey. 

If anyone wants to tell me about molecular gastronomy, please do!  I'm interested in it!

Gin Dojima and the chefs cooking for the students, I admit that I didn't expect that, mostly because of how hellish the school is.

RIP Marui, you tried your best.

Oh but how would MC steamrolling through everyone be a good show!!

On a serious note I did think it was funny how he could've easily gotten it done last episode but they had him go into existential crisis mode and realize he isn't all that. Kinda makes him seem more human though that he didn't get his great idea until he saw everything falling apart around him.

Fk it... guys I read the entire manga and let me say you one thing.. this will become the best anime for sure.. This show will get only extremly better!
>> ARTICLE
That sweat was making me sweat. Damn good episode. 
>> ARTICLE
After this episode I really feel like I'm so invested in this anime. I love the characters, at the end I felt so relieved when they weren't required to perform any more tasks and finally passed. I rarely feel this way when I watch anime, another one that's currently airing that I am pretty connected with is Ore Monogatari. This anime is just unbelievable.
>> ARTICLE
At this point in the manga was when I realized I was going to extremely enjoy this show. Beginning he was featured as hardworking but still OP but after this moment you see the scales and distance he needs to cover up. It is shown so rarely in such a way that we actually see every little detail he went through to improve and shows off what he already knows. This is one of the few manga that I am continuously reading that I just love and over hype to my friends. This moment is the main reason behind it. And I hope the manga stays strong! 
>> ARTICLE
Episode 15 "The man Called The Demon".

Can't wait to see next weeks episode now that Soma's father is involved. He's going to fuck shit up! Finally that bitch might actually start respecting Soma now given her hate is completely unfounded!
>> ARTICLE
I was really hyped for Fuwa Fuwa eggs and did the anime have more burners than the manga but still that totally looked awesome. Can't wait for next week when Asura comes in the kitchen casually asking Soma to help him out.

>> ARTICLE
I'm so glad they're still using the same ED :D
>> ARTICLE
God the music for this show is so amazingly on point.  Anyone know if the OST or anything is out yet?  Or at least the track that played right after the flashback(when Soma starts running through what he's gonna need to do, how long it'll take, etc., about 7 minutes in)?  Because I really need to find it.

Also [Spoiler maybe I guess for later in manga](/s "Very, very, very excited to see Mad Dog Kurokiba show up...whenever we get there.")
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't help but think "IT'S A TRAP" at the end.
>> ARTICLE
This show is still a huge joy to watch!

And Souma has really grown on me as a character. He hasn't hit that Gary-Stu level some writers make their main characters; he's just a fun shonen protagonist that fights with his cooking, not his fists!

This show has officially become the top anime I look forward to each week. I hope there's plenty more to come!
>> ARTICLE
This episode made me crave eggs. 
>> ARTICLE
**Thoughts while watching the show...**

Papa Yukihira to the rescue!!

I'm starting to dislike Erina more and more.

It was really sweet when Souma won over the little girl's heart.

200 SERVINGS!!!!!!!!!! ON TIME!!!!!

Takumi/Souma or Megumi/Souma?

>> ARTICLE
I'm glad I found this anime, it had been a while since I've watched something that's just fun.
>> ARTICLE
the ED song was a bit different this episode right...

also I'm trying really hard to like Erina but she is just a bad character and bad person, noting redeeming about her not one single thing... 
>> ARTICLE
skipping karaage arc really but that arc is imporant for conflict with aizen...
well i hope they at least include megumi vs isshiki-senpai...
>> ARTICLE
So... it took over a hour to realize no one was eating his dishes? And the little girl did not get the nude treatment of her enjoyment of the dish!?
>> ARTICLE
In the name of all that is tasty... this show gets better and better... I can barely believe it.

I still hate Erina with all my being though. I mean, look at Alice... she's also a high and mighty contender for "the best cook" but at least she has some personality other than "I am a stuck up bitch"

Though I called a bit of BS on her being able to cook ~400 servings of her intriquate recipe. But it's not like SnS is all about credibility, so I'll let it go. 

Souma's dad shows up next week. Hyped as always for more Souma!
>> ARTICLE
It seems that the anime would skip the Karaage arc which is a shame because I'd like to see it animated and it's somewhat connected to the Autumn Elections arc.
>> ARTICLE
storm's a brewin'
>> ARTICLE
Alice is best girl 
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so the task was to make a buffet meal.

His solution? Live cooking.

What? Did they forget halfway through how a buffet works?
>> ARTICLE
That's the point. 

Souma totally missed the point of the challenge and had to make-up for it somehow with live cooking to attract tasters and at the same time, the tasters will eat his food before it deflates after a few minutes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but surely he shouldn't have passed because he didn't actually make something suitable for the task?
>> ARTICLE
There are live cooking corners in the buffets that I've tried out so Souma's dish will just fall on that category. 

But yeah... I do get your point somehow. The requirements are to serve 200 dishes and a dish worthy to be serve in Tootsuki's buffet table.
>> ARTICLE
Is the show on break now?  There wasn't an episode released last Friday.
>> ARTICLE
Was Erina's stalker in this episode?
>> ARTICLE
I'm lovin' Alice already
>> ARTICLE
So no [](/s "Karaage") arc? I'm a bit dissapointed.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope they don't skip it. There's more development between characters as well as a [major plot point](/s "The introduction of the 9th seat, Etsuya Eizan, and how Soma manages to piss him off. ")
>> ARTICLE
I would rather straight up watch the Autumn Election, considering there are only 11 episodes left, but nothing is impossible.
>> ARTICLE
Is less than 11 episodes enough for the Autumn Election? I really hope they don't rush it too much. So far the pacing was spot on.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope they don't finish the election arc this season because that would mean a lot was cut.. It's like 60 chapters or so. 
>> ARTICLE
The ED makes me so happy - with them all at the table, reminds of a few other J C Staff shows, Sakurasou has a similar sequence in one of their OPs I think. It's super cute seeing all of the characters together to a nice song.
>> ARTICLE
It's full out DaVinci with Souma Jesus analogy.
>> ARTICLE
Souma was probably like gg easy
>> ARTICLE
[Called it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/32yg40/spoilers_shokugeki_no_souma_episode_3_discussion/cqftw50) It might be a little early to solidify best girl status but Alice is jumping straight to the top of the leaderboard.

Im so hyped for the Autumn elections, also next Episode Soma's dad returns :D
>> ARTICLE
Great episode as always. Never said this before, but Alice is best girl. 
>> ARTICLE
There are better written shows and there are better looking shows but no show gets me as hype as this one.


>> ARTICLE
I may be in the minority here, but I can't wait for Soma to put that Alice bitch in her place. While yes she is one of the prettier girls on the show (Megumi still slaughters her there though,) her attitude is something that I can't to see ground into the dirt. The episode where Soma wins a Shokugeki against her and kicks her out will be so satisfying to watch. 

[For the haters of this post](http://s522.photobucket.com/user/mullens4_anti/media/anime/comeatmebro.gif.html)
>> ARTICLE
Damn, with the pace we're going, this definitely looks like we're gonna at least finish with the announcement for the Autumn Elections, or somewhere around the start of it.

Meaning unless JC will either somewhat make an original arc for SnS __or__ they'll somehow expand a few chapters before the Autumn Election, my [prediction for when best scene](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/39mdbo/spoilers_shokugeki_no_souma_episode_11_discussion/cs4l3v5?context=3) will appear might be waaaaay waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay off

Hey so about that glasses guy being tired joke can we stop please... or at least expand on the joke somehow because the same joke doesn't really work after seeing it 80 times imo
>> ARTICLE
It's just a gag this arc you'll get to see him in action next arc though
>> ARTICLE
Just with his presence alone, Soma's dad managed to boost his son's attractiveness with all the Polar Star girls. That's the mark of a great chef
>> ARTICLE
My favourite part of the episode. Had Joichiro been any younger he'd had NTR'ed Souma's harem away! :D


>> ARTICLE
so dad... there's this party, wanna come along?
>> ARTICLE
The moment when it's not awkward to have your dad around your girls.
>> ARTICLE
No wonder he travels so much, can you imagine constantly creating harems where ever you go just by being there?
>> ARTICLE
If Shokugeki was an NTR hentai, Soma's dad would have had women instantly been crawling on him as soon as he tried his food.
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding? They'd be too worn out with all the foodgasms.

Just the way he likes them.

No self-respecting chef would enjoy an over cooked wet noodle.

>> ARTICLE
you serious? That's Nisekoi levels of plot development.


>> ARTICLE
Well the plot isnt really focused around them getting to know each other well. Thats just a side plot. [Manga Spoilers] (/s "However, since the elections have completed, she has shown to be much more welcoming to Soma. Especially once he got her aide on his side")
>> ARTICLE
Well, to be fair, there really aren't any signs for her to figure out that Joichiro is related to Soma. 

1. She idolizes Joichiro, so she would never imagine that he would work at a simple special-of-the-day restaurant called 'Yukihira.'
2. Soma and Joichiro don't share too many obvious similarities unless they're compared side by side.
3. She already has a predisposed negative impression of Soma while, like I mentioned before, she idolizes Joichiro.
4. Joichiro changed his last name.
5. idk why I'm fleshing this out so much

Either way, while Nisekoi could be considered to have a lot of clues and obvious hints, there isn't really a logical path (atleast that I can think of) for her to realize that Joichiro and Soma are father-son.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that is expected, because it will change everything. 
>> ARTICLE
That or Erina could be all like "well clearly you didn't really get much of your father's cooking aptitude" and it would be still basically the status quo.

And then her world is crushed when she tries the dish made of chunks of unskinned snakes.

I was thinking the same thing. It *will* be glorious. Perhaps Erina will start treating Souma less rudely, or maybe she will bow down and apologize for her snobby attitude she's be showing to our MC in every encounter they have? It might be the beginning of a beautiful friendship between the two. They could start sticking close to each other like Alice and Ryou.
>> ARTICLE
*'I refuse to accept that you are his son! I refuse to accept it!'*

Just like when she refused to acknowledge his plebian egg dish even after it made her foodgasm. Denial comes easily to her.

This is actually mixed way better, the vocal isn't loud enough on the ED version.

Borderline? I think it's full cringe worthy.
>> ARTICLE
You just defined everything by Oomori Seiko.
>> ARTICLE
There is stuff after the ed though so you know
>> ARTICLE
I saw it.
>> ARTICLE
To me, the new ED is great. The singer's voice sounds so fragile and soft. It isn't as exhilarating as Spice, but instead a pleasant farewell that I find suitable for the end of a show like Shokugeki no Souma.
>> ARTICLE
but it's all dark.

the show is really bright and happy, the new ED and even the OP are all shitty and depressing. They put a damper on the show instead of keeping you on a high.
>> ARTICLE
I like all the nao (Erina' stalker) they slipped into the new ed though. The song itself is questionable.
>> ARTICLE
Man, that new ED is some Tokyo Ghoul Root A OP level of disappointment.
>> ARTICLE
The video that goes with the ED is a bit creepy with the stalker haha
>> ARTICLE
I was happy when it focused on Erina and Hisako, but it quickly became uncomfortable to watch when the stalker became more and more apparent. Makes em seriously worried about what that is foreshadowing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, they are both still good, but I liked the old OP/ED better, I really liked the guys voice in the OP and Spice was just fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
I think the old ED was so much better, it just felt right. The one doesn't feel like it fits to me.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the old one just felt so perfect, especially when the song started playing in the background while the episode was still going. Also that one moment where Erina and Soma were humming the ed just made the old ed feel so connected to the series.

Yeah me too, the new op is really good, but the ending..., the singer sounds like she's about to die, she has a really really weak voice. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea...

Yeah, there's a lot of hate for the new ED's singer. I personally liked it. Spice was definitely better, but I like the new one as well.
>> ARTICLE
That fura-fura and last supper scene is really hard to beat. As an ED MTV, visual, music and vocal compliments each other too well.

>> ARTICLE
Spice was seriously almost iconic, the way they blended the intro of the song into the ending scenes really added to the entire series. The series won't be the same without it.

Judging from the New OP, It looks like it will be covering the majority of the Autumn Election. That's a lot of material to cover, and I wonder how rushed the show is going to feel from here on out.
>> ARTICLE
There's someone missing from Op and ED. So I will assume that his/her foreshadowing will be the very end of this season.
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Subaru") is the only person left out I think. He kind of came out of nowhere in the manga, and he was kind of a mystery dark horse imo. So maybe that's why he was left out.
>> ARTICLE
Up to midpoint then S2? Hehe. I can hope.
>> ARTICLE
S2 would be great, but sadly there may not be enough source material to make it depending on when S2 would come out. I'm assuming this anime will cover through the whole Autumn Election or leave us with a "read the manga" ending...
>> ARTICLE
They would need to super rush it to cover all of it. If there was a S2 I could see them finishing the final stages + stagiaire + the current arc quite easily. But I'm not sure they'll go further than prelims. 

>> ARTICLE
It'll probably adapt the preliminaries but no further.
>> ARTICLE
Well, in the OP we see a bit of [Manga Spoiler](/s "Kurokiba, Hayama, and Soma put against each other"), so that's why I think its going to cover the finals. With the amount of episodes left however, it wouldn't be a surprise to end with the prelims.
>> ARTICLE
If we're going by the OP [there's ](/s "no sign of Subaru anywhere").

More importantly there no way they can adapt the full thing with the time they have remaining.  The tournament lasts longer than the rest of the manga leading up to it.  There's time to go back and do Karaage, then the preliminaries (along with the build up to it), but no more.
>> ARTICLE
There's also the [Spoiler](/s "Moonroof at the start of the OP.")

>> ARTICLE
Who the fuck is Soma's mom? I'm very curious now...

Interestingly his dad's real surname is Jouichiro Saiba but he calls himself Jouichiro Yukihira and that's the surname Souma inherited.

There's a possibility that it's his wife's family name and Jouichiro married into her family.
>> ARTICLE
Well, seeing that no one in Totsuki recognized the Yukihira name except by Dojima (barely), she probably weren't someone notable in the culinary world. Who knows, maybe they'll pull an Uzumaki here too.

I don't think Dojima so much as recognized the name, as noticed similarities between father and son.

[Manga Spoilers - Erina Nakiri](/s "In as much as Erina does not actively helps Soma like Megumi who was always beside him either directly helping him or cheering for him as he cooks, it was always Erina who always indirectly gives the most important clues that result to Soma's triumph or at the very least, put Souma in the right direction. In as much as I like Megumi, I came to realize that it was Erina's pieces of advice that Souma was able to figure out something. And even Souma seek Erina for some advice himself. Moreso, recent panels shows that Erina is getting a bit more curious of Souma especially with his recent match-up with the 8th Seat in the Tootsuki Festival. Erina's involuntary assists to Souma already started in the Training Camp Arc. Do you think Souma could have made it in the breakfast buffet challenge with his live cooking if Erina didn't draw a lot of crowd in the first place?")

That's literally the case for most non-SOL OPs. Nothing new going on here. It's not a spoiler unless you know about it in most cases. Take [HxH Spoiler](/s "the OP during there Ant Arc.

Anyone who's a fan, I HIGHLY recommend reading the manga for it, it starts on chapter 35.

Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really mind much. The karage wars were pretty short anyway. If it means they get to more of the bigger stuff then I think it's worth it.
>> ARTICLE
~~what do you mean?

the karaage arc comes directly after this episode (/the next episode), which was ch34 in teh manga.

Nothing indicating they're going to skip it yet?~~

oh crap, thought this was ch34~, not 40-41. this show just took a good 1 point loss, maybe 1.5.. they were doing a BETTER than 1:1 adaptation until now, and then they decide to skip quality/important chapters... 


ED: besides, it's a pretty important arc, it gets mentioned a few times in later arcs as being a huge help for him... especially in the current manga arc, direct experience...
>> ARTICLE
Since they cut that arc, they're gonna have to find some reason why [Spoilers!](/s "Top 10 #9 has an issue with Souma..." )
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea what you did but whatever you typed in that spoiler is unreadable. 

How to use spoilers is in the sidebar.

But yes I agree they will have to find a way to connect that one thing with the election. (if that's what that spoiler was about) 
>> ARTICLE
oh oops. thanks for that! (forgot quotes)
>> ARTICLE
There is always the chance that the Karage Arc may be coming in later. The show has sometimes put certain scenes ahead than they did in the manga, so I wouldn't rule it out completely. Maybe they thought it would interrupt the pace of this season with the autumn election arc coming up, so they might have moved it afterwards?
>> ARTICLE
[Manga chapter 35-40 spoiler/question](/s "Isn't there supposed to be a showdown with the 9th seat because of the Karage war? He said he will basically get back at Souma during the election so it doesn't make sense to have it afterwards unless they change the story a bit. ")
>> ARTICLE
What's the chapter range that they are skipping here?
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much chapters 35-40.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished it, wasn't that interesting for me. 

I wonder how they will introduce the [Character](/s "9th seat") without this arc though.

Chapter 40 was interesting but I'm sure everything there will be covered. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't help but feel like they're gonna ruin the next arc. I mean, the next arc consists of maybe around 40-50 chapters, and they're gonna try to squeeze it into 10? (This is without the Karaage Arc already)


.... Then again, they did do Justice up until now.... But at the same time it took 14 episodes to cover 40 chapters, while the next one's even longer.

Well, hopefully my prediction is way way waaaaaaaay wrong, and that they'll be able to pull this off
>> ARTICLE
It's been a really good adaptation so far, so I have some faith that they won't screw it up. Maybe they'll only animate up to the [](/s "top eight matches?")
>> ARTICLE
That would leave me with a severe case of blue balls
>> ARTICLE
Severe enough to get a second season?
>> ARTICLE
It's okay hopefully Attack on Titan S2 can come out next year, and once that's over the 2nd season of Shokugeki comes right after.

*one can dream*
>> ARTICLE
Let's hope they'll turn the Karage Arc into an OVA, that should work fairly well.
>> ARTICLE
OVA hype?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that would make a sick OVA. 
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty much perfect OVA material, so I'd suspect that.

I have a question for the manga readers. Does Erina ever become likeable or does she remain this way for the whole series?
>> ARTICLE
She's more likeable now in the manga then in the past imo.  Granted, she still isn't best girl, but she isn't just straight the most annoying anymore.
>> ARTICLE
If her character development continues the way it is right now in the manga, I think she'll eventually transition into a wayyyy better best girl than Megumi

Don't know if crush is the right word to use there.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah he is moreso her personal idol who she admires most out of any chef she has met (and with her uprising, it says a lot about how highly she thinks of him). However, she probably did interpret it as a crush just like every other kid does with their idols in anime.
>> ARTICLE
She has a long way to go. 
>> ARTICLE
She's much more enjoyable in the current arc in the manga [Current arc spoilers](/s "Called the Moon Festival Arc, when the total sales of the first day have been tallied, it turns out that Souma and Megumi, and the trio of Alice, Ryou and Akira, are dead last on their respective areas, being in the red and thus in danger of being expelled. Erina especially is upset at this and starts to show concern especially towards souma instead of flaunting how much better she is")

Gonna miss the old OP and ED. 

But after not having a new episode lasts week I'm so fucking hyped for everything.

And I love Erina and Soma whenever they have their interactions together.

Was I the only one waiting for that [Spoilers?](/s "Ping Pong match between Isshiki and Megumi")?
>> ARTICLE
ahh wow, i didn't realize they skipped to 40-41, that's ridiculous!

not only is the karaage arc referenced later, and pretty important.. the ping pong scene they skipped is the best in the whole manga, and good character development.

Loved the episode, lots of info. The new OP was fine, that singer for the ED is TERRIBLE though ;(

New Opening was so hype!

Soma's dad sounds like Ging Freecs from HxH. Their Father and Son bonding made me cri. 

I miss the old ending already, but the visuals on the new one are ok.

Cliffhanger was too good. I might take a peek on the manga cause I just have to know.

WHERE IS SPICE. I was so disappointed when I didn't hear the familiar dings of the ED... :( The episode was nice though.

This episode was so worth the wait, glad to know they finally revealed Joichiros relations with Erina. I cant wait for the autumn elections!
>> ARTICLE
You know they're gonna a shitload of characters when the OP helps you to list them with their names
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, i've missed this show. And a new opening! I like it!

Man, i really love Jouichirou's character! Everyone's reactions were priceless! I'm really looking forward to Nakiri's reaction when she finds out that he's Souma's dad! It seems like he was the one who taught her how to cook in the first place. 

Had this been anyone other than Nakiri, i would've guessed that she'd gain some respect for Souma, from learning who his father is, but i'm fairly sure that that's never gonna happen. Which means my main ship of the series probably isn't meant to be... Oh well, i'll just headcannon that they marry when they graduate!

I just realized that we haven't had many ecchi reactions lately, which i'm quite happy about. It'll make it easier for me to recommend the series to others. 

EDIT: Oh my god! Souma VS Jouichirou next episode is gonna be epic!
>> ARTICLE
That was amazing i had a thought that he was a alumni before
>> ARTICLE
Soooo, that was fear in Soma's eyes at the end right??

The new OP song is a bit underwhelming compared to the first one. :(
>> ARTICLE
Megumi is an angel.

Anyone have a full gif of polar star dancing at the table at the end of SPICE?
>> ARTICLE
I thought I was in a different show when the new OP started.
>> ARTICLE
I hope they don't skip or rush the Karaage war, but by the looks of things they will.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, they could spend 2 episodes on the Karaage War, 1 on the ping pong match, then the rest on curry and hype considering how many characters there are... 
>> ARTICLE
Huh. So Soma's dad was the 2nd seat of the Elite Ten, and Soma's aiming for 1. Gonna be interesting to see if Soma can surpass his father during his time in Totsuki.
>> ARTICLE
I liked seeing Soma actually speechless/flustered.
>> ARTICLE
New OP huh? In case you didn't consider this a cooking shonen they now have people fighting with cooking utensils in it. 

Of course the dad was a badass that has an epic history with the school, friend with someone who forgot about him until it was convenient to the plot, ofc he lived in the same room as Souma and made that dorm a legend... but why, oh why, does he have to have a history with Erina? ERINA!! 


>> ARTICLE
Best Girl hook.... probably...
>> ARTICLE
Great new opening been looking forward to it and it's everything I wanted. Am hyped.
>> ARTICLE
Man... wish something more insane happened with his dad... 
>> ARTICLE
I love the sense of history that comes with having all of these alumni with old stories and rivalries around. It really makes the world feel a lot more fleshed out and real.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I can't wait to see the look on Erina's face when she finds out the person she admires is Souma's father.  The new OP makes me a bit nervous on how things will go from here. The upcoming Election arc is way too big to be covered in 9 episodes unless they plan on rushing it.
>> ARTICLE
Since no one mentioned it yet, why the hack is the spice dude using a light saber in the OP?!


>> ARTICLE
The video of the new OP is really awesome but I have to say, the songs of the previous OP and ED were something else.

I can't wait to see all the great chefs they showed in the OP to battle Soma in a shokugeki.

But first, he has a battle with his father. So much awesome!!!
>> ARTICLE
Shokugeki only gets better and better~ Haven't been excited for weekly eps from an anime in a long time.. very refreshing!
>> ARTICLE
That new OP feels like a proper Shonen manga... would not look out of place in a fighting anime!
>> ARTICLE
This episode was great but man, the ED is just bad. The OP on the other hand is a little better than the previous one, I think. I'm a little worried with how much the anime will try to cover. I hope the Autumn Election doesn't end up butchered. 
>> ARTICLE
I WANT THIS SHOW TO BE FOREVER
>> ARTICLE
Loved this episode's soundtrack, specifically the tracks used when Erina and Soma were thinking about Joichiro. Very heartwarming.
>> ARTICLE
With all the talk about the show rushing the elections, stopping at the prelimes, etc. I really hope this doesn't go down under during the second half. So far it's looking at a strong 8 to a 9, one of the best shows I've seen. That said, I hope it ends with a open ending for a season two, in case it's made (plz) rather than a No Game No Life ending, or rushed.
>> ARTICLE
Did this episode made you curious about Somas Mother? 

Well, don't think to much about it, because we manga reader haven't heard single thing about her either! Besides the quick mention on the very fist chapter!
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact: Dojima has same voice actor as Kuroyanagi from [Yakitate Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhzQ9mQbNr0)
>> ARTICLE
Can anybody tell me what's up with the way Yukihira(s) and Dojima (among others) hold their knives?

It's neither the pinch nor the racket grip. Is this some kind of unique Japanese style?
>> ARTICLE
its for style points, its not the right way but it looks badass
>> ARTICLE
That seems strange, considering most of the technique in the anime is accurate.
>> ARTICLE
Souma's dad is so cool ;A; and not only that but he even had chatted with him and all when they were sitting outside. He's a dad that challenges his son and helps him grow but actually gets along with him.

Souma's dad, please adopt Gon... and every single other shonen protagonist with a shitty dad.
>> ARTICLE
It's kinda shitty of him to have never told Souma anything about his past or even his real name though.
>> ARTICLE
That Nao Sadatsuka signature black soup in the ED.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously question why Soma never actually bothered to ask his dad anything about his past at all. I would think that after at least 10 years of being able to ask those types of questions then they would have been asked at some point. I did like how nonchalantly he waltzed in and started telling Soma to help him cook though. That was pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, looking back it was quite a stretch on the authors' part to tell readers Souma really knows nothing about his dad including his dad's real name.
>> ARTICLE
As a general observation, I've never asked my dad if his name was his real name or not.

Also keep in mind that Souma was actually working part-time/full-time since he was a kid, so his general magnitude of free time and distraction is rather limited compared to most kids.
>> ARTICLE
Oh God this show is so hype.  
Dad's back, and still just as awesome as ever. Soma still doesn't know prety much anything about his past, and neither do we. He used to know Erina apparently? Holy crap.  
New OP and ED now. The OP I believe is better, and captures the energy of this show in a suitable way. The ED, well ... let's just say that it would have been really hard to live up to the expectations set by the last one.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone notice the anime seems to have played up the father-son relationship a bit. Both this and the first episode show Jouichiro spending time with his son which weren't in the manga. In the manga he doesn't speak to Souma that much and just lets him do his own thing.
>> ARTICLE
btw how many episodes does Food Wars have left?
>> ARTICLE
9
>> ARTICLE
I love that the ED shows the POV of Erina's stalker! :D

Also that screencap at the end about Mizuhara-sempa's recruiting attempts.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa, surprising revelations about Souma's dad.

Where the hell was this show last week??
>> ARTICLE
Last week was a recap ep and if shirobako has taught me anything it means they fell behind in production!   Let's hope this doesn't end up as the next jiggly jiggly heaven! 
>> ARTICLE
Well Im sad they changed the ed :( that was one of the best EDs for quite awhile
>> ARTICLE
No.. no more soma humming to the ending ?!?! hopefully they will pace the election arc the same as the training camp arc and not miss too much out
>> ARTICLE
The new OP perfectly captures the intensity that the Shokugeki's are supposed to bring to the show. Sad Spice was replaced, but what can you do when you have an ED that is already 11/10. I think its kinda funny how [Soma](/s "knew nothing about his father's past, yet learns throughout the episode, just how close to his footsteps he is following.") I'm curious to see Erina's reaction when she realizes who Soma is related to, and this did clear up why his father is so famous, but don't recognize Soma's name (Yukihira.) Will most likely pick the manga up when I get caught up on To Love-Ru. Is ~~worst girl~~ Alice a big part in it?
>> ARTICLE
That was really nice seeing some father-son bonding time, and I didn't see that twist coming, as usual this show is doing awesome :)
>> ARTICLE
Anyone have the ost they played at the End of camp when they were leaving? Sounded like a slowed down version of spice not sure tho. 
>> ARTICLE
Just binge watched the whole show so far and it was so epic my clothes exploded.

This is truly culinary hentai. :D

I really liked the guitar piece near the end. Anyone know where I can listen to the full thing?
>> ARTICLE
NEW OP SUKS
>> ARTICLE
Finally reached this episode tonight. I'm pretty late. Why did they change the opening and ending themes!? 
>> ARTICLE
This episode covered chapter 34, the last 2 pages from chapter 40 and page 3 onwards from chapter 41 and it marks the start of the Autumn Election Arc. Be hyped cause its awesome.

I don't know why chapter 39 and most of chapter 40 were not shown in this episode, but I guess we will see it next episode.

The anime skipped the "Karaage Arc" at chapters 35-38, in which Souma goes back to his hometown. It could be called a filler arc, but it has one small aspect, which could be called important.  

[Short summary of chapter 35-38](/s "Souma goes home for a few days, hears that a new shop opened and people don't visit their shopping distric anymore, so the number of customers goes down. Reason being a new Karaage shop in the commercial area. Souma decides to get the customers back with a better karaage, creates a new dish ( recipe is also in the link below ) with the help of Nikumi and Kurase and regains the customers. Coincidentally that shop is managed by an underling from the 9th seat.") ( I'm sorry if it's not understandable, I suck at summaries, but if you have questions feel free to ask. :) )

And I really like the new OP, I think it fits the Autumn Election quite good. Though I prefer the former ED over this one. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, damn.

If they're skipping material then it won't take long for them to catch up to the manga.
>> ARTICLE
>The anime skipped the "Karaage Arc" at chapters 35-38, in which Souma goes back to his hometown. It could be called a filler arc, but it has one small aspect, which could be called important.

oh wow i didn't realize they skipped to ch41 or so

that's shit, they were doing so well at a 1:1 adaptation, this is really disappointing

they even cut the BEST scene, the ping pong scene :(

and the karaage arc is pretty important too, so why skip it?
>> ARTICLE
Karaage arc isnt really that important. It doesn't drive the plot. They only have a few more episodes left to fit in some or all of the autumn election. They can't waste time on a bit of character building for two already well-liked characters.
>> ARTICLE
true but It kinda does

and it's mentioned a few times in the current manga arc.

would have just been easier to admit they're going to do a second season and animate ALL the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I miss the OP and ED already. OP may grow on me, but the new ED cant top Spice
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit the new OP is awesome
>> ARTICLE
It is too bad we didn't get the chance to see more of Alice and her Ryou this episode. I liked Alice's character a lot in the episodes we have seen of her. Ryou, too! He is really intriguing to me. Not a lot of information has been given about him.

The new OP is "okay". I don't enjoy it as much as the other. As I mentioned else where in the thread, I find the new ED to be pleasant.  It stands next to the old ED just fine. Seems to be having mixed opinions here.
>> ARTICLE
I don't read the manga but I'm almost positive we will be seeing  Alice and Ryou a lot more in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Well... you'll see a lot of them in the Autumn Election Arc.

It'll sure be interesting to see more of Alice's smart way cooking. I wonder if Ryou takes the same approach to his cooking. Hopefully we'll see more of the duo very soon. They've definitely piqued my curiosity.

Does anyone think that Shokugeki No Soma's new OP sounds like it should be a Naruto opening?  Anyone?

Anyways, as a reader of the manga (I'm on the Shokugeki No Soma reddit making predictions and posting notes on food, check it out!)

Shinomiya senpai... So I knew it!  He's trying to get 3 Michelin Stars (The manga was a little vague on that, it just said 3 stars)! 

(For those of you who don't know fine Dining, 3 Michelin stars is the highest rating you can get from Michelin to get for your restaurant.  It's the thing every high-class chef aims for.  Highest earner of Michelin stars (Per restaurant) goes to Gordon Ramsey (Yes, that one) with 16 stars (3 per restaurant, so you open more of them and get more Michelin stars).)

Also, Megumi, train under Hinako!  Do it!

I also like Erina and Soma's interactions.  I mean, I know everyone here has a megumi Bias, but I also like Erina as well.

I missed Super Saiyan housekeeper.

Horray, Souma's dad is back!  

You gotta love Soma's reaction when Soma findsout his dad is an elite 10.

If this was a hentai, Souma's dad would have NTRd Souma's harem in one full stroke with his food.  But that would have been ridiculous even for a hentai plot.

I miss the disgusting dishes.

I miss the 1st en, but I think the 2nd end will grow on me.

I bet that everyone in /r/Anime is surprised that somehow, in an anime thread about cooking, just SOMEHOW we managed to pull a G Gundam Joke.  I mean, I know that I've been letting /r/Gundam leak out in my comments because of the fact that this series is the best way to keep the meatbun dream alive until Gundam Build Fighters season 3 gets out, and that the mecha community is pretty much down because of no new mecha series, but still, that was crazy, even for us.

On the other hand, as an Iron Chef Japan fanboy, I should have seen this coming from a mile away as cooking is serious business.

Also, next time the Erina's Grandfather does a speech, we will have to do a "Sieg Meatbun" because Erina's Grandfather's VA is Ghiren Zabi.

I love the song that start playing during the final dish, so much hype. One thing though, why would they make a big deal of him not having money and then do a montage of making like 7 dishes.
>> ARTICLE
noone said that he bought good meat to prepare those dishes , as i remember from the manga they went for the cheapeast u could find
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing they were using the club supplies at the end he asks if the club has any steak let over. If Yuki had bought it he would have known
>> ARTICLE
I assume because he has money, just not very much, and not enough if he is going to be preparing a ton of food like he needed to do in order to prepare. If it was just to buy one set of ingredients he would have been fine. 
>> ARTICLE
he had like $15.

he prepared like 7 meals after that.
>> ARTICLE
I thought I saw him get a 5000 and 1000 yen bill? Or were they 500 and 100? So he either had $5 or $50 of his own money, plus whatever he got from the Don society. Either way it isn't much, so it's certainly impressive. 
>> ARTICLE
It was a 5000 bill and a 1000 bill so he had like $60 (500 and 100 are coins). I don't think it's too far fetched he had enough stuff to do all those tests.

It's definitely there, but Megumi re-attaching it with tape is in a 1-come extra in the published volume -- not in the weekly scans.
>> ARTICLE
Ah okay.
>> ARTICLE
It's okay!  They reattached it!
>> ARTICLE
Such a good episode, but *why is it so short??* I want it to be next week already so I can see how this wraps up. Not that I have any doubts regarding who the winner of the shokugeki will be, but still, I want to see how it will happen! 

Needless to say, I'm really enjoying this anime. Though there seemed to be a bit less humor in this episode than the preceding ones. 
>> ARTICLE
The pacing they're doing for this adaptation is actually pretty good. It seems like they are doing a constant 2-3 chapters per episode. You can tell the budget was spent on drawing the food, because some of the conversations between characters seems a bit anti-climatic compared to what's in the source material.


I can't wait for the next arc; where things will pick up some momentum. My personal favorite this season. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the pacing is fantastic. My complaint is just that I'm enjoying the show too much and dislike waiting a week for each episode! Which is really just praise for the show. 

And now I'm looking forward to the next arc as well!

>> ARTICLE
That is a lesson that should be quickly learned watching food anime. Fortunately Gourmet Girl Graffiti imparted that lesson last season for most which prepared us for Food Wars which really cranked up the food porn.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like meat girl to make me meatbuns. 

Also, why is Isshiki so likable!?!?!

I'm so used to foodgasms that I was waiting for Soma to get one when he bit into the tomato.

Megumi's innocence... but I still think Game Food girl (Still trying to remember names, I have memorization issues) and Ryoko are contenders for best girls. All the girls are so likable. Even Erina!

Also, i'd like to remind everyone that Megumi can't be a wife anymore because Soma saw her naked.

Ah, food bowls.  Serious business.  trust me, I know.  Also, what is with that hair where the majority of it sticks forward?

I'd like to play with Mito Ikumi's magical mouthwatering meatbuns.

Is no one concerned about Ikumi's dangerous handling of knives for a master of meat?  I've learned that in basic cooking school!

I'd let Nikumi handle the pleasure of my meat.  

I never heard of the Chappelin steak, that's a first for me.

For those of you who do not get why Nikumi is using Wagyu beef that's aged, it's because when you sell beef, it's actually slightly rotten, not freshly killed.  I'm not sure how to explain this one, but when meat is a week old after the animal it's killed, the bacteria and something inside the meat, actually draws out the meat flavor.  Thus having aged meat, sometime between the "After animal is killed" (Usually 1 week, I believe) and "Before flys come and lays its eggs" is when meat starts tasting really good.

Just to show how much my binge watching and food readings have come in this show

>> ARTICLE
Fun Fact: some steakhouses age their meat for up to 6 months!
>> ARTICLE
I like Erina but I don't think she gets enough direct contact with Soma for her to really develop.
>> ARTICLE
> Also, i'd like to remind everyone that Megumi can't be a wife anymore because Soma saw her naked.

Well, she can only be Soma's wife now.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call it rotten (since that implies spoilage), but you're partially right.

One thing the "aging" process contributes is that the meat's natural enzymes and lactic acid continue to operate well after death, this tenderizes the meat by breaking down the muscle fibers. Another part is that it gradually evaporates moisture inside meat, concentrating the flavour. Furthermore, the various amino acids released in the process actually make up most of the flavour of the meat, increasing the meat's flavour even more. Pretty much all meats are aged to some extent.

(Fun fact, you can actually get some amino acids in powder form (i.e. soluble by connecting it to sodium) to enhance flavour. Perhaps most (in)famous would be MSG, which is basically concentrated umami flavour.)

They should have set a budget limit for the don they prepare at the Shokugeki.

Nikumi's parents own a huge meat-packing industry. Technically, their budget is $0, since they aren't paying for the meat, they already own it. Nikumi has been raising the particular "A5 higher than A5" individual used in this competition herself as well. Similar to if Yoshino was to use some of her animals she's been raising.

I had to pause in the middle of the episode to grasp smth to eat, this show's food just look too delicious
>> ARTICLE
I'm enjoying this anime quite a bit, but I do have some minor problems with the series so far.

One, they're focusing on the umami *way* too much. I know this is Japan and they're obsessed with their umami, but there are five whole other flavors they could be focusing on here! Hopefully they'll get to it sometime later in the series.

Second, it's really presumptuous of Erina and co. (and pretty much everyone else actually) that food made with high quality ingredients are the only dishes worth eating. But then our hero Soma comes in and shows people otherwise? 

It'd be better if they drove the point a bit more, but oh well. We have 20something episodes to deal with that issue I guess. It's just idiotic when the past five episodes, everyone has scoffed at the working-class foods that *helped build entire nations*.

I bear sad news my friend if their obsession with umami irks you as it is recurring throughout the manga. Not in every dish of course, but you'll constantly hear about umami that's all.

This episode starts off with chapter 14(the Polar Star farm), then goes back to chapter 10 and 11. 
There were some rearrangement of scenes, overall though,, the anime extensions of some manga scenes were great.

Thumbs up to the Fanservice for both the female and male audiences!

Can anyone give me a general description of this? Is it kind of like the basketball one, but with cooking? If so, I just don't think I'll be happy to handle it. If it's funny and kind of action-y, then maybe. 
>> ARTICLE
It's quite funny, but there isn't any action. It's mostly like a "battle-academy" series with cooking rather than training for a non-human theat to humanity.

Really funny though, altough the two jokes that killed me probably won't be coverd by the anime and best-girl won't get her moment to shine either.[]( /s "It's Hisako you fools")
>> ARTICLE
It seems to me that they'll be doing the fall classic arc so she'll get her time 
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully, but at this point I'd almost be suprised if they make it past the []( /s "Training camp") arc and when [spoilers]( /s "Souma's dad visits the Polar Star Dorm appears to be the perfect time for the adaptation to end.")
>> ARTICLE
Its 24 episodes so I'm pretty sure they'll do the fall classic starting in the early double digit episodes like 11 or 12
>> ARTICLE
Nope, they won't. The current episode scheme is 2 chapters per episode. At 24 episodes, they'll get around chapter 50. That is right before the Autumn Election starts. They're definitely saving it for season 2. 
>> ARTICLE
The anime is  still in volume 2 at episodes 6/7.
The training camp arc will probably take up most of the remaining episodes, I think

>> ARTICLE
I know but expect them to speed things up but if they don't im okay with it 
>> ARTICLE
Looking through the chapters, I  think that this anime season will end at chapter 34 or chapter 39(volume 5)... 35 to 38 is a nice little arc to either end the season or start season 2.
>> ARTICLE
What were the two jokes that killed you? I've read the manga up to 117 so spoilers away
>> ARTICLE
I was killed by the []( /s "Jojo & One punch man") refference.
>> ARTICLE
The action is absurdly dramatized cooking, which turns out to be extremely entertaining. It's funny, but the narrative is solid and consistent.
>> ARTICLE
The beautiful thing is that the food they make can also be replicated, the whole orgasming from the food is a dramatization, but regardless tastes good.

A little review about the episode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT7s7ftlTwU&feature=youtu.be
>> ARTICLE
This show combines two of my favorite things: softcore porn and food porn! AOTY 4 SURE!
>> ARTICLE
Wow...i'm impressed that they managed to make Nikumi even more overtly sexual than the manga ever did. Even if she did wear a bikini all the time in the manga, there wasn't anywhere close to this overt of a focus on her breasts. 

Also, I thought it was interesting that the subtitle translation took the Yukichi term for the 10,000 Yen note and translated it as Benjamin for our $100 note. An accurate translation, but interesting that they didn't want to go with the Japanese term (even though the flying angel faces were of Yukichi). 
>> ARTICLE
Man there's no way I can wait for next week for this. I think I'm going to read the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so we got more naked Isshiki, a guy whose pompadour apparently got so big it achieved sentience, and a new opponent who really likes her meat. Yep, this show is still great.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else notice the bell peppers & beef dish? 
>> ARTICLE
They definitely made Nikumi more sexual but I don't mind it, it doesn't feel out of character, she's just confident and knows what she's doing. Another fantastic episode, in a few more it'll catch up to where I've read then I'll be excited for all new content! So happy with how J.C.Staff are adapting this, they're doing a great job.
>> ARTICLE
Working in just a revealing piece of underwear Isshiki?  That's not very safe :\... at least it looks very liberating to work in.  Really looking forward to Nikumi's foodgasm...er...hopefully she has a foodgasm ;)
>> ARTICLE
Is Nikumi American? There's her appearance and her clothing but from what I can see online it doesnt say anything about that
>> ARTICLE
Not as far as i'm aware. She's a member of the Mito family that controls all meat distribution in Japan. 
>> ARTICLE

Nikumi is the perfect American wife. She can cook the best steaks and got them titties. Shes got the attitude. So if we could get some doujins of her that'd be great.

The anime is even more sexualized than the manga. This is heading towards literal food porn. Not that it's a bad thing.

not really happy that they gave away Soma's dish before the competition. In the manga it has more impact because you don't know what the dish he makes until it's preseneted to judges.

What are you talking about? The manga revealed the dish in the exact same chapter as shown in this episode.

Basically the structure of Souma preparing for competition in the manga:

1. Struggle with and play with a bunch of ideas

1. Settle with one

1. Think of what he can do to improve it

1. Time-leap to competition where we get to see what he came up with

He really is though. The comment that other alumni made about Dojima being a good educator was spot on. The other alumni are good teachers, even Shinomiya made for a good teacher ultimately, but Dojima is one of the few real educators. 

His methods go beyond book-learning and skills of the trade knowledge. He was observant enough to have picked up on problems individually with Shinomiya, Tadokoro, and Soma, then addressed them directly, helping them grow as people in the process.

He and Senzaemon Nakiri ( Head of Totsuki ) are good bro material. Both of them saved somas ass already

They never went into it. All we know for now is that they were classmates and that Souma's dad had a different last name and changed it to Yukihira. That's why Dojima didn't realize Souma is his son immediately

I dont know the exact chapters but [Manga Spoiler](/s "Dojima and Somas Dad were students at Totsuki too. In fact they were friends and in the same year. But it seems like they havent met each other since they went parted ways after graduation. Later in the story his Dad and Dojima meet again I think, cant remember well enough.

Well, remembered it wrong then. Just thought they did since [Manga S](/s "he visited Totsuki once")
Thanks for the correction :)

[Manga](/s "It's only shown that he visits the dorm. He says he has other business there but what it is is unknown. Also, Dojima should be at the resort, unless he was also at Totsuki off screen. Either way, it's definitely not shown they meet.")

Not OP, but [Obviously Manga Spoilers](/s "both lived in the Polar Star Dorms and were best brothers. Also, while Dojima was the #1 seat in the Council of ten (or whatever it's called), Soma's dad was #2.")

EDIT: Why downvotes on not only myself, but every single other person that answered it correctly? In the wiki, it says quote: [](/s "Along with his fellow 69th Generation Polar Star friend Gin Djima, Jichiro eventually entered the Elite Ten Council, earning the 2nd seat just below Gin.")

The entire little story is explained somewhere around chapter 41 in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
So much Megumi, so little time.  
  
That was so heart-warming. The "fake" shokugeki had some of the biggest impact on everyone involved. A stagnant chef found new inspiration, a chef who thought of herself only as weak found confidence, and a chef who has yet to lose at this school felt the taste of defeat. Everyone involved grew stronger.

I asked the same question when I watched an anime about guys tossing volleyballs back and forth competitively.
>> ARTICLE
The cooking world is far more interesting than people make it out to be.

Shokugeki No Soma got down the internal elitist societies of cooking right, as Shinomiya's French Flashback is surprisingly extremely accurate to how A: Not only how Elitist the French Cooking Business is in real life, but B: How racist it is too.  Even today this is still happening.
>> ARTICLE
[So relevant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome)

I worked in a michelin star restaurant as a sommelier in France, the cuisine was changing and we had this incredible japanese chef named jiro, I don't remember much about him, but he was the most serious and dedicated chef I ever worked for.
Most french chef will just shout at people for the sake of it and to make their staff affraid of him. I worked for a lot of chef, and one thing a learned in that the more a chef shout at his staff, the worst he is.
To go back to that japanese chef, I was the only one respecting him, maybe because I was talking a bit of japanese and could discuss with him, but the rest of the staff was just laughing at his face when he was talking, especially when he was saying words like "merlu" or "citron" just because it's hard to pronounce for japanese. Jiro never shouted at anyone, when there was a problem he waited for the end of the shift, sat dawn and talk trough the problem really calmly, I really miss chef like that...
>> ARTICLE
Jiro..?

*The* Jiro?
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling that is it a different Jiro. I don't remember the one from the documentary having learned anything before the art of sushi/Japanese cuisine.
>> ARTICLE
I would be 100% fine with both of them getting kicked out and opening up a restaurant together...

Also there needs to be more Hinako.
>> ARTICLE
I would watch a spin off series with just hinako in it.
>> ARTICLE
Assuming we all didn't know that they couldn't get kicked out, I saw the possiblility for three endings.


This one.  Them getting kicked out and opening a restaurant.  OR, the tie, followed by "but you're still out" followed by "but I want to take you (megumi) on as an apprentice" (since the tie still cleared soma for duty).  ((I don't know how bad I slaughtered her name, but spellcheck wants to correct it to legume, lulz))


But, you know, battle shounen.  We all knew what was gonna happen somehow.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to be honest.  I thought they were just going to let Megumi win. Good job Food Wars
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad they didn't because I came into this episode thinking "oh let's see how megumi wins this".
>> ARTICLE
They are not afraid to let the good guys lose.

Hinako is best side character, she's hilarious. I love her.
>> ARTICLE
...*yeees*

I dont know about you but over here the temp rises about 15 degrees kelvin everytime
>> ARTICLE
But Kelvin doesn't have a unit
>> ARTICLE
yeah it is, its K
>> ARTICLE
What he means is that it's just Kelvin, not degrees Kelvin.
>> ARTICLE
ok, yes . . . he is correct
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, so Kelvin is the unit (one of the 7 SI base units that are recognised, along with metre, kilogram, second, ampere, candela and mole), and doesn't use "degree" the same way that Celsius and Fahrenheit do since they refer to the degree on a scale relative to a point, and can be either negative or positive. Kelvin cannot be negative*, since 0 kelvins is absolute zero, which is the theoretical lowest temperature possible.

I'm still somewhat sketchy on the details, and I'm saying this more so for the benefit of other people reading, since you seem like you probably know since you already knew the distinction.

* *Edit*: Kelvin could not be negative until scientists recently discovered a temperature lower than absolute zero, which can apparently be considered "hotter than infinite temperature". This is referred to as "negative temperature", and is distinct from something merely being negative on a temperature scale. It is actually inverse temperature. It should be noted that absolute zero is still the coldest temperature, but technically not the lowest.

~ *Credit to /u/Alice_Ex for pointing that out.*
>> ARTICLE
That went by so fast, so glad this is 24 episodes long.

Looks like next episode will focus on tamagoyaki in some way, will be interesting to see what the spin on it is!
>> ARTICLE
Really? I thought they really dragged out this Shokugeki. I guess they're trying to highlight the battles as the main part of the show but I'm keen for more characters to be introduced and interactions.
>> ARTICLE
For me the only bit that dragged was the set of Megumi's flashbacks near the beginning, I really enjoyed all the backstory and reactions from the alumni. I can see why it could be viewed as on the slow side though, and I certainly missed the rest of the gang. 

Overall I felt this was very much an introverted character growth episode rather than an extroverted character interaction episode (if that makes sense), and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
This episode actually went really fast relative to the source. The whole bit about Megumi and allspice only took a few lines but it covered pages in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I've read the manga. The cooking is always elongated in the manga. Plot and character development was key in this arc. Flashbacks always drag on too long in the manga, I feel. 
>> ARTICLE
They adopted almost 3 chapters in this episode! A reason why the beginning felt slow was maybe that the pre-opening part was basically just a flashback of last episode (plus some "Megumi might get expelled here flashback" red haring).
>> ARTICLE
Damn it's like the ending of Ratatouille all over again

Glad I'm not the only one who immediately thought of that too, haha.

>> ARTICLE
I cried at the scene where Shinomiya was in France, because it is depressingly accurate to how incredibly elitist the French Cooking Community is.  Doubly so since Japanese people who go to France to learn French Cooking are ignored completely at best or looked down upon at worst.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. Are you a French Chef, or involved in that community in some way?
>> ARTICLE
My father is a french pastry chef. Born, raised, and went to culinary school in France, close to Paris. It is incredibly snobbish and elitest, but that's because it is an incredibly old tradition, and incredibly prestigious thing in France. It is taken *very* seriously there, if you don't want to be the best, if you don't bust your ass 24/7, you aren't going to amount to shit because 10 other people have that much drive and confidence, and it is incredibly cut throat.

So you have to think you are the best, you have to think everyone is garbage, you need that mindset. If you are French yourself, lineage means a lot (well it did back then, don't know if it changed much). Coming from a prestigious culinary family means a lot, probably puts a ton of pressure on your shoulders. My father's family ran a Michelin star inn. I remember asking my father about his time in culinary school and him telling me the headmaster of the school hated his family and his guts. My father graduated third out of his entire class and when the headmaster was handing his diploma he told my father "you will never amount to shit." It's very intense schooling.


>> ARTICLE
I'm not a chef, but I did have a thing for food ever since I was a kid, and today, food and the cooking industry is one of the things that still intrigues me.  I liked reading a lot about the food world, whether it had to be about how stuff like candies and chips are made, the science of food, the culture of food, the politics involving food (For example: Nouvelle VS Classique cuisine in France, Washoku vs Yoshoku in Japan), and the like.  I watch a lot of cooking shows in my free time, from Iron Chef Japan and Gordon Ramsey shows in my free time.   I ended up learning a lot from it and kind of got obsessed with it by the time I watched Shokugeki no Soma, I kind of got genre-savvy in the show.  I also been to Paris, and they take food seriously.  Really seriously.  Naturally my younger sister, who knows how much I have an obsession with this kind of stuff, then recommended me this show, and I said "Huh.  I'll check it out."

The spin off manga *Shokugeki no Soma - Etoile*, delivers some more insight into Shinomiya's life in France.

We all knew, that they will pass somehow, because otherwise the anime would be over, but it's a real sign of quality when one is still sitting in front of the monitor, thinking "This can't happen right now!".

Good episode. Not too flashy, but lots of information and development. This show is just so much more than simple foodgasm...

I knew that there would be no way either of them would be expelled, but during the voting scene I honestly did not know who was going to win.

Same, I honestly was expecting Dojima to strong arm Shinomiya into passing them when/if they lost. Still, I didn't expect him to end up teaching so many valuable lessons to the other characters, it was badass in a completely unexpected way!

I thought Megumi would win, and I'm glad she didn't. Especially with the subject matter as "real" as it is (i.e not superhuman battling), it's nice that they acknowledge that someone who is clearly more skilled cannot be beaten just by trying hard.

Nice comparisons! Small hint for future episodes: for the manga part you can use the scans from casanovascans or straight from batoto. Their quality is a bit better and they also don't have any watermarks on them!

From the looks of it, JC Staff is doing an absolutely exceptional job of adapting the manga.

Definitely.  The manga is really good but the anime grabs what is good from it and adds to it so well.  It has been awhile where I read and watch the shame show.
>> ARTICLE
Should I start reading the manga too or just stick with the show? These cliffhangers are killing me
>> ARTICLE
The manga is amazing. You won't regret it.

I gave in and read the manga, and I do not regret it. The anime is still really good, even if I know what will happen, so read it if you want to.

If you really don't mind ruining some first time experiences for the anime then sure, it's definitely worth the read. Just make sure you have something to eat while reading because trust me, YOU WILL BE HUNGRY BY THE TIME YOU CATCH UP.
>> ARTICLE
I say do it.  The manga is fantastic.  It isn't Naruto/Bleach bullshit of reaction gifs every week.  There is actual meat to each chapter.  And you get to enjoy the little things. I didn't realize that they spoofed sailor moon until the anime but I enjoyed it in the manga.  

Basically two weeks ago I read the manga and read all 80 interim chapters in one night.  IT was just that good.
>> ARTICLE
> actual meat to each chapter

Each chapter? But they just cooked a vegetable dish? ^Ha ^^Ha ^^^Ha
>> ARTICLE
For example, I knew the magical cabbage girls were coming but cabbage pink was so hilariously unexpected. 
>> ARTICLE
If anything, I felt like JC Staff had their job easier due to sheer quality of the manga, allowing the adaptation to be done nicely.
>> ARTICLE
I think that the manga has a really high quality too. Some scenes are so intense and brilliant. The artstyle seems sometimes a bit strange for "cooking manga" it's like your regular shonen jump manga just a bit darker but the combination is brilliant.

As the manga reader trying to provide insight to the show without being annoying, we reached the end of the Shokugeki vs. Shinomiya-senpai. [Don't grip my face like Hinako, I mean well >.<](https://38.media.tumblr.com/3d960d279ee275262d5295d96387f3c0/tumblr_npvciqAXFN1tubau5o1_500.gif)

The arc ends with 2 major things to take note besides Megumi being a competent cook at Totsuki. First is that Chef Shinomiya isn't that bad of a guy and has a reason for his scary evil persona. He is actually a very likable character who will return in the future. The other thing is that our main MC Souma-kun did in fact lose in an important competition. Something that a lot of people feel is important in Shounen anime is that the main character cannot continually win. There should be a challenge they couldn't overcome which sparks growth or just so the viewer doesn't feel like there is no conflict  our hero can't beat which makes things boring. Souma lost vs. an opponent much more skilled than he was, they exist in this world. The important thing to why this story is so good is from the scene of Souma hitting the wall which showed like Souma's challenges against his own dad, he always takes each competition seriously and plays to WIN, believing that no matter the unfavorable conditions, he has got a chance.

The other thing I want to mention is that the car brakes are broken and this anime ain't planning on stopping. The great thing about this anime/manga is that things rarely get stale. The next challenge will be just as exciting if not more and I love that this anime is 2-cour because the pacing is terrific, nothing feels rushed at all.
>> ARTICLE
It's dumb that this is considered a loss for Souma though. He wasn't head chef, so it's hardly his fault.
>> ARTICLE
Those were the rules. Also, Soma would've lost against Shinomiya even if it was a one on one.
>> ARTICLE
Souma was the one who challenged. It should have been his and his alone. It's dumb that those are the rules.

And, we can not say for certain that Souma would have lost even one on one. Souma's food makes people orgasm, Megumi's makes people feel comfortable at most.

It's dumb for Souma to consider this his loss.

Though I wonder at which point they wanna stop. Right now we are halfway through the anime but the training camp isn't over yet.

Aside from Megumi managing to pull her own and evade expulsion, one of the other most memorable parts about this battle was how [Soma took it after it was over](http://imgur.com/pddhz3m). This would technically count as the first time he's lost since attending school, showing that he isn't unbeatable and is very much capable of losing in the battles to come.

[](/s "However, this point doesn't fully get across until the upcoming egg battle.")
>> ARTICLE
The Megumi/Souma ship tease is so real this episode. I'm not usually a fan of flashbacks, especially to episodes that were 1-2 back, but I loved it. 

Shinomiya looks crazy similar to Souma in the flashback. And if I needed more reason to dislike French people, I think I found it. 

Doujima is awesome as always. [MM! Spoiler] (/s"There's a reason Jouichiro couldn't surpass him, after all.") And Mizuhara playing the straight woman throughout the episode was a nice touch. 

And the end of this episode is one of the reasons I like Souma so much more than most other Shounen protagonists- others would've just smiled and gone on their way, happy they saved the girl, but Souma is incredibly bitter about losing a fight he had no possibility of winning, regardless of his original objective being achieved. His sheer competitiveness and hunger to grow stronger is unreal. But nicely, at the end, he recognizes that the loss wasn't nearly as important as saving a friend and protecting the happiness of the Polar Star Dorm, which is a good touch.

And lastly, Yuuki flying between tsun tsun and dere dere was even better than the manga. I love the interactions of the members off the Polar Star Dorm- they really are a tight knit group.

>I wanted to server a dish that'd be gentle on your stomach

I love all the work they put in describing the science of foods.  Makes sense since the terrine is nouvelle ("New cooking", basically cooking that tries to accentuate the natural flavors of cooking)  in origin, if I recall, which has a lot of science put into cooking.   

Megumi is right in using Mom as an inspiration as cooking.  Moms are the best chefs, comparable to any 3-star restaurant!

Those three Megumi Spirits are adorable!

Megumi lost by a landslide?  WHAT IS THE SHIT?

That's right, Shinomiya, listen to Gin Dojima, because he is voiced by Takehito Koyasu!  

STOP HINAKO ABUSE, HINAKO IS BEST GIRL YOU BASTARD!

I just want to say that this show does a really good job in its research of the France-Japan relationship that it has in the culinary world.  I even provided a mini-commentary for you guys to read!

France and Japan actually does have a bit of a relationship when it comes to the culinary world.  A lot of Japanese express an interest in French cuisine (Japan really likes to enjoy other cultures, that's why we have curry rice, just look up Yoshoku, or Western-inspired Japanese cuisine), and a lot of Japanese people spend a lot (Read: Several thousands in their life savings) of dollars just trying to get hired to learn how to cook French dishes.  That's how Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai made his career in real life. Of course, like most people spending a lot of money (Read: Sevral thousand dollars) in France, it's hard to get into the food business in France due to the extreme elitism the chefs has in the work (The Critiques of Shinomiya in the magazines is just how accurate on how serious French takes cooking), but doubly so for the Japanese because Japan is such a low minority compared to the French population that they tend to not even get noticed.

Sorry, couldn't resist providing this commentary, I really do find the cooking world interesting.  It really is, and knowing this information really does enhance Shokugeki No Soma for me.

I cried at the scene with Shinomiya and his mother.  Anyone else?

Shinomiya voted for Megumi?!?  What a twist!

And so did Best girl Hinako!

Megumi won?!?!?  horray!

I like Dojima.  Takehito Koyasu was the PERFECT choice for such a broseph because Koyasu did Mu La Flaga in Gundam Seed, aka one of the best bro characters in a Gundam Series.  

Dojima is such a bro that his encouragement turned Megumi into a woMAN OF DESTINY! ^I ^couldn't ^resist.

Haha, look at all the text.  It's good to see that the group is worried!

And Dojima is watching Soma?  Will Dojima turn Soma into a MAN OF DESTINY!!?!?!?

And everyone was worried!  Daww.

I feel for you Souma.













>> ARTICLE
Aaaaaaaaahhh...such a lovely episode. I'm very happy regarding Megumi's take on dishes. So sweet and caring.

That piano (I'm a sucker for piano-related music) hit me so...goddarn hard with Megumi's sadness.

Good to see Dojima-san showing Shinomiya a new path, after hitting the top. Totally understand the "I've hit the top at what cost? What am I to do now?"

Hinako is still hilarious as always.

This show really makes me interested in cooking. Fuck.

I knew this would be good, and they definitely delivered. That was superb! I can't stress that enough, Tadokoro is one of the best things to ever be created, and adorable in a way I cannot even descibe.

I really liked that arc, serving as development and further deepening and fleshing out for so many characters. Tadokoro's source [Nature? Defining trait?] of cooking, Souma's competitive nature, Shinomiya overcoming his difficulties, Dojima and his role. Dojima is one of the most respectable characters in the series in my eyes. He's a role model as an educator and as a cook, he's also rooted in Souma's life in certain ways, and he's just cool as heck. I'm also looking forward to Shinomiya from now on, since he also becomes incredibly admirable, respectable, and straight up cool. I absolutely love this series, both as an adaptation and standalone, and I'm also glad that this is a two-cour series.

The OST was on-point for every scene that really mattered in this episode. Absolutely top! 

I got teary-eyed for a few scenes cause they were heartfelt and the music added to that especially in this.

>> ARTICLE
Late watching this episode but again, absolutely fantastic. The piano version of the OP was great and the whole sequence leading up to the judging with Megumi hoping for the best was really sweet, showing that Food Wars! has great humour and emotional moments. I say it every week but I'm so glad that J.C.Staff, my favourite studio, are animating one of my favourite manga so perfectly. Despite knowing what happens, I find myself excited each week and find that the cliffhangers are as painful for me as they are for those who don't know what happens next! Easily my favourite show of the season.

Only negative thing about this episode is that I think they could have handled Megumi breaking down after she finally got to stay in a bit better. I thought her falling down and being static then her face appearing over everything didn't pack the kick it could have done, whereas I think they capture Soma's despair at losing a lot better. Nothing that'll hamper my enjoyment, though. It's just odd cos J.C.Staff are usually so good with emotion and made me tear up a few times this episode but when it got to what should've been the most emotional scene, it didn't get to me like the rest of the episode had done.

I love how they're now using the ED to carry over onto actual footage though.
>> ARTICLE
Full of Megumi goodness... With a side of Hinako. Those two go well together.

And Soma is upset. You betcha he's going to make even more of an effort to wreck every other competitor. 
>> ARTICLE
Really glad Megumi was able to stay in the school.  I'd take a dish that radiates with love and consideration for the eater any day over an expensive pompous dish the other guy makes.  It's gonna be nice to see if she evolves in a way that it shows throughout the series.
>> ARTICLE
If Tadokoro wasn't already your best girl, she is now
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, Hinako is still.
>> ARTICLE
Frankly I find her annoying because she's so weak and helpless. She should get expelled from the school. That way, she'd suffer less. She can always pursue her cooking dreams in a different way. It's delusional that she thinks she can make it.
>> ARTICLE
WEAK!!!? Then let the Autumn Election Arc slap some sense into you.

[Manga spoiler](/s "From being at the bottom of the first years, she became part of the Top 8 first years outside of the Elite Ten, The Jewel Generation.")

Even Erina acknowledges Megumi's skill more than Souma's.
>> ARTICLE
She only made that far because of her connections, to Souma and their housemates. She has masters around to teach her. It's weak. Normally, people like her get expelled immediately. 
>> ARTICLE
That's why they are in freaking "school". To learn and be taught how to cook better.

What she lacks is confidence but she has talent. When she does not have the jitters, she's a respectable chef. Hinako recognized it, Ishiki as well. Even the principal himself recognized her talent (just a little bit late though).

And what "connections" are you talking about? For all I know, she's just a country bumpkin who was almost swallowed whole by city life when she enrolled in Tootsuki in middle school.
>> ARTICLE
>That's why they are in freaking "school". To learn and be taught how to cook better.

Except, compared to the normal student, her schooling includes being around the best cooks in school everday. It's like saying "What , you can't beat this other guy who has the best teachers? Then why the hell am I tutoring you under the worst teacher ever?" Completely unreasonable.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that at her worst, she still managed to graduate middle school and qualify as a first year student in Totsuki's high school means she's not weak like those who were expelled. She's just lacking confidence on her own cooking.

Though I admit that that lack of confidence should have already led to her expulsion if Souma didn't help earlier in the series. 

[Manga](/s "But she was able to bounce back and show to everyone her cooking in the Autumn Election Arc. It's her break-out arc that surprised every other first years when Megumi qualified for the main tournament.")

And the manga took some extra miles on showing how good Megumi is as a cook.

In any case, at this point, let's just agree to disagree and not drag this further anymore.

>> ARTICLE
I don't think they did a good job of showing how good she without the confidence issue thing. This episode showed that she cares for the person eating her dish, and that's supposed to make it a good dish. Big deal.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's definitely a "big deal" for the characters "in-universe".

If you're still not convinced, then go blame the author for poor writing.

Have you seen Hunter X Hunter? Another amazingly written and animated shounen
>> ARTICLE
I just realized that Joichiro is basically [Hunter X Hunter spoiler](/s "Ging: The good parts.")
>> ARTICLE
Or the same as [Heaven's Feel/Fate/Zero](/s "Kiritsugu.")
>> ARTICLE
He's also Nagate's guardian/grandpa in Knights of Sidonia.

I guess this guy gets typecast into the absentee dad/guardian role quite a lot LOL.
>> ARTICLE
Same voice actor too. Hah.
>> ARTICLE
The guy plays so many badass dads. You've got Joichiro, Ging from HxH, Kyros from One Piece, and I'm pretty sure there's others I'm forgetting.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't he play Kiritsugu aswell?
>> ARTICLE
Yep.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, Kiritsugu's role in F/Z was rarely father-mode.

Either way... food alter, double flavor
>> ARTICLE
So true! Not only I'm smiling to myself like a retard the whole time while watching it but those face-offs are more epic than some battles in other anime!
>> ARTICLE
Mant people shoot down shounen for being formulaic, unimaginative etc (and they're half right for majority of the cases) but I think that they've forgotten that shounen isn't about a deep story that makes you think (though some have that). What makes shounen popular is actually simpler than that.

Simply put, it's all about the hype. One Piece, early Fairy Tail, early Naruto, Haikyuu, Eyeshield 21, Gintama, One Punch Man, Shoukugeki no Souma... the common factor among all of them is that when shit goes down, the hype gets real.

Now I'm not saying that shounen can't have a good story. It can. However, it's not the 'base necessity'. Hype is.

Nope. That's a Seinen.

My only problem with the Shokugeki No Soma anime: It comes out on Friday, when the newest Manga Chapter gets released.

So I have to make sure my comments don't give any spoilers away.

Every time a new episode comes out I'm always itching to talk about the stuff that happens in later chapters too. It's really painful.

Just join the manga discussion threads in /r/manga then if you don't already.

(inserting casual comment here) How does the manga compare?
>> ARTICLE
The manga is great. Shoukugeki is on of those rare shows for me where I look forward to the anime each week even though I know what's going to happen. Hell that actually makes me more excited. If you like the anime you'll like the manga.

Same for Prison School, so far JC Staff has done an amazing job bringing both mangas to life.

Ah, when Erina finally finds out who Soma's father is. I'll be soooo happy.
>> ARTICLE
From what I understand, you're going to be waiting a long while for that. [Spoilers?](/s "Pretty sure manga readers are still waiting for this.")
>> ARTICLE
I love the manga but it's nothing really big, I would say the anime is 1 Arc behind the manga. But nonetheless, the Arc that's coming up is nothing short of amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Uhh.. that's not true at all. There's still the [Manga Spoilers](/s "Stagiare Arc, which is actually quite big in terms of Soma's development")

>> ARTICLE
What? that one is ridiculously short. Pretty much 2-3 episodes in an anime (even if it is a huge moment for Soma that Arc is super short)
>> ARTICLE
I could say it could fill up 4 episodes easily.

1. [Manga Spoilers](/s "Soma and Hisako meeting up and working for a bit at the first stage. Ends with "are we really leaving behind visible results?"")

2. [Manga Spoilers](/s "They figure out how to save the restaurant. Ends with Soma telling Hisako to "walk beside Erina"")

3. [Manga Spoilers](/s "Soma arrives at Shino's Tokyo. Quickly finds out he's in over his head. Ends with the couch scene where he's in thought")

4. [Manga Spoilers](/s "Show how he overcomes this by constantly learning. Ends with the cookoff for the restaurant's newest dish. This could be even broken up into 2 episodes.")
>> ARTICLE
Even then, that doesn't account for [Manga Spoilers](/s "Erina and Megumi's development, which imo was pretty important")

>> ARTICLE
Her face when this happens... thats what I am hanging out for. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait for her image of his father to do a 180.  She's built up this completely inaccurate idea of what a chef should be based on a false impression of his father.  When she realizes that father and son frequently create horrible dishes just to mess with each other while experimenting she'll have a breakdown.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more of a "Bad food makes the good food better" kind of thing.
>> ARTICLE
It's experimentation.  How do you create something new?  
>> ARTICLE
That aswell, but even if it turns out bad they still seem to cherish it. (Souma and his peanut butter covered squid tentacles and one of the dishes his dad made for the polar star students) That's why I feel it goes further than just experimentation.
>> ARTICLE
There is still something wonderful about pushing both sides.

Kind of the "I can't believe normal ingredients could taste so good!" and "I can't believe normal ingredients could taste SO BAD!"
>> ARTICLE
"Oh shit this combination doesn't taste good... let's see how far I can take this lol"

KARAGE ARC HYPE
>> ARTICLE
Hail corporate!
>> ARTICLE
I WAS DECEIVED. 

I was told they wouldn't cover it so I read the manga ;( 

At least we will have Ikumi appearing next episode so that's a plus. 
>> ARTICLE
Im actually surprised they didn't skip, not that many epsiode left but still a ton of content to cover. The next arc is at least as big as the training camp if not more because of how many dishes get shown and new character get introduced...
>> ARTICLE
Season 2? Anyone? Hype? Another 24 episodes? Yes please? 
>> ARTICLE
That might'be been me last week, my apologies. To be fair, they did skip it and are coming back to it, I guess for pacing it makes a little more sense this way.
>> ARTICLE
> I was told they wouldn't cover it so I read the manga ;( 

Not much of a loss, really.
>> ARTICLE
She was in the preview, doesn't really need spoilering.
>> ARTICLE
edited. I almost never watch previews. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to think Soma's dad was only second seat because he fucked around in Shokugeki's so much like Fumio said. It'd kind of suck if Soma's been pursuing his dad his whole life trying to surpass him, and he's not even the best there is out there.
>> ARTICLE
I think that Soma's Dad **is** the best out there but didn't give a shit about the rankings. Him not pursuing the first seat doesn't necessary mean he couldn't have gotten it if he didn't fuck around in shokugeki's. After all Soma's dad didn't even finish his school years because he didn't care and rather explored the world than finishing school.
>> ARTICLE
They also said that if it weren't for Doujima, who broke all sorts of records, he would have easily been first seat. IIRC, the manga implied something along the lines that there was essentially such a huge gap in skill for their generation that the first and second seat were basically untouchable by everyone else.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention Doujima Gin and Saiba Jouichirou were close buddies. Not only did Jouichirou not really care about ranking, he also had no good reason to defeat Gin either.

Contrast Gin who was much more straight lace and would actually aim for the top.

Similarly in the current generation of Toutsuki, there are characters such as Souma, etc who are actively aiming to be the top, while there are other good chefs who, while wanting to be better, are not necessarily aiming to be the top, like Isshiki senpai (maybe)

I'm still not really digging the vocals for the ED.

New ED is close to giving me cancer. First time in anime the change has been this terrible. I wish JV could bring back ["Spice"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1pETyNUJV4).
>> ARTICLE
It can't beat Spice of course but I think it's quirky nice, especially if you know who's singing lol

I actually think it was sung a bit differently this time compared to last ep or I might be hearing things...
>> ARTICLE
I just mute the video as soon as the credits come up and play the 1st ED in the background. The two go surprisingly well together.
>> ARTICLE
Really? This ED has been my favorite musical choice for the show thus far, I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who likes the ED? I mean not as much as the previous one but this one has its charms.
>> ARTICLE
I listened to the full version as well...I thought that it might redeem itself there but I still disliked it. Seiko Oomori's vocals just aren't my cup of tea as I said before.

I'll give kudos to the arranger, Yoshiaki Dewa, for creating the nice instrumental backing though.
>> ARTICLE
I really like it. I like the imagery of the characters as they are walking and the pot at the end. I also strangely enjoy the song. When something that is loved get replaced, people will always shit on the replacement and act like its worse than it is.
>> ARTICLE
I also kinda like it. I think it puts a bad taste in everyone's mouth because of how amazing Spice was though. The chorus and final part where the cast is in a giant soup bowl is really catchy to me. I'd definitely give the full song a listen when it comes out.

People might brush it out, but having **490** loses against someone would ruin confidence. But if its your dad or relative it might be alright. Plus you need to have a very solid goal in mind to keep yourself motivated.
>> ARTICLE
> People might brush it out, but having 490 loses against someone would ruin confidence.

Not really. It's pretty normal actually. Anyone who grows up playing basketball or something against their dad gets their ass whooped countless times for years on years with no win ever in sight.
>> ARTICLE
Soma isn't exactly normal. He always sees challenge as a way to improve. He never gets intimidated by better chefs but instead challenges them head on so he can learn from them. Losing 490 matches against his own dad only helps him.  
>> ARTICLE
Well... we've seen him challenge a world class French chef already...
>> ARTICLE
It's like when I play my Dad at darts, we play for fun and it's a bonding/communicating experience- I've never beaten him after playing hundreds of matches but I've gotten much better in the process xD
>> ARTICLE
My dad is in his late sixties and has played both Shogi and Chess all his life. Some nights I wouldn't leave his room until he lets me play just one more game of chess with him out of frustration. I'd spend half a day playing chess with him in hopes of beating him and I've only really won once, but we both knew that he just let me win so I would go to sleep (it was well past midnight). I mean the guy would beat me even with handicaps like playing with no queen and I even spent countless amounts of researching Chess just to beat him. I would even do surprising moves like the Crab Opening in hopes of cheesing him.

Well, I'd say most of r/anime has probably subconsciously memorized what pictures move and what doesn't from the [comment face page](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/commentfaces) or from trial and error (since it's really usually the same gifs being used over and over).

Off topic: I wish people would use [**this**](#volibearQ) more instead of [**this**](#dekotableflip). The first one just looks like it has so much more impact.

So, this may be a stupid question, but Souma IS going to a top-of-the-line cooking school, right? Because so far, I don't think we've seen any actual teaching. It's just been one big contest of how much you knew before you came to the school. It seems weird that I haven't noticed that until now.
>> ARTICLE
Former culinary student here. We did lectures on food for one hour a day early on. Beyond our fourth semester we no longer had lectures but essentially everyday had ' here's this ingredient plate me a dish' and our final semester we just worked in restaurants that were assigned to us.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was explained somewhere that this cooking school ( also a "high school" ) is more considered are place to define your skills, achieving practical experience in nearly real scenarios, getting hired by alumni for example and mostly compete with each other to make yourself a name. Thats why the autumn election is such an essential part. So I guess thats why actual classes are reduced to a minimum here :)

>> ARTICLE
It's actually kinda weird how later in the manga you see them in the classroom or during PE. I think the mangaka also remembered that this was supposed to be a school is starting to add more school stuff in.

>> ARTICLE
Theyve been adding more normal school lecture stuff in later chapters but a lot of their high school learning is trial by fire based as well. The other guy that replied to you was also right though, much harder to get hyped on a lecture about caramelization.
>> ARTICLE
Cooking is not book learning. Home Ec in High School is 20% safety protocol and recipe, then 80% hands-on cooking.

Adult cooking school classes are similar: give and explain recipe for 20 minutes, then 1-2 hours of cooking.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's very true although SnS is a lot more intensive in the hands on portion, which I've heard from a few chefs is what's lacking in most cooking schools.

But do remember that this school is more than that as well. They do lectures on cooking theory which is also different from normal cooking schools.

No surprise that Joichiro won. He has like 25 more years of cooking experience compared to Souma. But both of their dishes looked delicious, especially that ramen. Plus we got to see best girl in her pajamas AND dressed as snow white.

So next week is the Karrage  Arc.  It felt like a filler in the manga, but it is still canon, since it introduces one major character that will be shown in the election. I don't mind the fact they switched it around. Now it's pretty clear where they are going to end this season off on.

This one is really good. I suggest trying it if you can cook at all.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for also posting the recipes.

I get the feeling the writer was unfair to Soma with this fight... He used simple, common ingredients, while his father used tempeh, a very unlikely ingredient to find in the kitchen of anyone not vegetarian. Sure, he can write whatever excuse for its presence in the kitchen he need for the situation, but I think it would have had more impact had Joichiro beaten his son with extremely simple and boring ingredients.

I'm also laughing a bit at Satoshi just hearing about vegetarian dashi as if it's a revelation. Most introductory japanese cooking ressources I've seen mention that a veggie dashi can be made by substituting the katsuoboshi with shitake. I suppose that this series has to have it, but there's a big disconnect between the informed intensity of the dishes on screen and their relative simplicity in real life.

Anyway, I might try the Apple Risotto. Looks delicious and easy to make in the morning.

Well... It's been a while since we had a foodgasm...  
It might actually be love after all, with Erina and Soma's dad...  

And uhh... Thank this anime for teaching me about something I've   eaten for a while... Lotus roots. Never knew the name of them, even   in Chinese >.> Kept forgetting their name in Chinese...  

Yeah.. Wasn't there talk about Soma's catchphrase? It was more   cocky in the manga, right? Did his dad use the same one as well?  
>> ARTICLE
This show is so much fun, loved the Prince of Apples scene. 

Wish I could have breakfasts like that, this series makes me so hungry and I've only just eaten.
>> ARTICLE
So the ending voice changed slightly... the way it fluctuates in this ending just sounds wrong, i was starting to like the ending too ;_; 
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad I'm not the only who noticed that ;-; it was weird that they didn't catch that. Maybe it was on purpose though to show Joichiro's quirkiness/less serious attitude towards anything?

Soma was thinking they were ... Hungry for Apples eh?

this was actually my favourite mini arc in the manga, where asura comes back and shows who's boss. too bad the anime will probably never get to the challenges after the big tourny where souma helps around to put it vaguely.

How about Yakitate Japan?
>> ARTICLE
well, in Koufuku Graffiti didnt actually compete in the "cooking anime" category. More like, it's just a guilty pleasure show that you'll watch only to get hungry. In the case of Shokugeki no Soma (and other cooking anime), it actually follows a main character who strives for a goal. I'm not surprised to hear that a lot didn't watch Koufuku.
>> ARTICLE
Koufuku what?
>> ARTICLE
Good episode, but one of the lesser exciting ones

Few things to say
* I wonder if the writer is a chef that came up with these recipes and actually wandered the world

* I wanted/expected Soma-kun to lose. It would've felt too early if he won and wouldn't have left as much for room for the plot

* this proves that they're both extremely creative

* the only reason soma lost was because of his lack of experience(outside the diner environment/outside of the country) 

* Joichiro told Soma not to lose until he faced him again. If this was carried out, the show would lose a lot of suspense. I want to see more high risk, high rewards battles.

* This episode further continues the mystery of Joichiro and Erina's relationship. 

* My guess is that they're father and daughter, but that would make Erina and Soma have an incest relationship if they decided to go together. Plus, this might cause a few plot holes. Please don't tell me if I'm right or wrong. 

Overall, this episode screams, "Feed me MORE!".

Soma's dad is totally gonna band Erina right..... well if they are in fact not related, people seem to think they are father and daughter..

To my surprise, the [](/s "karaage") arc is up next; I thought they were going to either skip it or put it in an OVA. Interesting how they decided to switch the order of the next arc with Joichiro's visit, but I won't complain. Look forward to some character development from [](/s "Nikumi.")
>> ARTICLE
actually it kinda make sense this way for me :D, also we only have like 7 episode or less [Manga spoiler](/s "(not to mention it need a whole episode just to introduce Hayama Akira and maybe Kurokiba)") for the entire autumn selection? :( a bit of a let down if this is true 
>> ARTICLE
I feel you could've switched the next arc and Joichiro's visit around, really.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah me too. I was fully expecting them to skip the entire thing and go straight into Autumn.

I'm glad they kept it though. The neighborhood is beautifully animated from what we've seen in the closer and the first episode so it is good that anime viewers get a closer insight to his hometown.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, i was really hoping Erina was gonna meet Joichiro. Hopefully that "erand" he has is talking to her grandfather, and they'll meet then.

The fact that Souma lost was to be expected. I do hope we're actually one day gonna see him beat his father, and that it's not just gonna take the usual shounen route, where they keep pushing it further away.

I find the fact that the shopping district has been deserted after Yukihira Diner closed hilarious! A really nice touch!
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what it is but I absolutely love the ED. Probably my favorite so far of the season. Been listening to the full song on repeat the past few days.
>> ARTICLE
What the hell, so they're planning to get to the Karaage Arc know instead of the Autumn Election ? 

[](#volibearQ)

This episode covered chapter 42 and chapter 43. Edit: Though some scenes differ (e.g. the conversation with sleepy Megumi and Souma). 

And the next few episodes will cover chapters 35-38. I don't know why it is out of order, but I don't really like it. The Karaage arc is the one I like the least and I was actually happy that it was skipped since we'd get more of the Autumn Election in that case, but my hopes were crushed. 

[](#barakamonnotcool)

[And here](http://imgur.com/a/ZLvQc) are all the Foodgasm from the previous ED ( Episode 1-14).
>> ARTICLE
I think my main complaint about the Karaage Arc is that there's no tension. He goes home to save the shopping district, and you know he's going to save the shopping district via cooking. All that's left is to watch it play out. There's a ton of characters introduced for the first time, who are never mentioned again. They spend a lot of time building up background story for a relatively unimportant arc.

I would of rather had another 2 episodes of the autumn election. Or something from the stagiaire period.
>> ARTICLE
the out of order actually makes more sense, as the manga went jouichiro>karaage>jouichiro

ED: i'm happy with this, as autumn election is by far the most tedious and way-too-long arc in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I'd rather have the anime focus more on the prelims of the Autumn Election to flesh out so many characters and present their cooking expertise.

And the sequel hook for season 2 is the Autumn Election main tournament and face-offs which will be so epic.
>> ARTICLE
Karaage Arc builds up the Autumn Elections since it introduces an enemy later one. It is more character building which i enjoy.

>> ARTICLE
It was great watching one of my favorite parts from the manga animated. I'm surprised they decided to switch the order of Souma's dad coming back and the Karaage arc. I feel like that move accomplished nothing. Originally, Souma went back home on his own whim but in the anime his dad tells him to go home. We definitely won't be seeing the end of the Autumn Election at this rate.
>> ARTICLE
i think we will see it, because [Spoiler](/s "we can see the start of the final in the intro. I guess they'll cut a bit of the matches between the not so relevant characters, so that 2-3 less important duels are one episode. Or they just mention how those end.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "That would seem a bit too rush at this rate, since the prelims will likely start at episode 19. Also, Subaru isn't even hinted at in the intro, leaving the possibility that season will end with his first appearance")


>> ARTICLE
you know what i just realised? these guys are at cooking school right? it takes place at a school... and i don't think i've seen them actually attend a class yet like, of any kind, seriously what the fuck?
>> ARTICLE
This anime is mostly about the cooking battles. The school stuff is mostly in the background.

The school itself has classes but mainly expects its students to do their own research and progress through cooking challenges.
>> ARTICLE
Besides they mentioned that they have classes and stuff in middle school. So this "high school" is for practical experience, defining your skills and competing with each other to make your name known. So nearly no classes needed
>> ARTICLE
Soma and megumi meet in class, then find out they live in the same dorm

Disappointed by the lack of Yukihira cooking anything in this episode, but I really like that he got a rival that seems like a true countpart to him. Great episode all in all, as ever my only complaint is that they end too quickly and I have to wait an entire week for each one!

This ended partway through chapter 17. This episode is slightly different in the manga, though. It starts in chapter 14 and skips a bunch of stuff in the chapters, I think to get to the cooking.

I also recommend the manga. It's great having something that gives off a really intense action-ey feel, despite it having nothing to do with action.

You must be reminded that this is a cooking manga.

Also, you know, dat Tosh artwork.

The best thing about this show is that I still look forward to watching it after catching up to the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed, it really is a great adaptation. It adds to the series things that a written medium cant have (the soundtrack is great and i have no complaints in regards to the VA choices) while also keeping intact what makes the manga so good. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode in particular showed a lot of the flair Yonetani brought to his previous shows. That two handled knife hand off was straight out of Gaogaigar.
>> ARTICLE
I think one must attribute the success of the adaption partially to the fact Shokugeki is its encapsulation of the cooking genre. The diverse character, competition, and recipe designs certainly contribute to the whole, but it's truly the process of bringing together ingredients, such as the sizzle of frying bacon, crunch of chopped onions, and the aroma of melting butter, that is timeless in evoking a full-bodied response.

Shokugeki captures that concept perfectly in the midst of it's plot, character development, and epic reveals.

Of all the human experiences people seek to share in fiction, I don't think any is more broadly appealing than the prepping and consuming of food. 

*Food is life~*

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this series turned out to be really long. Like 100+ episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Current pacing is at a solid 2 chapters per episode, we've got 118 chapters so far and [progression spoiler](/s "haven't even finished the first year yet").
>> ARTICLE
This episode started in chapter 14 and ended partway through 17 (it skipped a bunch of stuff), so the pacing isn't consistent.
>> ARTICLE
So we could get about 80 episodes with between season breaks before the anime catches up with the content.
>> ARTICLE
Not really unless something changes dramatically.

Right now were are somewhere in the chapter 15-20 range

The training camp ends at around chapter 35 but its very action pack so its going to take 4-5 episode. After that there is a small  [spoiler](/s "holiday arc ") that should last 1-2 episodes and bring us around chapter 40 which would in theory be ep 14-15.

Now lies the problem, the next arc in incredibly long lasting nearly 60 chapters and they cant really extend the camp or the second arc more without dragging them out to thin as they are already covering every detail from the source material.

With 9-10 episode left they could to cover only the first part of the [spoiler](/s "Autumn Election") which would bring us at chapter 60 (would be the best option IMO) or they could cover it entirely by skipping/speeding certain meals which would bring us in the 90s or the low 100(hope not). 

Even if they end it in the 60s range there still isnt enough content for another season for a full 24 after this one, at max we could get a 12 episode and end 1-2 chapter away from where the manga is right now. 

So unless something changes another season after this one is unlikely.
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm, we'll see. 

The show has been going at a consistent 2 chapters an episode rate. I mapped this out a few days ago, and literally the last panel of the chapter where the 24th episode should finish is right before the official beginning of the Autumn Election (aka, all of the build up to it where they select students should be in this season).

It would be fucking weird if they ended this on some giant cliff hanger before the big arc of the manga so far. And that was I think, Chapter 48 or something. The manga is at like 118 chapters now. The entire Election as you said goes on for like 60 chapters. I think there is way more than enough content for a second season.

This episode covered page 1 and 13-21 of chapter 14 ( 2-12 were covered in episode 6 ), chapter 15, chapter 16 and page 3-13 from chapter 17. There is no real difference from the mange this time either, except the part after the ED with Erina, I don't think it was in the manga.

For the dish in this episode there is no recipe available, but [here](http://imgur.com/a/1gjVG) are the previous recipes.

And the foodgasm in the ED is this episode from [Marui and Ibusaki](http://imgur.com/0xltiLY). And [here](http://imgur.com/a/dVDCz) are all the previous foodgasms.

Personally I kind of imagined Shinomiya to have the voice of Midorima from Kuroko no Basket, but I guess the current voice is good too.

And finally Best Girl contender [Inui](http://i.imgur.com/5UIxGme.jpg) ( picture from /u/kratoz0r ) appears, she's just plain awesome. :)

**Edit:** Well the dish made in this episode doesn't have an actual recipe, but there is another version of the same dish with different meat. [Here](http://imgur.com/3y5dvds) is the recipe.

Who is even saying that? [Spoilers](/s "Erina isn't even best girl in her family.")
>> ARTICLE
Megumi is such a best girl. She even has a harem forming, though it is almost entirely Inui.
>> ARTICLE
>  Erina is best girl

Erinas a shit
>> ARTICLE
Erina doesn't get much development until later. For now she is just a  spoiled "queen" type of character.
>> ARTICLE
I havent caught up with the book but last time i checked still farther in she still doesnt get any better
>> ARTICLE
She is opening up more and more lately. I think in the manga we can soon expect some character development since the elite ten are gonna play a major role in the arc IIRC.
>> ARTICLE
We get a lot more "good" moments out of her (the moments she drops the act are so damn cute), but fundamentally she hasn't changed a bit since we first met her.

[For under 1000 students..](http://cdn.awwni.me/qb11.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
I counted 15 busses a row, with 5 rows. That's 75 busses. About 14 students per bus. 
>> ARTICLE
you must count the staffs in also. So around 20 per bus.
>> ARTICLE
Too much staff, I'd say that it's closer to 15, and no more than 17 max. It's shown later that a lot of the high ranking people had their own ride too.
>> ARTICLE
This anime is actually surprisingly really good. Love the humor, but also the angle they've taken to the "special abilities" to cooking similar to the flux of sports anime/manga that have been created. 
>> ARTICLE
It'll only get better.
>> ARTICLE
I already like Inui. Though I doubt we'll see her again after this :P  

How the hell did everyone miss ducks and all the other animals?! :D  
>> ARTICLE
it seems just like the instructor said, everyone got tunnel visioned on creating a Japanese cuisine, and plus unless you know how, it is exceedingly hard to catch a duck, rabbit or really any land based mammal.
>> ARTICLE
The tunnelvision is real under pressure. Ever had an important exam or a test where you get asked a certain question that is seemingly simple, and you've convinced yourself that "this is the right answer", only to facepalm afterwards because you realize that you narrowed down your thoughts too much?
>> ARTICLE
Its true, I had a final exam where I couldn't answer a question practically because I couldn't figure out that 4=2X2.

Is no one going to comment on the best anime ass, Isshiki-senpai?

I live for his shots.
>> ARTICLE
Best show in this season so far.
>> ARTICLE
If Yukihira doesn't end up with Tadokoro but instead with Nakiri... I'm going to be mad. Very mad. 
>> ARTICLE
The one shot kind of implies who the best girl will be
>> ARTICLE
Well if he ends up with Nakiri [Spoilers](/s "Alice, I'd be pretty happy")
>> ARTICLE
Well the foreshadowing in the second episode and chapter zero of the manga pretty much implied that ErinaxSoma will be the final ship that stands. Could be wrong though. Maybe they will just remain rivals. But given that she's the most popular female character, I certainly think that the author will introduce some romantic development between her and Soma 
>> ARTICLE
Yukihira ain't got time for womens. Yuikihira got cookin' to do.
>> ARTICLE
resort arc! time to introduce some more amazing characters
>> ARTICLE
I hoped they would do a good job by introduce all those new characters but they exceeded my expectations again. So excited for whats still to come
>> ARTICLE
Start of training camp arc!! Yay
This episode started from the middle of chapter 14(volume 2).
Wow! Great episode! I like how the introductions of the alumni and the Aldini brothers were done. The anime even added many small details that added very much to the scenes.

The only scenes not in anime was the flashblack to the Aldini brothers in Italy, which will probably be shown sooner or later...

The eyecatch is the cover page of chapter 15.
The omake after the preview is from page 26 of volume 3, but the anime also added Isami.

Episode 9 will start from the middle of chapter 17.
>> ARTICLE
Finally, the camp retreat arc starts. This is what captures the manga readers when the story delivers new challenges, epic rivals, and Souma n' friends taking all these things head on.

We've met the Aldini and the Alumni who all got proper VA's to match the characters. I hope people are feeling the hype for the hype and hunger for next weeks episode.
>> ARTICLE
The Italian was good, and I didn't remember so much words lol It's cool seeing something about Italy sometimes.  
Ps: it's "forno accensione", not "accendere".
>> ARTICLE
At this pace, I feel this show is going to running for a long long time
>> ARTICLE
Good!
>> ARTICLE
Huh.. I didn't know that [Shokugeki no Soma](http://shokugekinosoma.wikia.com/wiki/Kojir%C5%8D_Shinomiya) was in the same universe as [Bleach.](http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Szayelaporro_Granz) 
>> ARTICLE
TAKUMIIIIIII!!!! KYAAAAA!!!! *fangaying intensifies*
>> ARTICLE
Love hinako and her moment with megumi

hinako a fucking best
>> ARTICLE
I love this series way too much; one episode per week is the least satisfying thing ever.
>> ARTICLE
holyyyy, cant wait for next episode, need more Soma in action!
>> ARTICLE
Woohoo, best teachers Shinomiya and Hinako are finally here! And the Aldini brothers, who are cool too.

Also, another glimpse of both best girl AND best guy, though only a very brief moment.
>> ARTICLE
Is the manga still going on or is it finished? I really want more of this, thinking about reading it
>> ARTICLE
its still ongoing...it currently at chapter 118
>> ARTICLE
Still going on and it will be for a long, long time if they keep up this pace. And it's amazing, some of the best characters haven't even been introduced yet in the anime and probably won't be this season.

So I'd say go ahead and pick it up. 
>> ARTICLE
Normally I skip Intros in my shows. But not this one! Too goood.

This camp should be a piece of ~~cake~~ meat for Nikumi! I was hoping we'd finally get to see the other Polar Star students in some cooking duels...maybe next time!

Alice cameo! Im happy!

HER SECOND APPEARANCE!
>> ARTICLE
HYPE FOR THE EGGS!!!
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I can't watch this show without eating something. The food looks so good. 

Also, this show does cliffhangers really well. I find myself always wanting more every week (another show that did this really well was Nanatsu no Taizai last season). I really want to see what Soma comes up with next week.
>> ARTICLE
I had no problem with the episode but it was very "tranistiony." There wasn't any really exciting plot going on despite the true introduction of Soma's rival and the beginning of Hell Camp. 

Hope to see Soma kick some ass in the next episode!
>> ARTICLE
Well, we got Pavarotti in a duck suit this episode. I - I really don't know what to say.  
And it looks like Souma finally has a rival that's actually a match for him! Should be interesting to see how this plays out.
>> ARTICLE
Hinako hype! She's so great in the manga. Now let's see what the animation does with her!
>> ARTICLE
I stopped at the chapter where Souma defeated Nikumi more than a year ago and haven't continued coz of... well, other manga. But I haven't regretted it one bit. Since the difference is too great that it actually makes the ride in watching the anime without prior knowledge much more fun, adding all the suspense. (But I can still hell predict that Souma will still win this "judgment contest".)
>> ARTICLE
This is the first episode of Shokegeki wherein I don't have prior knowledge from the manga. And, boy, it's more enjoyable and thrilling. It may just be my unpopular opinion, but I recommend NOT reading the manga for anime-watchers only until the anime ends. I know the feeling of both a manga reader and an anime-only viewer of this show, since I've already felt both in watching Shokugeki.
>> ARTICLE
I ended up binge reading all of the manga, now I gotta wait for manga releases too <.<

The manga is great and just gets better and better the further it goes!

It's a Japanese superstition.   I think it's moderately well known, I know I'd seen it in at least one anime before this one.  Basically, if you're anxious or nervous you write the kanji for man on your hand 3 times then "swallow" or "drink" it.  This is supposed to relax you.  It's similar to the American thought that imagining your audience in their underwear before public speaking can help you calm down.

I mean, Scandanavia is in Europe.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but we really like to differentiate ourselves.
>> ARTICLE
how to find a Scandinavian 101.
>> ARTICLE
Back in the day, the people from your part of the world did a lot of that "differentiating" all around Europe, in fairness. =P

I live in Ireland, and my surname is of Norman origin, which also technically makes me a slight Scandinavian descendant. The Scandinavian bloodlines got around due to the Vikings sailing, conquering and setting up villages all over the place.
>> ARTICLE
I'm talking things like Denmark not being a full-fleshed member of the EU. We have special rules that apply only to us, like not being part of the unified currency. In short, we wanna be part Europe, just not too much.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, I guess. Still though, "European" doesn't really just mean the EU. The UK has the same story as Denmark, but you wouldn't exactly refrain from calling their countries European, would you? I call anyone in Europe "European". It's not an identity thing, it's just a fact.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly have to think very hard to remember anyone over here who refers to the UK as European contries. In out head they're just the UK. I even tend to forget that they part of Europe.
>> ARTICLE
I just couldn't remember where in Europe so I said European.
>> ARTICLE
Oh okay. Sorry for bothering you then.
>> ARTICLE
^ found the canadian sympathizer
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but do you think Japanese care?  Especially when you consider how often the West just lumps "Asian" together.

That's true. I guess I didn't really think of it that way. Thank you for the different perspective.

This show. There is like no true villains, all of em are just having fun trying to crawl over each others corpses to graduate Hana. I love how Aldini is essentially Gai and Soma is Kakashi. He has an idea that they are competing, but really he has no fucking idea at all (or care).

Don't forget to watch the small scene after the credits, it really sets the mood for the next episode.

A few episodes later I'm pretty sure the credits are going to play after like 10 minutes with the rest being the other half of the episode.
>> ARTICLE
Early morning egg challenge!!! One of my favorite challenges from the show. It introduces some more characters such as albino girl and lost his balls-san while creating a unique challenge that lets us see a variety of dishes that speak about the large number of chefs we get to see featured in the show/manga. As we all could see, Souma is struggling in the challenge as well as new albino girl. Shit will be going down next episode.

Also gotta say, the Erina foodgasm near the end, FANTASTIC. Watching that, I got the uncommon feeling of chills that I get when a scene from a show just does something awesome. The  anime depiction of our food queen in gold with her Egg Benedict was genius.

And recently the cliffhangers are getting to me I need to know how it turns out in the latest chapters but NOPE I have to wait till next Monday

/rant
>> ARTICLE
the new chapters come out on saturday, the raws come out on friday

>> ARTICLE
Really? I've been reading Casanova scans and they come out on Monday
>> ARTICLE
The only reason Casanova does this is because the viz official translation comes out on Monday and I think it's unspoken courtesy rule for some scanlators to release when the official English translation comes out.

I like how Tadokoro said "Shut up" in a polite way at the beginning of this episode. Even when being a delinquent she's kind...

Oh shit Megumi getting so good she's starting to get marriage proposals tossed at her!! Also can't wait to see how Soma can make a comeback.

> arly morning egg challenge!!! One of my favorite challenges from the show. It introduces some more characters such as albino girl and lost his balls-san while creating a unique challenge that lets us see a variety of dishes that speak about the large number of chefs we get to see featured in the show/manga. As we all could see, Souma is struggling in the challenge as well as new albino girl. Shit will be going down next episode.
> Also gotta say, the Erina foodgasm near the end, FANTASTIC. Watching that, I got the uncommon feeling of chills that I get when a scene from a show just does something awesome. The anime depiction of our food queen in gold with her Egg Benedict was genius.

What chapter is today's episode is? I can't contain anymore the excitement about this anime... need to read its manga. Thanks, rottingunicorn-sama

Uhm, could you tell me what Chapter it is? Want to read a little bit ahead

I remember when Alice was first introduced into the manga. I was like who is this alluring seductress. Thanks for posting these comparisons.
>> ARTICLE
Alice looks more mature in the manga than in the anime. They are 15/16 year olds though so the anime makes it more fitting I guess.
>> ARTICLE
the eyes in the manga are drawn much more expressively than in the anime. I personally like nakiri's eyes in the manga better than the anime since you can feel like she's looking down on everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Dat street fighter doe 
>> ARTICLE
I like the new albino chick, i guess she will be part of the final harem. 

And now we wait till Souma gets his mojo back. 
>> ARTICLE
> I like the new albino chick, i guess she will be part of the final harem. 

heh
>> ARTICLE
Maybe if Soma is lucky he can join HER harem. 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone wanna take a guess as to what Soma did wrong?

Erina and Alice figured it out with one look.

[Here's the answer if you wish to know:](/s "Soma's dish is a souffl. Souffls are only good when they're fresh and immediately served. In this buffet-style test, dishes are left sitting for an undetermined amount of time until a guest actually eats it. Soma has failed to account for this obvious factor that the rest of the characters understood.")
>> ARTICLE
Seemed like a harmless spoiler so I looked.  Makes perfect sense, it's nice to see him actually struggle and it makes sense since he's never encountered a situation like this.
>> ARTICLE
I assume it's because it's a difficult dish to mass-produce?
>> ARTICLE
My guess is it had to do with the texture. It isn't some thing people can visually see which is how people pick what item they want and a buffet. Appearance is what would mattered more then taste in this case.
>> ARTICLE
If I had to guess. Soma made a dish for the high-class members who would go to the resort, he didn't think he'd be serving the people who WORK at the resort. Because of that he made a dish that isn't kid friendly, doesn't stand out and requires you to taste it to see it's potential. 

I only think of this because of Soma's flash back about what his dad said about serving the people who would come to a diner, so it would only be logical Soma would think about people who could spend over 55 000 yen a day or similar.

EDIT: well, I apparently was way off, carry on.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah gotta agree, he put emphasis on the Luxury part of the hotel. The variety of the judges/eaters for this challenge was huge. Kids, parents, old and young, staff/employee. I bet if he stuck with the dashimaki and the scrambled eggs + some more flavor tweaking he might have done well.

I'm loving the fact that the MC has his weaknesses/shortcomings. At first I really thought he'd be one of those unbeatable MC like a lot of currently and past airing shows. So refreshing.
>> ARTICLE
No, you were on the right track. [](/s "Soma's dad said people come to a diner to eat diner food. In this situation, people came to a buffet to eat buffet food... which Soma doesn't have.")
>> ARTICLE
Unless you've read the manga or you have some above-average knowledge of cooking with eggs (specifically souffles which is the dish Soma made) it would be very difficult to figure out what was wrong with Soma's dish.
>> ARTICLE
And there are other people in this thread casually spoiling the reason without using spoiler tags. Jeez if you never read the manga, you can't fucking enter this thread without getting spoiled about everything that happens in the next 100 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Well straight away i guessed an omelette was not gonna work as i know personally i would not want to eat one that has sitting around a while. But i may just be fussy. /u/vetro sums it up well in the spoiler tag.
>> ARTICLE
an omelet could work, if you practice you can make them really [fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9B22Ii7-eE). Evidently that guy made 400 some-odd in 30 minutes for the world record. I'm betting Soma can knock out 200 in an hour or so. 

also omelet bars are pretty common in buffets 
>> ARTICLE
Man, that Fist of the North Star shoutout came out of nowhere, I spit my tea out when I saw it.

There are so many strange references throughout the show. We may not see it animated in this season, but  [spoiler](/s "There is even a Jojo's Bizarre adventure stand battle at one point in the manga")

I just realized how much I like the design of the Yukihira-shirt. A shirt you can actually wear in public and not get weird look from people. I need to get my hands on one.
>> ARTICLE
Alice faces are slightly disappointing in terms of cuteness. :c only slightly though. Her introduction was different from manga, unless I forgot that first scene. 

All the other art style shifts are pulled off really well. The breakfasts look good too. The only dish that I have some questions about is Takumi's. Salad and egg... texture-wise, that's interesting. Then again, diced eggs go into some salads anyway, so I might just be focusing too much on the egg part.
>> ARTICLE
Also, frittatas tend to have a sturdier texture then other egg dishes. There's another Italian dish where they put pieces of the bread in the salad so I guess this is kind of like that?
>> ARTICLE
That was how it was in the manga

Pretty much every mentioning of a souffle on TV (Some anime I forget, one episode of Arthur/Cyberchase iirc) involves them falling flat. Mhm. 
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Souma even wondered what exactly a buffet was :p
>> ARTICLE
A great episode. The best thing about is that they showed a lot of the main student chefs and their interactions with each other. That's about my favorite part in this episode.

I think the Shokugeki with Shinomiya has thrown Souma off a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Finally [Slight Spoiler](/s "Alice") makes her debut..the funnier and more enjoyable of the [Slight Spoiler](/s "Nakiris") imo

I don't get why Erina seems to hate Soma so much..is it just a pride thing?

Soma makes a big mistake but always pulls some kind of awesome shit in these kind of situations. I can't wait for Erina's reaction when he does. I just want to see her ego to take a hit.
>> ARTICLE
Please put a spoiler tag on the surname.

She hasn't introduced herself yet.
>> ARTICLE
Whoops. Done.
>> ARTICLE
It's a pride thing, but also it's because Souma is totally unfazed by her status and is virtually immune to sarcasm and taunts, so she devolves into hissy fits around him. To my knowledge she only acts that way around one other character (and they just introduced her).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its a pride thing. It basically stems from how he acted towards her at the entrance exam
>> ARTICLE
Well souffles are an absolute bitch to make, let alone 200 servings to be served buffet style within a couple of hours. Quite the challenge Soma has set himself, I wonder if he'll have to change his dish during the test.

Megumi's dish looked like a perfect light breakfast, the other dishes shown paled in comparison (in my opinion).
>> ARTICLE
Since I couldn't make it to last weeks discussion, I will mention the chapters the last episode covered here.

Last weeks episode covered chapter 25-27, this episode covered chapter 28-30 and page 1-6 of chapter 31.

If the pace stays the same the anime will probably end at chapter 62 which is [Big spoiler](/s "Souma vs Alice in the Autumn Election"). I guess it would make for a pretty "good" cliffhanger. :D


As for the recipes. I finally have Volume 1-5 of the manga ( up to chapter 39/episode 16 ) and I'm planning to scan, or at least take a picture of, all the recipes in it, which include Megumis Terine and several of the dishes made in this episode and more, and post them some time soon. 


As for this weeks Foodgasm in the ED, it's from [Aoki and Satou](http://imgur.com/yJJQXc1) and [here](http://imgur.com/a/no8Mz) are the previous ones.


And [those](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ln3sg0wPalw/UcRQqAm2m5I/AAAAAAAAVh8/xYnD07NUXS4/17.png?imgmax=30000) manga [pages](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DQd2wDkvN6g/Uc5VEfT7YnI/AAAAAAAAzKg/a47L3J5GA3k/016.png?imgmax=30000) are to [commemorate](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rq2IDunBwLo/Uc5VEiL0pgI/AAAAAAAAzKo/OvyQuF-T5n0/017.png?imgmax=30000) the appearance of [Kurokiba](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/shokugekinosoma/images/7/76/Ryo_Kurokiba_profile.png/revision/latest?cb=20141010210253)

Also, hard boiled Megumi is pretty great too.
>> ARTICLE
*sort of cheated cuz I read the Manga ahead of time*

I like the fact that the show used the idea of eggs as a key ingredient.  Eggs are often considered the "ultimate" ingredient because of how incredibly common egg usage is everywhere and how cheap it is to get.  It is either a great primary ingredient or a secondary ingredient but due to the school's standards in cooking, you wonder "how will the characters use these eggs creatively?  There's only a million ways to use eggs!"

Also Fist of The North Star reference gives it 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Eggs are also used because there is a lot of difficult technique involved in most egg dishes, and it's actually hard to cook them perfectly, so it's a good test of a chefs skill. Plus they're delicious!
>> ARTICLE
This episode proves it.
Megumi = Best Wife Material
I swear if she ended up cooking a meal for a royal family, she'd be engaged to the prince within the week.
>> ARTICLE
Those poor chickens, all the eggs :(
>> ARTICLE
Eggs served to people are usually unfertilized, so there's no forming chicken in those eggs.  

Fun fact about fertilized eggs served to people: some southeast Asian cultures have a belief that men eating fertilized eggs (ones with chicks inside) has a "Vaseline effect" on men.
>> ARTICLE
I know, but it's still a shit ton of eggs that those chickens made
>> ARTICLE
They were going to make them anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
maybe there were a shit ton of chickens and they only made one each
>> ARTICLE
I bet Takumi's VA loves eggs. First we got Inaho (Aldnoah.Zero), then we got Kousei (Shigatsu wa kimi no Uso), and finally this episode we see italian-kun using eggs.
>> ARTICLE
I still can't believe, that I'm watching an anime about cooking... even 13 episodes in it still sounds weird... but it's even more ridiculous how much fun I have watching people orgasm over food :D

I never read the manga and before the season I just read the synopsis and thought "Never gonna watch it!". And now I'm sitting here every friday, waiting in joy... xD

This show is just absolutely top notch at the over-the-top comedy bits.

>Eggs Benedict-sama

[](#ehehehe)

> Metamorphosis

Based on the title for next week's episode, I'm guessing Soma modifies his dish (or just thinks of something new) to make it fit the task and squeaks through somehow.
>> ARTICLE
Soma is falling behind?! How?!
>> ARTICLE
Because Souma is not almighty- even though he is an Shounen- Hero doesnt mean he is the best Cook at Totsuki- there are the Alumni, the Elite Ten, heck, even in his Grade there are Students that are on the same/higher Level than him.

This is so true. He might have seemed a lot like a typical shounen MC that can't lose, and a lot of people have complained about this, but he really can.

What is it with characters always underestimating the main character in anime it gets so tiresome after a while

He *does* act like an idiot most of the time, so people underestimating him isn't that weird. 
>> ARTICLE
Another excellent episode. I love how this anime expands so well on the original scenes from the manga. 

Isshiki's opening scene was even better than the manga. Neaderthal Ibusaki in particular made my sides hurt.

Souma trolling Erina about the 2nd episode was a nice extra touch. And I especially loved Erina and Hisako's scene together- Erina the bad loser is so cute it hurts.

And one of my favorite characters makes her debut. And the poor anime-only folks just have no clue the amazingness they are in for.

Excellent cliffhanger ending. So looking forward to the Crowning Moment of Awesome incoming.

Anyone got any ideas of why Somas fluffy omelette failed hard?

This is my favorite challenge of this arc, so nice to see it animated finally. It's the first time you really see why Erina is in the Elite 10. Also, her sore losing chibi is adorable, which is good, because her normal imperious act is unattractive. But that's what makes Souma undercutting her attitude funny. (Though, let's face it, Souma's not exactly Mr. Humble himself.)

I absolutely loved this part of the camp challenges so it's nice to see it animated. So happy that we have another 11 episodes of this and considering how big the manga is in Japan, there's a good chance the home releases will do well and we'll get a second season.

This series hasn't had anywhere near a weak episode yet and judging by the manga, it can only get better! It's nice seeing more new faces now too (everyone looks so good!), I can't praise J.C.Staff enough for bringing Food Wars! to life so well. These cliffhangers are great and leave me wanting more, despite being further ahead in the manga and knowing what's going to happen next.

Classic restaurant industry mistake.  Serve a breakfast/brunch dish with a high cook/prep time and it totally fucks all of your tickets.  It's great to see Yukihira portrayed as mortal.

God I love this show. It just knows how to be entertaining. I'm looking forward to seeing this new girl in action, and to see how Souma recovers from his situation.

Here's my question why hasn't soma been given a totsuki uniform he still wears his old one. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing you can wear anything you like in the kitchen as long as shit doesn't go to the food.

Takumi is wearing the Aldini Restaurant uniform( He shows the patch when him and souma met)

Nikumi is wearing shorts and a bra only

and that Chinese Cuisine lady with purple hair shown in the episode wearing a Qi Pao(?)
>> ARTICLE
I'm a little disappointed they don't explain the little cheeky things in the anime like they do in the Mange, for example when Megumi was the delinquent in the dream, she still said Desu- which is a polite way to speak because she is in fact still Megumi.
>> ARTICLE
That's not a manga/anime difference, it's just translator preference. Officials subs/translations don't do TL notes as a general rule, and there isn't really much of a need to point out every instance of Megumi's accent, or say "there's a Japanese cultural joke here!"

The one difference is that in the manga you can't keep the desu in the text without it sounding awkward, whereas in the anime you can still hear her say it, but I'm pretty sure VIZ didn't have a note in their translation of the chapter regardless.

Eggs Benedict is not done with side bacon
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I'm glad that I wasn't the only one annoyed by this. I kept muttering that they were using the wrong kind of bacon in this episode. 

And I understand why they did it. It might be a translation mistake or a cultural thing. Eggs Benedict is traditionally done with Canadian bacon, which is kind of similar to a slice of ham. But to someone from East/Southeast Asian culture, they might just hear "bacon" and make that assumption. (My family is from the Philippines, so things like this happen a lot. Like, I think the whole thing where people there think hot dog is a breakfast food comes from them seeing sausage being eaten for breakfast in the U.S.)

I was so genuinely terrified that Megumi wouldn't make it, even though I knew she would because she's practically a main character.

Not like you wouldnt expect them anyway. But I think if the op at least didnt show Hayama in the way that they did, you could put him in the category with Nao and Hojo as "really cool characters who are just introduced for the time being" and wonder if he would really pass

It's probably going to end right after we get the judging for Souma, and the top 8 are locked in.

It's going to end at the very end of prelims. Finals is pretty long so they won't be able to do any of it.

I'm pretty sure the Finals alone take up a half of all the current chapters of the manga.

I think it's a solid 30 or 40 chapters so not half but still a large majority.

There's no way they cannot have a 2nd season, this season was great. It'd be a shame to waste the rest of the source material.

How do they decide if they want to create a 2nd season? Ratings? And if so, how have the ratings been?

How far away is the anime from catching up?

I don't know how to spoiler so I can't say exactly, but I can tell you there a still a couple events before the anime even gets into the same part as the manga.

to put it into perspective, the preliminaries end at chapter 59 in the manga, and there are ~130 chapters at the moment, so there is more than enough for another 24 episodes (not to mention we're going to get more chapters by the time the second season is made)

But they can always leave gaps to space it out.

I'm curious, are any professional cooks that are watching this here? If so, how do you feel when watching this? Are the dishes actually as amazing as they seem and us non-chefs think they are? Or do you feel the same way actual nerds feel when watching BB Theory?
>> ARTICLE
Some of the cuisine is inspired by actual dishes made famous by Top Chefs in the real world. A few examples;

- Soma's souffle omelette is inspired by Jean Imbert's famous Omelette.
- Alice's cooking style is fairly common now in a lot of fine dining, it was revolutionized by Chef Ferran Adria and his restaurant El Bulli.
>> ARTICLE
I had something similar to the monkfish dish, can confirm, was amazing
>> ARTICLE
You might already know this since it's been posted everywhere in these threads, but the manga volumes contain recipes to most of the things that get cooked. If you look at those recipes, what probably jumps right at you is how simple they are, both in terms of ingredients used and amount of preparation required. And if you actually follow the instructions to a T.... well they're nice but not clothing-removing orgsmically good. For example, I tried making the Chaplin steak since it's essentially a slab of steak and tons of raw onions... well it's essentially impossible to tenderize the steak to a point where the meat simply breaks up when you pull a chopstick across it lol. 
>> ARTICLE
I've also cooked the chalyapin steak a few times since that episode with mixed success. The last time went pretty well and got the meat pretty tender but nowhere near the levels they would have us believe through the anime. Not sure how to stop the onion from becoming too overbearing though, as you do use a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah there's no way that you can take a sirloin steak and make it almost as tender as slow-cooked BBQ brisket in an hour or two. Even though onions are used pretty liberally in a conventional gyudon, the amount used to make this steak is pretty ridiculous indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Well to my knowledge the author works together with a highly rated chef. Together they think of dishes that fit each characters speciality and have some "kick" in it. 
Aside from the usual anime exaggeration I think those are actually that amazing
>> ARTICLE
Not a pro chef, but I do cook and do have knowledge in the cooking industry.  

The show does show a lot of research in subjects on the food, and it shows in places.  Not just in the cooking, but in the cooking society.  Like, if you take a moment and evaluate each scene, then the scene shows a lot of moments that make sense.

For example: the Training Camp challenges.  In Hinako's challenge, because Hinako mentions a Japanese theme, the students end up looking for all the fish and the mountain vegetables.  It makes sense, because in Washoku, or traditional Japanese cooking, combining mountain ingredients, such as vegetables, ocean ingredients such as fish, is a basic in preparation of traditional food.

The scenes where the French people are racist to Shinomiya and sexist against Hojo are also real.  The French cooking industry is one of the most racist industries in the world, where if you aren't French, or at the very least white enough, the likelihood of any good chef accepting you into a job is really slim.  And the cooking industry has a lot of things against women too.

And in the Buffet challenge, the reason why eggs are used as the theme despite them being a "universal ingredient" is that eggs are a VERY non-buffet friendly food.  The buffet serving style would get the eggs to catch a lot of moisture and ruin the flavors.

They also didn't do any of the annoying food stereotypes such as "The perfect curry powder spice" during the autumn preliminaries, because curry powder contains different spices for different dishes.  

So props to Shokugeki No Soma for that!

However, in terms of cooking...  I think some of the recipes are easy to do, while some of the others are not. 

 
>> ARTICLE
Even if I already read it in another thread, as a french, your point on French chefs makes me depresses me a bit
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong:  I LOVE French cooking.  I thought that a French duck dish I shared with my cousin in Paris was one of the best things I ever had in my life.

However, some anvils need to be dropped.
>> ARTICLE
From commentary in /r/ShokugekiNoSoma it seems that the culinary techniques Alice uses are outdated, at least. A (former? not sure) professional cook has made some recipes and they turned out pretty well, though and special things (Soma's egg rice surprise, the fake roast pork) don't look nearly as good in person.

As a dabbler in random cooking experiments, I think that a lot of the recipes are either impractical in terms of ingredients/prep or simpler than they make it seem. 

All their talk about umami (technically a meaty sort of taste) is pretty spot-on though. I can make [fish paste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surimi) by getting wheat gluten from flour, mixing seasonings into it, and then marinating with a mix of Marmite, sugar, garlic powder, soy sauce, and a little bit of other assorted spices. 
>> ARTICLE
In all fairness though, Alice's Molecular Gastronomy cooking has ALWAYS been impractical, in my opinion.  The problem with Molecular Gastronomy is that it hasn't really found its place in the cooking industry, and the fact that some of the equipment molecular gastronomy uses are expensive.    
>> ARTICLE
It's not impractical at all, at least not at its roots. That's like saying cooking is impractical because you need high end knives and utensils. Yes, those things can be beneficial depending on what it is you want to do, but they aren't necessary to cook good food.

Molecular gastronomy is simply about approaching the process from a scientific perspective rather than an artistic one, being able to understand and explain the processes in detail, or the interaction of ingredients and their flavours in order to achieve the desired or ideal result in terms of flavour, texture or other quality.

Many of the (what you can call) discoveries of molecular gastronomy can be applied in a perfectly normal domestic or professional setup.

As an example, some of the basic things to come out of the concept are investigating what you would consider age old rules of thumb and whether or not they actually hold water; things like "sear meat to keep the juices in" etc. These are the kind of things you still hear being handed down, both from amateurs and professionals, but aren't necessarily true. MG is just a way to find out "what *exactly* about process X gets us to result Y" so that you can apply that knowledge on a wider spectrum. It is literally a scientific approach applied to what we would traditionally consider more of an art.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck ALL those 1st year Megumi doubters. Except Hojo. She good she good
>> ARTICLE
Ironically, while the anime almost cemented Megumi's status as the best girl, the latest chapter of the manga raised so many flags for Erina shippers enough to make them wet their pants. Next weeks chapter will make or break the ship.
>> ARTICLE
You've been duped, dude. You're actually talking to a HUGE Erina supporter right now. I've seen the latest raws of that chapter and can confirm that this marks the beginning of a OTP. ^Pls

But don't worry, even hardcore Megumi fans are welcome under the banner of the Nakiri flagship

[Welcome](#urbansmile)
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, she started from the bottom/seen as one of the worst cooks in the school and now is top 8 in her class. What if she ends up being the most talented/secret op? What if she ends up taking the number 1 seat? Souma just needs keep helping her with those confidence issues and the sky is the limit. I also enjoyed how her mom wanted her to see the world. Very similar to Souma and his dad. Souma and Megumi travel the world sequel.... Anyways yay Megumi.

Sad for Yuki though. She had great faces at the beginning of the episode. 
>> ARTICLE
[manga spoiler/speculation](/s "Based on Senzaemon's fundoshi falling off she's gonna be one of the highest for sure")
>> ARTICLE
Just a prediction but I think that Souma will be 1st seat (after being 2nd seat to Erina for the longest time), Erina will be 2nd seat, Alice will be 3rd, Megumi will be 4th, 5th would be between Ryo and Akira with the other bein 6th, 7th would be Isami, 8th would be Takumi and 9th and 10th would be 2nd years yet to be introduced. This is by the end of their 3rd year and I hope that the manga will continue for that long.
>> ARTICLE
 the top 10 can't come from only 1 grade that would be unfair to those younger and older to them. 
>> ARTICLE
Read the last line. I said that this is by the end of their 3rd year. I also said that I predict that 9th and 10th seat would be to 2nd years. I think Erina being in the top 10 as a first year is a first for the school as well though I'm not sure on that one.
>> ARTICLE
Soma will not end in first place, for the same reason his father didn't - he will goof too much and try things that are too wacky.
>> ARTICLE
It's a shounen. The main character has to "win" in the end. Souma's Dad's situation hasn't even been fully explained so saying that he was the 2nd seat because he was goofing around isn't really fair. He left before graduating to improve his cooking. Maybe Doujima was just some godly once in a century chef that Souma's Dad couldn't beat. I think it was actually kinda addressed in the manga but that was a long time ago (if it actually exists) so I dont have a good memory of it.
>> ARTICLE
It was already stated in thr manga. Souma's dad was too busy trying out new mixes on shokugekis with no prior trial  that he kept losing a bunch and that held back his rank on second. Fumio says as much when soumadad visita the dorm room.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, While that list isn't bad, Ryo would never be that low, I'm sorry to say but he'd be above or below Erina. Akira would probably be above or below Alice as well. Something I'd like to say though, who knows if Erina is even that good, I mean she has her taste, but we've never seen anybody experience her cooking. I imagine her cooking to only be slightly better than Alice's if not the same.
>> ARTICLE
You say that with a sense of authority but both the show and the manga haven't showed anything close to Ryo being in a similar level to Erina. Afterall, Erina is the 10th seat and has been insinuated to be the most talented out of the first years (thus likely to be the 1st seat eventually). I predict Alice to end as the 3rd seat because her whole shtick is Molecular Gastronomy and the mangaka hypes it up as the future so she'd be very highly ranked for propaganda(?)'s sake. I put Akira where he is because he seems to be the most likely to be a researcher to follow Jun's footsteps. As the rankings are based (I believe) on Shoukugeki results, Akira would have a lower ranking than he should do because he doesn't have much time for Shoukugekis compared to everyone else. 
>> ARTICLE
How dare you forget about Hisako!!! I'm excited to see how good Ryou is. It would be interesting to see him match and possibly surpass Alice. It would bring about a flurry of amazing Alice faces/pouts. I ship them.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't. I actually think she's the most likely to leave the school. Not because she got kicked out or anything. She's been working for Erina this whole time and while she's had the opportunity to improve herself by learning to cook for Erina, she doesn't have much experience cooking for other people's tastes compared to everyone else. Her cooking is basically for her "Empress" Erina. I'd like her to leave the school to go out on a journey and come back better than any of the others. 

Also, I ship her with Souma. 
>> ARTICLE
I like the way she is now, she is a perfect balance for Soma's character. But [manga spoilers](/s "The current 1st seat of the elite 10 has confidence issues that mirror Megumi's, and he's the damn 1st seat, the very best chef in the academy.") so who knows she may be OP after she takes off those Rock Lee weights too.
>> ARTICLE
[manga spoilers](/s "to be fair he doesn't have confidence issues in his cooking but rather in the things he cant control, like how people feel, and how his staff treats the food.")
>> ARTICLE
[Manga Spoilers](/s "He has confidence issues, but Souma pointed out he never bothered to ask if the food was good. The current first seat has absolute confidence that his food is good.

why? because when western food was first introduced into japan in the 20th century they was poor and didn't have tomato or puree, but only ketchup. So they dilute it with water.

Except she clearly said "ketchup". The Japanese really do call all types of tomato sauce "ketchup". This is not a translation error at all. If anything blame the Japanese for using a loanword wrongly.

I never eat spaghetti **without** ketchup. In Sweden it's really common to have ketchup on spaghetti, for example on bolognese. We eat tomato ketchup on almost everything.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen people do it, but rarely and it's gross as all hell.  That said, I wonder if this is more due to tomatoes not being a native food to Japan.  "Ketchup" may simply be what they call all tomato sauces, whether it's what we think of as ketchup or a more standard marinara or other tomato sauce.
>> ARTICLE
Pure ketchup is pretty disgusting. Ketchup-based tomato sauces aren't uncommon, especially in Asian family diners. Speaking from experience in Hong Kong. Don't know how to explain it, but there's a distinctive taste and look whenever they use ketchup in any dish. Probably the thickness as well as the sweetness of the ketchup.

I still think pasta sauce has a lot more complex flavor, but spaghetti with ketchup + tomatoes + egg with cheese on top is pretty good.

> I love Tadokoro's country accent for the same reason I love the Kansai accent. It just sounds so...country. I love it.

Man, I don't understand how you guys differentiate it without knowing the language. Am I just dumb or something? 
>> ARTICLE
The various japanese dialects have their vowels shaped differently and end common words with a different sound. The most obvious difference I hear in this one is long 'o' to 'ou'. If you re-watch [this phrase](http://imgur.com/IRXh0rL) it usually (I think) sounds like 'yah-taah-mo' while she pronounces it 'ya-ta-mou'.
>> ARTICLE
I can hear it, same way I can pick apart German accents, it's not too hard
>> ARTICLE
She's using hardcore Tohoku-ben. I don't know the specific prefecture she's from, but the accent seems stereotypically thick. It's the kind of accent that gets subtitles on Japanese TV. The Karaage lady from the previous episodes was using something that reminded me of Kyoto-ben. You can tell since she attaches "hen" to a lot of her verbs at the end of sentences. I can only tell because I lived in Akita, which has probably the worst sounding Tohoku-ben and I've heard enough stereotypical Kyoto-ben from spending time in Kyoto and watching movies set there.

Here's a [great guide](http://akitajet.com/wiki/Akita-ben) for Akita-ben that might help.
>> ARTICLE
For the record it'd be more accurate to refer to kara-age lady's accent as Kansai-ben. Kyoto-ben is a sub-dialect within that, but given that she didn't really fit any of the stereotypes of women from Kyoto I dunno how accurate of a label Kyoto-ben would be.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, you just pick up on words and phrases after watching/listening to enough of it. Anime especially is guilty of using only so wide a vocabulary, and only so many dialects, so once you've listened to enough to distinguish them, you can think oh, that's Tadokoro's country accent, or during the karaage arc, oh, that mean lady's speaking in a Kansai accent. Each dialect has certain phrases that give away what dialect they're speaking in as well.

That's true. But seeing how so many times something intervenes (when he got refused entry by Erina, or when Megumi was almost kicked out by the french cuisine guy) I was thinking that could happen again. idk

Cooking is one of the foundations of human civilization. It isn't "just" cooking. It's cooking!

I honestly think this is the best aspect of these kind of shows. You sometimes could careless about the activity itself; cooking, go, volleyball, biking, and card poetry.

But these characters put their hearts and dreams into "just" these things. And seeing them fail or succeed, especially Megumi, is incredible.

For anyone interested in the art of cooking, and all of the fascinating science that underlies it, I would wholeheartedly recommend **Modernist Cuisine**, a six-volume masterpiece covering every aspect of cooking imaginable.

If you can't afford this $500 book, just PM and I can direct you to more... affordable... alternatives.

Cheers, and happy foodgasms


>> ARTICLE
Jesus, and I thought that Megumi's triumph was incredible in the manga, but the anime completely just blows it out the water.

Credit to the VA. That phone call to her mom that everything is okay. She so desperately wants to succeed, because she somehow associated failing with letting down all those loved ones she desperately wants to help. Hell, that flashback where she rejects her roommates invitation to practice on her own -- she felt like such a failure she either felt like she didn't deserve help or was beyond help or was wasting their time. Either interpretation is fucking heartbreaking.

And then finally the music and editing with the birds and scoring. Fucking beautiful.

I never noticed that the vegetables behind Tadokoro in the OP are never the same every episode ... For instance last episode it was [~~carrots~~/green beans?](http://i.imgur.com/qnvupMS.jpg), before that it was [cauliflower](http://i.imgur.com/g4nlaOc.png), and this time it's [corn](http://imgur.com/wNt1NWY).

I love this kind of trend there is in anime nowadays to change just one little thing in their OPs/EDs, it adds a nice little touch to it.

LOL when was the last time you saw green carrots?

Never seen green, but did you know carrots were originally purple?  The dutch bred them orange to match their flag.  No clue how they got from purple to orange, but hey, it worked.

Yes, drank blendered purple carrots before. They taste like orange carrots.

I watched Angel Beats without crying

Aaaand I cry at every Megumi flashback.

Idk if it's the perfectly fitting music, or just that the characters stick more to me in Shokugeki, I just feel so emotive all the time with this anime.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's due to good characters and negative space. Shokugeki doesn't barrage you with "feels" scenes so when they actually do one it has a much bigger impact.


>> ARTICLE
You are not alone. This show has fleshed out its character really good I mean really really good. I mean I can tell every character's speciality in cooking. No characters seem to be nearly identical ( well not intended anyway :P ). And yeah you are saying it, the music in this show is just so freaking beautiful and fitting. And to crown it. It's a freaking cooking anime. If that isn't great writing and animating and whatsoever then I don't know :)

I feel bad for Isami. Nao doesn't give a fuck about the contest anymore. She found her ["onee-sama"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLwsbgeJuIE), the lovely Secretary-san. 

Alice is cool as always. Confident to boot. But not abnoxious about it. Erina take notes!

God-fucking damn it. I'm just as teary-eyed when I was reading  Megumi's scene crying in the kitchen compared to when I'm watching it now.

I don't have anymore things to write about for this season.  To be honest, it's really hard to write down these commentaries because I'm always afraid to spoiler or get too far into the pacing in the story to the point where I end up going into that fine line between spoiler territory and okay area.  Also, the Preliminaries in the manga were REALLY unevenly paced in my opinion, because of the judging and the amounts of characters.

However, I like writing about this to all you guys, because as a guy who used to love cooking (And Shokugeki No Soma actually got me back to turning on the stove again), I also know things that most common people won't point out or some people originally miss.  So I'll be happy to point them out to you.   

However, if they DO make a second season, I will be sure to entertain you all with my commentary involving [ ](/s "Bentos, Ramen, hamburgers (In Typical MURICA' fashion), beef stew, saury, and the Franco-Japanese relationship, Chinese food, and the Deep Cultural Connection between Japan and China") , assuming they go through both the Autumn Elections and [ ](/s "Stagiare") arcs next season.  
>> ARTICLE
I didn't expect this episode to have me in tears, but the way the bgm and voiceacting worked together just made this so much better than the manga. Wow. 

Sadatsuka Nao still best girl though~

Whenever Megumi is up to bat I cant help but root for the sweetheart, she never gives up, she always tries her hardest and she always cares for the food she cooks. She is the sprightly underdog we all can relate to in some way.  
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Damn I really didn't know that all those were.... curry.
>> ARTICLE
When Megumi got into the Elections, I was kind of disappointed. Yes, Megumi is a fun character, but her position as an elite chef was seriously in question, and the show had yet to really have her develop in a technical sense.

I was planning to be even more annoyed with her actually making it past the first round, but the show surprised me.

They built up why her dish would be good in a way that simply worked with the character and the premise.

You've come so far, Megumi. I'm proud of you.
>> ARTICLE
I never saw it that way.   Megumi was always shown as a great chef that lacked confidence in herself and had stage fright when it came to judging.  That's why she always cooked great alone but kept failing classes. 

Her shokugeki proved how great she was when all the judges acknowledged her and she was saved from expulsion.   Soma has taught her to believe in herself more.   However, even before the elections tournament she still didn't believe in herself and told hojo she only did well in the shokugeki thanks to soma.   Her passing the first round was thanks to her finally believing in herself and was the culmination of her character growth in the series. I don't think she was ever portrayed as a bad chef in the show and I always saw her as an elite chef that lacked confidence.

Now in music news, Kojiro Shinomiya's character song album was released the other day. Takumi's is up next and they posted [another preview - this time for track 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zObjsp7jqBg) From before, [track 1's preview.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtzjFHQuRg)
>> ARTICLE
When the judging for Megumi started, I almost started crying. The Megumi scenes are always so heart wrenching even when they aren't sad. Last week's Monk Fish made me feel like a proud parent. Megumi best girl indeed.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the translation messed up the Hishoko pun a bit, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to explain it by myself.

In any case, anyone who has ever doubted Megumi is now silenced, for good hopefully. Her progress is so satisfying, from being the meek and shy flunky into the first year's top 8. I especially liked how Hojo saw that there's more to cooking, or everything really, than just using brute force to overpower obstacles.

Block A hype now? I'm ready for witnessing the up-tight twin's jaw unhinge and spiral into orbit. Actually block A IS the hype block.. well I'm excited.
>> ARTICLE
Our Megumi is growing up so fast [](#torrentialdownpour)

I really wanna see the dishes that Ryo and Akira made.
>> ARTICLE
I really like relationship between Aldini brothers. Isami realizes that he is not as good as his brother, but doesn't want to give up, and Takumi does everything to support that competitive spirit in him, so Isami could move forward and become stronger. And that shoulder pat was a touching moment. I really wish Aldinis to get more time. I heard they'll get their own OVA, that's awesome.

Oh, and Alice being best girl with her bizarre cuisine. I felt her dish presentation was a bit rushed (like a whole episode, to be honest), but it indeed made some impact. Loved moment when all judges literally froze for a few seconds. Just shows how much Alice is above the rest of Block B competitors. 
>> ARTICLE
I like the touch that while Isami is usually the more confident guy with the cooler personality, it's hinted it may just be a mask to disguise his insecurity over being less talented than his 'lame' bro.

It seems the anime skiped 3 chapters worth of content (essentially the equivalent of one episode).    
I wonder if they are just going to show that content later, or if they are skipping it entirely.

Also, shameless plug to /r/shokugekinosoma, where you can also discuss the manga or just share the dish you made

Basically they did the same thing they did with Soma's dad and just shuffled it around a bit.

Those of you who have read the manga, are they going to do what I think they're doing and drawing out this round by going through absolutely everyone then having Soma on last in ep. 24 and giving us a cliff hanger?!

Cause in all honesty if they do that I'd be truly pissed and might not bother with it if it gets a second season. It's beginning to feel unnaturally stretched out to me now :(
>> ARTICLE
I believed it has been already confirmed that the anime will end at the    first round of the autumn selection (aka when the 8 people are chosen) 
>> ARTICLE
Unlikely. They presented all of group B in 2 episodes. So it would take 2 episodes for group A as well (even less maybe because they won't be switching between the two for various reasons and neither do they spend time on anything else, like setting the stage for the contest like they did prior to starting the group B)

Souma's results would be announced , and we will get to see all the 8 finalists. That is cliffhanger enough to S2. 
>> ARTICLE
That sounds good. I was just worried that they were purposely drawing it out to then give a manufactured cliff hanger!

Finally having Best Girl get recognized for her talent is the greatest feeling ever. I would've liked to see her demolish that white haired chick (I know her name, but god damn I hate her so much that I can't even say it. Yes molecular gastronomy is cool shit, but the way she acts makes me wanna drive boiling hot skewers into my eardrums) but that will happen later. 
>> ARTICLE
A really feel-good episode, but I kinda wish they'd have hurried up with the food tasting - maybe condensed some of the hotel training arc - in order to get the autumn elections over with by the end of the season.
>> ARTICLE
Even if they did hurried somewhere, they would have never fit all of the autumn election arc into this. It's around 50 % of the current number of chapters. If you see it like that it's "doomed" to continue in a second season :P.

MEGUMI is the best. This is why I was gun ho for her in the best girl contest because of this moment. This moment and another are my favorite moments in shokugeki. Everytime I read this chapter tears come out because megumi deserves all this. This is why im her biggest fan. Megumi FOR THE WIN
>> ARTICLE
Not particularly disappointed with the results, but the winners were all very expected. And sadly this was another case of "god I hope the op isnt spoiling the results, god i hope it isnt spoi- yep it spoiled the results". I remember trying to ignore it because the episodes preceding the preliminaries did such a good job with the build up like anyone could win

And yeah I know I shouldnt be surprised at who got through(I wasnt after all) but they did such a good job highlighting everyone that I was hoping for some real "dark horse candidates" like what if Isami somehow made it threw, or Nao or Hojo or any random person from Polar star other than the ultimate underdog Megumi(note I loved Megumi and felt her parts were the best of the past few episodes). Yeah I liked seeing someone other than Souma compete, but there wasnt much doubt in who was going to stomp who so there wasnt any tension. I just felt indifferent through much of it


>> ARTICLE
it's not over yet we still have Block A to go
>> ARTICLE
MEGUMI BEST GIRL
>> ARTICLE
I actually cried when Megumi's first scores were 17 and 17. When the piano started playing and she started remembering her past and how everyone encouraged her... I thought she wasn't going to make it and I couldn't hold it. But then I saw the other scores and my tears of sorrow turned into tears of happiness. Damn this episode was amazing!
>> ARTICLE
So many Megumi hype and to think that Erina's Arc only started last week on the manga and this week, the Curry Sisters and 2 other prelim judges makes a comeback. 

If translated to anime, Erina's Arc could be shown in season 3.

Anyways! Great job Megumi-chan!!!

Can't believe man tears were shed in a cooking anime.
>> ARTICLE
I cried like a bitch in the end. Fuck that. 
>> ARTICLE
FCK YEEAAAHH MEGUMIIII-CHAAAANNNN

I'm not crying... Ok, I'm crying a little.

But they didn't. Only the top 4 go through so Isami did not make it. 
>> ARTICLE
Crap. Don't know why I thought top 5.
>> ARTICLE
Megumi is everything she should've won!
>> ARTICLE
Best Girl never wins unfortunately ;-;
>> ARTICLE
Megumi got to top 8 in the best girl contest on r/anime, and now she is in the top 8 for the Autumn Elections!! :D
>> ARTICLE
Jesus Christ I wasn't expecting these feels.  
Isami's story was bad enough, with him constantly being overshadowed by his brother. Even the show just treats him as "Takumi's brother", and this is the first time he was portrayed as a person with his own goals and dreams, even though they were never fulfilled. Seeing the brothers' camaraderie was honestly really heartwarming.  
But Megumi though, holy shit. Never before have I wanted to see a character succeed so much. She know she's not as talented as the others in the contest, but she makes up for it with honest determination and hard work. She's constantly told she's not good enough, but she really wants to give people the best meal she can make. The fact that she's gone from a person the judges dismiss without a second thought (they even almost forgot her this episode, how could they?) to one of the top eight is incredibly satisfying. I actually cheered when that final score showed up, even though I knew it was coming.

However, did this episode feel kinda rushed to anyone else? Last episode was dedicated to 2 contestants only, and they weren't even that important. This episode had six, and the impact of each dish felt somewhat lacklustre. I guess it's because they just wanted to get this stage of the competition out of the way?
>> ARTICLE
No the pace is good . In the manga, Hisako Arato and Nao both have one chapter each . Yuki Yoshino ( duck) and Hojo Misako have 3 pages in the Aldini Brothers chapter . The other one is Megumi and Alice chapter . So 2 chapters for this week episode

In term of order appearance, next week episode goes before this week episode. In the manga they show half of block A and half of block B :)

Not gonna lie i forgot about Megumi too. Maybe simply because i don't like her character.

Wow so the entire ED has been about this one face off.  Interesting choice, I assume this has further ramifications throughout the rest of the series. 
>> ARTICLE
Considering that the current season will end soon, I don't assume so.
>> ARTICLE
I was being a bit facetious. Idle speculation based on the minor nature of this battle and the fact the one of the opponents was only introduced fully last episode and this plot was only hinted at for two episodes. Combined with the complete nature of the defeat. I'd say this was a one and done type thing. At most only Erica's assistant will advance to the election between the two.  

But it does provide interesting imagery compared to the rest of this cour so far without having to spoil the curry theme. It was an OK choice but it does lead one to think of witchy as an over arching villain. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I was more looking forward to a bigger role for her. Honestly, I thought her style of cooking was way more interesting than the assistant's.

If you asked me whether I wanted a 'dedicated follower' or a yandere to play a bigger role in a cooking show, I'd be more interested with how they make the yandere work
>> ARTICLE
I think they are at peak interesting characters at this point. Too many and they begin to get to bakuman everyone's a genius, which is OK but it got tired. 

I think the medicinal cooking could have been played up to a higher degree to make it more interesting. But death curry was a tough act to follow. 
>> ARTICLE
Exactly...the assistant was still very interesting, but ehhh...I dont know how to put it....she still fit into a certain mold along with most of the other characters.

The manner in which Nao made the judges react was so different, and then to immediately have it be utterly destroyed by 'medicinal cooking'....I mean yeah it was okay, but I was noticeably less enthused than I had ever been throughout my time watching the show
>> ARTICLE
I agree with that. Having her pumped up as much as the anime series had to have her lose so harshly did throw me off. 
>> ARTICLE
>Too many and they begin to get to bakuman everyone's a genius, which is OK but it got tired. 

It's an elite cooking school and they are near the top of it, everyone *is* a genius. Some are just more genius.
>> ARTICLE
That's is a bit of an unfortunate thing about the setting the older he gets the less likely we are to see a non-genius character, power creep will be an issue with writing it, at a certain point they will need to humble him properly or get outrageous with it and pull a yowamushi pedal and play up the awesomeness of each character, losing the focus on Soma. This works less with soma because his goal makes him stay the focus, where as pedal guy his goal was having fun, making friends, and riding his bike,  which meant he could more easily hide into the background when its another's time to shine.

I think it will be interesting to see how the series plays out.

You're not the only one.

I can answer that.

Imagine you are a Japanese student in the top cooking academy.  

You know the basis of Japanese cooking, French cooking, other worldly cuisines.  

You see this blue haired girl, clumsy as fuck, always failing her grades. 

 It's a miracle she hasn't gone expelled.

She somehow gets into the Autumn elections without a problem.  

You wonder, "How?!? How come she, despite being clumsy, managed to get in?"

Then she takes out a freaking monkfish.

The monkfish, one of THE ultimate fish in Traditional Japanese cuisine. 

It's also one of the hardest to prepare, because you have to surgically cut up the fish to ensure that you don't damnage the precious innards.

And she cuts it.

You wonder that this girl is going to fucking ruin an expensive ingredient that EVERYONE wants to practice with.

And she does it.

She fucking does it.

She successfully separated the innards and the liver is undamaged.

And then you realized.

You were wrong. 

She is better than you realized.

She just successfully prepared monkfish, THE most difficult ingredient in this school!

And you now know why she got in.

She finally awakened her potential.

[Megumi commentary here on anglerfish here](http://pastebin.com/x5c4msnb)

Also, Nao is one of my favorite characters.  I can relate to her that I think that the taste is all that matters, even if it looks unappetizing, if it tastes great, I don't care.  As a guy who cooks weird things (Not too weird on soma's level though) I can relate.

So it looks like the anime is following the remarkably slow pace of the arc in the manga, which is fine by me, but it means that a lack of a season 2 would be even worse. I really, really hope they continue to adapt it after this season because I assume they'll stop at the end of the preliminaries, when the hype is at its peak.

If they don't adapt the Autumn Election arc I will be very, very disappointed. I just finished reading the manga in 3 days, and that was phenomenal.

A little disappointed that Orie didn't go beast mode after eating Hisako's cooking.

Last week had Erina adorably fussing over Hisako and this week's end card has me shipping Hisako x Erina forever. 

Also Megumi's scene was awesome, but felt sort of rushed. Looking forward to seeing her dish.

I just watched a demon get cleansed in a cooking anime. This is awesome

One thing I was surprised by was how high Yandere's score was. You can have some of the best food, but if it is so unappetizing that no one wants to try it (unless forced to in order to judge it), it isn't that great of a dish. 
>> ARTICLE
I really want the Soma x Megumi ship to sail badly.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, you mispelled Soma x Erina. She DOES have a crush on his dad afterall...
>> ARTICLE
No one will come between my Erina x Hisako ship
>> ARTICLE
She has a crush on his dad, but she hates Souma's guts (for all of the anime, maybe somewhat less in the manga). How is that translatable in a Souma x Erina "ship" 

I mean, I fear that it might end up that way, but god damn it would be such a travesty. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes a travesty compared to two people who have little to no romantic feeling for each other.
>> ARTICLE
Are you serious? You haven't read the manga have you? 
>> ARTICLE
Read the manga, last chapter had a huge figure appearing at the end (just in case you doubt me). And no there still is no romantic feelings between them, idk why'd you even bring the manga up.

Edit: Just to clarify I'm talking about Megumi x Souma
>> ARTICLE
Getting from "friendly" to "romatic" is easier and more believable than getting from "I look down on you, scum" to "romantic" 

So yeah, if Megumi x Souma has no (or little) romantic angle to it. Erina x Souma definitely doesn't.

From that standpoint, Mito x Souma is closer to a ship than stupid Erina. 
>> ARTICLE
Well they will be in the same school for three years, who said it will be ''I look down on you, scum'' to ''romantic'' and not ''I look down on you, scum'' to ''friendly'' to ''romantic''. 
>> ARTICLE
That's true, but the point is that it's a shorter and more credible road in the friendly->love than the scum->not scum->friendly->love. 

It still can happen, just that much more unbelievable (shocking if you will) , which is why they do it, instead of choosing an obvious nice girl.  
>> ARTICLE
She's acknowledged his cooking. Plus the fact that she always gets flustered whenever he's around. This goes to show how stupid this anime's shipping community is. Souma has no interest in women so shipping him with anyone is just wasting time.
>> ARTICLE
> she's acknowledged his cooking

Well then, ring the wedding bells... 

> to get flustered = becoming nervous or upset

In order of frequency so do Mito, Mayumi, Alice, Hishoko, hell even Takumi. Souma x Takumi ftw.

> Souma has no interest in women

Except for the fact that they OBVIOUSLY [pointed to a romantic angle to the show](http://i.imgur.com/mA0G4Xw.png). And [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3irgly/spoilers_shokugeki_no_souma_episode_21_discussion/cuj9n4d)(ask him for proof)

> how stupid the shipping community is

If you are so uninterested in it, then why do you participate in the discussion? 
>> ARTICLE
>Clearly doesnt know about Tsunderes.

And have any of them gotten to the point where they dont even want to hear his name or theyll get flustered. 

An angle that Souma clearly doesn't currently care for (as of right now). And I will ask.

I can participate at whatever I want to, please tell me otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
If you're claiming that Erina is a tsundere, then you are the one who clearly doesn't know what a tsundere is. If anything, she's more like a himedere, since she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth and looks down on other people as if they are lower class. But even that is not correct, since she has no fucking "dere". None. 
"Oh but she was flustered" So what? That's not a sign of liking him. She doesn't. 

> I can participate at whatever I want to

Nor was my intent to stop you, I was pointing the hypocrisy of calling this discussion topic stupid, then taking the time to participate in it. Claiming that people discussing this topic is "stupid" just because you don't find it interesting or necessary yourself, is just as "stupid". 
>> ARTICLE
>Claims Souma x Erina is canon via random person on internet

>Turns out most people replied saying it wasn't confirmed canon but him confirming Erina would develop feelings for Souma

>Says Erina isn't a tsundere

I'm loling at the fact that not only the person you linked turned out to be wrong, but on top of that invalidated your entire first paragraph.

So basically, I can't criticize the shipping community otherwise I'm a hypocrite because I so happened to say it in a thread that involves said community. Welp can't argue with that.

>Still loling at epic fail
>> ARTICLE
Does Souma actually show interest in girls later on in the manga? Cause as an anime only watcher, food/cooking seem to be his only interests. 
>> ARTICLE
He isn't even actually close to finish his first year in the manga yet. I bet the romance will slowly start creeping into the whole thing in his 2nd year and be a full out romance in his 3rd year. 
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Nope. His main focus is still improving his cooking, surviving in the school, challenging people to shokugekis and aiming to beat elite 10 members. ")

>> ARTICLE
I feel like with the way [Naruto spoilers?](/s "Naruto and Hinata ended up together (very similar to the Soma Tadokoro dynamic)"), the Soma x Megumi ship could sail on. I mean, I don't know what to believe anymore...
>> ARTICLE
Though Erina is someone who is very big on merits. Souma is someone who is very very arrogant but he actually doesn't have that many official merits to back him up. Erina who is also someone who is pretty arrogant can't really think too highly of him then now can she? 

>> ARTICLE
Allow me to disagree. 

Souma is indeed arrogant, but unlike Erina he doesn't look down on people (with the exception of that school announcement, which was mostly a response from him to the snobby majority in the school who looked down ON HIM) But once confronted one on one with a cook, he doesn't belittle anyone. [Manga](/s "He even became friendly with the once despicable Mimisaka")

Erina looks down on almost everyone (unless it's a top tier chef recognized by her superiors), and you say it's because of merits, which is partially true. It's also because she was born into a rich family with strong ties in the food industry. A cooking elite. I'd say that has a lot of influence in that "merit" of her cooking. 

Which is why Souma is better than her. He is arrogant because he is a good chef despite is lower standing in the socio-economic classes. 
>> ARTICLE
They are arrogant because of their skills is insanely high. Souma has multiple times looked down upon people with less experience than him each time they surprised him by showing they aren't that easy opponents. Souma is born into the cooking elite as well, he basically personally tutored by the 2nd best student in the history of the school for 10 years. Their arrogance manifests in different ways, and Souma stopped looking down people simply because he perceived them as less experienced. 

Souma's arrogance is much more petty than Erina's which deeply rooted just as Souma's in her over the top skills and never been challenged, but she also got merits. If someone gets merits she will acknowledge them. 

Don't get me wrong, arrogance is good thing in this setting. They are meant to be elites. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFPqqL-4RbE for further clarification. 
>> ARTICLE
> Souma was born into a cooking elite

Not exactly. He learned from competing with him. And the dad even recognized he didn't put much confidence into "teaching him" to the point he wanted Souma to give up on trying to be a cook. Not exactly a highly lucrative training circumstance. 

Even then, he was just a 2nd elite. Compared to that, Erina had the influence of the Totsuki family looming over her. Miles above in what you consider access to a good tutorage in cooking. 

And it's not all about the teacher either. It's also about the resources. [](/s "They said in the manga that elite 10 have access to cooking books that cost as much as a small restaurant.")Imagine what a Totsuki heir can exclusively have access too (actually don't imagine look at Alice and her cost intensive cooking style). In any case, the elite has access to many more advantages that put them way above others. 

>  Souma perceived them as less experienced

Not as less experienced cooks. He perceived them as less experienced in serving customers and tailor food for their enjoyment. Unlike many in Totsuki, who valued perfection over satisfaction, he valued the bond with the people eating his food, because he came from a local diner where he met his customers everyday. Which is why he arrogantly put it "he won't lose to people who never served others". It's not that he thought them as lowlife cooks (like Erina does). 

> Erina will ackowledge people on merits

Not exactly. For one, she was among the last people to ackowledge his cooking skills. Souma impressed Dojima, Shinomyia and a pletora of high end judges in the cooking world (all of them implied to be more qualified than Erina to judge food) , and yet they found his food good, but Erina doesn't. 

There was that one point in the entrance exams with the egg dish, where she was obviously surprised by the quality of his dish, but she dismissed him regardless. She lied about the food being bad just so that he won't enter the school. She found his food lacking when Senzaemon the cooking "master" disagreed and enrolled him regardless. She's straight up in denial because she can't admit that people in Souma's circumstances can get as good a cook as her.

You're kind of fooling yourself if you think Soma x Erina WON'T be the final ship.

[Example 1](http://i.imgur.com/mA0G4Xw.png)

She only hates his guts because she doesn't understand how he makes her feel.  Literally one of the only people in her life to ever feed her something she found delicious.

She doesnt have a crush on his dad. She has a crush on her perfect image of his dad, which is far from reality.

Best 30 minutes of my week, I'm already fearing the after depression for this one.

I really enjoyed seeing all the different interpretations of curry. And Megumi butchering that monkfish was awesome. She cooks really well when she can calm down and focus. But there are too many characters that I like and want to see move on to the next round! I'm really curious to see who's going to make the top four!
>> ARTICLE
I'm calling it, it's definitely not Miyoko. She's just too sure of herself and how great she is. Plus, her pretensions about being the only woman capable of succeeding in the male-dominated cooking world are rapidly being torn apart, considering all the men in her group so far did terribly, and the only people who scored over 50 were women.

Manga readers, don't spoil this for me. I'm not touching the manga until this season is over.

Hishoko is such a god with her Chinese medicine cooking, she's been one of my favorite characters ever since the most recent arcs in the manga. And now we get Sa-chan with her Hisako onee-sama, which is even better than Erina-sama I think because they're the same age.

Am I the only one shipping Hisako X Nao?
>> ARTICLE
I think I've said this before, but I'll say it again. How is a show about cooking so goddamn exciting? Here's what happened this episode:  
1. A character makes food.  
2. People overreact to how delicious the food is.  
3. The ingredients of the food and why it is so good are explained in great detail.  
And you know what? It fucking works. I hope to God we get a season 2 please J.C. Staff I NEED IT.

Great episode, but I wish stuff would happen at a faster rate.

Next week is gonna be good, the Aldini's and potentially the other Polar Star residents' dishes.

I'll tell you, that has been an incredible episode. There wasn't much hype as there was delivery of said hype, Megumi handling the monkfish, Sadatsuka's cursing dish and ~~Hishoko's~~ Hisako's cleansing one, even the minute mention of the Mezzaluna. Such a satisfying episode, and knowing there's more left is just incredible. These guys make me want to literally drop everything and start learning how to cook, really.
>> ARTICLE
So will this show get a second season? It just doesn't seem like it can wrap the story up with the remaining episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Ehh....Id prefer it if Nao had won, but the build-up throughout the episode did make it obvious who would do better.

I know manga readers keep going on and on about Hisako, but...I dont know...just imagining this fucked up character rising through the ranks for the stupidest of reasons, I think that couldve been fun

Not to say I was dissapointed by any means, I still loved their contrasting styles and ideals regarding Erina. Megumi still stole the show with that monkfish


>> ARTICLE
Curry laksa is a South East Asian curry soup dish usually cooked with spices, shrimp/seafood and coconut milk base, with thick rice noodles. The taste is rich and flavourful.

Here, Nao uses kusaya, squid ink, and this makes the curry look black and even more flavourful, even though it stinks.

Penang Curry Laksa is the best. It has that spicy belacan paste.

The manga itself during this arc is slow, so that could be it. Also they could be slowing it down so they can end the season where they want to.

Megumi and Curry... enough to make this episode enjoyable :D

Only 3 episodes left. We have a lot to cover in this arc. I don't think three episodes is enough.

ONLY 3? This thing better receive another season because that isn't even close enough considering that it'll take another episode to finish this block and we still have Soma's block to go!
>> ARTICLE
Ho...

Ho?

HHHOOOOOOOO
>> ARTICLE
It's really nice to see Megumi cook with confidence. Hisako's medicinal cooking also makes a great foil to Nao's slow cooking.

This episode gave some of the more passive background characters a chance to step up. Both Megumi and Hisako largely seemed lost in the shadows of Soma and Erina and now we get to see that they are where they are on their own merits.

God damn this show is so good. Episodes go by way too quickly :'(

Well that was pretty fucking intense! Megumi you sure showed all of them who doubted you! <3

It's been a while since i've been hit by that sadness of an anime ending, and I know i'll be hit by it once Shokugeki ends even though i'm reading the manga. I MUST KNOW IS THERE SEASON 2?!

Ahhhh, shit I forgot to post this when the thread started:

For those of you who have been intrigued by this show or otherwise now want to do some serious cooking, I'd highly recommend reading a collection of books called **Modernist Cuisine** by Myhrvold, Young, and Bilet.

It's a comprehensive guide to everything from techniques all the way to the type of scientific molecular gastronomy that Nakiri Alice practices. I can direct anyone who's interested in the book to a place where it can be found cheaply. Just PM me.

Finally something Megumi is good at, honestly I was losing hope in her... I knew she had to be good at something....

also I wish there were more bets in the "matches" cause it seem like most matches only have pride on the line. :)

the witch girl going "white" was hilarious..

that ED2 is becoming one of my all time favorite.. 

next week last episode, right.. :)
>> ARTICLE
This is in my top 5 Episodes from Shokugeki no Souma so far. Megumi showing everyone why she is where she is (**TEARS T_T**), Nao the Black/White, That judged getting the Fist of the North Star buff from eating Hisako's medicinal dish, oh and Soma just making it look so easy xD. Not to mention the ED change xD. Can't wait to see the Aldini brothers compete.

No matter how tasty a dish is I'm not sure I'd be able to eat it if it smelled like a toilet. Just the smell would make me puke and kill my appetite.

And interesting that Hisako's medicinal cooking gave the male judges ripped bodies. The reactions are starting to reach Yakitate Japan levels now.
>> ARTICLE
I recently taught myself how to cook, and this show was a big part of it. I have tried to replicate most of the dishes so far, but this curry arc I'm like, "I have no idea what any of this is and I'm cold and afraid."

Nao (White) is pretty cute.

With the pace it's going with, I think we'll only get to see Group B's results or if anything more, it would be the students who passed into the main tournament.

Am I the only one who predicted Hisato's score?

C'mon, we need a season 2. This is so much fun to watch!!!

> Oh the reactions of those Megumi haters...so satisfying.

What would you do if I told you that I just don't partucarly care for Megumi or her type? Lol, the whole point of her still being there is because she actually is a good chef. And for those who outright don't like doormats she still acts like one even if she isn't completly useless by herself.

The one thing that keeps getting on my nerves about an otherwise freaking awesome series is the way they hold the kitchen knives.

Them showing Bnh xo actually made me really hungry for it. I haven't had it in over a year.

Yeah, i love that stuff. Going to see my family that live in little saigon in a week, gonna see if I can get some while im there

if you're gonna be in little saigon (i'm assuming it's the garden grove/westminster one in California) then i suggest checking out banh cuon tay ho for the banh xeo. or if you want boba then check out 7 leaves huehue

First one rings a bell. I've been to little saigon a lot, but the names start to meld in my memory.

Thst and im subject to the final decisions of my grandparents. Though their choices aren't bad. Usually.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit. That episode ending.

HYPE.

AUTUMN ELECTIONS.

From how much manga readers have hyped the arc we're moving into, I'm beyond hype for this, even though, from what I've heard, we probably won't see all of it.


>> ARTICLE
The autumn election arc is fucking great, I tell you. Sadly with how many episodes there are left, it will end just a few chapters into it. 
>> ARTICLE
My personal favorite arc of the manga thus far. So many hype moments and unexpected results which made me happy. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not so much hype, but worry. The Autumn Elections arc is pretty big, and the anime only has a few episodes left to cover them completely.


That being said...It's a pretty good arc that you should read sometime.
>> ARTICLE
There's no sign that the anime is going to cramp the entire thing 6 episodes....
>> ARTICLE
There are 6 episodes left in the season. The arc hasn't even started. What are you smoking?


They haven't announced a second season yet.
>> ARTICLE
Right, there's 6 episodes left. And at the rate the series has been going, I'm assuming the season will end at [Spoilers](/s "the end of prelims"). 


>> ARTICLE
[Right, but](#s "that doesn't cover the entire arc, or the aftermath. It's essentially ending right in the middle of the arc.")
>> ARTICLE
So what you're saying is they want people to go out and buy the manga. That sounds familiar! 
>> ARTICLE
No, Shounen Jump series are usually guaranteed 2nd seasons because they're meant to boost manga sales that are already doing well.

Death Note adapted to completion

Bakuman adapted to completion

HxH adapted to the most recent completed arc

KnB adapted to completion

Nisekoi adapted to two seasons

Jojo adapted to Part 3 with more likely on the way

Haikyuu S2 next season

AssClass S2 announced

>> ARTICLE
>Jojo adapted to Part 3 with more likely on the way

We hope.
>> ARTICLE
How cool would it be if they suddenly announced that the season wasn't ending for another 20 episodes?
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the manga, what are the Autumn Elections? Is it a tournament? 
>> ARTICLE
It's basically a ranking tournament for the first years. 
>> ARTICLE
without too many spoilers , yes it is
>> ARTICLE
You will be blue balled hard unless they fuck up the adapation. 
>> ARTICLE
One of the few times being blue balled is a good thing. Unless you're into that I guess...
>> ARTICLE
The entire election cycle is 60 chapters deep, so yeah. Hopefully we get a season 2.
>> ARTICLE
my guess is they will make it to setting up the bracket and that will be the end of season 1.
>> ARTICLE
This is a Shounen Jump adaption. Not getting season 2 would be the weird decision, considering most has over 100 episodes (except maybe Bakuman that has 75, but that was because they got to the manga ending)
>> ARTICLE
I always hear the term Shounen Jump, but I never learned what it means, what is it?
>> ARTICLE
Essentially the most popular Shounen Manga magazine in Japan. Every week they release the latest chapter of manga under their IP like Bleach, One Piece etc.

Anime adaptations from Shounen Jump usually runs hundreds of episodes, like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Hunter x Hunter and Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like we have enough material for a season 2 already.

[manga](/s "this season ends with the preeliminaries, season 2 adapts the rest of the elections, and the stagiaire arc.")
>> ARTICLE
If we get Elite 10 introductions Kreygasm
>> ARTICLE
100 Shokugeki episodes? 

Count me in!
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it already exists, but I could see a cosplay cafe or event where they serve recipes from the manga and waitresses dress up as nikumi, megumi, other best girls, etc. I'd go. Call it Cafe no Soma. 
>> ARTICLE
If they serve the same recipes as the manga, I'd pay a visit even without the cosplay!
>> ARTICLE
I can see it having the food & recipes... but wouldn't dressing as Megumi or Nikumi require paying royalties to the creator of the manga? Are restaurants willing to pay that?

Regardless... shut up and take my money
>> ARTICLE
Most normal restaurants wouldn't but it would be cool to see something like that at a con or something.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't that already sort of done? Soma cosplay and he was frying squid with peanut butter all day or something?

I'm actually planning to roll in with my squad to a local con with portable stoves and Shokugeki cosplay.

I had never really taken an interest in cooking until watching this anime- I've tried like 3 or 4 recipes from the show so far and they're surprisingly easy, you should go for it man!

Apple Prince-Sama please whisk me off my feet too!

All the recipes can be found in the manga for just about every dish cooked.

it seems pretty legit, though I don't know how the banh xeo crepe works out tho.

Its like a normal french savory crepe, just stuffed with different things. The batter is also different, but it is the same principle.

[Risotto spoilers](/s "The idea with the apple juice to keep the actual apples crisp"), that was genius. I gotta cook that. Looked so good

I definitely think Megumi is best girl, but honestly... I don't even *want* her to end up with Souma. He's so dense, and sarcastic and smug... I kinda want her to end up with some perfect gentleman of a man, y'know? I totally ship her and Souma as cooking partners for life, though. That'd be my perfect end.

honestly at the moment the one with the best chances of winning is satoshi, he has already been seen naked in various occasions and would be the only one bold enough to make the first move

Dear diary, Alice ship feels so empty these days. I feel like we are drifting into the vast ocean as we watch the Erina and Megumi battleships fire on each other nonstop.

dude, the ship doesn't exist.there is *nothing* suggesting anything like that in the series.

Honestly I didn't like her that much before these last two episodes, but she has firmly cemented her best girl status in my mind now. She has had more development as a character in the 3 episodes we have seen her in than all the episodes we have seen either of the Nakiri sisters in combined.

I too think that she is very well *developed* as a character.

Yeah, she has a lot of *plot* going for her.

I really liked her from the second she was introduced in the manga, but being a fan of Chie from Persona 4 may make me biased towards athletic short haired girls that love meat.....

I don't mind girls who love meat either.

I liked her the second her backstory was introduced, she seemed so cute after that.
>> ARTICLE
When you think about it, unless something ends up changing Souma's mind about keeping the diner, I'm pretty sure Kurase and Megumi are the only ones who would be ok with that life. 
>> ARTICLE
I would bet that Soma's competitive streak would drove him to try to learn more culture's dishes than his father. 
>> ARTICLE
My theory is that Soma's father tries to get him to experience the world by getting rid of Yukihira Diner then Soma and his father have one last Shokugeki for it.
>> ARTICLE
*Show end*
>> ARTICLE
That sounds nice, but what Eizan said this episode is so damn true. He is an amazing chef and set his goal so low. An adequate chef could have carried on the diner (albeit with less success.)
>> ARTICLE
Seriously the show ending already wrote itself.

God's Tongue Erina will be the final judge of Shokugeki between Father & Son.

Son beats Father because the final and ultimate ingredient is cooking for someone you "love". 

Soma <3 Erina beats out Joichiro perfected-but-missing-final-ingredient-cooking.

90% sure the ending dish will be egg related.

Erina finally learns the importance of local - family oriented cooking - and settles down with Soma.

*End credits*

And that Shokugeki will be the 500th one. Feels like they've been bringing that  up a lot for it not to be a pivotal point.

Today I burnt half my fries and left the other half uncooked, couldn't get the eggs to scramble, and undercooked the bacon. And then broke a plate while cleaning up.

This show really makes cooking seem easier and a lot more fun that it actually is.

^^I ^^settled ^^for ^^potnoodle ^^instead. 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, they're infinitely more talented/experienced at cooking than you or I will ever be.

I'm not going to ask you to tell me how on earth you failed so hard though, sounds like you had a rough day.
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda concerned with how he couldnt get eggs to scramble, it seems pretty straightforward to me. And if you undercook some bacon just keep cooking.
>> ARTICLE
Bacon defeats me.  Regularly.  :(  I can cook a souffle, I've made flan, give me  a recipe and I can churn out near gourmet style food but for the life of me I *cannot* cook bacon and I have no idea why.  Drives me nuts, but it never comes out right.  Ever.
>> ARTICLE
>talented

One of the main themes of the series is that Souma isn't talented, he just works hard. See: his stance on failure as a chef, compared to Erina's response (breakfast buffet episode).
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, he seems incredibly talented to me. Talent doesn't imply you're good without hard work, it implies they have the potential *through* hard work to become a master chef in this case.
>> ARTICLE
Nah they actually address this SPECIFICALLY in the manga. [Here (** SPOILER **)](http://casanovascans.com/read/shokugeki_no_soma/en/0/102/page/12) is the specific place where they address it. You should probably stop after a couple pages. Like at Pg. 14 or 15 or something.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's because I was trying to do too many things at once and got turned around a bit. 

I also made rice and that was perfect.
^^Although ^^failing ^^to ^^make ^^rice ^^would ^^be ^^impossible.

You can always burn the rice or add so much water that it turns into mush.

You can? Yay! I did a success!!

Lots of ways to ruin rice. Keep at it you will just get better over time as you learn.

I locked myself outta the house an burnt some pancakes at the same time. Cooking is hard.

> and a lot more fun

It actually is a lot of fun. Here's how to make it fun: start with the simple things that you actually like. Experiment a bunch until you figure out exactly how the basics work (watch videos and whatnot) and then start to complicate things as you go.
>> ARTICLE
Don't be sad! If you like cooking, just keep on practicing.
>> ARTICLE
Even though I got quite frustrated with it, I did feel a weird determination to keep trying. Had it not been for braking the plate I would have tried again.

I really want to learn thanks to this show. 
>> ARTICLE
That's good to hear :)

It's a nice feeling when you cooked something that tastes awesome and you know you did it. It's even more awesome when you get to a stage where you eat restaurant/fast food and know you could do a better job or give it a little twist that makes it even better.
>> ARTICLE
baked fries?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah...I suck at cooking.
>> ARTICLE
its just something that takes practice.  With oven fries part of your oven is hotter than others so make sure the fries are just one layer on the pan then also rotate the pan half way through cooking.  

Its easier to make bacon in the oven say on a rack above your fries.

No idea what happened to your eggs though.  Maybe scramble them in a bowl, heat butter up in a pan gently then pour in eggs and fry?
>> ARTICLE
thank you for the tips, I will use this in the future.
>> ARTICLE
> couldn't get the eggs to scramble

Not scrambling eggs is harder than scrambling them. Maybe you have some secret talent here.
>> ARTICLE
Every time I make anything with eggs, they immediately turn into an omelette. 
>> ARTICLE
There you go, you've perfected omelettes to the point where you can't make anything but omelettes!
>> ARTICLE
I was trying to make some steak the other day. Omelette.

I don't even know how that happens.
>> ARTICLE
Its like that spongebob episode where no matter how hard he tries he cant make anything else but a krabby patty , even cracking an egg yeilds a burger
>> ARTICLE
>couldn't get the egg to scramble

what the fuck? How is this possible?
>> ARTICLE
I made an broken omelette :(
>> ARTICLE
who cares if the omelette is broken as long as it tastes good

>> ARTICLE
This is actually how I cook omelettes. Add all the eggs, bacon, vegetables and seasonings into a pan and then stomp it down. It breaks up in the pan, but it fries and ends up being delicious. Who needs intact omelettes?! There's no points for aesthetics in my own kitchen. I'm not running a restaurant here!
>> ARTICLE
exactly.  I can't afford a really good no-stick pan, so even with butter my omelettes end up sticking in the middle.  I usually just say "fuck it" and scramble the damn thing with all the ingredients.  Ends up more thoroughly cooked anyways.

They tone down the exploding clothes in the manga as well, replacing it with absurd/silly reactions instead. 

I bet the author wanted to put more emphasis on the enjoyment of the food rather than the naked chicks. Either way, I'm glad they took a step away from the overly ecchi reaction.

All right! This is the first episode I see AFTER reading the manga... I finally cracked...

~~The manga is better... Anime is shit~~ Just kidding. I'm still watching this with enthusiasm. The tasting animations are that good.

Nice to see Nikumi progress trough her feelings for Souma and maybe for DomRS-san... If only a certain annoying character stop being so stuck up and be like her *cough Erina cough*

Autumn elections hype! I wonder how far into them will the anime go... 
>> ARTICLE
you said that you read the manga, [manga](/s "erina isnt really stuck up in the recent chapters. she was even giving him advice, after the elections and hishoko accepting soma she seems to have understood that he really belongs at the school and isnt just a lucky commoner")
>> ARTICLE
[Manga](/s "Oh no no no... that wasn't advice given due to her recognising his value. That was due to boredom and convenience, since she wanted something in return, unlike help from all the others, who did it for the sake of their appreciation of Soma and due to their good will towards him. You say she finally came to realize that Souma has cooking skills, which is kind of true, but I say, she was kind of the last one to do so, and after seeing how he almost won the autumn election, it's kind of hard to claim he's a two-cents cook after that. Still doesn't change the fact that she looks down on him, by maintaining her holier than thow attitude, like the last chapters with the chinese food, when she sees his lack of knowledge in the matter, she considers him of lower class of cooks because he wasn't born into a rich family in the food industry. She doesn't consider him a lucky commoner, right... she now consider him an average skilled commoner. She never takes to consider one second, how she might be better because she was born into that family. Nope. She still thinks she's that god-like figure in the cooking business, which is, as I mentioned, stuck up. She might not be as bad in the manga as she is in the anime, but she's still pretty fucking bad. Hishoko might be the medium to finally break her hime/tsun side to a more casual side, but damn, it's already long overdue. She tried to get rid of him from the school quite a few times, which is kind of a moral event horizon in that context. If SnS gets to have a conclusion to the harem debacle, and it turns out to be Erina because that's the himedere story they are trying to tell, I am going to be severely disappointed.")

I have no idea what you're trying to say.

What I'm trying to say is the moon being in the OP doesn't mean much.

The moon itself doesn't but when they pan up to it you see the ceiling of the moon stadium.

[manga](/s "wait, isn't the moon stadium at the finals? And the autumn election is ~30 chapters. That would mean 6 chapters/episode, which I don't think is even possible")
>> ARTICLE
Yes that is 100 percent correct.
>> ARTICLE
I mean they COULD squeeze it in if they really rushed the prep time before the prelims and had had each episode cover a couple rounds of elections. However i really dont see it happening since the show is taking its time with pacing so far and trying to fit in that much would really throw it off. Also if they did that i think they would be catching up too much to the manga and messing up our chances of a season 2 any time soon.

Hey I didn't expect Vietnamese cuisine here. I Was wondering why the sauce randomly had fish sauce in it, and banh xeo would explain it.

For those who don't know, banh xeo is effectively a savory-focused crepe. There are a few differences to a normal crepe though. The exterior and edges tend to be crispy as balls, while the interior is fluffy (or spongey depending on the person who makes it) as fuck.

It's also balls easy to make and is nice to use when you have a bunch of leftover bullshit in your fridge and you don't know what to make with it all before they expire.

God I started watching this show last Tuesday and was caught up by Wednesday night. I was sad and told myself "YOU CANNOT READ THE MANGA UNTIL THE SHOW IS OVER". So everyday is going to be a psychological battle with myself over me not pressing on the manga pages I have bookmarked. I won't, I won't, I won't. I've been trying to find other anime I can watch until the new episodes come out but I always find myself rewatching my favorite parts of the show. The opening is stuck in my head and I'm constantly singing it. I need help.
>> ARTICLE
I lost the psychological battle after ep 10 I think or whatever ep it was he challenged the French chef to a shokugeki.  That moment was too damn hype so read the manga after that. Now it's painful waiting for weekly manga chapters!   Shokugeki is too damn good! 
>> ARTICLE
I like the cooking advisor cameo-ing as the judge lady.

KAWAII
>> ARTICLE
Just picked up the show yesterday, and now am caught up.  Was anyone else getting a few Kill la Kill vibes from this show?  Maybe I am just crazy but I swear the hotel had a disco theme whenever it was shown and and the scene got very Blumenkranz-y in atmosphere (Like you are in the presense of a god type feeling).

I love "climb your way to the top" types of shows so this show definitely has my interest now.
>> ARTICLE
Still hyped for Autumn Election even though they can't fit it in the last few episodes. Can't wait for best guy Hayama. 
>> ARTICLE
This show makes me laugh and want to cook. I can't ask for more.
>> ARTICLE
Guys this is seriously a problem. What the fuck are we going to do when this season ends? I need more
>> ARTICLE
For real, though, what's the cooking show for Fall 2015? We've had 3 straight seasons of over the top food anime and I don't think I can handle going into withdrawal.

Maybe it'd be a good time to schedule a *Yakitate!! Japan* rewatch?
>> ARTICLE
Harass JC Staff for a season 2. Though if they are playing their cards right, they'll have a strong Season 2.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished binge-reading the manga, and it's really interesting how they end up in roughly the same place but take slightly different routes.  I was worried that I wouldn't like the show as much after reading the manga but if anything I appreciate the differences between the two storytelling methods in addition to the show itself.
>> ARTICLE
After reading the Manga I love the show even more, seeing the food in actual color rather than black and white helps as well.
>> ARTICLE
That karaage looks so good. Good to see Souma & Nikumi working together, instead of against each other for a change. I find it funny how Eizan and Erina are so full of themselves yet they're the two lowest-ranking members of the ET. 
>> ARTICLE
Well Erina is a 1st year, so she has more right to be proud of herself than the others. I don't know of any other 1st years on the Elite Ten.
>> ARTICLE
There aren't, Erina is the only first year to ever make it into the Elite Council in the history of Tootsuki.
>> ARTICLE
Nikumi is best tsundere! 
>> ARTICLE
Everything is part of Aizen's plan. Even Eizan's name is an anagram for Aizen.
>> ARTICLE
I think we have 6 episodes left will they be able to get the full Autumn Election Arc in?
>> ARTICLE
Nah, but i think the preliminaries fit, but that would mean a huge cliffhanger...
>> ARTICLE
Strong sequel hook right there. JC Staff will burn if they don't animate season 2 - The Autumn Election Final 8 Battles.
>> ARTICLE
Well, they are showing every details from the manga, which is great since it is pretty boring to see the food in black and white...
It's also amazing to see how they cover all the dishes from various parts of the world with such intricate details...
>> ARTICLE
I really, REALLY shouldn't watch this now that I'm on a diet...
>> ARTICLE
I want Soma's karaage now.
>> ARTICLE
I swear in the beginning at around the 4 min 30 sec mark I heard a Dishonored sound effect... (the one when you're noticed by enemies)

Ok I lied, I actually really love the new OP and ED. In my opinion they're both as good as the first  Op and Ed
>> ARTICLE
welcome to the friend zone Kurase!
>> ARTICLE
anyone know what chapters are adapted in this episode? there are plenty of source for season 2 right?? but waiting a year or up can be hard so il start the Manga  after this season :D
>> ARTICLE
Well at the pace the show is going, season 2 may not even reach where the manga is at currently. So there's more than enough source material, and popular Jump Mangas normally get multiple seasons 
>> ARTICLE
This is around chapter 39.  There are currently 129.
>> ARTICLE
When Soma used street smarts to get business and spread appeal, was anyone reminded of Onizuka and how he did a similar thing with Toroko.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit confused by the outro, maybe the LN readers can fill me in though. I mean it concentrates on Erina but we've only 6 episodes left and her and Soma seem miles apart. So unless there's massive development between the two over the coming episode's (which might be hard given that Soma has the elections) is it not a bit pointless? Or are they setting up for some romantic interest in a second season?
>> ARTICLE
SNS is based on a manga series, not a LN series. But anyways, nope, Erina is just basically an Ascended Extra. She gets a lot of screentime in promotional materials and op/ed, but she appears much less than say, Tadakoro. She's finally begun to *very slightly* warm up to Souma in recent chapters, but not really.
>> ARTICLE
Just to add on though, there's tons of hints that she'll get a crap load of character development at some point and get much more screentime. 

Off topic, I kinda like how their relationship is taking it's time. Not like your average tsun changes overnight bc the MC did a good thing type deal that's usually seen. Feels a lot more natural. 
>> ARTICLE
With all this "best girl" talk, does anyone know if the anime/manga will have actual romance? I always get frustrated about the way most animes deal with relationships, they always hint it but nothing happens or it only happen in the end of the series. Why couldn't Souma just give a kiss to the poor girl and then go on with his life?
>> ARTICLE
Literally ate before watching this ep and I feel like I'm starving now. All I want is some of that karaage.
>> ARTICLE
For manga readers,

I think they will cover up to chapter 60 , 61 would be a better end though :) .
>> ARTICLE
THIS ANIME NEEDS A SEASON 2. I WANT MORE FOOD, PORN AND FOOD PORN

Is it me or the ED singer become better. I NEED ANSWERS!!

>> ARTICLE
You're the reason I listen to the ED after skipping it.

1:30 secs wasted.
>> ARTICLE
Guess they'll explain later what elections are
>> ARTICLE
That whole overturning and coming back around to kick some ass and revive the shopping strip was soooooo satisfying as fuck to watch :).  Soma can cook his non-experimental stuff for my unhealthy ass anytime lol, if only I could magically pull him from the anime medium and have him as a personal chef :(.
>> ARTICLE
This. Stuff. Is. Intense.
>> ARTICLE
Well this was a nice little mini-arc, although it didn't really add anything to the show. There wasn't really any further development of the characters, besides maybe Kurase, and I highly doubt that the events of the last two episodes will be relevant later on. But you know what? It was all worth it for that Karaage. Never before have I wanted to eat some fictional food more than this.
>> ARTICLE
Is it me or is the Mozuya lady kinda hot? I wouldn't mind having a tap 
>> ARTICLE
Man it's so frustrating to wait a week, just to watch a 23 minutes long episode. When I started to watch this anime, a lot of episodes were already released and I watched them all in a row and it was a fantastic experience, it's probably one of favourite animes. I think I will wait longer now, so that I can watch more than just one episode. 

>> ARTICLE
Omg I just saw this episode. I can't imagine combining Banh Xeo with Karaage!
>> ARTICLE
We need Megumi now!!!
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god, i want to try this out too. What they invent in the Shopping District.. Please tell me, there are ones, and not only in the Anime... i am drooling to take a bite

Well how can she win against brea-I mean best girl Nikumi.

A character that appears in like 3 episodes total can never win... Right Nikumi?

3 episode total.. So far 
,  bet they gonna use her niku on air again
>> ARTICLE
You shut your filthy whore mouth
>> ARTICLE
;_; she never stood a chance. The fact she believes she isn't good enough makes it even sadder. 

EDIT: Mayu don't believe in yourself. Believe in Aki who believes in you! Also since Soma plans on keeping the diner, Mayu might actually have a better chance than most childhood friends.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah....no. Not really. Definitely not. Index III would outshine anything they can show in Railgun III. There are[spoiler for novels](/s "Document of Constantine arc, Battle Royale Arc, Acqua of the Back Arc, British Halloween/British Civil War Arc, DRAGON Arc, and lastly World War III Arc."). Railgun III would only have one canon arc and the rest would be stupid ass fillers so....no.
>> ARTICLE
If they brought Touma up to the levels of badass that people say he reached in the LN, then I'd actually be all for it. As it stands, half the arcs in Index I and II bored me. Railgun, despite the filler, kept me more entertained.

and then feel the same despair when you're caught up....

No!

That despair is exactly why I haven't started it. I'm not a big manga fan, but God is it tempting. The thing is I can tolerate keeping myself hyped and waiting for a new episode every week, but if I marathoned the manga I would be crushed when I caught up due to the commitment placed on reading it all.
>> ARTICLE
this is what happened to me with One Punch Man... 2-3 weeks per chapter and the occasional 5 page chapters are the worst 
>> ARTICLE
Could be worse, you could be reading Nisekoi. Every chapter ends looking like some actual plot is going to happen, then they always find a way for nothing to actually change. ever. 170 chapters of this, still going.
>> ARTICLE
And if your reading One-Punch man and Nisekoi it just gets worse. Not to mention GATE which gets only one new chapter each month. The only reason I'm not reading Shokugeki no Souma is because I don't want to loose the suspense for the show.

I did not know true suffering until i realized what GATE's release schedule was.

Poor Nikumi.  She just wants to use her A5 beef. :(

Think about it... she said 3500 yen per 100g.

**That's almost $160 per pound**

And that's at a wholesale discount.

But I've had beef that's vaguely comparable to a5 level and it was life changing so I can see the appeal.

Still cheap for what it is. If someone offered me a quarter pound of A5 for $40, I'd absolutely buy it.

This show continues to be awesome! Can't wait for Fall Elections. Although I'm sad we don't have a lot of episodes left. I hope this show gets renewed for a 2nd season sooner rather than later.
>> ARTICLE
You and me both! This anime has been really popular and it actaully was one of the first anime I have ever seen while it was airing. I want to stay optimistic about Season 2 chances, I cant really comment on it though since I haven't read the source material to know if they will have enough content to animate. But I am keeping my fingers crossed!
>> ARTICLE
It has 129 chapters this week and going by the pace of around 2 chapters per episode I'd say they have more then enough to animate. 
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! That makes me really hopeful, I guess all that's left is to see if it has enough sales I'm not sure how popular it is in Japan, but I feel like it will sell well!
>> ARTICLE
It's like top 15 or top ten in japan and still on the rise.
>> ARTICLE
The elections could basically be an entire season if they wanted to do it that way (it's about 60 chapters long), and there's plenty of material that happens afterwards to finish out a second season if need be. And by the time all of that airs there will be enough manga material to make a third season, probably.
>> ARTICLE
>it's about 60 chapters long

HOLY FUCK HYPE!!

Just gonna continue the emphasize the point by saying that in the manga we're currently at Ch 129.

Karaage arc boys. I hope they don't spend too many episodes on it so they can play the fall elections out properly.

I imagined the karaage lady's voice being different, I'm not sure how I like it. Her serious voice is on point, but her normal uppity, talking-down-to-everyone voice is different than what I pictured in my head. I'm sure it'll grow on me though.
>> ARTICLE
The Autumn Elections are probably going to be a whole season itself with the amount of chapters it contains. The Karaage arc is probably only going to be 2 episodes considering it's around 4 chapters in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
They'll barely even get into it, this Season will probably end after the [spoiler](/s "curry challenge") and leave a huge cliffhanger for everyone as to [spoiler](/s "who wins the battle")
>> ARTICLE
yeah I was worried they were gonna cramp too much of it into the remaining episodes but knowing that they are spending 2 eps on the Karage arc, it will certainly end with the [Mangaspoiler] (/s "Curry Pre-eliminaries where Hayama already shines, explaining the opening")
>> ARTICLE
The election arc is over 60 chapters, they are going to need another season if they want to show the entire thing.
>> ARTICLE
They'll likely just wrap this season up with the preliminaries for the Autumn Election.
>> ARTICLE
That's the conclusion I came to as well based on the current pace.

2 years ago I could only defend myself in the kitchen. Two weeks ago, I made my first pesto sauce from scratch, and, dare I say, it was very fucking good. I can now cook any kind of meat, whether it be propane or electric stove, or propane or charcoal grill. Pasta is super easy. Rice is not difficult. I'm dying to make pizza from scratch. I even want to try my hand at desserts.

Look up recipes on the internet, buy the ingredients, secure the utensils, and start cooking. After some time, you'll start modifying recipes to your liking, to the point of making them your own.

I would if I had the money to afford A-5 beef for 3500 yen per 100 grams.
>> ARTICLE
cooking is cheaper then eating out. You really don't need to buy expensive stuff to make some thing wonderful.
>> ARTICLE
Did Soma teach you nothing, you don't need expensive meat or fancy ingredients!

You want meat - fresh pork is relatively cheap.  Buy some, put it in a crock pot with equal parts lemon juice, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.  Use a rub if you want but we're going bare bones here.  Add a teaspoon of pepper, I love pepper.  Buy some minced garlic and add a couple tablespoons.  Add a couple tomatoes chopped into eigths.  Let it cook for a few hours, idk let's say at least six.  2 hours before you want to eat get the biggest pot you have and put it on the stove.  Quarter 2-3 pounds of potato into it, add a bag of baby carrots, chop an onion or two in (doesn't need to be small, you could even just 8th it), some celery stalks.  K, now add two cups of milk and fill the rest with water so everything submerges (but keep track of how many cups).  Add enough beef (my preference), vegatable, pork, chicken bullion to be in line with the number of cups of water + milk you added.  Start heating it, it'll take awhile to get boiling.  While it's struggling to boil add a tablespoon or two of parsley, teaspoon black pepper, ~~teaspoon or two~~ fuck it do a tablespoon of garlic, teaspoon black pepper, three bayleaves.  I might be forgetting a few spices, whatevs this isn't written down.  Stir (or try to).

While it's struggling to boil pull out the pork and shred the shit with a pair of forks, try some, marvel at your awesomeness for making something like this, put it back in the crock pot.  Let it crock while you wait for the boiling stew.  Once the stew is boiling stir some more and let it boil until the potatoes fall apart.  Reduce it (boil water off) enough to fit the stuff in the crock pot.  Add the crock pot goodness to the pot, stir and let boil another Idk 15 minutes.  Eat that shit.
>> ARTICLE
Can you convert this recipe to substitute the crock pot and stove for a microwave?
>> ARTICLE
No, but a rice cooker will also kind of work. 
>> ARTICLE
No :(

For you I suggest /r/shittyfoodporn
>> ARTICLE
I was kidding, I have no money.

Thanks though!
>> ARTICLE
Seriously though, rice and beans with cheap meat (stew pork is cheaper than ground beef) is going to be way more filling than any kind of fast food/pre-prepped food. Add in cabbage+onion or other vegetables for a nice balanced stew. Really recommend the onions as filler, especially if you brown them beforehand. Spices are actually *really* cheap if you pick the right kinds. Pepper, salt, garlic (or garlic powder) are all you really need for it to taste okay.

I made a "small" pot of stew and it was good for 3 days of food. If that sounds boring, freezing portions for later also works.

The new ED is really growing on me, starting to love it now, but the OP is still kind mediocre compared to the first one. I hope it can grow on me!
>> ARTICLE
I loved the first OP. The new one is kinda generic sounding imo. Not bad, but not quite as good.
>> ARTICLE
I love that new ED! There's just something really nice about the imperfect way that song is sung.
>> ARTICLE
The first OP emphasized the journey through the various ingredients and tools from which you start. Gradually starting to make something awesome.

The second OP emphasized the characters and their battles.
>> ARTICLE
The first OP is still stuck in my head. That tune just pops into my ears from time to time, it won't be forgotten so easily.
>> ARTICLE
That is very interesting considering that the popular opinion is that the OP is way better than the 1st one and the ED here is "bad."


Personally I like both of them a lot.
>> ARTICLE
The ED is only 'bad' compared to ED1 which is prob my favorite ED of any anime ever
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even realize people thought the first OP was bad. Can't say that the new one is all that bad it just doesn't give me the same excitement that the original did.
>> ARTICLE
No one thinks the first OP is bad by any means. They just think that the 2nd one is better than the 1st.

The 2nd ED is pretty polarizing however. 
>> ARTICLE
Ahh okay my bad I misspoke when I said bad, but I do know what you mean.... I'll probably like the OP more as the show goes on! 

I do agree that the new ED is really polarizing now!
>> ARTICLE
Same, I thought the general consensus was the first opening sounded nicer and made everything hyped as hell. I haven't seen anyone praise the second OP until now (mostly I hear it sounds generic), but maybe we've all seen different communities.
>> ARTICLE
Yep my though's exactly! When the first OP started I couldn't help but get pumped for the next 20 minutes. Kinda wish they did what baby steps did and reuse the song but have a different opening animation!
>> ARTICLE
Or do what Hunter x Hunter does and use the same opening song throughout its run, re-covered by the same artist. Shokugeki's first OP will forever be "*the*" Shokugeki opening forever and always.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen HxH but I have been meaning to! Really need to start it soon!
>> ARTICLE
You'll hear a lot of HxH recommendations around these parts. The 2011 version is a masterfully adapted series, and while there are many *great* shows, there may only a handful of adapted series that reach this level of near-perfection.

The length may be an issue for some, but I say roll with it and take your time. o/
>> ARTICLE
Gaaah again! all deez hxh recs! I need to (re)start it soon I guess... How many episodes until it turns good? (I dropped out at like a dozen)
>> ARTICLE
Lol that was better than what I did. I heard about HxH back when when it had maybe 5 episodes, tried episode 1, and promptly dropped for *years* until saw rave reviews. I personally thought the anime picked up in the later stages of the hunter exam (~20ish?) and into the Zoldyck stuff.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest I have been looking for some longer anime to watch so I can watch something for a longer period of time (that is why I am planning on starting One Piece fairly soon)!
>> ARTICLE
The ED gets me hyped for Stalker-chan, can't wait to meet her.

No idea who Stalker is but you're getting hyped so I need to get hyped too!

Do you watch the ED or just listen to it?  Stalker's the one with the red eyes watching them the whole ED.
>> ARTICLE
I want some karaage now...
>> ARTICLE
I know, I like the texture of Karrage chicken because it puts less emphasis on the "fried part" and more emphasis on the meat flavor.
>> ARTICLE
Today is the Karaage arc huh...

I dunno what to type about, so I guess I'll talk about Karaage because it's one of my favorite snack foods.

Karaage is a favorite snack food of my sister and I, we always had been competitive to see who are the most. It has a different texture compared to most fried foods, being less crunchy but having the meat a lot more juicy.

Fun fact about Karaage:  supposedly, an urban legend stated that Tatsuta-Age, a way to prepare Karaage (the meat is marinated before adding the potato starch flour used to fry),was supposedly invented by the head chef of the IJN Tatsuta.  (For those of you who play Kancolle, yes, THAT Tatsuta).  The form of Karaage was so delicious that the crew called their special Karaage Tatsuta style age, which shortened down to Tatsuta-age.  However, as it is an urban legend, we do not know if it is true, but I thought it was interesting to share.

Edit: Grammar.
>> ARTICLE
nice, I loved your comment :_)
>> ARTICLE
This episode was awesome. Great reactions, great overreactions, everything.

I also like how differently the girls all treat Soma. Megumi respects Soma for his cooking skills and his attitude, Kurase because she feels like Soma has talent while she's not, Nikumi just has an absolute crush on him...

Also found it really funny how we got two boob shots of Nikumi as Soma was remembering her. Plus [pretty sure that Nikumi wants the same thing to happen just in a slightly different setting...](http://imgur.com/aTW1fSs)
>> ARTICLE
Poor Kurase just met the (not really) first of many girls that Soma has lured into his foodgasm trap
>> ARTICLE
Nikumi's Tsundereness this episode has brought her up +2 best girl points. 
>> ARTICLE
to be honest after hearing the ending a few times im beginning to love it 
>> ARTICLE
i love it too. the thing is, they changed several things about it after the first episode it was shown, (probably due to the bad reception) including the singing. It sounds much better now and im sure a lot of people skip it now after hearing the original. they dont know what theyre missing!
>> ARTICLE
Why can't there be like 600 eps of this show for me to marathon?
>> ARTICLE
Nikumi trying to be all tsundere is adorable. This episode felt super short, can't wait to find out what Soma has planned to attract students. Is he going to go for a full meal or will it be novelty karaage?

I like how we're still getting some Totsuki development despite being on holiday. Hopefully more of the gang turn up later.
>> ARTICLE
Nikumi is definitely best girl.
>> ARTICLE
For while in this episode, I was thinking Mayu stood a chance as the childhood friend; despite the lack of confidence, she has an overt romantic interest which is a major point.

Then, Nikumi bounced onto the screen and I remembered that there's at least three of other girls I'd root for and now fully understand all the pity and sympathy comments I saw here before starting the episode.

*You never stood a chance, Mayu...*
>> ARTICLE
No Megumi :'( We got Megumi lite instead. 
>> ARTICLE
Putting the jimi in osananajimi.
>> ARTICLE
No ones probably gonna see this as its been nearly a day since airing, but does it sound like the ending is sounding better? Sounds like the singing was better this time. I'll have to go and compare it to when it first aired. It could be because I had the volume up more so I heard it fuller and clearer
>> ARTICLE
this felt like an episode of nisekoi. You got the "New girl" related to America and is also tsundere and blonde (Nikumi), you got the "childhood friend" dark hair and shy(Kurase) and you got clueless MC who doesn't know the 2 girls like him and is good at cooking
>> ARTICLE
The difference is that he has a reason to be oblivious. He needs to save his hometown from the Karaage invasion and he can't be distracted by Nikumi's tits or stick his A5 beef into anyone. 
>> ARTICLE
Nikumi was adorable this episode!
>> ARTICLE
Mayumi huh? Sorry but the there's plenty of best girls already : Megumi, Nikumi, Alice... Still better than Erina though... Then again that's not hard to accomplish. 

I'm kind of curious what is Souma's ideea for the new "Karaage of Youth". 
>> ARTICLE
Now I feel like eating karaage...
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully he won't subject his childhood friend to "new" food combinations before he heads back to school...the tentacles and peanut butter combo gave the poor girl nightmares :(
>> ARTICLE
> the tentacles and peanut butter combo gave the poor girl nightmares

Did it? Or did it simply [open up new pleasures for her](http://i.imgur.com/uZBig2W.jpg)?
>> ARTICLE
Man, new elite ten members!!! Sugoi!!!

And Nikumi is fulfilling the blonde tsundere part really good. Kurase is going to try and fill in the gap of Megumi, her personality is kinda the same but Megumi is way more cute.

Maybe I'll read the manga once this anime ends. I really love this series.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who thinks there's a lot of character overlap between Kurase and Tadokoro? They're both shy, clumsy, ordinary, soft-spoken girls who are too scared to express themselves to Souma.
>> ARTICLE
god damn I really like this show. Maybe it's because it's the first food related anime I've ever seen, but something about this show makes me hype af. It's not a masterpiece or anything but it's so entertaining. I'm glad I gave it a chance last week, sucks that I have to wait all week for new episodes now though.
>> ARTICLE
Man Nikumi is so best girl, and it hurts me to know that she'll never get it.
.
.
.
My only consolation is that considering the type of anime we'll probably never get a definitive conclusion to that.
>> ARTICLE
I never get tired of Nikumi's reaction to seeing Kurase. +1 Harem member. That's 4 girls for Souma already 2 Tsundere and 2 shy ones

>> ARTICLE
fuck cliffhangers, this and gate... Jesus atleast i was expecting one to make me orgasm
>> ARTICLE
Crap, this one was really good. Time to read the manga then.
>> ARTICLE
And so the girl from the first episode makes her return.

I suspected that she might appear again based on the fact that they stuck her delayed reaction to the squid at the end of episode 1.

Also, I finally figured out that her VA voices Kominato Ruuko in Selector. Sounds like despair and cute.
>> ARTICLE
You know, I've really liked Kurase from the get go. No apparent reason, just the type of characters I like. I really wish we'd get more of her, or from Yukihira's home in general.

In any case, can't get enough of how thrilling each episode is. Even those that are more build-up like this had me at the edge of my seat, filled with child-like excitement. The CEO's serious / threatening persona was extraordinarily good. I seriously can't wait for the Fall Election.
>> ARTICLE
So, what's up with the Crunchyroll translation at 17:30 when Soma says, "Knead the marinade in to breast meat chunks" ?  I thought karaage was normally made from chicken thighs, not breasts, since thighs are fattier and more succulent.

The only thing is that the MC is Dense as Fuck when it comes to women... He's got his harem and isn't even aware of it. :-/
>> ARTICLE
Shounen Jump series are special. They get anime because the manga are already popular and the anime is meant to boost those sales further. If you look at every anime adaptation they've had, every one of them got two or more seasons.

Poor Mayu. The plight of the childhood friend never ends.  
Nikumi being jealous was adorable. Souma's slowly building up his harem.
>> ARTICLE
I was seriously scared that they were cutting this arc out entirely originally (because it happens before Jouichirou comes back in the manga) but holy shit was I happy when this popped up. Kansai chick is best girl.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how they can spoil that much of Autumn Election in OP and animate it in 7 ep.
>> ARTICLE
so there are people who actually watch op? o_O 
>> ARTICLE
Fine, I'll read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I've missed the last few conversations about this! I love the new OP, more so than the old one I think, and the ED is growing on me although it's no Spice!

It's not far from where I am in the manga now so I doubt I'll see much new stuff, but J.C.Staff have done a consistently fantastic job with this. Food Wars! deserves a second season. I want the OST to release already!

Ikumiiiii <3

[Elite Ten Spoiler](/s "Eizan-Hype")
>> ARTICLE
For me, SnS need only 1 more thing to be a perfect show: spanish cuisine. Not joking, spanish cuisine is one of the bests in the world, but I know it's not very well known around the world.

EDIT: I'm heavily downvoted so, [read this.](http://www.traveller.com.au/the-best-country-in-the-world-for-food-gihsmi)
>> ARTICLE
I have some good news for you.  [Manga spoilers](/s "Apparantly, the first seat (Or maybe fifth, I'll have to check the recent manga chapters again) of the elite ten specializes in Spanish cuisine.  Considering Shokugeki No Soma is going through Soma's attempt to challenge the elite 10 to move higher up the rank, you may just get your wish fulfilled.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "As far as I am aware, the only known Spanish Cuisine Chef revealed is Taki. We still don't know most of the specialties of the Elite Ten")
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember them pointing out any of the elite ten's specialities (other than certain someone but its not spanish)... I checked their introduction in the manga and their wiki pages and didn't find anything... If you find the chapter I'd like to know :)

Edit: Ok, so I dug a little more into it and found that [Spoiler](/s "Taki Tsunozaki the previous 2nd seat who graduated in the 88th generation opened her spanish restaurant right after graduation. She was a guest judge at Soma's and Mimasaka's election match/shokugeki. She said she would have lynched Mimasaka for spitting on Takumi's mezzaluna if you remember.")

>> ARTICLE
I'm trying to find it right now, [ ](/s "but I remember EXPLICITLY one of the elite ten members specializing in Spanish Cuisine (Or was working with the Spanish research club) so it's a likely hint that particular Elite 10 Member specializes in Spanish food.")
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! I would love to see some plates of my country in this awesome show :P
>> ARTICLE
I know how you feel man.  You're Spanish (Judging by your comment), and your neighbor is France, the reigning King of formal cuisine and a leader in the culinary world.  France produces many chefs that would become known throughout the entire world, and the food industry also drives a lot of the tourist industry.  It's only natural that your country would get overshadowed.  You are basically the average, hardworking dude and your next door neighbor is like that rich jerk whose house has like parties every day but you never get invited because you're too poor despite working hard.

But don't worry, someday, France will shaken up and loosen its grip on the food industry, and then people look for more foods to try out.

 As an Asian, our cultures always get overshadowed by Chinese.  Whenever we think Asian food, Chinese comes to mind.  But then the Chinese food slips from being the definitive "Asian food" and other countries will sweep in and take advantage about it.  This happened with the Japanese food boom here in California (Why a lot of Californians get interested in sushi), the Vietnamese are going through one right now, the Koreans also are trying to fill in the gaps.

As the years go by, France will slip up, and I'm SURE the Spanish would take the opportunity to introduce authentic Spanish Cuisine to the world.  The Italians did it, and I'm sure the Spanish will do the same.

I'm guessing he'll go with karaage on a skewer so it's portable.

CEO is scary, they made her so over-the-top bitchy it's hilarious.  I wish it had shown us what seat the new guy is, I'm guessing he's lower than Issiki though.  The humor in this show, god damn I love it.  Two favorite moments from this episode are Soma and the Chairman "Seconds." "Oi." and Soma's reaction to 3500 yen for 100 g ($128.12 per lb...that can't be right, I'll try again after reading through the discussion).

Edit:  Okay so 3500 yen = 28.2452 USD  
100g = .220462 lb  
Now, price per pound should be the price per 100g divided by .220462, so 28.2452/.220462 = 128.12 (rounded to nearest cents place)  
USD/~~g~~ = ~~g~~/lb for the units.  I haven't taken a math course since 2011 but I'm pretty sure I didn't mess up here, wtf.

That's sounds right. Kobe beef (aka Wagyu Beef) is about 300 dollars per pound in the real world at normal price.

I weighed my XBox360 copy of Skyrim, 3.7 oz, that's .23125 lb.  Paid $60 for it + 7% tax = $64.20

>> ARTICLE
Isshiki's VA cracked me up with the "eating watermelon 'summer break'" take.
>> ARTICLE
Out of all the recipes listed I only have: onion, water, salt, garlic

>> ARTICLE
You can make some kick ass garlic fried onions with that. They would go well with a lot of easy dishes that anyone can make. 

Bring the water up to a boil and then blanch the onions for a few minutes. Take them out and immediately put them in a bowl filled with ice and water. Now, cut up the onions and garlic to your desired size for the dish you have in mind. From there toss everything into a pan season with salt and fry them up until they start to crisp up. Shouldnt take too long. About 2-3 minutes. Just keep an eye on it and keep moving everything to ensure a nice even fry on all sides. And now you have a nice and delicious topping for burgers (Or any beef product) or something you can mix in with rice. 

Something I like to do with them is to put them in a burger. The garlic and the onions help to suck up some of the oil when you are cooking the patties. For this recipe get some nice ground beef. The higher the fat content the better. Around 80/20% lean/fat ratio is usually what I use. So to prepare the ground beef, put it in a bowl and mix in your onions and garlic, and then some seasoning. I usually use some Cayenne pepper, black pepper, and a pinch of salt. (only a tiny bit of salt since you already used some in the onions from earlier) Finally crack an egg into the meat and mix it in well. This will help bind everything together. 

From there, separate into even sized patties and make sure to put a little depression in the center as when the patties are cooking they tend to bulge up. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD YOU PRESS DOWN ON THE PATTY TO FLATTEN IT OUT. This forces all the juices out of the meat and leaves it dry and bland At this point most of the flavor is in the oils and removing them from the meat will remove the flavor as well. After roughly 5 minutes cooking on each side in medium to high heat it should be done and ready to serve. For the bun, I recommend brushing with olive oil and frying in the same pan as the burgers for a few seconds and then serving. Once the burger and bun is cooked, it should be ready to serve. Top it however you wish and enjoy.

Decision of a lifetime right here.

* Megumi

* Alice

* Oppai-Loli-Sensei

Choose one.

Megumi has some great qualities. She would make a great wife and would make any man she marries happy to the end of their days.

Alice while arguably the best looking of the three and is rich as fuck, is way too caught up in her own ego to make the jump from best girl to bestest girl.

Oppai-loli-sensei is well...a loli with decent sized tits. Easily this would shoot her into first place in my book. EXCEPT for the fact that she is too caught up in her own work and would likely forget you even exist at times to even think about romance. 

It really is an easy choice. Megumi all the way.

We finally get to the Autumn elections arc.

I'm desperately trying not to go too far in these discussions since I read the manga and know what happens, so I end up talking about food more often.  Also, no new chapter for shokugeki no soma :(.

I will say though that the Autumn Elections does introduce many likable characters, and has some of my favorite moments in the story so far. 

But Id figure Ill talk about curry spices and curries, one of my favorite ingredients and foods.

Curry spices are some of my favorite ingredients of all time, mostly because of how vague the definition of Curry is and how much history there is behind the curry spices, which I wrote on a bit of the history of, which involved quite a bit of Japan as well, so I think you guys will be interested in reading it!   I even wrote a bit of the history on curry rice, fro the curious.

You see, curry powders are very vague in definition. Some curry powders contain completely different spices to flavor different meats (For example, a curry used to flavor fish would contain different spices compared to chicken).  When most people think Curry powder, people assume that curry powder comes from one spice, but in reality many spices are grounded up and put into curry.  The spice most people usually think of when they think of curry is usually turmeric, which gives it that yellow color that people are familiar with.   One thing Im glad that Shokugeki No Soma does is that they got that fact in on how there are several varieties of spices used to put in curry, and not go on the stereotype of one curry spice. 

Now on to a bit of the history of curry:

The history of curry spices that led to the spread to many of the world began when the British in their imperialistic period occupied India.  When India was occupied by Britain, curry spices were some of the most transported goods in Britain, right behind tea.  And just like Tea, British people ended up making their own versions of curry.  Britain is the main cause of why many groups in Europe and countries like Japan (More on that later) know about curry and the spices,  Even today, curry is probably the most eaten food there that isnt British in origin, partially due to the fact that the biggest minority population of Britain are the Indians and the British love of curry is second to tea.
 
Now how did Japan get curry rice did get into the Japanese diet?   
Before we move on to that, lets talk about Japanese food for a bit.

Curry rice is in the Japanese cuisine group called Yoshoku Or western inspired cooking.   The main difference between Yoshoku and Washoku is that Washoku is purely traditional Japanese syle, Using local Japanese ingredients, fish for protein as usually Washoku does not use land animal meat, 1/3rd of it is due to ancient Japanese had a thing against eating land animals, the Tokugawas and their Buddhist worshipping making meat consumption taboo and availability)  and traditional techniques in their presentation of the dish.  Such dishes would include sushi, for example.  Yoshoku is a food group that came after the Tokugawas were overthrown, and the food uses meat (mostly to show that Japan was entering the new age), has foreign spices, ingredients,  (Like curry) and foreign techniques to cook the food.  Foods known for being in the Yoshoku group is curry rice, Hayashi, Gyudon, basically anything that contains beef, pork, and chicken.

Somas cooking or the Don RS Club, for example is Yoshoku in style, while Hinako (Judging by her Autumn Challenge on using nature, considering an important part of Traditional Japanese cuisine is to combine mountain vegetables and sea ingredients together) is Washoku in style. 

Basically the golden thumb for the rule to tell them apart is that usually Washoku uses fish and Yoshoku uses meat and foreign spices.

Now there are many origins on where Curry rice came from, but the most commonly accepted origin about Currys introduction to the Japanese is that like how Britain introduced curry spices to the European nations, Britain and Japan traded and curry eventually became part of the Japanese diet.   

When Japan broke out of their 200 year isolation away from the world and overthrown the Tokugawas, they needed to improve the nation to defend against imperialistic threats.   So they turned to the British for advice.  The Japanese and British then had a very close friendship with each other, with Japanese sending many generals to learn naval warfare, European culture and how to build ships and Britain sold many ships to the Japanese, most famously IJN Kongou (Yes, that Kongou), IJN Mikasa, and IJN Wakamiya (the predecessor to the Houshou-class carrier). During this time, the Japanese who admired British clothing and culture also culturally traded many things, which began the era where the Japanese started wearing western clothing and stopped using katanas and used sabers instead (The Katana would eventually come back in the late Taisho/Early Showa rule when Japan became very militaristic and nationalistic to reclaim their identity after thinking they strayed from being too un-Japanese, but thats another story).  During this time, Britain introduced curry to the Japanese, and the Japanese loved the spice.  It naturally, like Nikujaga (another dish influenced by Britain), became immensely popular and thus the curry became part of the Japanese diet.  However, potatoes were added to curry rice later, after a famine. 

Now for those of you who like reading about the Imperial Japanese Navy or play Kancolle, the Imperial Japanese Navy LOVED curry.  Yeah, the curry episode in Kancolle ep 6?  That was real.  Fridays are known as Curry days in both the Imperial Japanese Navy and the modern Japanese Self Defense force, as to tell the time and the fact that curry day was considered the best day in the hellish training the soldiers go through.  There was a phrase that they said that if you had to join the military, the Imperial Navy was slightly better because of the fact that they could use curry to flavor the food (The army was shit out of luck.  Being in the Japanese army was one of the worst armies you can be in).  The navy held curry contests between ship crews.  For those of you who want to know which ships (And your Kanwaifus) were reported to serve the best and worst curries: 

The ship that apparently was reported to serve the best curry is the [Hint: Big eater](/s "Akagi.  Akagis crew reportedly won many of the curry contests and was known for having good curries..")

The ship that apparently was reported to serve the worst curry is the [Hint: Not Hiei](/s "Kaga.  Reportedly Kagas curry was so bad that when a crewmember of the Kaga that got rescued and boarded the Mutsu after the battle of Midway, he said something along the lines of being thankful to never eat that curry again.")

When the Indians became independent after the British pulled their rule out of India, Indian undergone a nostalgia revolution.  Curry recipes long thought forgotten, lost family curry recipes, and the like were being explored and remade again, and thus this caused the massive boom that got many people interested in curry and Indian food.

TIL if I'm sent back in time to ancient Japan I'll get skinny as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. For some reason eating fish is okay, but god forbid you eat land animals (except deer for some reason) in Ancient Japan, especially the Tokugawa Era when the Tokugawas and their Buddhist mass worshipping putting religious laws not to eat meat.  

So when the Tokugawas got overthrown, the first thing they did was unban the consumption of meat and to have Japanese chefs learn the preparation of meat, mostly to give the middle finger to Buddhism.  Kind of like how gay people make out in front of those ultra-religious Christians.

Erina : "You're wrong, I still have a stick up my ass and refuse to acknowledge Souma's skills" 

A lot of Awesome characters have come into the spotlight. Hayama, Ryou, hell, even Nao the stalker. This is going to be epic! 
>> ARTICLE
It will be a while until she acknowledges Soma. The manga would likely be near the end if Erina ever fully accepts Soma.

It has been hinted in the beginning that Erina x Soma will likely be a pair.

In the first chapter, Soma's dad said:

["The secret to being a great chef is meeting a women that will make you want to give all the food you make to her"](http://img.bato.to/comics/2012/11/30/s/read50b845120aae0/img000048.png)

In one of the earliest encounters between soma and erina:

["Wait for it, I'll make you clearly say "it's good" with that mouth of yours"](http://img.bato.to/comics/2012/12/17/s/read50cf05949c365/img000016.png)
>> ARTICLE
Yea, it's a pretty obvious thing, which sucks since erina is worst girl.
>> ARTICLE
I would prefer literally every other girl in the anime over Erina. Even this new stalker girl, she seems legit.
>> ARTICLE
I'd love this because Erina is best girl.
>> ARTICLE
> Soma's dad said :

That could be any woman. Especially Megumi.

> say it's good , god damn it

More like "bitch what did you say my food is bad? I'll show you!". It's beyond annoying to have your food praised by so many (now including top tier chefs), to then have your skills put to question by a stuck up himedere, that by the way is also lying about her not liking his food. 

In the entrance exams, even though she was pleasantly surprised by his egg dish (so, she liked it to some extent), she outright denied him, just because she looks down on him for being a lower class cook. 


I know they are trying to push the story in that direction where she calms down and gets closer to Souma (especially after Souma's dad being her idol), but god damn is will be overdue, and it will be disappointing if the story ends with her "winning the harem". It will be like the worst decision ever.
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna let you finish, but Nikumi was the best girl of the season.
>> ARTICLE
Nice one, Kanye. Though I care that much. Just as long as it's not Erina, pretty much everyone else is fine. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Soma sees it more as a challenge than an insult that Erina didn't like his food. And we all know how much he loves challenges. Finally getting the God's Tongue to say your food is delicious would be quite an achievement. Plus, [Manga Spoiler](/s "In the original oneshot that preceded the series Soma insulted her cooking the first time they met.")

Soma also didn't do himself any favors by mocking Erina at his entrance exam. Everybody knows you don't piss off the person who holds your future in his/her hands.

>> ARTICLE
sorry man, there's someone who's another contender for Megumi hinted at the most recent chapter.
>> ARTICLE
I don't care. Just as long as it's not Erina, anyone is fine. 
>> ARTICLE
Except that in the anime, right after Souma's dad gives that advice to him, they cut to Erina. 
>> ARTICLE
I figured it was a reference more to a rival than a romantic partner.

Man I just want Megumi x Soma to win. Loyalty unto death!
>> ARTICLE
But neither have any romantic interest in each other.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't have to be a romantically paired ending per se. I just like the character dynamic (and loyalty) between the two of them.
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't mean anything since the manga isn't even close to finishing.

They had good sales. That's what makes it different 
>> ARTICLE
First week initial sales:

Nisekoi: 8.1k

Ansatsu: 4.7k

Souma: 1.6k

Those three went **over** their *predicted* sales. How did Souma sell bad? Anyways, it's not even about the BD/DVD sales. It's about how much it helps their respective manga.

Food Wars was below what was predicted for 24 episodes 
>> ARTICLE
Predicted sales was 1,588 BD and 490 DVD.

Source ? Because I know exactly where you got that from and those aren't that actual predictions .

I feel kind of dumb asking this, but what exactly are the elections for? 
>> ARTICLE
It isn't really an election thats just the name, it's more of a tournament that determines the ranking of the first year students, excluding Erina since she is already the 10th seat.
>> ARTICLE
It's just the name of the big tournament held amongst all the 1st years (minus Erina because she's in the elite 10). Those who get to participate are "elected" by the elite 10, hence the name. Essentially the tournament will establish the hierarchy of the 1st years, who's the top of the top and thus most likely to enter into the elite 10 in the future.

And the episode was just amazing. So awesome that episodes without a focus on Souma or Megumi are just as great.


>> ARTICLE
I've found that this is a series that treats it's side characters pretty well, it makes me happy.
>> ARTICLE
One of the strong point of this manga/anime, is that it treats it's side/rival-like characters with respect by giving them proper background and decent leeway to grow.

Whereas most shounen has the common stereotype

- a challenger shows up, massively intimidates some side characters
- gets defeated by MC, then
- a) you never see him/her again
- b) blend into a side character with his/her power level tune down to 10%
  
>> ARTICLE
that would be Nikumi but her power increased by 50% after defeat and she hasn't sided completely with Souma yet.

So... Vegeta?

I love how Nikumi evolved and took what she learned from the DonKen to make her dish, especially the little circle she made to show how donburi should be eaten as a whole! So cute as a tsundere. The rice thing is really important too. Plain rice you can get anywhere with any dish, but what she learned from Soma with the whole circle of rice making them want to eat the meat, meat making them want a break to eat rice thing was important. What I don't get though is how you can serve perfectly cooked vegetables after waiting so long between judgments. They would have wilted at least a little I imagine, but definitely enough to impact judgment.

The green onions on Sakaki's dish really helped to cut the heavy fermented flavors of her dish, but I bet it tasted great still. Everyone's so afraid to try fermented things like natto, but done right, it can taste really good.

I like how they admit Marui's super mediocre, but he's a god at research, so he just researches the hell out of everything and combines what works well. I've attempted a vichyssoise before that turned out really mediocre, but at least his looks good.

Ibusaki's smoked everything looks like it smells really good, similar to Hayama, but he implements more wood and fruit flavors into his dishes. I've had smoked eggs before, the runny centers are slightly firm outsides are really good over rice with some kind of protein to go with.

> I like how they admit Marui's super mediocre, but he's a god at research, so he just researches the hell out of everything and combines what works well.

I love characters like this.  Getting good through busting your ass and being intelligent definitely appeals to me more than the "genius" characters.

I've given this a lot of thought this arc, and my conclusion is just that you have to employ suspension of disbelief.

I like fermented things. Beer is fermented after all.
>> ARTICLE
Natto smells horrible. Even not all Japanese like it. It's not something you'd probably like on first try. But once you get past the smell and the slimy texture, it's breakfast of champions.
>> ARTICLE
No, I've ate it a handful of times, I've never enjoyed it. Though I've only had it professionally prepared once, even then it wasn't amazing. Definitely a acquired taste, and it seems to only be to those who grew up on it. Since it's dirt cheap to prepare and buy.

Doesn't the school have only like a 2 or was it 10% graduation rate. That is going be one hell of a scale they measure students on. They might  be great cooks in their own rights but to do good in that school you have to be on  a far greater level.

It'd be great if they had a running gag of a background character who constantly scores just shy of the named characters. Like even give him a few lines but never have his name mentioned. Maybe even have a character ask his name but he gets cut off before he can say.

Jump manga is good because you know that it's popular enough that you'll get scans every week. Almost everything else gets monthly, delayed extensively, go on hiatus or abandoned.

Besides the explosive organisms how realistic is the shows cooking? Can any chefs confirm it?

I really don't want this series to end, not only because we're not done with the Autumn Election, but also because how incredibly fun it is. They made cooking look more intense than any battle in DBZ or other stuff like that, with impressive physics to boot. Now we have Hayama's judging and Soma's retaliation, I'm super excited.

All the Foodgasms and jiggly bits this week. Seriously was a really good episode, the 2 week wait is gonna kill me though.

Hey can anyone tell me which chapter this episode ended ? I can't take the cliffhanger.
>> ARTICLE
It ends at the beginning of Chapter 58.

But I recommend reading it from the beginning because the artwork is just reaally good. One of the best art I've seen in shonen manga. That and you get to see some skipped scenes like Megumi's pingpong.

The fanservice is strong in this episode

Damn, Umami No Soma truly said goodbye to physics this episode. Stoked for the showdown we've been waiting for in two weeks!

Mentioned this before that this show's hype never stops. I already knew what was gonna happen, but this episode got me super excited and this is only the preliminaries. Trust me when I say again, things will get even better and when this show ends you gotta pick up the manga

Also animated foodgasms always on point... wish I knew how to make gifs to attach to this lol

I can't believe there is only 1 episode left. I don't know how I can have a truly fulfilling Friday without this show.

For those who wants to start the manga . Here is a guideline : 

* Last week covered chapter 56 and 57 and last 2 pages on chapter 55 .
* This week covered chapter 53,54 and 55 .

If you want to be safe, starts at chapter 52 ( beginning of the shift in blocks) . In the manga it shows half of block a and half of block b ( not like that in the anime) .

I wish the original creator would do like a seinen martial arts or battle manga. It'd be amazing. Since this is pretty amazing.
>> ARTICLE
in the manga :

[Just to be safe](/s "There are fews battle scenes illustration between each characters, they look pretty bad ass ")

I don't know if Shun Saeki ( tosh) can draw seinen martial arts or shounen battle manga because his selling point is drawing female characters ( no puns intended here) . His female characters are way better than Kentaro Yabuki's characters ( To love ru/darkness, black cat) in my opinion . 

Just like Yusuke Murata, his main selling points are drawing male characters and action scene (OPM, EyeShield21).

>> ARTICLE
Too damn awesome. Definitely needs a sequel.

At last, we get to see Ryouko Sakaki in action. As for Marui and Ibuki, they were pretty awesome. I was expecting Ibuki to be in the 90's.

Ryo is really cool when he wears the bandanna.

So next week in the finale. Damn, Saturday mornings will never be the same again.

Can someone explain to me why when it comes to the curry arc, frequently the sauces/liquids are being called a roux? Is that just a weird word adoption gone wrong?
>> ARTICLE

* Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on yoghurt, cream, coconut milk, coconut cream, legume pure (dal), or stock
*  Curry sauce is made by frying together curry powder, flour, and oil, along with other ingredients, to make roux; the roux is then added to stewed meat and vegetables, and then simmered until thickened
* Roux  is flour and fat cooked together and used as to thicken sauces.

source : wikipedia . What i take from that is the curry "soup/broth" is not really a soup because it thicks with fat/meat and other stuffs .
>> ARTICLE
No... I know what a roux is... I'm asking why they're calling something that isn't a roux a roux. I mean, I could see it if they were talking about it during the cooking process and someone was in the middle of making a roux for their curry, but it keeps getting used when the dishes are being served, which makes 0 sense. That's why I thought maybe it's one of those things where they've adopted a word into their language and it just doesn't get used properly? Like how they say mansion when referring to a condo unit.
>> ARTICLE
They better announce season 2 at the end of the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
FUCK YEAH, MARUI!
>> ARTICLE
Great display of culinary talent this episode. I love that the female judge kept doing naked orgasms till the end! :D

Too bad some of it was censored with white light. Hopefully the BD will remedy that.

BTW is 'umami' supposed to be some culinary holy grail? The judges kept repeating that word over and over for each dish.

Sad that next episode is the last one. So many awesome and hype moments yet to come. I seriously hope they will consider turning this into a long running anime series like those other big shounen series (One Piece, Naruto etc.). I bet Shokugeki would give them a run for their money! 
>> ARTICLE
It would never beat One Piece. One Piece is in a category of its own.

And I don't think Shokugeki will run for that long, they would eventually catch up to the manga. Which will get you fillers or One Piece pacing.

They simply can't do that. I'm 100% sure it'll end with the prelims, and we won't even get to see the finals.
>> ARTICLE
The finale is for second season. It's pretty obvious they can't fit the entire Autumn election in this season since they are quite long with the pace we're going. 

I'm pretty happy with that honestly since I hate when anime just rushed everything and skipped a lot of details from the manga.

Personally this is my favorite part of the [episode](http://i.imgur.com/GtNVR6b.jpg) 

Those are bros.
>> ARTICLE
I like those two. They're fun. I naturally didn't expect them to qualify for elections but I don't remember actually seeing any examples of their cooking in the anime. (I remember Souma arriving at North Star and having Ibusaki's food and Isshiki's and the girls' but not theirs). 

Out of all the Polar Star roomers they're definitely the least developed (though to be honest - at least in the anime - the other Polar Star kids don't really have much development either), and it seems clear enough that they are nothing in comparison to the big name characters, but the thing is, they passed all their classes and made it through camp and everything, so they can't be too lackluster cooking wise...right?

I want to know what their specialities or interests are when it comes to cooking...frankly at this point I'm pretty sure they exist mostly as comedic relief/to make the Polar Star dorm a bit fuller, which I am not okay with and now I really hope the manga gives the Polar Star roomers a bit more spotlight/credit than they get in general. 

**Edit** I remembered--I think Satou's dish at the party in Marui's room was like a fried shrimp appetizer and Aoki's was a vegetable fritter dish. That doesn't really say too much about their cooking styles (not important enough characters for us to know their styles if they have one?) but maybe Satou's good with either frying food or seafood based dishes? Aoki's harder to make out. Actually, wait a sec, fritters involve frying right? Since the two are so similar, I'm guessing they must both specialize in frying. Well, that's one question kind of resolved. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought one believed fried meat was king, and the other believed in fried vegetables.
>> ARTICLE
The little interactions between the Aldini brothers are my favorite. 
>> ARTICLE
Isami's definitely my favorite Aldini because of how chill he is and how he balances out Takumi. In every arc Takumi's all bark and no bite, while Isami just jumps in and just starts doing stuff. Especially in the most recent arc [](/s "where Soma is running the food cart and Takumi is making a big show of coming to help him while Isami just rolls up in the middle of his speech and asks if he can help boil the noodles") I love that shit.
>> ARTICLE
He also has probably some of the best character development out of the side characters

Prison School, Shokugeki and Shimoneta are my 3 "looking forward every week soon as it comes out" for this season.

There might be long waits between seasons, since the manga needs to have a good amount of float time.
>> ARTICLE
I am curious. Would people mind some filler material if it meant an earlier second season and more time spent on the elections and other arcs? Theoretically, it'd be a one time thing.

I'm sort of split on the idea. It's certainly the type of show that could get away with filler.
>> ARTICLE
Some Shinomiya filler material (which has a separate manga) or Gin and Joichiro filler when they are still in Tootsuki would be nice.
>> ARTICLE
Side story filler after the end of an arc if fine. Stalling filler in the middle of an arc is horrible.
>> ARTICLE
Not really. They could easily do a 12 episode second season this winter if they wanted to with no filler.

>> ARTICLE
Miyoko's backstory about having to deal with men is sympathetic because it's true:  The cooking industry, especially those that practice French, and even more so in the Chinese and Japanese cooking, have a VERY big bias against women working in the industry.  Even though it's very ironic, however, that these are the same cultures that have women be considered perfect if they know how to cook, but only for their husbands or helping running small shops.
>> ARTICLE
That's the typical trope of "Women have hobbies, men have careers." Women are bakers, men are chefs. Women are gardeners, men are farmers. Women are nurses, men are doctors. Women are teachers, men are professors... It's a pretty long list. It's still a pretty common stereotype in many countries.

It's a variant of Tohoku-ben. I don't know the exact prefecture, though.

This isn't a romance nor does the author have experience writing one.

Hentai is just much more well drawn than normal manga, mostly time constraints that make normal manga art quality suffer. But honestly the hentai artists are generally better at male/ female forms in general as well.

This show does such an amazing job at building up hype. Every episode feels like it's 5 minutes long. I think the soundtrack does a great job supplementing the mood too.

For some reason I'm hoping Soma *actually* fell asleep. This is probably just another one of his "I'm too good for you" things but it'd be cool if it weren't.

Also I haven't read the manga and this is speculation but I feel like it might be right: [](/s "Are the 8 at the end of the OP except Erina the 8 that move on? Seems a bit obvious now.") [Related image](http://i.imgur.com/jUabOJF.jpg).

That's amazing, because it's kinda like how Sadatsuka's food works, they did a good job with that ED.

I *really* hope we get a Season 2. Manga sales have only increased since the anime started airing so hopefully that'll be enough. Plus JC Staff has done a really good job with this adaption.

Other recent JUMP mangas like Nisekoi & Ansatsu Kyoshitsu got season 2s *extremely* fast, so hopefully we'll be hearing something soon. The Autumn Elections have so much HYPE moments we won't get to see this season.

I think JC Staff is usually pretty good about sequels if the material is right, which I think Shokugeki is.

Oooooohhhh man Autumn Elections finally in full swing. Show is doing a good job spotlighting all the notable competitors and bits of their cooking style with the small time that these 24 minute episodes have to give. Not only did we see a calm before the storm with the summer break, but just a taste of an introduction to the beginning on the competition.

Would really like to hear from anime-only viewers on which competitors they think are gonna make it far in the competition from what they've seen so far. Certainly couldn't be Souma if hes sleeping on the job right :P
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so what's the prize for winning again? And does anyone get expelled for losing the Autumn Elections? I forgot what the goal to win was here.
>> ARTICLE
Expulsion is not a threat looming over the contestants.

The contest is to showcase their skill as the most promising 1st years, for the judges and audience to scout new talent for later hire, [Manga](/s "and they get to meet the elite 10")
>> ARTICLE
No expulsion. Autumn Elections is merely a medium to rank the first years with the top 8 most likely becoming the future Elite 10.
>> ARTICLE
The one scene I really want to see from all of this is when [not really a spoiler](/s "Megumi is possessed by Toriko.") 

No, that doesn't make sense unless you read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I would watch a million seasons of this show
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait to see what Miyoko is making, does anyone know what regional tradition she specialises in? I don't want to look it up in case of hitting spoilers. I'm guessing her dish will be Szechuan based purely because of Szechuan peppers and the general spiciness of Szechuan dishes.

Awesome to see Hayama making a fish head curry, the cheeks of the fish are the best part!

So hyped for these elections! With how Soma was at the end I'm half expecting him just to make some ridiculously good katsu curry or something equally simple.
>> ARTICLE
Judging by what I read in later chapters, [ ](/s "Miyoko seems to be pretty sufficient in all the 8 regions of Chinese cooking, but the Elite 10 member Kuga specializes in Szechuan cooking.")

As some may remember, I'm the guy that managed to [fuck up everything while cooking 2 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3g5wd1/spoilers_shokugeki_no_souma_episode_18_discussion/ctv63tg). Well this week I decided to try again at scrambled eggs as you guys said that shouldn't even be possible. I added some rice (inspired by episode 2) and [I think it came out great](http://imgur.com/16Ltpy2).

Didn't break any plates this time either so that a plus!
>> ARTICLE
Congrats! How did it taste?
>> ARTICLE
It was really good, I added a bit of ketchup to mask the grease a little.

I was a little worried the egg would overbear the rice. But all the flavours really complemented each other. 

I couldn't finish all of it though as it was really filling, but didn't make me feel bloated or lethargic. I only got about halfway through it. But now I know to make less for next time.

try adding a bit of ketchup for color :)

Sine you were all loved my commentary on curry last episode , I'm currently working on another, longer one and will probably put it on Google Docs or Pastebin.  Instead of being just one segment though, I'm gonna do the entire preliminaries.  The chapters of the preliminaries are the very unevenly paced, so I might as well just kill two birds with one stone. [Stuff I will talk about include](/s "Hisako's medicinal cooking, a bit about Houjou and the Chinese cooking industry, and the Megumi preparing an Anglerfish, which I consider to be Megumi's highlight."). I know that /u/Painn23 will be extremely excited to know about the last one, knowing the Megumi fan he is.  

By the way, the commentary may be a little late next week due to personal 
 issues.  But I know you all would love it!
>> ARTICLE
Yo, Hishoko shutting down [](/s "Sadatsuka") made her look so cool, and her arc later with Soma fleshing out her character even more made her an even more likable character. I actually really like Hishoko.
>> ARTICLE
Glad we get to see the show concentrating on some of the other side characters and competition (Jesus christ Sadatsuka is on some bubble bubble toil and trouble type stuff. She's going full blown yandere.) 

With this preliminary and the main tournament next season, we get to see what they're truly capable of.

That shit was fucking HYPE.

Wait... that was 25 minutes? Fuuuuuuuuck.
>> ARTICLE
as quickly as my summer break ended, I took some delight in feeling like^theirs ^went ^by ^even ^faster
>> ARTICLE
I've been hyper hyped by this series each and every episode from the get go. The only experience that can come even remotely close to the hype and excitement I'm feeling is Ushio to Tora. This episode though, holy hell; heart beating, blood rushing, palms sweaty, mom's spaghetti, all that jazz, and knowing what's to come only increased the excitement seven-fold.

Since we'll probably end without a proper conclusion to the election tournament, I'll start praying for a second season right now. If they're planning on OVAs in the meantime, I'd like it to be the chapter in which [just to be safe](/s "Isshiki enlists Yukihira and Tadokoro's help in teaching a cooking class") but I'm kind of jumping over my own head now.  In the mean-time I'll indulge myself in the delicious culinary hype machine this series has proved to be.

Goddammit there are so many people I want to make it through the preliminaries, but I especially want Ibusaki to advance. I dunno, I feel like that kid is more talented than the other characters realize/than the anime is letting on. Sadly I doubt this is going to happen.  

It would be nice if all of the other Polar Star kids advanced but that's obviously not going to happen -- Marui's strength lies in his brute memorization of ingredients and techniques, which isn't going to be enough to keep him in, I'm guessing. Ryoko's special ingredient looks interesting but it's probably not going to be enough; and Yuki doesn't seem to have a trick up her sleeve (though her dish looks good). 

And obviously the other competitors are clearly high-level tier/been developed more than the Polar Star kids, so it's kind of inevitable. I mean, there's no way any of the Polar Star kids are actually going to *win*--that's just not going to happen. 

I'm thinking Mito might be one of the surprise characters who doesn't advance--or maybe that's because I don't want her to in favor of other characters. I'd also like Isami to advance over his brother Tekumi (I'm assuming only one of them will advance, but maybe neither of them will), which this episode seems to be hinting at since Isami stayed behind in Japan (though that could be a red herring). 

Mostly I want Ibusaki to at least make it past the preliminaries. If that happens I'll probably be okay with whatever happens next. The anime's doing a good job of keeping you guessing, making sure to remind us that most of these contestants are really strong contenders and ~~this 'only 8 people can advance rule sucks balls~~ it's not going to be an easy contest at all. (That being said, I'm 98% confident about my guess as to who's going to win, so *that's* not what I'm worried about). 

I think the biggest mystery for me is what the fuck Orle's planning for Arato. I'm almost genuinely concerned that she plans to poison or sabotage Arato's dish, but it could be that this is just her 'style' of cooking. 

Hmm...since the headmaster said that this arena is where the elite ten do Shokugeki, should I be expecting a match between Isshiki (one of my favorite characters) and one of the other elite tens in season 2? Or Erina and someone else? That would be horrifying and glorious at the same time (horrifying in that Isshiki would be ruined if he lost a Shokugeki).

Sakaki Ryouko is pretty cute. My second favorite after Megumi.

My guess is it ends at the end of prelims. Each battle is easily an episode by itself and there are 8 of those.

Short answer: Not likely. Long answer: JC has shown no signs of moving faster than 2-3 chapters per episode. Episode 20 ended at chapter 48*, it will probably end at [](#s "59 or 60"). 

* = They threw chapter 49 in episode 20 as well, but they flopped the order again.

>> ARTICLE
And so it begins! I can't help but feel this episode was a little rushed in terms of pacing. I haven't reread this part of the manga in a while so I don't know how many chapters this episode actually covered. Next episode will show why Megumi is best girl once more.
>> ARTICLE
They did some reordering in effort to show all the participants and then ended with Soma sleeping.
>> ARTICLE
Finally, the arc where my favorite Shokugeki character solidified herself into her position. It's a shame we will have to wait untill season 2 before we get a chance to see her to se her at her best in the Stagiare arc next season(It's a Shonen Jump adaptation so of course it will have a sequel).

[Pic](http://i.imgur.com/PkcuIi1.jpg) and I don't care if you worship Megumi(doormats will be doormats) and bickering over who is the best Nakiri is a waste of time(Broken Japanese is the correct awnser, though).
>> ARTICLE
Not to be a downer, but Hisako (Erina's doormat) is actually worse than what you consider Megumi to be. 

Also, being around worst girl Erina is rubbing off on her. 
>> ARTICLE
Well we haven't seen jack shit really of Hisako outside of functioning as Erina's aide so far and it's this and the next arc that were the pieces that made her my favorite character. Honestly I'm on the edge with Megumi as she is getting better on paper, but still behaves like she useless without her boyfriend(doormat comperasin comes from a Demo D video for the winter 2014 while describing Onodera). I guess it's just in my tastes that most moe-blobs don't apeal to me(while I love some like Mao from Taiyou no Ie). And I did say that I don't particarly care eitherway and the whole best girl shit has gotten really fucking stale and they seem to be ctrl+c & ctrl+v from thread to thread. 
>> ARTICLE
I do like Hisako's [ ](/s "Medicinal cooking") considering how that cooking style is not as well known as the 8 regions (Cantonses, Szechuan, etc) of Chinese cooking.  [ ](/s "Chinese medicinal cooking") is a pretty lost form of art, and the style is still believed to have a value that could potentially rival [Censored due to spoilers](/s "modern medical care and dieting") due to how deep the style of cooking puts into its ingredients, considering how [ ](/s "Chinese medicinal cooking") uses the hypothesis on "How will this ingredient make my health better?"
>> ARTICLE
This was basically a filler episode with mostly anime-original content looking at the students' preparations for the tournament. I don't really mind, but I couldn't help but wish something actually happened to advance the plot.

And yeah, if only weight loss was as easy as Isami makes it look.

Yes. Shirobako is set at an anime studio. It's a 2 cour series where the first cour is about them making one anime (an original anime) and the second cour is about them making a second anime that is an adaption of a manga so it covers a lot of the issues involved in making anime.

Can't you bring some cooking equipment with you and do that too? It doesn't seem that difficult as long as you aren't making something super fancy. Making the costume seems far more troublesome and expensive, for most cosplays anyways. This one seems straightforward as far as cosplays go, which is good news cause you can focus on the cooking part more then.

Me too! I was planning on doing a Souma cosplay on October. I don't think it won't be as close to being as good as this. lol.

The fact that she clearly said "Erina-sama" just makes it so funny.
>> ARTICLE
It's internal dialogue becoming external.
>> ARTICLE
I sorta wish Erina got more screentime in the anime. I just can't get enough of Taneda Risa's voice.
>> ARTICLE
She was in like every episode...
>> ARTICLE
Being in an episode isn't as significant of a presence as I wish she was in. She's very much my type, I wish I would see her play a bigger role. 

Everybody says she does in the manga, but her voice really adds to her appeal so I can't exactly bear to read the manga as of now.
>> ARTICLE
I like her voice. I just don't like Erina as a character. Was kinda glad she was off screen a lot in the manga until the more recent arcs anyway.

>not liking glorious tsun ojou

What why :(

You just answered your own question.

I got tired of "Tsun(dere)" ojous. Tsundere these days* aren't well done. Their Tsun/dere are basically on and off switch.


* for a while now actually.

Sometimes you can just have too much tsun, y'know?
>> ARTICLE
You might want to watch [Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori), then.  26 episodes with major Taneda Risa screentime in each one.  People also say the show's pretty good, too.
>> ARTICLE
It's fucking amazing. Except the visuals. Everyone looks the same.
>> ARTICLE
Lets hope for it next season. I'm sure she'll have a more important role with where things are heading.
>> ARTICLE
it stays a similar balance all the way through the manga

though CURRENT manga chapters, she's a much more central character. That's probably more season 3 material though hah.
>> ARTICLE
Well... she doesn't have a *huge* role in the fall elections arc (the one they left hanging in the finale) actually, but the arc after, and now in the current arc, she does have an increasingly large role.
>> ARTICLE
Judging by how they make each battle at least 1-2 episodes, and the tournament will take up almost all of the season, season 2 would have almost no Erina scenes. Season 3 won't happen for at least 1-2 years. 
>> ARTICLE
It would probably won't be until season 3 (if we get one) for the Erina arc
>> ARTICLE
She is best girl in the manga right now. All the Megumi shippers are crying and panicking already. Don't think one or two seasons is enough to get there though.

[Too bad for Erina and Soma, it's](/s "more of a set-up made by her gramps than something more natural like what Soma had with Megumi in the first 130 chapters. Still the foundations has been laid since they were kids with Joichiro and Erina is now seeing glimpse of Joichiro thru Soma so the inevitable will happen. If there's any consolation, Soma hasn't shown any romantic interest to any girl or Takumi. The closest the he had on liking someone is telling that he like Megumi's cooking.")

I'm not affiliated with any particular ship but I trade exclusively with the Nikumi. 
>> ARTICLE
Didn't know the manga had that many volumes. Makes me happy knowing the show will probably go on for a bit longer.
>> ARTICLE
Next season should be all about the Autum-Election (maybe plus the Stagiaire Arc), she has only a minor role in both, but a third season should get us to where we are in the manga right now.
>> ARTICLE
I think the autumn elections might take up the entire season 2
>> ARTICLE
I think if there's a 2nd season, the best way to end it would be before the end of the Stagiaire Arc, [just before](/s "the 2 month timeskip"). 

Then if a 3rd season occurs, we can open with that!! IT'S PERFECT!!!

If there's a second season? 

Don't play with my feelings like that. There better be a second season.

no no no . The best part is to end at chapter 118

STOP LAUNCHING TORPEDOS AT MY SHIP GODDAMIT.

In all honesty I want a Megumi x Soma ship but an Erina x Soma ship seems more likely and isn't a bad thing.
>> ARTICLE
Well, here's the thing. When they first introduce her in the manga, it's like this.

* Soma's looking at a picture of his parents, and the text says something like "To be the best cook, one has to find the perfect woman to cook for."

NEXT PANEL (on the next page)

* Erina gets introduced. 
>> ARTICLE
She was also introduced in the one shot. Plus tsunderes winning is a consistent theme in anime or manga
>> ARTICLE
She has been awesome since the Stagiaire
>> ARTICLE
It's alright though. The Megumi-shippers and all others against the Erina-ship can rest assured it won't make it to port either. This is the type of sea where none of the obvious ships will make it. ~~RIP my preferred Nikumi-ship~~ 

Soma's archetype, one who is first-and-foremost married to his passion, teaches us that he'll end up with is the one he has the best chemistry with:

* [(SPOILER!!) One could argue this ship has already sighted the port.](http://i.imgur.com/zdKem32.jpg)

It's inevitable that Megumi's gonna realize her feelings for Souma.

This was actually hilarious, and indeed was the only show this year to receive a 10 from me.
>> ARTICLE
>the only show this year to receive a 10 from me.

Whut.
There were countless good animes this year, and a lot were waaay better than Shokugeki no souma..


>> ARTICLE
like what?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, you can't say something like that and not give a list!
>> ARTICLE
That's just like, your opinion, man
>> ARTICLE
this stuns me. a 10/10 for me is basically perfection. i found SnS really predictable and it eventually got boring. the humor relies entirely on ecchi and chibi reaction faces. it's really the best thing you've seen this year? it hasn't been the best year for anime (so far) but surely there's much less generic fare than this?
>> ARTICLE
I view a 10/10 as something extremely memorable, creative, and unique. Something that would be a 9/10 but has something extra special going for it that makes it truly a masterpiece. I cared about the characters, and seeing them go head to head after building these relationships was just awesome. It excelled above and beyond in every category, at least to me. That's 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
interesting. i thought the characters were the worst part of the anime. i had a hard time caring about anyone besides Megumi because she was the only person who felt real to me. plus, the MC is kind of too perfect. that's always bothered me about shounen in general, though.
>> ARTICLE
that's the thing though, he's perfect, but he's kind of a little shit, and it's entertaining. 
>> ARTICLE
that's what makes him annoying, which is more frustrating than entertaining. for me, anyway. /r/anime seems to like annoying characters. i wonder why...
>> ARTICLE
Because that's how subjectivity works? The biggest problem with the vast majority of anime's fanbase is forcing critique to be hard, objective truth based on one's own desire for what they think anime *should* be instead of taking each series for what it is. Plus, when you add the whole upvoting/downvoting system, you're pretty much begging to have an opinion railroaded up your ass.
>> ARTICLE
actually i was hinting at the fact that the average /r/anime member is probably annoying irl but ya that's also true
>> ARTICLE
coincidentally, those ar ethe types of people who won't like SnS
>> ARTICLE
Megumi felt real to you? She's basically the blandest tool you'll ever see and it's fucking annoying to watch her grab up screentime. I can't stand characters like her - they're a waste of space. But ***she's*** the one you find interesting? Really?
>> ARTICLE
bland is how i'd describe just about everyone in SnS. i'm not saying that Megumi is a great character, just that she's the only character that experiences actual character development. she's designed to be rooted for in the sense that she comes from humble roots and is the only character that appears to have any real struggle or difficulties at the academy. everyone else is already an uber-competitive elite cook that sends jaded and cynical judges into food orgasms because they're just that amazing. how is any of that interesting? there's no tension. 
>> ARTICLE
also, I get the feeling Megumi was the only character specifically meant to be relatable. Everyone else is a cartoon character. For the entertainment of the audience.
>> ARTICLE
i think it kind of hurts the show's story tbh.
>> ARTICLE
what, that Megumi is actually relatable or that the others are not real people at all? The thing is, Megumi is pretty much the entry point for the audience to feel like they can relate to the show (even though Souma is the titular character...), while keeping its ridiculousness. 
>> ARTICLE
the latter. because i only cared about Megumi , so when she wasn't on screen i didn't give a fuck about what was going on.
>> ARTICLE
that's understandable, but tbh I don't think the latter hurt it at all. In fact the simplicity of the characters is what allows the story to shuffle them around and give different dimensions to life at Totsuki
>> ARTICLE
i just felt like i was watching the same thing happen over and over with glorified palette swaps. it got boring. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm amazed you gave this a 10 and not Haikyuu.
>> ARTICLE
I gave both Haikyuu and Shokugeki no Souma 9's. I don't think it's ready for a 10, maybe 2nd season will be. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I didn't say they were both deserving of 10's, I was just surprised that he'd give Soma a 10 and not Haikyuu. Like, comparing the two.
>> ARTICLE
Oh okay, I misunderstood
>> ARTICLE
I don't see what's so surprising about that, people have different tastes after all. I thought Haikyuu was good but nothing more while Shokugeki no Soma is by far my favorite weekly manga.
>> ARTICLE
That's manga though, which is different. Soma works a lot better as a Manga due to the pacing of them explaining the dishes, since that ended up taking up most of what happened near the end of the anime. I still loved it, but that was it's major flaw.

Haikyuu, however, does not have that problem at all. It's also very action/movement based, which lends itself to the medium a lot better, while at the same time making it not quite as interesting in Manga form.

But that's just my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'd personally rate Soma anime over Haikyuu anime anyways so my point still stands, but I agree that Soma works better as a manga. Goddamn the OST was hype in the anime though. 

That said, Haikyuu is one of my favorite sports anime too and I'm planning on starting to read the manga so I might change my mind at some point.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen it yet, I'm 2 episodes in.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, it's probably one of my favorite sports Shonen, after Hajime no Ippo.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno. I thought both baby steps and Haikyuu were neck and neck, both tying for second after Hajime no Ippo. 
>> ARTICLE
It's my first try with a sports anime. It... is taking some getting used to. The art is kind of ho-hum so far. I don't know if I can get that invested in volleyball. Then again, I didn't think I would get so invested in cooking. Food Wars is why I started Haikyuu in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
It's really well done and interesting. I liked it right off the bat, but it gets fucking cool as shit after a while.

The best thing to do is to not focus on the subject, but what actually happens in front of you.
>> ARTICLE
Try Baby Steps (tennis) and Big Windup (baseball) too!
>> ARTICLE
The other sports anime that season is much better in my opinion (baby steps) although haikyuu is hype as hell
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit. I didn't know there was a Baby Steps anime. I've mostly been reading the manga and sort of stopped paying attention to Anime a couple of years back. Reading is just usually better for me, but I hope they executed well on Baby Steps. I enjoy the manga, at least.
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps was probably my favorite anime this season. I don't read the manga beforehand, and picked it up on a whim. So. Bad. Ass.

The anime is up to chapter 183 I believe I only started reading from there so I can't make a comparison but the anime is amazing

>> ARTICLE
Awesome review. I really enjoyed this show in the beginning but it started getting really boring and repetitive and towards the end and I found my self not really enjoying it as much. It was a bit of a let down.  With that said, I'm invested enough in it that I'm hoping the next season will develop things a bit more.  
>> ARTICLE
Thats my basic opinion as well. 

It doesn't really do anything wrong but there is only so much comedy I can get from the food reactions before it goes from funny to meh. 

Also think there are too many side characters to care about - like all the side characters in the dorm haven't really been developed yet - so I don't really care about them.
>> ARTICLE
also don't write it off after the first 5 minutes as another ecchi like I did. I came back to it several weeks later and was pleasantly surprised. The ecchi is not in your face at all, and if you read the manga, it's obvious some editor was like "it needs more boobs, put more boobs in it"
>> ARTICLE
Watch it.  Now.

Proof:

1. Saw the anime and read up to the current chapter of the manga.  Great art and plot (both literally and uh, fanservice wise).  First few episodes may be a bit too "lewd" for some people, but it gets much more tempered as the show progresses.
2. Go to the shokugeki no soma subreddit.  Great place.
3. Currently #38 in MyAnimeList, and it's only been running since Spring 2015
>> ARTICLE
Only bad part is yeah, it kinda [maybe a bit of a spoiler] (/s "ends on a bit of a cliffhanger"), but it makes sense to end it there if you know how the manga goes [again, kinda a spoiler] (/s "so a second season can start off at the right moment").  Right now we're just praying for a second season (I swear if there isn't one....).

It ends on chapter 60, but you should start reading on chapter 59 if you want to pick up where the anime left off.

I want more of reviews like this, SnS has "only" a 9/10 from me (because of the extreme cliff-hanger, without confermation for a second season), but this review is a 12/10 review.

10/10 rewiew, just like the show. To be exact SnS is my only show to get 10 and also only one that got me pick up the source material. (Well I have just 56 shows watched, but still.)

Well I have other 10 but it's little bit troll. :D 
>> ARTICLE
a bit tyring to watch when you understand japanese... dammit
>> ARTICLE
I know that this isn't the point of the video but I felt I had to get this out. I seriously see to many people giving 10/10 reviews. A 10/10 for a season? Dude.... I would be excited to see something a 10/10 once every 5 years. I have watched hundreds of anime but I can only give two 9.5's and a few 9's. I dont see enough 2's-4's. A 5 is average a 10 is pretty close to perfect, perhaps a new standard. While I have a few shos that raise the bar they do have one or two weaknesses that I wish were fixed. But ddamn i see people handing out a couple 9's a season and I just stop reading their reviews right there.
>> ARTICLE
When you are able to see perfection in the imperfect, then you reach enlightenment.

A 10/10 show is like having true love with your best friend.  She may have flaws, but even those supposed "flaws" work in context to make something even better than a technically "flawless" show would be.

I think this was actually expected, I mean if any series will get more episodes than the standard 12 it'll be a Shounen Jump series, and a popular one at that. Not to mention it has a lot of material already. Still good news though.

I also think multiple seasons will be extremely likely. 
>> ARTICLE
It has been a bit long since my favorite anime has got 24 episodes, so getting a confirmation like this is heart melting for me man!

But yeah I wasn't aware of the manga before this. Now I am at chapter 115.

Any manga readers here be able to confirm if there will be enough source material for a second season after this?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, and we can easily predict when they're going to end Season 1 
>> ARTICLE
after episode 24. /s
>> ARTICLE
There are 115 weekly chapters so far
>> ARTICLE
Depends on how they pace the series. The first 4 episodes have adapted like 6 chapters so far. If they pick up the pace, they could end up somewhere during the main tournament around chapters 60-80 which should make for a pretty good cliffhanger for the second season. That would leave at least more than 40 chapters with more coming out every week.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, there should be enough source material. The manga is currently at 115 chapters, with a new chapter every week. And the anime is going at 2 chapters per episode. With episode 4 covering Chapter 6 and 7.
>> ARTICLE
In relation to the English manga and it's release times, do you think I'll still be reading ahead after Episode 24? I'm finished volume 5 as of right now. I sincerely doubt it but I'd like to hope so.
>> ARTICLE
Hm, the anime should end on ~~the 7th of August~~ 11th of September it is ( thanks to /u/Painn23 for correcting me). The release date of Volume 6 is 1 week after that and covers chapter 40 - 48.
Depending on the pacing I guess the anime will end at around chapter 43, 46, 59 or somewhere around chapter 63.

Well, to put it short, I don't think that you will be able to read ahead, because the anime will most likely end somewhere at the end of Volume 6/7/8 and Volume 6 gets released after the anime ends.

Edit: ~~I just looked on Amazon again and it say that Volume 7 gets released 2 day earlier than Volume 6.~~
Ok, in Germany that is the case, in the US the release date for Volume 6 is the 2nd of June and for Volume 8 the 6th of October.

So, /u/Questen , at the end of the anime 7 Volumes of the manga should be released with the 8th Volume coming 1 month later. If they keep the pacing as it is you actually are able to read ahead of the anime.

>> ARTICLE
Wait what? The show will end the second week of September if it has 24 episodes and I'm pretty sure they'll pick up the pacing to cover the fall tournament arc so they should finish at chapter 104
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, you're right. The anime ends on the 11th of September, guess I wasn't looking correctly, thanks for correcting me. 

I would love to see the [](/s "Autumn Election") animated and I think that some things can be skipped to end the anime at chapter 104, but, well, all we can do is wait and guess. 
>> ARTICLE
I just wanna see chapter 80 animated. It has my favorite scene and my laptop wallpaper
>> ARTICLE
Chapter 80 is pretty awesome and [](/s "Soma is really badass in that chapter, with his "I'll quit being a cook" ").

Personally I'd love to see [](/s "Ryou" ) animated.
>> ARTICLE
I just want to see that one scene with Souma doing you know what 
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, thanks for your help!
>> ARTICLE
It'll be very interesting to see how they approach the pace as the series progresses. On one hand you'd expect them to cover more chapters per episode as the arcs get longer, but if they kept the current pace they would have perfect stopping points for both 24 ep seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, thats true. The beginning of the [not really a spoiler, just to be safe](/s "Autumn Election") would be a good place to stop for the first season and the beginning of the [](/s "Stagiaire") would be a good one for the second ( if we get a second season ) . 

But for example the Nanatsu no Taizai anime covered ~100 chapter and was IMO a good adaption.

So I could see Shokugeki no Soma even ending at chapter 92 at the [](/s "Three-way final announcement").
>> ARTICLE
I seriously doubt they'll finish the[](/s "Autumn Election")in season 1 at the rate of 2 chapters per episode. Ideally they'll devote 50 chapters to each season stopping the second season before[](/s "stagiaire")begins.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree because [spoilers](/s "it would be stupid to NOT show the final battle of the election; it ends relatively close to 100 anyway, so they will have enough to adapt if you consider that they are going by 2 episodes at a time (minus episode 1). Season 1 ends with the great Autumn election final result and Season 2 begins with the Stagiaire")
>> ARTICLE
I think it'll go to the end of the Training camp arc and maybe the karaage wars, but I think that would work extremely well as an ova (I think they could fit it in one episode pretty well). That way we can have the entire autumn election for second season.
>> ARTICLE
Except they couldn't possibly stretch it out that long for 24 episodes. We are already on episode 4, that's the beginning of Volume 2. Meaning 20 episodes:[To summarize](/s "Next episode is gaurenteed to end with Isshiki and intro of Nikumi, 2 episodes for Nikumi, approx. 6 episodes for training camp, 2 episodes for Karaage (or OVA although it is important for Eizen plot), and the rest (approx. 9 episodes) for Autumn Festival and etc.") This seems to fit well with me 
>> ARTICLE
If they skip some of the prep work for the [Spoila](/s "Mimisaka shokugeki they'll be able to squeeze everything in. ")
>> ARTICLE
I agree with your approach.  It'll certainly flow better that way.

>> ARTICLE
SEASON TWO WHEN?!!

 ACTIVATE HYPE THRUSTERS!

Calm down there /u/zshanif , we got plenty of season one to get through first.

 SEASON THREE MILKING THE CASH COW BABY 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, man I hope this goes for multiple seasons, so we can get that filler.  I want to see what they do.  Soma, take a trip to another school to learn something new that never get's brought up as soon as the filler ends. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's take it a step further and get three movies plus a crossover with One Piece where he takes on Sanji.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece AND Toriko
>> ARTICLE
I would rather he try to feed Luffy. It'd be nice watching him create a giant multi course meal for the gluttonous pirate
>> ARTICLE
I said bottom of the barrel not the HYPEST SHIT EVER TO BE THOUGHT!
>> ARTICLE
Bro, that episode would go into theaters. That shit would rank best selling movie on box office for ten years. That goes on WAY beyond the scope of the HYPEST SHIT EVER. This would be the COOLEST,BIGGEST SHIT OF OUR DECADE
>> ARTICLE
You just begged for filler...
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, it could be feasible seeing as the writers for the manga are separate to the artist. Surely that should open up possibilities of extra material being able to be written. Don't know if that's ever happened with fillers before though.
>> ARTICLE
While that works for general plotlines, in this case the bottleneck might be the cooking research required.
>> ARTICLE
I never claimed to be right my fellow redditor.  I just want to see what the bottom of the barrel shall bring.  
>> ARTICLE
I suppose it's good to know what the worst content we might get would be like :)
>> ARTICLE
This has been pretty fun so far so I can't argue against having more come my way. I wasn't a reader so watching this for the first time has been an... experience?
>> ARTICLE
I can say as I reader that the anime has been what I have been hoping for a little more. I will be interested to see how it goes from here but so far it has been really spot on.
>> ARTICLE
Thank god. Out of all the new shows airing this season, this show is, imo, the best by far and I usually hate ecchi anime.
>> ARTICLE
That's what i've been thinking as well. But i'm really into Kekkai Sensen as well.
>> ARTICLE
Those two are definitely the frontrunning AOTS contenders, but there's also a bunch of others that are close behind for me like Oregairu s2, Arslan,Ore monogatari and FSN UBW.
>> ARTICLE
I like Dungeon Art Offline too, even if it's a semi-clone I still look forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who has read all the manga so far, i forgot how ecchi it really was because the manga does a good job with the plot. Though without the food-gasm reactions, it just wouldn't be the same.
>> ARTICLE
I think the anime/manga can turn so people off that first but then they get further in and see that the characters and plot are actually really cool and the food-gasm is just icing on the cake. 
>> ARTICLE
Without those over the top reactions though, there would certainly be something to be desired. I mean what if they just gave a usual head nod and said "Damn this is good" 
>> ARTICLE
Yea the reactions really pull it together I can just see someone watching the first episode of the anime and getting turned off thinking it's just anther weird ecchi anime. I think of the food-gasm as the piece that really brings everything together
>> ARTICLE
I love the creativity and variety during those moments
>> ARTICLE
Yea it is really great how they all go with the dish's and really gives the food just another kick. You see an amazing dish after them cooking it and then you know some ridiculous reaction is going to follow.   
>> ARTICLE
I think part of it is how *fun* the cast is. Everybody is just so lovable.
>> ARTICLE
*cough * Erina
>> ARTICLE
As bodaciously fuckable as she is, she's probably one of the least likable characters. 
>> ARTICLE
For those that can't read Moonrunes

It basically says that there will be 8 volume of bd/dvd, each containing 3 episodes. So 24.
>> ARTICLE
I assume you're learning Japanese? If so, for how long? Just curious, hah.

And that's great!
>> ARTICLE
basic knowledge of katakana and my chinese background, plus some off the cuff experiences reading those things means I can understand those **typical simple announcements** fairly easily. I still need help if it's something a lot more complex.
>> ARTICLE
Do you happen to be from Singapore? :O

Also what's your daily reading/learning material? I'm only currently halfway through the first Genki textbook and the grammar's really getting me.
>> ARTICLE
What exactly are you having trouble with? In my own experiences, the Genki textbook explains most things pretty clearly, but you do need to practice. Each lesson kind of builds on the prior chapter, which makes it harder to grasp for each chapter that you haven't mastered.
>> ARTICLE
Not really trouble per se, I know that the issues I have now will eventually be resolved via practice. The Genki textbook is great in this regard. I'm just curious how everyone else goes about their education and constantly looking for new ways to learn. 

Also it's hard trying to make the shift from "thinking in english" to "thinking in japanese".
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it really is pretty tough to make that jump, but its kind of the case for most Asian languages or heavily inflected languages like Latin and such.
>> ARTICLE
Currently in Australia

Like I'd said, it's more of "OK I kind of know what those kanji means, and I think that katakana phrase means this word", and then it's all experience. Its better if you ask someone else on the proper way to learn
>> ARTICLE
Still, you're better than me. I can read only 10 hiragana at the moment.

That's kata lol. Looks like you're doing better than you think :)

Then you basically know "shi" too! \^.^
>> ARTICLE
[TIL.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lm4ux1hR2m1qfutm7.bmp)
>> ARTICLE
With enough practise it takes no time to learn both hiragana and katakana! Kanji is when the trouble begins...
>> ARTICLE
I don't see the problem with kanji at all. Learning Chinese words wasn't hard, I don't see what problem I'll have learning kanji. 
>> ARTICLE
Wait so the Season that is currently airing will be 24 episodes long or is it split in 2 court?
>> ARTICLE
Single cour, 24 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, this made my day! Thats so nice since so many shows go with that 12 episode style. Thanks for the info!
>> ARTICLE
Think you mean two cours, 24 episodes, 1 season. Cours are usually divided up to 11-13? episodes and take up a season's airing time. Unless I've been wrong for the past few years that is.
>> ARTICLE
Ah so therell be a short break between the second 11-13 episodes
>> ARTICLE
If you mean short break like between the spring and summer seasons then yes. Not like the split cours that DRRR is currently running.
>> ARTICLE
Alright thanks for making it clear :)!
>> ARTICLE
[](#nico-heart "No problem :)")
>> ARTICLE
Nah you're right, I wanted to say that it'll run for 24 episodes straight but I kinda brainfarted when I wanted to comment.
>> ARTICLE
Since I thought this season was going to only be 12 episodes, I'm beyond happy right now.

>> ARTICLE
Praise every deity known to man

Fantastic. I'm always hungry for more...

Really hope they don't change the ed. Not sure that it could be better

I always have to eat while watching this otherwise i get hungry even if i've just eaten

Yes. More MEGUMI action. That's the reason why we all love this show is because of megumi 
>> ARTICLE
B-b-but, Isshiki's butt...
>> ARTICLE
Megumi better
>> ARTICLE
Yes! Loving it so far, probably one of the best anime in the season. If not, the *best* one.
>> ARTICLE
Oh food god yes!

This was definitely my favorite anime of the season even at 12 episodes.. I'm so happy right now. Best news of the day!

[MFW more Souma](http://imgur.com/YXRUALh.jpg)

[My reaction reading this news](http://gfycat.com/ScholarlyBraveAmericantoad)
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if they will do a full adaption. Seems to happen with a lot of Shounen Jump content, so I wouldn't be surprised or saddened 
>> ARTICLE
As long as they don't do that thing they do with some adaptations, where they have to improvise an 'ending' for it, before the manga's actually completed.
>> ARTICLE
They won't if it sells well. Plus I'm sure manga sales have been boosted in Japan because of the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh definitely. I didn't even know about the manga until I heard about the anime, then I went through it all in one sitting. I'm grateful they made it into an anime, so I could discover it.
>> ARTICLE
That'd be horrifying. If they do a full adaption maybe they will make up filler while they wait for more content. I'm curious of how far things such as DBZ, Naruto and Bleach were before they started their anime adaptions. 
>> ARTICLE
Usually it doesn't matter because the anime (almost) always catches up to the manga since you can cover more in an episode. However some anime have endings different from the manga, and are actually better than the source material, Eureka Seven being a good example.
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone translate this article from the same site? http://otakomu.jp/archives/251990.html

Looks to be a scene from Code Geass iirc, is this some type of BD remake with less censoring? I don't really remember what the original looks like, and its been awhile since it aired.

Also can anyone identify the gifs in the article? For you know, science...
>> ARTICLE
Ya it is from the BD. In the original there are not as much boobs. 
>> ARTICLE
As one of my favourite manga and my favourite show this season, I'm so excited that this is confirmed for 24 episodes! I thought it might be due to the pacing but it's nice to know for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
how does the anime compare to the manga?

>> ARTICLE
Very well. It's keep true to the manga and is going at a steady pace, only covering 2-3 chapters per episode. I'm finding each episode to be exciting! Easily my favourite of the season.
>> ARTICLE
it's a good adaptation,for sure. The only thing it's lacking is the art. I mean,the art is extremely good in manga but the anime makes it up for the OST.
>> ARTICLE
More of best girl Yuki-chan!? yes plz
>> ARTICLE
That confused me for a moment, because I thought you meant Yuki Nagato.

Good.  More of best girl Erina the better.

I can't argue that! Young fumio would be in the running for best girl if she wasn't from the past!

Actually really enjoying a lot of moments of this so far, if the ecchi doesn't get too crazy I could really enjoy it :)

Nice timing, Just as I finished catching up to this show.

YEEEEEEES! this is my favorite anime of the season so far. im so hard right now!
>> ARTICLE
Exactly what I wanted.
>> ARTICLE
Do any of you know if Hibike! Euphonium or Denpa Kyoushi will be getting 24 episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Nothing has been said on how long either will be yet. I imagine DK will be one cour and Hibiki! could possibly be two, though.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds great to me. I'm loving the show and glad to see it be 2 cour. 
>> ARTICLE
Its 1 cour 24 episodes tho, still awesome news
>> ARTICLE
A cour means a 13 episode block of a show. The fact this is 24 makes it just under 2 cour, not 1. 
>> ARTICLE
Is this really that good?  I started washing the first episode but stopped because I basically saw what appeared to be a literal food orgasm happening. Idk I was really confused. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a comedy mixed with something like a Card-Battle anime. Imo the series really picks up once they get to the bootcamp, which is relatively soon.
>> ARTICLE
> Card-Battle anime

[I see what you did there.] (http://puu.sh/hqZLm/9b9148334d.jpg) Warning: Spoilers in that pic.
>> ARTICLE
I will never understand how it is they can start making these things without knowing (or saying) how many episodes they're even going to do
>> ARTICLE
It would be nice to know considering it must have been decided long before the first episode airs. Not sure why we have to wait for a home release advertisement to find out.
>> ARTICLE
Good news looking forward to it each week.
>> ARTICLE
What chapter will the season end with? 
>> ARTICLE
Probably chapter 34
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense since the pacing doesnt seem to be rushed. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, I have more anime to watch while there's no mecha anime right now so WOOT!
>> ARTICLE
this means we will see the latest tournament arc?
>> ARTICLE
nope, it will end in the Sensual Kaarage Arc, and we might get Natsuyumi Erina as an OVA. But the problem is that the tournament Arc needs to be 52 episodes to not feel rushed, so expect a 2 cour next year for the tournament.
>> ARTICLE
not really, you are exaggerating
>> ARTICLE
Maybe he is , but the arc would still be at least 35 - 40 episodes so they are not going to start it at the end of the 24th episode or just hint it . (I'm saying that he may be exaggerating because a lot of the chapters could probably be condensed into 3 -4 minute segments in the anime)
>> ARTICLE
you guys are exaggerating too much

less than 1 full season ~26 is more than enough
>> ARTICLE
So you suggest they do 26 episodes from around 86 chapters ? .. then what :D
>> ARTICLE
most scenes are cooking, foodgasming and crowd reaction

and 

86 chapter = 26 episode

1 episode = 3-4 chapters thats damn fine
>> ARTICLE
If it's super successful i really doubt that they will chew through content that fast , just look at anime's like DB where even 1 chapter was strached to 1 -2 episodes , it all depends on the studio though seeing the current pace they probably wont exceed 2 -3 .
>> ARTICLE
If they speed it up
>> ARTICLE
That's good, the pacing will be alright then I guess.

If they cover all of the fall classic they would be covering 104 chapters. The pacing will pick up
>> ARTICLE
People may be disappointed with the last arc.
>> ARTICLE
...disappointed that it won't turn into a Hentai?
>> ARTICLE
the tournament arc was pretty bad
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say it was bad, but it was *really* long and could drag. I enjoyed it, but with some slimming down it'd have been better for sure.
>> ARTICLE
The only issue with the arc is its length and even being so long it doesn't feel diluted as it is cram packed as always and we also get to see allot of other characters other than Souma cook. Altough so far I have enjoyed the Stagiare arc more.
>> ARTICLE
The tournament arc was amazing 
>> ARTICLE
Nah, it was really slow and predictable and dragged on. The antagonist that was hyped was a HUGE disappointment in terms of impact. 
>> ARTICLE
Not for me it was good it has my favorite part 
>> ARTICLE
well that's you. I don't know about how it was during reddit but the discussions in other forums for souma were dead during the tournament arc.
>> ARTICLE
Granted I started reading shokugeki at chaoter 103. So It didn't feel like it was lacking 
>> ARTICLE
that can explain things. Sometimes mangas are best read in bulk. But being there for the tournament arc from start to finish was hard. Eventually it stopped being fun for some.
>> ARTICLE
Ah I can see that. Waiting every week for that would boring but this is the anime and I believe they'll cover 104 chapters 
>> ARTICLE
Doujins man, I know they're coming... 

In Eriri, we trust.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno if I even want a second season. The Fall tournament felt like a huge waste of time. And that's probably the only thing that would be shown in S2

Edit: Lol, it sucked. Literally half of the manga and nothing happened. Deal with it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm enjoying it.. Why do you feel like it's bad? I know everyone is entitled to their opinion so why did you not enjoy it?
>> ARTICLE
People say the fall tournament felt like a drag since it takes up like 60 chapters. But imo it's all good because we get to see some serious fucking competitions and amazing food
>> ARTICLE
That's how I felt I mean it's a cooking manga about them wanting to be the best and number 1 right
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I mean it's amazing how they all want to be the best even though soma is the best 
>> ARTICLE
No argument there haha
>> ARTICLE
To be honest MEGUMI is the best at everything because she's best girl but since soma is the MC I'll give it to him
>> ARTICLE
I felt like showing my personal AOTY some appreciation and introduce more people by throwing together this album. Thanks *J.C. Staff* for putting together an amazing adaptions and making me salivate every episode.

If you feel hungry just imagine how the animators must have felt. They probably ate cup ramen in the short breaks between drawing these delicious creations.
>> ARTICLE
I've never made curry in my life.  Since Shokugeki no Souma started airing, I've made it twice.  I also made karaage for the first time.  That got me on a Japanese food kick and I've taken a couple whacks at homemade shoryu and tonkatsu ramen.

Unfortunately, none of it has blasted my clothes off yet.  Guess I've got to up my game.

Going through this album is having a really nice flashback / summarized version of all the episodes. I can remember what happens with each dish.

That's one thing I really love about the series, almost all the dishes have their own personality and it makes them memorable. You can tell who makes them just from that too sometimes.

Yes and no, they are dialed down massively after a few episodes besides a couple of hiccups. The mangaka was a hentai artist and those... Certain talents definitely show. Gotta get that otaku fanbase early on guess.

Foodgasms still happen, but they are pretty unique and more about the food. There's still ecchi though, but it's pretty sparse now.
>> ARTICLE
Yes they do, but so far not as over the top as that "tentacle rape" from the first episode. That was disturbing :S

The only reason I didn't drop the show after the first episode is because I had already read the manga and knew how good it was. The anime adaptation so far has been amazing. Specially the current ark which makes your mouth water tremendously!

Shokugeki is not Haruhi brah. S2 is coming.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Well, unlike most anime, you can be quite confident in Shokugeki getting multiple seasons. Its a Shounen Jump series, and a popular one at that.
>> ARTICLE
Index is like the most popular LN series in Japan. Look where that has gotten season 3.
>> ARTICLE
Raildex is my favorite universe.

I don't see a season 3 happening for Index or Railgun.  Why?

> Index is like the most popular LN series in Japan.

And it sells like hotcakes.  A season 3 won't promote either series anymore, as they would be behind in material, and not promoting the new material (New Testament, especially).  Like Haruhi, a new season won't help sell anymore novels and manga volumes than they are now.

JC Staff, while eager, has not gotten the A-OK, which isn't surprising after some of the adaptation missteps that happened while producing the show.  Even if they did an Index III or Railgun T, I would have doubts about their ability to handle the series properly.

Altogether, as much as I would love another season, I don't see it happening.  Read the novels and manga, and enjoy the unadulterated story.
>> ARTICLE
In fairness, being a popular LN series and a popular Shounen Jump series mean very different things. Shounen Jump is very much so in favor of funding anime for their series, especially when they do well. Not to mention that Shounen Jump is at the very top of the manga world, and manga as a medium is much bigger than LNs. 
>> ARTICLE
That makes little sense. I see that Jump is a very big company. So? Why would they be in favor of funding anime for their series? The only reason they'd want to do so is for two reasons:
1) Like Naruto or Gintama, they can be a super popular self sustaining anime business
2) They'll greatly boost the popularity of the original.

Shokugeki is not at stage 1, and stage 2 is unlikely due to the law of diminishing marginal returns.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree with you, but I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted? Downvotes are for off-topic comments, not for comments that you disagree with.
>> ARTICLE
They fund anime because they simply can. They'd do anything to further boost sales and the popularity of their best series;. Haikyuu, AssClass, and Nisekoi all have second seasons. World Trigger has been airing since 2014 and it's not even their most popular series. Toriko had a near 150 episode run and even Beelzebub had essentially a two season run with 50 episodes. Not to mention Hero Academia is also getting an adaptation. Like /u/Sougo said, you can't compare SJ to your typical LN/manga adaptations. Shokugeki getting a second season is almost guaranteed.
>> ARTICLE
But it ain't Shounen Jump
>> ARTICLE
2.1k in BD sales for a 24 episode season though, would they really produce another season at a loss just because its a popular Jump series? They probably got what they needed in terms of Manga sales out of the first season.

Edit: I'd rather hear out why they would still get an S2 in spite of this, rather than get silently downvoted.
>> ARTICLE
It depends on what impact it had on manga sales, and whether the producers feel like it can continue to have a positive impact on manga sales. Assassination Classroom had similarly poor disc sales numbers, but managed to get a second season nonetheless. Nevertheless, I'd agree with you that a season two isn't a guarantee. A possibility, yes, but not a sure thing.
>> ARTICLE
I think things are also a bit different for those series whose manga counterparts rank in the top 10 best selling series of the year. Just look at Terra Formars, which had much worse sales and is still getting a second season. 
>> ARTICLE
Manga sales are rising so they don't care too much of the BD sales
>> ARTICLE
BD sales don't matter as much to SJ. World Trigger only sold 1.6k avg per volume in 2014 and it's still airing. AssClass sold 2.6k avg per volume and it's getting another season. So Shokugeki getting an S2 is pretty likely. Plus, it's one of Jump's most popular manga - ranking consistently in the top 5 every week.

edit: forgot to mention the sales are average per volume not total.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, those are some pretty strong examples. I know it's based on average, but the total sales still comes in <100m in yen though right? Assuming shokugeki costed >400m yen to make that's a pretty big investment. All the power to SJ if it can bring continued manga success, would like to see the series thrive.

I think that since this is JC Staff, it's only fair that they bring out the entire VA cast on stage, do a live performance of the OP, and then drop a release announcement for INDEX(or Railgun!) SEASON 3.
>> ARTICLE
Or even better, an Accelerator series. With some cute moments from Last Order of course.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't even be mad. In fact, I'd be even happier. I would easily sacrifice a 2nd season of SnS for Index 3.

...Or we could get both? Pls?
>> ARTICLE
Railgun and Index still have some stuff left after the anime? I just started watching railgun so I thought both were complete.
>> ARTICLE
Index has like 20-something novels, Railgun isn't that far in either. 
>> ARTICLE
Railgun anime stops about quarterway through vol 7.  I think vol 11 just came out late October in Japan (after more than a year of waiting).

Index stops with vol 13 of 22 novels, with a sequel series of novels that just had 14 come out, titled "A Certain Magical Index New Testament"

The problem with a season 3 for either show at this point is that it would be so far behind the source material, it would be more for the fans of the series rather than for promoting and helping sell the source material.  So it's highly unlikely we'll get a Index III or Railgun T.

However, the "A Certain Scientific Accelerator" manga is new and early enough that it's still in the realm of getting an anime to promote the spinoff.  However, JC Staff is currently working with another Kamachi series, [Heavy Object](http://myanimelist.net/anime/27829/Heavy_Object), right now, so it'll be at least a year before we see anything, most likely.
>> ARTICLE
If you count the side story novels, Railgun has enough for another season. Index has only covered about a 1/3 of the novels.
>> ARTICLE
Make sure to read the novels once you finish the series. You can start with index on 14th volume and with railgun on 40th chapter. Some people also prefer reading the 13th volume and the index ss because they weren't really fully adapted but you should be just fine if you start reading from 14th one. 

There is also the reread of the entire series on /r/toarumajutsunoindex so feel free to join us once you're finished with the anime. 

Edit: just one more thing, don't even try to read the index Wikipedia or anything related to the new testament, believe me, you wouldn't want to have all the juicy parts of the light novel spoiled. 
>> ARTICLE
Should I read the novel after Endymion or after Index 2?
>> ARTICLE
After Index 2 you should be fine with reading novels. The movie takes place in the middle of the second season just after the daihaiseisai arc if I am not mistaken and doesn't really bring much to the series apart from two cute girls and some mindless action. 
>> ARTICLE
> you wouldn't want to have all the juicy parts of the light novel spoiled.

That, and it's pretty information dense.  It's pretty difficult and thick to get through some of the pages on the wiki without more formatting and separating of information.
>> ARTICLE
Index has a lot of stuff. A LOT. Like [Index spoilers](/s "Misaka growing wings.")
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "wait when does Misaka grow wings, Iv'e only heard about Accelerator and the dark matter guy")
>> ARTICLE
It is in one of the Railgun Lns. I dont know how the LN was called but the arc was called Liberal Arts City
>> ARTICLE
Railgun is a manga written by Kamachi and drawn by Fuyukawa.

Index is the light novel written by Kamachi, and it also has a manga adaptation (that is behind the anime, last I checked).

EDIT: Rereading this exchange, I realize that I misread your comment, with you saying it was in one of the LNs, not that Railgun was a series of LNs that the event occurred in.  Sorry for the misunderstanding.  I still stand by my point that the commenter was probably referring to [spoiler](#s "Misaka's Level 6 Shift under the effects of Exterior").  There was also no reason to take up such a tone with someone else over a minor misunderstanding of your comment.
>> ARTICLE
THERE ARE TWO RAILGUN LNS. Jesus Christ people look it up.

'to aru kagaku no railgun SS' aka Liberal Arts City and 'to aru kagaku no railgun SS2' aka Shopping Mall Demonstration.
>> ARTICLE
Correct, but I'm pretty sure by [spoilers](#s "Misaka grows wings"), The_Cutest was talking about [volume number](#s "10") of Railgun, and not about the Japan only bonus short stories included with the anime.

I know about the LNs, but when talking about the series, due to their nature of being side stories that were only included with the anime in Japan only, typically they aren't mentioned in counts of the series.  There are quite a few SS novels for Railgun and OT that would otherwise have to be mentioned.

Index has a huge amount left, the first two seasons covered about 13 of the 22 novels. Then after that, there's the sequel series, New Testament, which currently has 14 novels and is still ongoing. All of it can be found translated into English online.
>> ARTICLE
Index is *the* light novel series. 22 volumes + numerous extras and a sequel that is currently ongoing which also has over 14 volumes with no end in sight.

The anime has barely scratched the surface. There's enough material for hundreds of episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Not hundreds but something about 72 episodes of Index and maybe 24 episodes of railgun and also a one cour of Accelerator manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Hundred including NT and SS. Also, we already have 4 cours worth of Index.
>> ARTICLE
They have a lot of stuff left, Specially Index.

At this point not even our great grandkids would live long enough to see a new season of Index, it's pretty much the Half Life 3 of anime. 

Which means Kamachi is the Gabe Newell of anime too....but we don't know what Kamachi looks like...WHAT HAPPENS IF KAMACHI IS GABE NEWELL?!? OH LORD THE LACK OF 3s WILL DESTROY US ALL.

Half Life 3 will happen at some point though. It's just a matter of when, but this has no similar guarantee.

The manga got a good sales boost from the anime I'd imagine since its the [seventh best selling series of 2015](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-11-29/top-selling-manga-in-japan-by-series-2015/.95913). So the chances of a second season might be nice if they wanna give the numbers a bit more a of a push.
>> ARTICLE
For comparison, [here are the top-selling manga series from 2014](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-11-30/top-selling-manga-in-japan-by-series-2014/.81607)

Cuz anime is too freaking expensive. 2 episode for 60 bucks? Only rich people would buy it.
>> ARTICLE
Manga is way cheaper than buying anime
>> ARTICLE
It's averaging about 3k per volume, which I see as just under "okay".

It's a Shonen Jump property though, so the BD/DVD sales don't really matter anyway. The manga was pretty well-boosted by the show, and that's what *really* matters here.
>> ARTICLE
Why the BD/DVD sales of a Shonen Jump show don't matter? I get what you mean, thinking about all those Shonen Jump shows having a lot of episodes, but why do you think that is?
>> ARTICLE
> Why the BD/DVD sales of a Shonen Jump show don't matter? 

It's not that it doesn't matter but the anime was produced to boost manga sales, having more BD etc sales is a bonus.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Shonen Jump is generally more interested in their franchises as a whole, not just anime adaptations. Anime aren't really likely to make a lot of money from expensive BDs only hardcore otaku are likely to buy (plus they don't get 100% of the money the BDs bring in anyway, since some has to go to the studio and stuff), so they're most likely commissioned for the purpose of promoting the franchise and source material, which is much more affordable, and which therefore casual viewers who get interested from the anime are more likely to buy (and which also gives them 100% of the money they bring in).

Because Shonen Jump has a lot of money and effort put into their advertising, their anime almost always give a big boost to their source material, and that pretty much negates whatever profit the niche otaku crowd would bring in.
>> ARTICLE
I wish more companies were like this. We would have continuations of many popular series. Thanks for the explanation!
>> ARTICLE
You don't get it do you? This also means that until the popularity of Shokugeki starts to peel off again, JUMP will have no incentive to produce a season2!
>> ARTICLE
Welp. Season 2 was announced a few days ago. Looks like they had incentives after all, especially since manga sales of shokugeki in Japan were crazy even before the anime aired. 
>> ARTICLE
Lol. I don't get it still but I ain't complaining one bit.
>> ARTICLE
Lmao, pretty sure it's going to get a third season as well with those kinds of sales. 
>> ARTICLE
Season 2 here we go. Announcement being on the same week as Jump Festa(Dec 19) is pretty telling. We should know by Thursday(10th) of this week what the announcement is.
>> ARTICLE
HYPE FOR 2ND SEASON!
>> ARTICLE
Get Hype!

This was easily my favorite show of the last couple years. Loved everything about it. Just finished a re-watch actually, just as good the second time around. 
>> ARTICLE
*SEASON 2 INTENSIFIES*
>> ARTICLE
Remember you can't spell Seapachinkomachineson 2 without "Pachinko Machine".
>> ARTICLE
SEASON 2 OF COURSE
>> ARTICLE
i started reading the manga like 2-3 weeks ago, if another season gets confirmed now im gonna be kinda pissed off


AND REALLY FUCKING HYPED
>> ARTICLE
You won't be pissed off, quids in for pachinko machine.
>> ARTICLE
If the season 2 is 12 eps then it can wrap up the Tournament arc.
If its 26 eps it'll probably cover the [](/s"Strataigre Arc") either way Mimasaka gets animated!!
>> ARTICLE
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

I had my hopes up....
>> ARTICLE
What's with announcing announcements anyway?
>> ARTICLE
I'm waiting for Live-Action with Gordon Ramsay(as spesial guest) Announcement
>> ARTICLE
Oh, Index S3?
>> ARTICLE
please season 2 with 50 episodes at least.
>> ARTICLE
Are there even enough chapters for that? 
>> ARTICLE
No, it'll probably take a 2 cour to catch up.  By then it'd be 2 cour plus a season 3 I guess though. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably a few different things that could be announced.

>Live Action Shokugeki no Souma

Maybe?  Would be interesting to watch... I hope

>Author announcing a new series to be published alongside SnS

Possible.  A good way to give some publicity to the new series

>Cooking game or VN?

Naaaaah, I highly doubt that'll happen

>Season 2

And finally for what everyone wants, which will probably happen soon even if its not announced.
>> ARTICLE
Spinoff of the Shokugeki girls at the beach~
>> ARTICLE
[Oh boy this is gonna be good](http://i.imgur.com/ZkgRiNs.gifv) 

Season 2 pls, I don't think a season can cover the current material, we need at least another season for the current arc. 


>> ARTICLE
If they do it like "Nisekoi" first season 20, second season 12. I know SnS season one had more, but 12 episodes are enough to finish the tournament and the following arc.
>> ARTICLE
Season 1 were almost 60 chapters. 

Autumn's arc ended at chapter 104 

The following arcs ended at chapter 117 

The latest arc starts at chapter 118 and we are now at 145 and still far from being over. 

So 54 Chapters = 24 episodes seems plausible and maybe the beginning of the latest one with the bazar stores thingy arc. 

>> ARTICLE
halfway throughout chapter 118 would be the best possible cliffhanger ending to a 24 episode season, it would also be 58 chapters which is around the average of manga -> anime adaptions
>> ARTICLE
season 2 might come in spring or as late as summer/autumn, and after that there would be enough material for a season 3.
>> ARTICLE
2nd season? aw yiss
>> ARTICLE
season 2? ova? live action drama? ecchi video game? WHAT COULD IT BEEE?!

*edit: just because no one has mentioned this: AN ANIME ADAPTATION OF SHINOMIYA'S SPIN-OFF?
>> ARTICLE
I hope they announce at least an OVA continuation of where they ended off. Just give me something, JC Staff...
>> ARTICLE
Season 2 or OVA to be exclusively broadcasted on various TV screens at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport.

Just watch this turn out to be another official cookbook. Or a pachinko machine.

Plot twist, SJ is partnering with food network to bring a "live action" version of the show to the american public. Something along the title of "Iron chef".

I'm surprised that no one said Berserk yet.
>> ARTICLE
I started it few weeks ago because I had nothing to do and numerous friends suggested it.  30 chapters in and it is already on my top 5.  The story, the epicness, and the bad assery is like nothing I ever seen.  

It's senin, so it's like watching HBO series.  But I would never say it uses gore or nudity to draw it's audience.  It's simply a great story with great art.  
>> ARTICLE
Have they ever talked about doing more Berserk anime? Fuck it was so good.
>> ARTICLE
Tower of God is one of my favorite arcs ever. Would love if it got animated some day. 
>> ARTICLE
Do manhwa's get anime adaptations?
>> ARTICLE
Tower of God, or Conviction, is an arc in Berserk. Wasn't talking about the manwha.

And not really, no. If they did I'd love to see The Breaker though.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh thanks. That makes a bit more sense.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair though, a Tower of God adaptation would be amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Oh absolutely, great series.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I loved the Conviction arc, really disagree with people who say Berserk goes downhill after GA
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the rest of it is pretty fantastic. The only parts I don't remember loving were the lightning guy fight and the sea pirates. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the sea god arc definitely doesn't compare to the rest, thankfully it wasn't very long

Seriously weirds me out when people watch the whole anime but they don't want to pick up the manga just to read the last arc even though that's all that's left.
>> ARTICLE
The last arc it's amazing , everything makes sense after reading it .
>> ARTICLE
To me, the arc after season 3 was pretty mediocre, but the last few chapters were SO worth it
>> ARTICLE
I personally feel that it provided closure, but happened way too spontaneously and illogically. Was hoping for an ending on the level of Goddesses's finale.
>> ARTICLE
The last few chapters wrapped up the entire manga in a nice pretty little bow. 
>> ARTICLE
JoJo's Bizzarre Adventure.

Considering the Anime only covers parts 3 out the 8 parts with 4 hopefully on the way.
Parts 4-8 are a really good read (Part 5 has some dodgy scans but are getting re-scanned slowly) 

The stand battles in the rest of the parts are really creative and show how far the powers of stands go in terms of creativity and just how plain weird some of them are.

It's also refreshing having different settings and protagonists for each different part.
>> ARTICLE
People will be rewarded immediately by reading Part 4. The main villain is just so evil. Not Dio-evil, but a different kind of evil. But definitely evil.  ^^just ^^a ^^quiet ^^life
>> ARTICLE
I really hope DavidPro continues because (in my opinion), JoJo gets so much better after part 3. For me it goes 7 (obviously) >4>2>6>8>3>5>1 in terms of enjoyment.

I honestly just want to see the Mandom fight animated, really.
>> ARTICLE
I really can't wait to see every instance of "WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SAY ABOUT MY HAIR" animated.
>> ARTICLE
Took me a while to read 6 parts (I read when Part 3 S1 was airing) but damn was it worth it. Part 7 can't be topped. 
>> ARTICLE
Part 7 is definitely my favourite part as well but part 4 is not far behind it though. 
>> ARTICLE
Nyohohoho 

[My only complaint about part 4](/s "is the unexplained stuff, the alien & the alleyway ")  otherwise it's an excellent part that really explores the different emotions and how to incorporate them into stands. Fear, regret, Love and hate, all of them are central to the story without it getting too dramatic, and that's why I love it so!
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul, the anime doesn't give it any justice. If your into collecting mangas, volume 1 came out already and I think volume 2 is coming later this month 
>> ARTICLE
I have tried reading the Tokyo Ghoul manga and found the overall storytelling dysfunctional.

I adored the climatic moments we all know and love, but, during the rising action and exposition portions, there wasn't any good flow to the story. It felt as if the writer was struggling to decide when and where to introduce specific details.

This is also how I feel about the on-going sequel, *Tokyo Ghoul:re*. Everything feels so disjointed, I have found it more readable only when I wait 2 months at a time and let chapters stack up.
>> ARTICLE
Can't have a thread like this without good ol' Tokyo Ghoul

You know it 
>> ARTICLE
The Spice and Wolf light novels are pretty good. 
>> ARTICLE
I prefer to wait for season 3.

I finished them one week ago on vacation.

Man those two took me on an adventure with them. And the end was so great aswell.
>> ARTICLE
But I still felt empty at the end
>> ARTICLE
Maybe. But the ride was quite worth it. 
>> ARTICLE
Im reading them atm (vol. 8 currently). For everyone who loved the anime: JUST DO IT. 
>> ARTICLE
Especially since we will never see season 3.

It hurts me to say that :(
>> ARTICLE
I'll be the one to say Medaka Box. It stops adapting content just as it gets out of the worst two arcs of the entire series. It literally introduces a character in the last minute of the last episode that DEFINES the show and makes it what it is. I read the entire series just for him alone. 
>> ARTICLE
just started reading it, really looking forward since everybody says the first two arcs are the worst and i liked them.
>> ARTICLE
They're the worst, but only comparatively. 
>> ARTICLE
Prison School.


>> ARTICLE
I started with the anime but was pretty bummed out by the over the top censorship on an otherwise entertaining show. I initially started the manga just to see what was just ahead, and was immediately sucked in. It's such a great story and the writing is incredible. The way the author can so quickly make me hate a character in one chapter and then make me love them in the next is astounding. **Highly** recommend this.
>> ARTICLE
>The way the author can so quickly make me hate a character in one chapter and then make me love them in the next is astounding.

I still hate Shingo when I shouldn't up to now lol (Im updated with the manga)
>> ARTICLE
PS is amazing. Not just for the *plot* either. Though it is uber ecchi in its choice of angles.

The story is funny and I binged through it pretty quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Been reading it for 2 years it is indeed fantastic and I am not a big ecchi fan myself 
>> ARTICLE
The art in Prison School's manga is so damn good, and I don't mean just the naughty bits. One of the most addictive mangas I've read. 
>> ARTICLE
**Welcome to the NHK**

Because it is arguably the only book that can pass off as an actual (biographical) novel; and is very loosely based on the author's real life, which makes the characters all the more compelling - especially the MC.

[](/s "That fucking Afterword, man. ;-;")



>> ARTICLE
To add, 

Welcome to the NHK LN was the original material and had little to no fillers. [Spoilers about events](/s "The senpai is a minor character and several arcs (MMORPG, offline suicide meet, pyramid scheme)") never happened. The anime adapted most of the LN except for explaining that Saito's hallucinations were drug induced. 

Then there was the manga, which added the aforementioned arcs and a characters were added and/or had bigger roles. It also make Misaki a lot more manipulative; manga Misaki was actually my favorite version of her. The anime did not adapt the last part of the manga, where [manga spoilers+anime/LN ending spoilers](/s "Misaki went on a brief relationship with the class president's rehabilitated brother, which fizzled out and the resolution to the climax, Misaki's suicide, was less happy.")
>> ARTICLE
It's surprising considering the content of the anime, but the book was even more fucked up. [spoilers](/s "Apparently, the author was abusing drugs, which explains the hallucinations. In the show, they just appear, making it seem like he's schitzophrenic rather than a druggie. Not only that, but he legitimately gets sent child pornography to 'study' for his ero-game, and if I recall correctly he masturbated to it.")
>> ARTICLE
If you liked Fate/Zero and UBW I would recommend playing the VN for Fate/Stay Night and even its sequel, Fate/Hollow Ataraxia.

FSN in particular is good about clearing up some of the things that they just didn't have time for in the anime adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope the vita version comes to the west.
>> ARTICLE
Also, Fate/HA has best girl, and we're not seeing an adaptation anytime soon, so read Hollow Ataraxia.
>> ARTICLE
Aye, adapting FHA would be rather difficult for the fact that the SoL elements are so far removed from the actual plot of the game.

~~Also Hell Yeah Bazett~~
>> ARTICLE
I think that maybe if they adapted FHA into a SoL with an overarching plot maybe it could work, or simply make one series with the SoL and another with the main plot.
>> ARTICLE
I could see choosing random SoL elements to pad out the days between plot advancement scenes. Hopefully they do all of Lancer's fishing misadventures, holy shit those were gold. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's be honest here.  Every single time Lancer was on screen was just wonderful~
>> ARTICLE
Hell, even if you DIDN'T like Unlimited Blade Works, F/SN is worth a shot. Fate route can suck to play through if you're familiar with the franchise and questionable word choice can make Shirou come off as sexist rather than self-sacrificing, but Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel are SO DAMN GOOD that it's worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I saw Shirou as sexist when I first played it, but, well, I now have a different thought there.

[FSN Fate Route](/s "I think he's just using "But she's a girl" to have any sort of excuse for not wanting Saber to fight considering he never does that to any other girl in any other route.  I think he doesn't actually believe that but needs SOMETHING to tell her.")
>> ARTICLE
The author has commented on the reason behind it in an interview, actually. 

>Nasu: [Fate route spoilers] (/s "Urobuchi-san is correct. It's a bizarre development for the King of Britain to fight for all those years and then suddenly regain her sense of being a woman and fall in love with Shirou. Still, that's the kind of boy meets girl story I wanted to tell. As a last resort, I had Shirou directly tell Saber that she was a girl and that she shouldn't fight. That was an intentional step to plant the idea of Saber as a girl in the subconscious of our users. It was also a very direct message from me, the writer of the story. Were I to write that now, I'd use a more subtle way of going about it, but at the time, I was at my limit.")

TL;DR: [](/s "Shirou is written that way in Fate because the romance seems inherently unrealistic and it was Nasu's (kinda amateur) way of reminding the reader that at her heart she was still a regular girl, and not just a famous king, in order to compensate.")

>> ARTICLE
You know, I can roll with that.  It makes a lot more sense on a meta level now, at least.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I'm saying, he needs an excuse to be self-sacrificing. Also, from a visual standpoint Saber really does not look combat ready at like 5 feet tall and 90 pounds.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for reminding me - I did that a while ago!  It was pretty good.  I can't figure out how to get my hands on F/HA though.
>> ARTICLE
There's actually a guide on the /r/FateStayNight subreddit for getting FHA to work.  As for a download and whatnot there's actually a fellow there who I messaged to get it from.  His name should still be on that stickied post as well!
>> ARTICLE
I have it installed now - I'll definitely be checking it out soon.  Thanks for the tip, I totally overlooked that link when I was snooping around that subreddit when I installed F/SN.
>> ARTICLE
The F/HA translation was finished about half a year ago. You'll probably find some links on /r/fatestaynight.
>> ARTICLE
No mention of Claymore is saddening. The anime went original after episode 22.
>> ARTICLE
The Claymore manga is amazing. With AOT doing so well commercially, wouldn't it be a good time to reboot Claymore? Or maybe they're worried that the audience isn't there for a cast of super strong females that aren't moe. 
>> ARTICLE
All time favorite manga. Show is good, ending is shoddy. Manga is godly. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes! Claymore was the first manga I went out and purchased. I *had* to know more about the characters and the world after seeing the anime. The anime covers so little of what really goes on in that incredible story, and it ends pretty much on the first real climax of the manga. Almost every chapter ups the intensity, the excitement, the suspense. It's by far one of the most fulfilling stories I've ever read!

If you even only sort of enjoyed the anime, give the manga a shot. You can even start around chapter 60 if you remember the anime well enough, since that's about where the anime begins to deviate.
>> ARTICLE
What's putting me off is the price. $8 per volume seems pretty steep to me on amazon, is there anywhere cheaper? Never bought any manga and I'm also pretty cheap when I don't know what I'm gonna get out of my purchase.

Wouldn't it be *Sisterhood* in this case?

The Haruhi Suzumiya series. While the Disappearance movie functions as a near-perfect conclusion to the series, the story that continues afterwards is nothing short of brilliant. It becomes an incredibly complex time-travel mystery thriller while maintaining the meandering and exhausted personality of the world as narrated by Kyon. The characters get an INSANE amount of development: what we saw in Disappearance was only the beginning, and by the end I felt as though each and every member of the SOS brigade was a fully fleshed-out character that I cared about (even Koizumi). The whole thing culminates in a way that is nothing short of epic while stile keeping the feel of the series intact, and I loved every word of it.

Also, for all you Haruhi Suzumiya (the character) haters, never fear. Nobody matures more than her in this series. By the end you barely recognize her. 
>> ARTICLE
While we are on the topic this is time for the subthread haruhi reminder that its been nearly 5 years since the last novel the author released. Also to add to that Season 1 heavily used stuff from Novel 3 and Season 2 used stuff from around novels 7/8 while maintaining the image that haruhi hasn't changed on the outside. (much)

There is a lot of material that KyoAni didn't bother using for the anime and i highly recommend to you shits that are on the ropes about it go read it.

Did the anime even adapt snowy mountain syndrome? Its been a while since ive done a rewatch on the anime
>> ARTICLE
No, they didn't adapt it, but I wish they had. Of all the stories from vol. 5-7 (the only ones I've read so far) snowy mountain was my favorite. 
>> ARTICLE
When would you say it picks up? I read vol. 5-7 after watching the series and movie, and it honestly hasn't been as interesting as I hoped it would. I got tired of vol. 5's and 6's constant short stories, so I thought I would find paradise in the 7th, but SPOILER ALERT (can't tag) 

It was so exhaustingly boring. The whole thing is just Kyon going back and forth doing odd jobs while we don't get a clue as to what it's for. Then we finally get the reveal, which is such a disappointing let down I honestly got a little frustrated. Also, the part where Asahina gets captured? She gets rescued so fast you don't even have time to worry about her character. The story started out interesting, making you wonder what Asahina time leaped for, then dragged its feet for WAY too long with those dumb and pretty boring odd jobs, only to finish in an exceedingly anti-climactic conclusion that made me reluctant to order the next volume for a while now. It also doesn't help that the next volume is ALSO a bunch of short stories. 

Honestly, the only short story I found intriguing was Snowy Mountain Syndrome, and that short story was translated before the better translator stepped in, after the 5th vol. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, as I said, it keeps up that exhausted narrator feel that Haruhi has always had going for it. Personally, I love the style. I love Kyon's frustration and mundane interpretations of everything while the plot slowly builds. I love the way the short stories slowly all piece together to build the central narrative. I love how Haruhi captures a lot of the anticlimactic and everyday feel of life, with even its car chase scene being resolved quickly and simply, the way something like that likely would be. I love that the most intense moments in the series are the results of the internal culminations of its characters, and that these drastic changes rarely even manage to affect the situation that triggered them. But all of that is personal taste, and I can easily see someone finding the style to be repetitive and boring. For reference, I thought Endless 8 was amazing and rated the second season higher than the first. That kind of innovation really clicks with me, but it's simply not going to with everyone. 

What I will say, however, is that book seven is easily the most mundane of the franchise, and that the last three books especially feel much more energetic and fresh. 
>> ARTICLE
I have a couple questions for you.

1. Have you read both the fan and official translations? If so, which do you find better? I've only read the official, but I find it annoying that there are quite a few cultural references dropped as if the reader's supposed to understand. I thought they would add footnotes for em or something since official translations always try to translate it in a way that makes it  easy for an English speaker to get into. 

2. Is vol. 8 possibly interesting enough to reel me back into the series? 

So far, I have no complaints in the series' character developments. I love the effect Disappearance had on Kyon and Nagato, Kyon being more appreciative of his life while still retaining his bitter personality, and Nagato seemingly becoming more human with each chapter. The only thing I find lacking is the amount of stuff actually happening. 
>> ARTICLE
Stuff happens alright, you just have to wait for it, there is a lot of subtleties happening in each short story that end up culminating into a larger event.

Having said that it is very slow going- The plot becomes hard to follow and it isn't obvious what's going on until right at the end. It's worth it though.
>> ARTICLE
On the Wikipedia page there's so much with light novels and manga, what do I read and where can I find it?
>> ARTICLE
The lights novels are the original source material, they are all licensed and translated iirc.
>> ARTICLE
Surprised I had to scroll down this much to find Haruhi. The character introduced in the last 3 volumes is amazing, and it's insane that [he/she](/s "she") was overshadowed in the very first episode of the anime. [Reminder](/s "Kunikida stated that Kyon seems to like spending his time with "weird girls", so Haruhi wasn't the first.")
>> ARTICLE
Elfen Lied 

The anime barely covers 1/3'rd of the source material, and misses out on a lot of sub themes and messages. Really interesting read. 


The Fruits of Grisaia 

I would consider myself a somewhat avid reader, and this has become one of my favourite works of fiction. The anime is pretty bad in comparison, I would easily recommend this VN to anyone that enjoys the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
The complete, translated version of Grisaia no Kajitsu should be dropping soon. (Steam has already released a censored version.) Looking forward to seeing what fans of the VN have been raving about!
>> ARTICLE
Complete translated version of Kajitsu has been out for a WHILE. It's fan translated, but it's all there, H-scenes and all. Even comes complete with translator notes for concepts that don't translate well into English. It has a lot of heart put into it.

That said, I am STILL FUCKING WAITING FOR ANY KIND OF GRISAIA NO MEIKYUU TRANSLATION
>> ARTICLE
Right, you mean the patch? I'm aware of that, but I'm waiting on Denpasoft's release.
>> ARTICLE
Why? The fan translation is actually really well done... Hell, it's better than the official Fate translation.
>> ARTICLE
I want to support localization projects with money. I also couldn't find the Japanese game at a good price.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose that's fair. Personally I pirated the game, as I could not find a digital release of the game online, I had to find a disk rip. I might buy the new one to support localization, though.
>> ARTICLE
Only a two more years until the rest is translated ;__; 
>> ARTICLE
I actually didn't know until a few minutes ago that there were sequels, haha. Without going into too much detail, is the end of the first VN a cliffhanger?
>> ARTICLE
[Not much detail but spoiler tagged just in case](/s "The VN has 5 routes, one for each girl. I believe the sequel follows from a non-existent route where either everyone's problems were solved or no one's was (not sure which)")
>> ARTICLE
hmmm, I know very little about the sequels I have only read the fruits of grisaia, and the spin off. 

Ill just say that there really didn't need to be sequels, but considering the way that the whole game plays out there are some minor unresolved plot lines which are most likely completed in the sequels. 
>> ARTICLE
Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE. The anime cuts out all of the blood, minimizes the language, adds a bunch of filler, and changes the ending because it is too "depressing" heck I wouldn't even call the ending of the Tsubasa anime an ending. The manga is definitely worth reading.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't continue watching it after seeing how they changed things and added filler... so awful.
>> ARTICLE
The anime did add in those few OVAs that showed some of the grittier, darker arcs in the manga (ie Tokyo Revelations), but I do agree. Not to mention the manga did a complete 180 at the beginning of that arc and the rate at which the tone changed took me by surprise for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
Production IG did those OVAs. They're amazing. 

Bee train who did the anime probably expected something cute like chobits or CCS and jumped on it and didn't have the balls to adapt it properly when it went all edgy. 

I'm a clamp fanboy tho so TSR is my all time favorite manga
>> ARTICLE
Would also like to recommend Xxxholic, Tsubasa's sister manga. One annoying feature of the anime production was that they practically cut out nearly every mention of Tsubasa, or its characters except in the last few OVA's. But reading the manga will help to make understand how intertwined the plots of the two are.
>> ARTICLE
What if it was based on games? Persona 3 and 4 and Tales of Symphonia come to mind.   
EDIT: AND DANGANRONPA! how did i forget that...

Umineko no naku koro ni.

Yamada-Kun To 7-Nin Majo manga adds way more to the story and the characters. If you enjoyed the show, you would love the manga.

- Mahou Sensei Negima! (Amazing manga , dont get discourage of the begining , thinking is just another romance harem , nope it quickly turns into an amazing story)

- Deadman Wonderland ( Anime is missing half of the manga)

- Elfen Lied (so you can see the true ending)
- The World God Only Knows (Anime is missing the last part of the manga which is amazing , also not all of the girls appeared in the anime , so if you want the best experience of this masterpiece go and read it)

Of this four mangas I highly recommend MSN and TWGOK , both of them are masterpieces for me , hard to tell which one I love the most , but I just finished TWGOK and the feels are still there , its just such a beautiful story.

Negima x 100. The anime doesn't even compare to the manga. Really was a disappointment.

While the Pandora Hearts anime had a very rushed "read the manga" ending, with the manga recently completed I can soundly say that it's a prime example of the good that can come when an author already has most of the story planned out before they start writing.

The manga's just straight up better. It has an actual storyline. The first series is only 40 chapters and has more comedy the the second.

But Rosario+Vampire II series was *extremely* good. It had more of a serious tone to it. Also, the art was fantastic. (74 chapter)

The anime has *some* of the manga's story elements but doesn't use them well at all
>> ARTICLE
The way I see it, the anime was basically a different telling of the manga. The first part of the manga was adapted at least moderately well (very comedic, a bit of ecchi, etc.), but the second half of the manga is where it really shines. R+V II has a much more serious tone to it, and has a lot more action.

If you know Evangelion, I would compare the R+V anime as being the "rebuild" of the manga.

> Raildex 

They screwed up with the adaptation and added filler and shit. 

> Sakurasou

Pretty average ecchi comedy. I didn't think there was anything special there.

Haven't seen the others so I won't comment on those. When you're judging an animation studio, there are a few factors to take into account: diversity of anime, faithfulness as an adaptation (or originality if it's not an adaptation), and animation/sound quality. There are probably other factors but I'll just go through these 3 for now.

**Diversity of works**: most of J.C. Staff's anime are LN adaptations and they are known for their romcoms and ecchi comedies. So there's little diversity in the anime they produce. Furthermore, LNs as a general rule are not very good. So in this area they score poorly.

**Faithfulness of adaptation**: I know that J.C. Staff kinda fucked up the Raildex adaptation and added fillers for no reason. Other than that I haven't read the source material for the stuff they've made or heard any complaints about them having unfaithful adaptations. In this section they get an average score for messing up Raildex and, to my knowledge, nothing else.

**Animation/sound quality**: very mediocre. Most/all of their anime have the same kind of art style and it really is nothing special. There's nothing unique or interesting about the art style and I don't think I've ever said anything along the lines of "wow, this animation quality is beautiful" with anything they've done. Sound quality is mediocre too. There are very few pieces from their OSTs that I found interesting and most of their OPs/EDs are nothing special ("only my railgun" being an exception). 

So in these 3 criteria, their scores are poor, average and poor. For reference (in no particular order) I'd say all of the following active animation studios are better: Madhouse, Shaft, KyoAni, Ufotable, Bones, A-1, production I.G., Brains Base, Sunrise, P.A. Works. If J.C. Staff does "amazing work" then you're free to argue how it is better than most of those studios I just listed.
>> ARTICLE
>Raildex
>>They screwed up with the adaptation and added filler and shit.

That's your opinion, I enjoyed the adaption and the filler.

>Sakurasou
>>Pretty average ecchi comedy. I didn't think there was anything special there.

Again, that is your opinion, alot of people enjoyed Sakurasou, and the ending brings forth tears from most.
___
I won't go into the rest, because as you can see... there is a pattern

I like J.C Staff, I like their works

You don't.

Those are opinions, people are different. However that is no reason to say

>J.C. Staff is a pretty shit studio

Then proceeding to shit on everything they do.

Personally I hate SHAFT but I'm not gonna shit on everything they do or start voicing why I hate them, I just keep it to myself, because I understand people may like them. That's why it's an opinion.

Edit: and stop being petty and downvoting every reply I make, it's childish
>> ARTICLE
> I like J.C. Staff, I like their works. You don't.

Which is exactly why we have objective criteria for judging animation studios like animation/sound quality and originality/faithfulness to the source material and diversity of works. KyoAni's animation quality is extremely high. Ufotable generally has good sound quality because their OSTs are composed by Yuki Kajiura. Madhouse has done absolutely every genre and type of show. Most of the studios above haven't had any issues with bad adaptations, meanwhile I also just realized J.C. Staff is responsible for the Tsukihime anime, an adaptation so bad that most people like to pretend it never happened, so in retrospect I'd also give them a "poor" score for faithfulness of adaptation.

You're welcome to try to dispute anything I just said, of course. I'd love to hear a reasoned argument as to how I'm actually wrong about J.C. Staff having poor animation/sound quality or faithfulness/originality/diversity in their anime.
>> ARTICLE
._. Do I have to post the definition of objective and subjective everytime?!

I mean you are aware that unless you post nothing but facts you aren't being objective.

When you start to interpret you aren't being objective.

As for animation and all the things you listed (faithfulness) you can't say it's objectively bad because it's up to interpretation and response to the viewer. 

Also diversity doesn't really matter.

And originality? I'm not quite sure what that has to do with if a studio is good or not.

Anyway; that means your scores and review of J.C staff  literally is just subjective.

Knights of Sidonia. I love the anime but the manga goes in so much more detail.

To be fair, the manga has a pretty jumbled start. Scenes that appear important last a matter of panels and a bunch of science fiction-y ideas are dropped as quickly as they're introduced. The anime series does a *way* better job at introducing a newcomer to the world of Sidonia, at least judging from the first volume that I read.

>What anime's source material is worth reading?

**Every single one.**

No anime is 100.00% faithful to its source material. Even a faithful adaptation skips things of its source. So, if enjoyed an anime, look for the source material is the normal thing to do.
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily, especially with a large percentage of LNs. Fan favourites like Toradora, Spice&Wolf, and Haruhi are massively better as anime. They're only worth reading for either completion's or comparison's sake most of the time.
>> ARTICLE
>Fan favourites like Toradora, **Spice&Wolf**, and Haruhi are massively **better as anime**.

I completely disagree with the bold part.

The novels that the anime covered gave way more depth to Lawrence and Holo characters and their relationship.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. I wish more people listened to this advice.

If you like an anime, you are sad it ended because there is no more of it then go and read the source material be it manga LN or VN. Most likely it didn't cover all of the story and even if it did, you missed out on fleshing of characters and character development.
>> ARTICLE
Not Genshiken. The anime is way funnier.
>> ARTICLE
Not so. Checking out Highschool DxD's novels ruined my enjoyment of the series. Seeing further into the MC's head made him absolutely insufferable, the plot and world flaws became more pronounced (used to just assume exposition was missing from the anime), the author's sexist view of females is unmistakable (all women, even the most powerful in strength and authority, really just want a man to protect and compliment them), and it's just poorly written from a technical perspective that's typical of LNs but feels exaggerated (every single thing that happens needs the MC spelling out how he and everyone feels about it, even when the author manages to describe the events colorfully enough that we can easily infer what everyone thinks).

Also, the anime producers had the good sense to skip a few things from the source that were totally stupid, like a dragon power level scouter so that the MC would always know just how powerful to become to win.

So yeah, don't check out the DxD light novels if you really enjoy novels.

Definitely was better for it. HxH 2011 anime was a rare example of being better in all areas. 
>> ARTICLE
lol
>> ARTICLE
Okay. At least my opinion isn't just something I saw get upvoted and decided to parrot. 

Having Gon's goal based around his longing for his father, rather than a chance encounter from kite, definitely made more sense (Gon basing his life around it made more sense). 

Also Gon had plenty motivation to try to revive and save kite (he thought it was his fault). 


Nothing was lost from moving Kite, I think it was better and can actually support my claim. 
>> ARTICLE
Except you tried to claim it's better for it. Proper foreshadow is always preferable to impromptu flashbacks.

* Kite was intended to be a brother/father figure to Gon. He is supposed to be the sole reason Gon made finding Ging his goal in the first place. The subtle emphasis of this was lost due to the shifting of his introduction.

* There are A LOT of fans who were unconvinced as to why Gon was so hardened by what happened to Kite and that can also be attributed to the shifting of Kite's introduction. That noticeable confusion in the viewership trumps your own self being adequately persuaded in assessing whether the series benefited overall.

I have no quarrel with the fact you personally felt no issue towards it, but we CAN objectively assert that the story was weakened in overall public perception.
>> ARTICLE
Lmao, did you like delete and rewrite like this 3 times? 


>but we CAN and DO objectively assert that the story was weakened in public perception.

It wasn't. Where were those people while the show was airing? 100 nonexistent. 


Did you not understand the rift Kite's death caused between Gon/Killua and *why*. Reread the page Gon realizes kite is gone. 

He's not upset because Kite is the the guy who he met once a long time ago and knew his dad. 


He feels wholly responsible for Kite's death and he's angry at killua for not letting him at least try to save him. 


Not to mention that Kite is the only other human on the planet that Gon can talk about Ging with (his mother wouldn't really), so them becoming fast friends made perfect sense. 


>He is supposed to be the sole reason Gon made finding Ging his goal in the first place. The subtle emphasis of this was lost due to the shifting of his introduction.

That tiny little connection with kite was lost (but i explained above why it wasn't needed) but A TON was gained. The entire motivation for the story was strengthen, Gon wanting to know *why* his dad became a hunter was so much more powerful than having Kite plant the idea of being a hunter. 
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty interesting; something I didn't know about. I think that showing Kite at the start of the series would have made his appearance later on seem more interesting or important - possibly more believable too (not that it wasn't). Although, I can also understand your point so I want to read the first few chapters at some point to see what it's like and compare them.
>> ARTICLE
Diamond no Ace anime is better than the manga.
>> ARTICLE
It's not even about being faithful, most anime don't even get through the whole story in their running. Anime only endings almost always never compare to the source, mainly because they leave a ton of questions unanswered and in some cases the story could mean something completely different just because of something that happens in the later chapters.
>> ARTICLE
Except Usagi Drop. In that case not being faithful is a good thing
>> ARTICLE
So what happened in Usagi Drop manga?
>> ARTICLE
[Explanation] (/s "this is from memory, so forgive my minor errors. The story does a time skip. Rin's in highschool. Skipping some drama its revealed that Rin isn't related to Daikichi's family, and grandpa was only posing. It's also revealed that Rin has fallen in love with Daikichi. He resists but relents later because his only want in life is for her to be happy. If I recall, he stipulates she has to wait until she's a full adult so she can make a decision without the cloud of youth.")
>> ARTICLE
I only read the manga, how does the anime differ?
>> ARTICLE
The anime ends before the timeskip. So most people don't know about the stuff afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not gonna ruin the show for me. So I'm not reading the spoiler, but I have a few guesses. I just don't want it to be confirmed.
>> ARTICLE
Why does everyone hate this ending so much? Ive stayed away from it cause everyone around here treats it like satan. I havent read it but by your summary it doesnt sound that bad. Am i weird for thinking that?
>> ARTICLE
The reason why we include the relationship between Rin (child) and Daikichi (parent) under the banner of illegal "incest", although there are no blood relations, is because of a relationship of trust. It is similar in this way to a relationship between a doctor and patient or a lawyer and client (which are equally protected). 

Such a relationship is easily exploited and has a wide scope for a child (regardless of age) to make choices they would not otherwise make if not for that relationship upon which they have relied. It is part of life that children need to become independent and learn to trust other people. Daikichi went in the correct direction giving her time to think over it, but this did not significantly change their relationship.

I did not mind the deviation in the manga, it was interesting to consider, especially in the light of their exceptional family history, but I did appreciate the first part of the manga and anime a lot more for what it was. The story was simply about trials of parenthood.
>> ARTICLE
It's mostly because the show is all about this heartwarming feeling you get watching as Daikichi at first reluctantly takes on the role of being Rin's guardian since nobody else would help her, but really grows out of that into actually fathering her. The bond he forms with Rin as a non-traditional family unit becomes unbreakable over the course of the show, as it should because it's what the entire show is about.

The ending that is provided is a completely different tone that kinda tarnishes what everything else was building on. The unlikely father-daughter combination that we watched grow over so long breaks down because things are taken in a romantic direction. It's kinda the same pitfall that Oreimo fell into. Yeah a romance plot can feasibly happen, but when you set such a strength-of-family setting and tone throwing in an incest twist is kinda radical. It makes more sense in a setting that is set up for that kind of romantic arc from the get-go.

It's not the worst ending ever, but why take things in that direction y'know? You'd have a lot more impact if you just had a separate arc where she is a teenager but *doesn't* fall for Daikichi, and build more upon the foundation you've already set for yourself where Daikichi is forced to mature with Rin as a single parent.

It makes more sense for a kid to have romantic feelings towards a guardian anyway. It's a very normal thing for kids to go through. Not so much for teenagers.

That's why I'm a bit against the ending anyway. It's not like the world is ending because things took that route, but I'd have been happier if it focused more on the themes that made it so popular to begin with because that is what it is especially good at.
>> ARTICLE
It all depends on how you invest in the story. for a lot of people it's a story about fatherhood and family, so when the time skip happens it becomes very incestuous and wrong. 

For others it's a cute story of a guy looking after a kid, after the time skip the kid falls in love with the guy and they live happily ever after. 

There is no wrong way to watch the show but people do get worked up. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't know why people hate it so much, either. Yes, it is an unexpected twist in the story and yes, it is a bit ... awkward. But when you think about it, it's not THAT extraordinary age-wise and certainly nothing illegal. When I read it, I thought "well, that was unexpected" and not "MY EYES! Bring the bleach!"

Yes, that makes sense. For me, it was the second one, so the end of the story did not bother me much. But I can see how it might annoy somebody who considered the manga to be a "how to be a good father" story.
>> ARTICLE
Oh it goes way past annoy and into the realms of personally insulted for a decent amount of people. There have been some incredibly heated argument over bunny drop in /r/manga and until I realized people were reading very different stories I was one of them.

Daikichi is a character guys can really empathize with and really get that I am this character investment going. So it very much becomes a story about fatherhood for them and while its not often discussed guys do have very strong feelings about being fathers. After the time skip the story becomes a betrayal of every aspect of what guys consider good fatherhood (stable home, growth of character, succeeding without them, finding love).

Its actually an amazing example of what the author wrote being dramatically misread either that or they're a massive troll which I can also support.
>> ARTICLE
(spoilers)

In at least the US, [this would count as incest](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/22qvv9/serious_under_what_parameters_can_i_raise_my_own/) (even if you aren't blood related). Most people wouldn't be sexually (or anything beyond a paternal relationship) attracted to a person s/he has raised from the age of 6. It's considered deviant in today's society, on the same level as parent/child incest.

I read the first 3 LN's and those felt like a straight copy paste compared to the anime, I guess it gets better but idk if I can manage to get through them all

This this and even more this. There were so many details and other parts left out of the anime that people really needed to see, but didn't. The LN's explain pretty much everything you want to know, and we've got 16 volumes (Though 16th only just came out in Japan, so no translation yet).  
I think the anime is up to volume 7 or 8, and 9 onwards is Alicization, which honestly blows all the previous stuff out of the water.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, as much shit as SAO gets its still one of my favorites. The anime isn't the best and i'll agree to that but I still love it. But when it comes to the LN's its an entirely different story. Reki (the author) really starts developing his writing style as he goes on and Alicization is easily his best one. The concept, the world building, in a world we already knew, is just fantastic and I'm glad it gets some love among all the SAO hate on this sub.

[Overlord](http://myanimelist.net/manga/81669/Overlord) is really worth reading. The novels are a lot better than the anime as the anime can not really follow all the gore from the novels. 

[Rokka no Yusha](http://myanimelist.net/manga/55869/Rokka_no_Yuusha) also from this season is really great. I would strongly not advise you to read it as Fremy destroys all debate over who is the best girl in anime. I heard rumors that future "Best Girl" polls will be renamed to "Best Fremy" polls.

[Higurshi](http://myanimelist.net/manga/1257/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni:_Onikakushi-hen) and the complete clusterfuck of reading order is really a work of art. To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement. 

[Akagami no Shirayuki-hime](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30123/Akagami_no_Shirayuki-hime) was quite enjoyable to read. For those of you that like Kiki, reading the manga is strongly advice she has some strong character arcs that wont be covered until late S2 / early S3, a.k.a. when hell freezes over.

[K-on! College](http://myanimelist.net/manga/51855/K-On!_College) and [Highschool](http://myanimelist.net/manga/51857/K-On!_Highschool) is really worth reading if you watched K-on. They are both fairly short. 

[Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/manga/35513/Koten-bu_Series) novels are equally amazing as the anime. Would for sure recommend.

[Nazo no Kanojo X](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12467/Nazo_no_Kanojo_X) if you did not get enough of seeing people drooling in eachothers mouthes.

[Hataraku Maousama!](http://myanimelist.net/manga/36719/Hataraku_Maousama!) is up the same alley as Mahouka. Worth reading but you will probably have trouble finding translations. I have not read the manga version. 

My tip for you is just read the source material for whatever animes you liked. They will rarely disappoint you.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano!  I swear you won't regret it.

Not only is Narita Ryohgo the best LN writer out there imo, but the series keeps the zany non-chronological storytelling with even more thrilling plotlines and gloriously insane characters.  There are even major feels later!
>> ARTICLE
99% of the time the manga is always better
>> ARTICLE
If you liked Nausicaa, read the manga. The movie only covers a portion of the story, and much of it is quite different from the original manga, especially the ending. Miyazaki's artwork is incredible as is his world building. It is epic. 
>> ARTICLE
Pandora Hearts.

Pandora Hearts.

*Pandora Hearts.*

The manga for Pandora Hearts is indescribably amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Highschool DxD
>> ARTICLE
I don't circlejerk Steins;Gate nearly as much as the rest of this community, but the VN is worth it alone for the fact that it has hilarious 2ch esque arguments on it every once in a while that are so extremely meta it hurts.

The story and Okabe's delusions are all just a bonus, the real meat of the VN is those @channel arguments.
>> ARTICLE
Sidonia no Kishi. AKA Knights of Sidonia's manga is excellent. Greatest scifi manga I've read

>> ARTICLE
I would go with Nanatsu no Taizai, some scenes were skipped and a but of the story was changed.  The current arc is also really awesome
>> ARTICLE
The skips weren't that major though (except Gowther's introduction) and it's overall a great adaptation. I think it was pretty well received as well so hopefully it will get a second season and another OVA for Edinburgh.


>> ARTICLE
I'm told frequently that High School DxD LNs are quite enjoyable and offer far more than the anime (as to be expected I suppose haha).
>> ARTICLE
The Soul Eater manga is significantly better than the anime imo. The anime caught up to the source and took it in a completely different anime-only direction

**Attack on Titan** made me start reading manga.

**Index** made me start reading Light Novels.

Also I need to mention **Railgun** manga.

> I've read Jitsu wa Watsahi wa

Is it any good? do you recommend it? Does it have closure?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's quite good.  Art style is a little disconcerting at first, but you get used to it after a few chapters.

It's still ongoing, so the story isn't over, but I do enjoy where it's gone so far.  Recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
The last few chapters of Sayonara zetsubou sensei are definitely worth reading, the ending is fantastic.  
>> ARTICLE
Some anime which isnt mentioned yet:

Heaven lost property 

Elfen Lied

Black Cat!
>> ARTICLE
From your list, I'd recommend The World God Only Knows. If you want to continue after the anime ended start with volume 20. There's really only one big arc left so if you want to wait for season 4 to get announced/made that might be better
>> ARTICLE
How does 5 cm/second compare to its source material?
>> ARTICLE
The Rurouni Kenshin manga was great.
>> ARTICLE
Love Hina's manga is infinitely better than the anime. Better paced, stronger character development ect. Wish Shaft would remake it with a glossy coat of sparkles and head tilts. 
>> ARTICLE
Rurouni Kenshin! It's an absolute blast.
>> ARTICLE
It's actually the opposite of source material, but the Neon Genesis Evangelion Manga is pretty good. 
>> ARTICLE
Well it more than half my half to make it....
>> ARTICLE
Rurouni kenshin, the anime did a pretty good job up until after the shishio arc. Then it became mostly filler(manga was behind). Its about a former manslayer who vows never to kill again and wields a reverse edged sword. Its silly at moments, but it also has some cool action.

Also OnePunch Man, the anime hasnt come out yet, but the manga is awesome. The webcomic which the manga is based on isnt very good art wise, but still has a great story.
>> ARTICLE
Rosario Vampire has a much better manga than the anime, if you liked the anime at all then you should give it a shot. Also the My Little Monster manga finishes the story so if you felt the anime ended too abruptly then read that one.
>> ARTICLE
Monster musume

The manga doesn't censor itself, has a lot more character debt to it and doesnt have to full in the void of exposed tits with unnecessary forced crotch and cleavage shots. Really, the anime could even benefit from trying to tone down its own fanservice, even if it means there is little fanservice. The manga is much more nuanced imo.
>> ARTICLE
Um what are you talking about? These people watch MonMusu for fan service and sexual comedy. I think you're doing it wrong if you're looking for a good "story." 

What are you getting at?
>> ARTICLE
The ecchi element is definitely why most of us are here.

But he's right in saying that the manga is a good bit more nuanced. It's more raunchy but at the exact same time it's more subtle too.

There is a significant amount of characterization that is being missed as well. Not that I'm not enjoying the show as well, but the manga feels less like it's forcing it.
>> ARTICLE
Beelzebub's manga is so much better than the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Monster is great, but I'm pretty sure the anime did an extremely good job in adapting the manga almost scene for scene... obviously some dialogue tweaks, but pretty much the exact same story.  
>> ARTICLE
All of them. The source material almost always beats the adaption. 
>> ARTICLE
SAO
>> ARTICLE
Why did you give the first season of Index a 7 and the second one a 5? Just curious because it seemed to me that the final arc of Index II was amazing.

Getting back on the topic, Tokyo Ghoul (You can watch the first season then pick up the manga around chapter 60. Don't watch the second season, it's utter garbage and original), Akame ga Kill manga since this one also went original after episode 21-22. 

If you don't mind novels, the Spice and Wolf novels are quite good and No Game No Life adapts 3 volumes and there are currently 7 out (last one came out recently so not translated yet)
>> ARTICLE
I liked the Clannad visual novel well enough to spend 50+ hours on the school arc.
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru. The manga is amazing and the anime is unfinished. A lot of the best moments haven't been animated.
>> ARTICLE
I'm mostly waiting for it to wrap up the story, as I think I'd find it more frustrating to be left waiting for the remaining chapters.
>> ARTICLE
If you watched Heaven's lost property, read the manga. It's one of my all time favorites
>> ARTICLE
Kaichou wa Maid sama.

If you want to laugh your butt of and you cant wait for the anime to catch up. Prison School
>> ARTICLE
**Deadman Wonderland** and **Elfen Lied**
>> ARTICLE
Yahari/Oregairu. I just don't enjoy the anime as much after reading the LNs. The dialogue and psychological analysis in the LNs are so much better.
>> ARTICLE
Anything based on a visual novel, so Steins;Gate, anything from Key - especially Air and Little Busters which had especially crap adaptations, Ef, White Album 2, and so on.
>> ARTICLE
**Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin.**

For starters: [the manga](http://myanimelist.net/manga/214/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam:_The_Origin) is a re-telling of the first 1979 Gundam TV series (itself and anime-original), with some re-worked events and added backstory. However, [the OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10937/Mobile_Suit_Gundam:_The_Origin) of the same name is simply going to adapt the backstory segments of the manga, leaving out the events of the original series. So for the full story, one can either watch the first series/its movie trilogy in addition to this new OVA, orf read the Origin's manga.
>> ARTICLE
Any Visual Novel adaptation, go read the source material it's great stuff and usually has more than one route!
>> ARTICLE
i'll throw you one from a different genre you might take an interest in. Elfen Lied
>> ARTICLE
GATE, you can't really compare them
>> ARTICLE
Question, is the death note manga worth reading?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's more detailed and I liked the manga better, also the ending is a bit different. 
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the Danmachi light novels, it's more detailed, Bell is more believable, and it has great world building.  
>> ARTICLE
Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. It's just as funny as the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Assassination Classroom. The manga has the amazing God of Death and Korosensei Backstory arcs that I hope get animated in coming seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Rurouni Kenshin
>> ARTICLE
The manga that Bokura ha Minna Kawaisou and Bakuman are based on are both really good.
>> ARTICLE
I'm reading S&W (must-read for fans), Mahouka (much better then the anime due to the fleshed out lore) and Oregairu (on vol.2 and it's hilarious, I wonder what's the transition to the more serious/dramatic volumes gonna be like). Would recommend all of them.

Index LN is worth reading, it just gets so much better than what we see in the adaptations.

Mnogatari's ligh novel

* Mysterious Girlfriend X
* Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches
* Gangsta

* Prison School
* Rosario Vampire

Those are a few worth reading. 
>> ARTICLE
Akame Ga Kill, Tokyo Ghoul and Noragami.


Im leaning towards SAO as well, though i havent read the LNs yet
>> ARTICLE
Overlord LN!, so much better than the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Light Novels:

Havent gotten into them, but hearing about Hyouka having a great LN that goes a little further than the anime ending may just break that for me. 

Manga:

Dead man Wonderland, and Claymore are tow big ones. The anime original ending are replaced with more in-depth character development and introductions for every character you meet, better stories and worthwhile endings. 

Berserk is another. Sadly the anime and movies only touched at the beginning, and you are thrown into an even darker world after the ending of the anime. 

One that never needs to be read or animated:

Thr second half of Usagi Drop. I am so god damn happy that never happened, as the second half brutally destroys the wonderful story created before it. 
>> ARTICLE
Prison School.
>> ARTICLE
Oregairu man. The LN is amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say Tsukihime, but there hasn't been an anime yet.
>> ARTICLE
Most definitely recommend the Noragami manga! It's excellent, imo. 
>> ARTICLE
Ao no exorcist
>> ARTICLE
Akira
>> ARTICLE
Kiseijuu, the dark and gritty feeling in the manga can't be topped
>> ARTICLE
My Ranking would be:

- Gantz best Manga I ever read God lvl

- Berserk amazing settings

- Tokyo Ghoul is really good in terms of brutality and "dark"

- Pandora Hearts the art and story is pretty genius

- Shokugeki no Shouma is pretty much delivering all hype I need

- Nisekou just reading the manga is so beatiful 10000000% better then the anime

- Zetsue no Tempest is really cool to watch but the anime is better I think

>> ARTICLE
oregairu Lighnovel, much better than the animes
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised that no one said Gantz..
>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf, if you can find a translated version.
>> ARTICLE
15 of the 17 light novels have been officially released in the US, and most or all of the manga as well
>> ARTICLE
Oh nice. When I was reading it there was only up until vol. 13. Guess its time to pick it up again.
>> ARTICLE
You might as well start reading kizumonogatari right now because it's the only way you'll ever get to know the story ;)
>> ARTICLE
Ghost in the Shell should be read by everyone that ever felt like the film was too complicated. The Puppet Master arc is some of the best writing cyberpunk or science fiction in general, has ever seen, let alone the manga industry. Ghost in the Shell: Human Error, explains everything Motoko has done between the two films. Ghost in the Shell: Man Machine Interface is the final and more difficult read to me personally. At this point in the timeline, Motoko has multiple identities running around in their own prosthetic bodies taking orders from her via the internet.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say the durarara novel. It's much more detailed and easier to follow 
>> ARTICLE
Vampire Hunter D (a series of novels)- the original OVA, and Bloodlust cover 2 novels.  There are 26 total so far.

DanMachi (Light Novel)- seems to go in a bit more detail about some of the events.

Fruits Basket (manga)- the anime ended before the manga was over, and the manga is really a great story.  

Haganai (Light Nove)- Adds a bit more detail to the characters, and has some material that hasn't ben animated.  

Negima (manga)- Someday they will make a decent Negima anime based on the manga, I hope.  

>> ARTICLE
Tsukihime is definitely worth a read, seeing as it doesn't have a currently existing anime. Or it would probably just be better to wait for the supposed remake, but knowing type moon we'll be lucky if that's out by 2050.
>> ARTICLE
My recommendation is Mahou Sensei Negima, no anime adaptations has done it justice. After The kyoto arc the manga gets a billion times better. The school festival is amazing, and the battles are badass. Plus we get the most fucking op character ever with Jack Rakan. The only downside is the ending, it was rushed but hopefully UQ holder another manga set in negima's future makes up for it.
>> ARTICLE
Any shoenin your interested in, reading manga is significantly faster and without filler.
>> ARTICLE
The Kuroshitsuji anime is crap, but the manga is one of the darkest and saddest things I've ever read in my life, and the characters have 1000x more depth
>> ARTICLE
Most anime whose original source is manga do a shitty job at adapting the material, or even if they do a good job it still doesn't compare to the original source. 


Off the top of my mind Tokyo Ghoul and Nanatsu no Taizai didn't get the justice they deserved. Berserk not because it was bad, but because it wasn't completed.
>> ARTICLE
"Welcome to the nhk." Pretty short novel about a NEET.
>> ARTICLE
Soul Eater does alot more with the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Surprised no one mentioned it but **Naruto Shipuuden** bruh. Just to end the amount of filler frustration.
>> ARTICLE
**SOUL EATER**
>> ARTICLE
Hard to believe nobody has said **Clannad** yet.

Holy. Shit. I cried a lot during my playthrough of the anime, the vn was Earth shattering. 

The ending felt a lot more fulfilling too, which was the biggest complaint of the show. The ending makes perfect sense to me but after rewatching the show recently for the 4th time, they don't make much more than slight mentions towards one of the most important pieces that builds up to the ending which is probably why it felt a bit contrived to most people.

The ending was the best part if you ask me.

Also, if you like Clannad and *especially* if you like Tomoyo, try **Tomoyo After**. It's an alternate universe where Tomoyo is the After-Story heroine. It's also an eroge so be warned, but it's really not so bad and there are censored versions that lack that element. Though you miss out on one of the most powerful sex scenes I've yet to witness so there is that too. The artwork was also off-putting at first since it looks nothing like Clannad's, but it grew on me.

I cried like a bitch at the typewriter ending too. Hoooooooooly shit that was some powerful stuff. Hoooooooly shit I'm probably gonna cry just remembering it.
>> ARTICLE
Fruits Basket

If you're a manly macho man like me
>> ARTICLE
Ga-rei was a pretty good manga imo. Not incredible but definitely a worthy source material.
>> ARTICLE
Not recent, but the 6-volume manga for Akira is fantastic. So much more plot and character development than the movie.
>> ARTICLE
Visual novels:  
*Grisaia no Kajitsu* (Fruit of Grisaia) is **way** better than the anime, at least with the first season. There's almost no comparison.  

*Little Busters!* the visual novel is fucking amazing.

*Steins;Gate* is also a very well-regarded visual novel.  

*Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni* and *Umineko no Naku Koro Ni* are absolutely fantastic visual novels. Higurashi's anime is apparently okay, but Umineko's is atrocious.

Manga:  
*Rosario + Vampire*. The anime is a pointless fanservice vehicle, but the manga actually goes somewhere and it gets considerably darker than one might expect.  

*Assassination Classroom* is just a very fun manga. The anime is also okay, but I recommend the manga anyway.  

These are all I can think of off the top of my head.
>> ARTICLE
Akame ga kill and akame ga kill zero. Zero sets up why akame is in night raid, and akame ga kill Is way better than the steaming pile of crap that is the anime
>> ARTICLE
If haven't yet you should pick up on.

-Witch Craft Works
-Nisekoi if you want to enjoy comedy but with no progression
-Plz read Sora no Otoshimono because the anime adaptation is cancer (really bad)
-If you what plot and a lot of good "PLOT" then Momster Musume
>> ARTICLE
I just recently started reading the Spice and Wolf light novel, where the 2nd season ended, more precisely starting from Volume 6. I recommend it reading it to anyone who don't want to wait forever for (if they gonna make...) next season(s), because there is plenty to read until the last volume.
>> ARTICLE
I don't even have to look. I know somebody's said Berserk.
>> ARTICLE
Gate: and Thus the JSDF Fought There

Or something?  Japanese names are hard guys.  The anime sanitizes a gritty series and adds sexuality to characters who were refreshingly not all interested in MC-kun
>> ARTICLE
If you read jitsu, then you would know how different the anime is from the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah, but I still like both.
>> ARTICLE
- Tokyo Ghoul (Studio Pierrot fucked it up, S1 was ok but very rushed and S2 was garbage that had nothing to do with the original story)

- Berserk (the series and the movies don't do this awesome series justice, its basically only the GA arc but Berserk is so much bigger)

Two great manga that I would recommend to anyone!
>> ARTICLE
The DxD light novels are great and there is a ton of stuff left which has yet to be animated, and BorN ended with an anime-original storyline which is definitely inferior to the novel storyline. Additionally, they left out the majority of Volume 5, which is another reason to pick up the series.
>> ARTICLE
Nisekoi, it's not that a lot of stuff happens o move the story forward (the last few weeks excluded), but there is a reason why manga readers like Haru.
>> ARTICLE
is Sao worth reading? or is it still shit

>> ARTICLE
Seems a very obvious answer but the Fate/ Stay Night VN. I read it to get to the 3rd route since there's no anime for it yet, but the other 2 routes just made so much more sense, as there's only so much exposition you can work into an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Not that much into manga, so can only give LN recommendations:

As you liked the NGNL anime, I would also recommend reading the LN. Especially volume 6 is excellent(show stops at volume 3, although ending isn't same as volume 3 ending(it uses the volume 6 ending))

Overlord is also a really good LN. The novel has a lot more details about things.

Lastly, Rokka no Yuusha is also really good, but it seems like you aren't enjoying the anime, so it might not be what you are looking for.
>> ARTICLE
Since no one's said anything...
One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
You have rokka a 5 while charlotte a 8 bruv we fighting 
>> ARTICLE
Haven't updated my MAL for a while.  Rokka's still a 5 in my book but Charlotte's kind of like a 6 atm.  I loved the MC in the first 2 or 3 episodes but he's quickly regressed into generic dude territory from his early sociopathy, so the show's less interesting than it was.

I don't like Rokka's animation and the story has failed to really grip me week-to-week.  Maybe when there are more episodes out I might just watch it all in one sitting.
>> ARTICLE
Smh I don't like you.... In all seriousness you sound like my brother but he does like the animation 
>> ARTICLE
I rarely read manga, especially anything that's related to sports. However, [Slam Dunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_Dunk_%28manga%29) is one of the most engaging and enjoyable manga series that I've come across. The anime adaptation is fairly old but the manga should be easy to get into.

>> ARTICLE
The fate zero novels let you get deeper into each characters head would recommend. In rider's case it is inspiring,  in casters case it's downright scary.

Kuroko's Basketball

Beginning: This is so ridiculous. Why do they literally have super powers? This makes no sense

By the end: COME ON GUYS! SHOW THEM THE TRUE POWER OF TEAMWORK! YOU CAN'T LET THIS SHIT WIN! THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD FOR! YOU CAN'T GIVE UP NOW!
>> ARTICLE
I always thought their "powers" were just overexaggerated physical abilities except for that one guy that makes you trip and shit thats just seems silly to me. I stopped watching around episode 56 or so and havent found the motivation to go back and finish it.
>> ARTICLE
so it gets better?, im on ep 6 and i don't know if i want to keep watching it.
>> ARTICLE
It totally get better, but you gotta just go with the ridiculousness. 
>> ARTICLE
It gets amazing. You get so used to how ridiculous it is.
>> ARTICLE
What exactly are you gripes with KnB?
>> ARTICLE
I loved it from the first episode. I loved that they basically had powers. I am not a fan of sports really, so I don't really watch sports anime.. but there is a certain genre of sports anime the I like. I always describe them the same way.

It's a battle anime but with Basketball for Kuroko's Basketball

It's a battle anime but with volleyball for haikyuu!!

>> ARTICLE
> By the end: COME ON GUYS! SHOW THEM THE TRUE POWER OF TEAMWORK! YOU CAN'T LET THIS SHIT WIN! THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD FOR! YOU CAN'T GIVE UP NOW!

The sweet sweet smell of someone who's fallen for the tropes of sports anime.

[](#ehehehe)
>> ARTICLE
You reacted the exact same way I did to Kuroko no Basuke in the beginning. Except I dropped it after the first episode, but I came back to it a few weeks later and loved it.
>> ARTICLE
For me it took years. I've only started it back up a few months ago and I'm surprised at how much I adore it now. But I'm sad to have not been into it when it was still going strong...
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann, to be honest i didn't like it very much at the start. The second half brought it all back though and now i like the show.
>> ARTICLE
same here. it was meh and predictable/repetitive up until Episode 17. For me, thats when it started getting CRAZY and became easily one of my favourites
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I would go as far as to say the first ~5 episodes of Gurren Lagann are straight bad
>> ARTICLE
I won't say they were bad, but they were pretty damn boring. There were a few awesome parts, like Kamina's sword fight with Viral, but overall I dropped the show for almost a year because I couldn't get into it after the first few episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to accept that this is as close to a safe space as I'll ever get and agree. I had to watch up to about ep 9 by skipping through the movie(s).
>> ARTICLE
If not the first 2, then DEFINITELY the spa episode and the one with the outsourced animation.
>> ARTICLE
Only the censored spa episode. The uncensored bathhouse episode is pure brilliance.
>> ARTICLE
Uncensored you say? I... I never knew it existed. I'll be right back 
>> ARTICLE
I like the feel of the early episodes because it has a sense of they're gathering up the squad to end all squads, but my personal favorite is the military drama bit right after the timeskip.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, in the beginning I thought it was kinda boring and I wasn't a fan. And then by the end, it became my 2nd favorite anime of all time.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's a shame that people don't like the beginning half of TTGL. It's a fantastic coming of age story (which Gainax in general excel at) for Simon. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought the first half was great. It's just some of the starting episodes up until the point where [ep. 8 spoiler](/s "Kamina dies") were just mediocre. It happened in the second half as well where the start was meh and it picks back up towards the ending.
>> ARTICLE
Nagi no Asukara. I hated the first episode. I absolutely despised Hikari, the main character, during that first episode. I wanted to drop the show right then and there. But, me and my friend had selected a few shows airing that season that we would definitely watch all the way through to talk about later, so I stuck with it, cursing my existence. 

But, as I watched it, I came to love. Character development happened. So much character development. I actually came to really like Hikari as a character, along with the rest of the characters. I'm so glad I stuck with it. I loved it so much by the time it had ended.
>> ARTICLE
I had trouble getting past the general premise and setup. I know it's a work of fiction and anime but I just couldn't suspend my disbelief for the world they were trying to create. And based on the first episode it didn't really seem like they were trying to get the viewers to do so in the first place. 
>> ARTICLE
I just kinda forgot about it after a few episodes. The show was so engrossing that my disbelief was naturally suspended :)
>> ARTICLE
The show is decent but the characters make you so mad!! 
And don't even try shipping cuz the second half ruins any possible pairings you had set up.

I'm 3 eps away from finishing it
>> ARTICLE
Totally this!  I wanted to drop it because I was just pissed at Hikari's character.  He irritated me to no end - but he grew and developed really well.  The show certainly had other issues but I liked it in the end :)
>> ARTICLE
Exact same thing happened to me. And man,[Spoiler](/s "that plot twist was awesome")

Hunter x hunter 2011

The first episode made me want to quit but the comments saved me so bad and I ended up watching a jewel.
>> ARTICLE
so good!
>> ARTICLE
My personal favorite of all time :D
>> ARTICLE
Shirobako, I just wasn't feeling it at the time I guess, so I stopped after a few episode while airing, picked it back up once it was all completed, and absolutely loved it.
>> ARTICLE
If there is one show I regret not watching while airing it would be Shirobako. Taking part in the discussion threads would have been so much fun. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, definitely regret that as well. Though, I loved marathoning it all at once, it just gave me a much bigger appreciation for the show and it's characters.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate. 

Initially watching it I was very confused. What the fuck is going on in this first episode? Why does this man act like a child? Why is this girl dressed like a maid in a cafe? What the fuck is Akihabara?

As you can tell by those gripes, I watched it very early on in my anime experience, and it really didn't click with me.

Going back later, and understanding all the small cultural things around S;G really helped me enjoy and appreciate it.
>> ARTICLE
I found it intriguing on my first watch, but now the first few episodes are soooooooo boring to me. I'm supposed to be rewatching it so I can connect it with the alternate episode 23 and be prepared for Zero, but instead I decided to pick up Overlord, Durarara and Gintama, rewatch the entirety of South Park (I'm up to season 10 now), start playing Pokemon again, and get back into seasonal anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate would be my answer as well. I was told prior to seeing the anime that the story takes some time to get going and they weren't lying. Good thing I knew that otherwise I may have dropped the anime. And how unfortunate would that have been for such an amazing anime.                                                     https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=22IWi21lwok

It would be Steins;Gate for me as well. Good thing I didn't drop it (like most people did)! After finishing, I kept recommending S;G to everyone I know =)

So good

Exact same story here, was recommended this show way too early but came to like it a lot when I gave it another try. I didn't stop watching the second time around and binged it to the end. I don't love it as much as some here do but I think it was an amazing show, easy 9/10 for me.
>> ARTICLE
It was that moment at the end of episode 3 that made me go "what the FUCK this is so good"
>> ARTICLE
Same for me except it wasn't my first anime. I started the first episode ~3 years ago and dropped it because I had no idea what the hell was going on. I recently watched all of it a month ago and now it's one of my all time favorites.
>> ARTICLE
To your first question: Chunnibyou is an established trope in anime Okabe embodies and is something a anime watcher should reasonably be expected to  know about since it's a case of truth in television (just more known in Japan since it has a name) even if people tend to grow out of what literally translates to 8th grade syndrome [S;G spoilers ](/s "The reason that he hasn't is an important part of his backstory."). Second any Japanese person, regardless of thier oppinion of them, would more than likely at least know what a maid cafe is. Third, Akihabara is a real district in Tokyo a Japanese person would have to be culturally ignorant not to know about. 

Point being, this being a Japanese show it is making Japanese assumptions about the viewer, and for that reason it sees no need to explain them.
>> ARTICLE
Uh, yeah I understood all of it pretty clearly the 2nd time around, as it had been about 3 or 4 years of watching anime in between. 

Good answers for anyone else wondering that though.
>> ARTICLE
It seems that everyone has dropped Steins;Gate in the first few episodes and then picked it back up months later! :)
>> ARTICLE
I binged Steins;Gate in less than a week, and I didn't really enjoy episode one. But anyone who has seen their fair share of anime, or even TV probably got the feeling that the events in Ep One would be critical later. Quite a few series have bizzare opening scenes or episodes which a seasoned viewer will recognize as something to file away for later.
>> ARTICLE
Very much so. You don't end a pilot episode like THAT and then just transition into goofing off. 
>> ARTICLE
Only the heathens. I was hooked from episode 1's ending 
>> ARTICLE
same, i love both C;H and S;G from the get go, soooo funny and interesting omg
>> ARTICLE
Goodness. I thought I was the only one. While the early episodes definitely paled in comparison, they were still pretty entertaining. 

Okabe turned out to be one funniest MC's in a non-comedy anime, which caught me off-guard. Just watching him and the rest of the lab screw around was actually a lot of fun, even before the main plot kicked in. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched it from beginning to end, although Okabe turned me off to begin with because I felt like he didn't fit in to begin with, then I warmed up to him.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I love the first half of Stein;Gate. It feels, mostly, like a scifi SOL done very right, I don't really like SOL. Then, of course, it hits you with a sack of concrete.
>> ARTICLE
I had a really hard time getting into [Monster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster?q=Monst) at the start and really found it excruciatingly slow right up until the Frankfurt arc.  I am so glad I stuck with it though because once it got going it was impossible to stop watching.
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently at the 10th episode of Monster, and it is pretty slow. Does the pacing get faster? 
>> ARTICLE
It maybe be kinda off-topic but...
There is a Frankfurt arc? This is actually amazing. I always wanted to watch Monster but now I'm even more curious how they portrayed my hometown. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah there's a few episodes early in the series  mainly centering on the Turkish part of Frankfurt.  It's where the series really starts to get going in my opinion so it's definitely worth checking out.
>> ARTICLE
I initially dropped Kill la Kill halfway into the first episode. Around the time that Ryuko meets Satsuki for the first time. 

Came back after 15 shows or so (it was gonna be my 6th anime or something), including Gurren Lagann, and then I was able to handle the craziness that initially turned me off.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped it after the 5th episode because I wasn't used to that much fanservice. But like crack,  it kept calling my name and I came back to it a few days later and loved it. Now I've seen it 5 times and it never gets old. 
>> ARTICLE
Ditto here.
>> ARTICLE
> (it was gonna be my 6th anime or something)

how many have you watched now?
>> ARTICLE
155. This would have been August 2014 or something.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, are we the same person?
I dropped it at the first episode too, and Gurren Lagann managed to convinced me to pick it back up. 

Not only it ended up being my favorite anime ever, it changes my whole view regarding fanservices heavy shows, and the whole 'won't judge till i give it a chance'. Now i'm able to enjoy a lot of anime i refused to watch before.

TLDR; KLK saved anime for me.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I was going to say Shokugeki too.

I watched the first episode and honestly I through it was going to be the typical fanservice anime with 0 plot that gets tiring fast, just to end up marathoning the anime and the manga, I'm so hyped for season 2
>> ARTICLE
I hated this show until the first Shokugeki. I hated everything about how the school worked, I hated that the tsundere was obviously going to win, and I hated pretty much every character introduced before Megumi except for Soma and his dad. The Shokugeki made me warm up to everything and accept that the really corrupt and hostile school environment was really just an excuse to do cool food showdowns, and I started liking it a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a season 2?
>> ARTICLE
Season 2 was confirmed to be coming this year :3
>> ARTICLE
Fate Zero.

The start can be hard to follow and the first half just felt like things were happening but nothing would change. The second half just picked up so well and made the show one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf, didn't care for the period setting or naked wolf girl.

I was soon proven wrong...
>> ARTICLE
Really? I was turned off by naked wolf girl and the whole stick of "IT'S ECONOMICS IN ANIME!!!" isn't really that appealing... what sold you on it? 
>> ARTICLE
The characters. The banter and chemistry is like no other. I also enjoy economics so that helped :p
>> ARTICLE
Economics was my least favorite subject in college, but the prospect of another two seasons with ~~Lelouch and Kallen~~ Fukuyama Jun and Koshimizu Ami *is* pretty tempting... 
>> ARTICLE
The economics wasn't even a lot for me, I just enjoyed the adventure, the flirting and Holo :)

> the flirting
  
Oh God, there's FLIRTING?? Sign me up!

Gintama;  tried to watch it twice before. First time I got through one episode, but it just seemed like a dumb shounen comedy with a lot of yelling. A few months later I tried again and got through about 5 episodes. It did get better, but I still was a little bored. Dropped it for two more years. Then I kept reading all this stuff about how amazing it was and I had just finished Uchuu Kyoudai and was looking for another long running action/comedy anime and so gave it another shot. I marathoned the first 10 or so just to give it a good try, and dang! by then I was in love and never looked back! Now it's even more amazing, and I'm getting a little sad as it looks like it will go back on hiatus after this season. But I can still get my fix with the manga, which is amazing also!
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Madoka Magica twice before giving it another chance starting at episode 3 one night. I finished episode 12 at 7 in the morning. Now I try to keep an open mind about every new show.
>> ARTICLE
I will eventually try a third time to watch Madoka Magica and probably end up the same way. 
>> ARTICLE
Lots of people probably have similar experiences with Madoka, especially since the entire genre is pretty niche in terms of interest/viewership. It was on my PTW for months, and I knew from reddit that it would rival anything else on my PTW as the most critically acclaimed or liked on this subreddit.

 I just couldn't get past the cover art and genre for the longest time. Then I binged it in one sitting and vowed to be more willing to blindly subject myself to other series I'm skeptical of.
>> ARTICLE
Durarara

First ~8 episodes are pure introduction of characters and setting.    
I had no idea who all these people were or what they are doing, so it took 12 episodes to _really_ like the show.  
But then it really took off because the following Slasher Arc is great.


>> ARTICLE
Ah. No wonder I dropped it after 6 eps. 
 
You have inspired me to pull through. Thanks! 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah same for me, I was like who are these people and why should I care?

Then I cared :p
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha two episodes in - the girls' daily lives were boring and I didn't find the show very compelling.

Later, I picked it up again and enjoyed the show a lot starting from episode 3, as Karin improves the group dynamic substantially. It's one of my favorite anime now.
>> ARTICLE
Heavy object, at first I thought the concept of these 100 ton giant balls of death was inconceivably stupid and it seemed as if all the characters lacked common sense, the show seemed to run on ass pulls and plot convinces.

The thing is though, I was right and it is totally  stupid! But and this is a big but, the banter between the characters, the comedy and the great bromance between the 2 MCs makes it rather enjoyable. Would recommend.     
>> ARTICLE
Glad I found Heavy object somewhere in this thread. I really don't know what I like about it, but I do.
>> ARTICLE
Sidonia no Kishi is hard to like in the beginning if you aren't used to full CGI shows. But it grows on you and some of the fight scenes are pretty tense and exciting towards the later half of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
It also shares a namesake with my favorite Muse song
>> ARTICLE
Yep. Kind of makes me want more mecha CGI shows. 
>> ARTICLE
For every Sidonia mechs we get a bunch more of Aldnoah or Cross Ange. I think i'd still rather have[ 2D drawn](http://gfycat.com/NauticalImpassionedBuzzard). But CGI work has been improving, especially with [Orange](https://a.pomf.cat/khumqf.webm) or Polygon doing the CGI work. And given a high enough budget the [CGI](https://my.mixtape.moe/nrooud.webm) can look fantastic. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey I tried looking up Fafner and I couldn't find a mention of Polygon or Orange anywhere. Would you mind linking something that ties them together?

Also just to make sure, that clip is from the 2004 show right?
>> ARTICLE
No the clip /u/wingsoflight linked is from Fafner Exodus, the 2015 sequel series. The original series only used CGI for the Festum and some enviromental things such as computer displays etc. The mecha were all 2D. 

Orange themselves only started working on Fafner as of the 2011 sequel movie [Heaven and Earth](https://d.maxfile.ro/rwrhrvknxa.webm), before that their most notable project in terms of impressive CGI would probably be Majestic Prince.

And just because I can't stop myself, [have](https://a.pomf.cat/gsbqjl.webm) [some](https://a.pomf.cat/dfhhan.webm) [more](https://a.pomf.cat/fkmbkr.webm) [clips](https://a.pomf.cat/dbffdf.webm) [from](https://a.pomf.cat/nupgdx.webm) [Exodus](https://a.pomf.cat/ilkyic.webm)
>> ARTICLE
Polygon are the ones who do Sidonia. 

As for Orange and Fafner, /u/thrasher439 can probably give you more info. 
>> ARTICLE
What show(s) are those clips from?
>> ARTICLE
In order of appearance:

1. Gundam Build Fighters

2. Soukyuu no Fafner

3. Gundam the Origin. 
>> ARTICLE
Gundam The Origin is my favourite example of CGI mechs. Its really captures the idea of mobile suits as hyper mobile as compared to the big cruisers that they are crushing in battles early. Apart from that, Unicorn is gorgeous, and 00 is still the best looking normal airing show I've seen. I guess what I'm saying is that Sunrise is damn good at animating mech.
>> ARTICLE
Shirobako. Not gonna lie I dropped it the first few seconds cuz that first scene made me think it was another typical SOL high school anime. Then picked it back up again for about 4 episodes then dropped it again cuz I couldn't stand that one annoying guy. Once again, gave it a try cuz internet was out and I had it downloaded on my computer........KICKED MYSELF IN THE ASS ONCE I FINISHED THE SHOW LIKE HOLY SHIT 
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B. I watched the first few episodes a few months ago and I couldn't really get into it for whatever reason. Started it back up and I'm loving it so far. 
>> ARTICLE
is it worth watching? I have seen FMA like 2-3 years ago but have been lazy to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
It's near top (or on top?) of MAL ratings
>> ARTICLE
number uno
>> ARTICLE
Yes. The first few episodes of FMA:B are compressed first-half-of-FMA, but after then it is a different and suspenseful show.
>> ARTICLE
I'm loving it at the moment. I'd say yes.
>> ARTICLE
FMAB is the most worth watching anime ever imo. finished it a couple of days ago after some binging, and holy shit. there's a reason the FMAB characters dominate the best character contests. 
>> ARTICLE
It's fantastic - It's long as fuck but trust me, you'll be glad you watched it when you get to the end
>> ARTICLE
It's already in my top 5 and I'm 1/3rd of the way through. 
>> ARTICLE
I was the same - after finishing it, it's in my top 2 tied with steins;gate
>> ARTICLE
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Looking back on Phantom Blood now I appreciate Jonathan Joestar and I think the series overall wouldn't be as good without that arc but it took me about three months watching very sporadically to get to a point where I was really enjoying it. I think it was around 8 episodes in when I finally got into it, and then I got to Battle Tendency and fell in love with this ridiculous show

Actually, this is almost exactly my experience with Gintama except change "three months" to "six months", "8 episodes" to "20 episodes", and "Battle Tendency" to "Benizakura"
>> ARTICLE
normally if i recommend a show, i leave the person to their own devices for continuing watching it. 

for jojo, i really stress that not only does it get "better", but it gets quite different. So, if you dont like it at first, it will more than likely turn into something you love. 

JoJo is a show that rewards sticking with it more than most shows i can think of
>> ARTICLE
Initial D
Wasn't used to dated art, so I didn't like the first few episodes where nothing really happens
Came back to it a few months later, saw Takumi's first (official) race against Keisuke, and then I binged all the way up to Fourth Stage
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori, the plot moved REALLY slow before the first time skip. It's like, "why should I care about these damn kids and their boring-ass field trip? I thought this was a dystopian thriller, not a pleasant SOL". 

Of course when all the pieces came together in the final arc, it was breathtaking. 
>> ARTICLE
First episodes were confusing af. Especially the trip part where they just dump a HUGE amount of information that you have no idea what it is about.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari. A friend made me watch it, I was bored for the first few episodes and didn't understand the appeal. But once I got past Senjougahara, I came to love it and it's now one of my favourites :)
>> ARTICLE
what does that mean tho? past senjoughara? is that a character? 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, the first arc (three episodes) is about her.
>> ARTICLE
wow i am salty as fuck. i want to tie you orange clockwork style now
>> ARTICLE
Go ahead (   )
>> ARTICLE
It sounds like you are making a clever joke, but just in case, he means once he got past the boring Senjougahara episodes, the series was a lot better for him.
>> ARTICLE
> boring Senjougahara episodes

fight me
>> ARTICLE
I gave up on four hehe
>> ARTICLE
Wanted to say this, except I didn't hold interest until after Suruga Monkey. The fight scenes and openings kept me going until I was hit the Starry Night scene. Man, that scene sold the series.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte fo' sho. At first, I was like "wdf is this shizzle." Then, I actually watched it and fell in love.
>> ARTICLE
Before I watched it, all I ever saw of it were the gifs of full-blown parasytes doing their head-mutilation thing. Then my anime club aired the first episode, and I saw that we actually had a relatable main character to root for, and it wasn't just *mindless* violence for violence's sake.
>> ARTICLE
Mawaru Penguindrum, I put it on hold for a few months three episodes in, and by the time I picked it up I had a hard time dealing with Ringo and her shenanigans.

Something clicked by the time the library archive episode rolled around and I fell in love, and that ending is just one of my favorites ever.
>> ARTICLE
-Nana

I didn't like the art style or the characters at first and had to drop it a few times. But once I actually got past the first few episodes I couldn't stop watching it.

-Another

The start was very confusing and stupid, but plot started to pick up in the end.
>> ARTICLE
You and I have the exact opposite opinions on Another.  I loved the atmosphere and mystery around the first half then it got weird.
>> ARTICLE
K-On!

lol jk how could anyone with a soul not like that 
>> ARTICLE
Familiar of Zero. Absolutely atrocious at first, I have no clue why I continued to watch all 4 seasons. Proceeded to binge watch every episode over the weekend. Kinda liked it. 

Decided to read the LN's. Thought they were superb. Proceeded to hate on JC Staff. 
>> ARTICLE
* Danmachi. There were a lot of aspects that I didn't like at first, but once more cast members (especially Lili and Welf) joined in and some cool action scenes started take place, I started appreciating the show much more.

* The iDOLM@STER. After episode 1 I was convinced that it was going to turn into some generic harem. Boy was I wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of the opposite about DanMachi. I initially really enjoyed and was hyping it up with all my friends but as time went on, I slowly started to care less and less for all the characters until I eventually just didn't give a shit anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Danmachi was great until episode 8, then it became so boring and cliched
>> ARTICLE
Probably Baccano,
the slow/hard to get start gave me a hard time following up
>> ARTICLE
It's the opposite for me. I loved the start since it gave a great sense of mystery and atmosphere. As the show goes on, you get more information and it's like you're putting together a puzzle, piece by piece. I do agree people might have a hard time following what's going on, but it's not that bad if you pay close attention.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely Hunter x Hunter, the 1999 version because my brother told me it was better than the 2011 version *sigh*.

Anyway, I started watching it but the slow pace and the story itself was really not that appealing to me, so I kept watching other stuff in between. That was until we had a blackout in my house for about a week. We regularly went to my grandparents' house to charge up our computers, etc, and spent a large amount of time there, but eventually we had to return to our house. During that whole week the only show I had with me was HxH, so I was forced to watch it because I had nothing else to do. Eventually I started enjoying it quite a lot, and I binge-watched the whole thing. I might pick up the 2011 version someday just to see how different it is.
>> ARTICLE
Do yourself a huge favor and just watch the whole 2011 version, it's worth it. The animation is very refreshing and the 2011 version is without fillers (not counting the 2 recap episodes). You'll get plenty of time to get used to the new voice actors and even if there's some things made differently in HxH that people consider better, overall the 2011 version is still better in many other ways.
>> ARTICLE
I'll eventually watch it... someday. The thing is that I'm not the biggest fan of shounens (HxH is a bit different from the norm but it's still a shounen). The 2011 version is also fairly long and now 3 years later I have much less time to binge-watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Just continue from where 1999 left off and then rewatch the earlier arcs with 2011 if you want. 2011 adapted the material through Greed Island well but 1999 did it better imo.
>> ARTICLE
Watch the 2011 version. Do it for the CA arc.
>> ARTICLE
The CA arc... you mean when the narrator got a fucking raise? :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the middle of the arc and thats so true!  But either way, I'm liking the arc so much I'm recommending it even tho I haven't even finished it! :)
>> ARTICLE
The World God Only Knows.

I almost dropped it after the first season, but the third season is now one of my favorites.  The character development in that season was incredible and the final scene in the last episode gets me emotional every time I watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero:
Watched a couple episodes (2-3 maybe?) and thought it would be stupid. The premise seems far fetched and I imagined it would just be a generic action anime. Ended up really enjoying the characters once I gave it another chance.

Clannad:
I did not like the design of the characters at all, and figured the show would probably be a throw away cutesy anime where the guy gets the girl and they live happily ever after. Although I guess that is what happened, the way it happened was amazing. Loved every bit of the story and the characters, especially the after story. Although I still don't like the art style :S
>> ARTICLE
Shokugeki no Soma - Same as OP

Lucky Star - At the time, I couldn't stand that they just talked random stuff without jokes at all

Steins Gate - First 5 episodes were so boring
>> ARTICLE
Highschool of the Dead for me, I came to love the absurd humor after the third episode.
>> ARTICLE
It's absurd, it's mindlessly violent, the tits are huge. It's everything I don't like about anime, but somehow I fucking loved it. 
>> ARTICLE
Not at the level of the other people commenting (if I drop something it's gone for good), but Classroom Crisis and Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu. Classroom Crisis was a borefest until I realised I was wrong at how to approach it by episode 4 and it passed the 4-ep rule safely. And Nagato... I picked it up because why the fuck not, it's not Haruhi. I was kinda bored but not enough to drop it at episode 4, and it gradually grew on me (and made me realise trying to rewatch Haruhi would be hell).
>> ARTICLE
Ew, I couldn't get past the art of Nagato. It was a different art style was it not?
>> ARTICLE
[Katekyo Hitman Reborn](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1604/Katekyo_Hitman_Reborn)
I needed 3 tries to get started the first couple episodes were just so bad in comparison to the rest of the series which I really enjoyed

Cowboy Bebop, had a really hard time with it early but I seem to like it more and more after each episode.

When I first started watching JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, I've watched the first episode and thought "meh" and just forgot about it. Then a couple of days ago, I've remembered it and after a bit of encouragement from this sub, I've decided to try it again.

The first part "Phantom Blood" didn't really have me hooked but it was still enjoyable. But when "Battle Tendency" started, I was hooked from start to finish and ended up loving it.

Bakemonogatari felt kinda slow for me until I got hooked into the characters and art style
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually currently watching Shiki and on episode 6, but so close to dropping, the animation of the characters and the characters themselves just aren't very enjoyable. Only 2 so far I have interest in. Buddy says it's his favourite anime so I'm gonna tough it out, but I hope it picks up, show has been incredibly slow so far.
>> ARTICLE
Shiki turned out to be a great anime. I won't say it's my favorite, but I was definitely surprised by how well it developed into a series whose characters I cared about.
>> ARTICLE
Saki is a very interesting anime. The show creates a lot of interesting characters with unique abilities that you can care about. The show gets a lot better once they get into tournament setting, where there are other characters with unique abilities
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter. The show was fine, but the lack of early world-building and the fairly straight-forward plot and characters kinda made me wonder why everyone was raving about an above average show. 

Then I finished the Hunter Exam Arc, got the first big twist, slogged through the Zoldyck Arc, and finally made it to the Heaven's Arena Arc. 

I was hooked from then on. 
>> ARTICLE
Shokugeki no Soma, the food reactions really put me off at first. "Oh, *this* kind of anime," kind of deal, but they put more emphasis on the comedy of the reactions rather than the fanservice as the episodes went along, and it really saved the show for me. One of my favorite shows of 2015. 
>> ARTICLE
Amagami SS / SS+ for me. I started watching the show with the rewatch thread last December and I was pretty disgusted by the end of Haruka's arc (I was like wtf when he kisses her knee). And the show is pretty heavy on the fanservice which I hate as well.

Shoutout to /u/AmethystItalian. She's* the only reason I stuck with it because I respect her ratings and agree with a lot of her stuff. Since then I've honestly rewatched both Ai's and Ayatsuji's ss/ss+ arcs 10+ times. I think they're perfect for when I have a little free time and just want to watch something quick.
>> ARTICLE
> Since then I've honestly rewatched both Ai's and Ayatsuji's ss/ss+ arcs 10+ times

Yeah those are the top 2 arcs ;) lol I use them a lot as recovery anime.

>  He's the only reason I stuck with it because I respect his ratings and agree with a lot of his stuff.

Awe thank you!! It's she btw but no worries :p
>> ARTICLE
>It's she

AH sorry! I just assume everyone is a man on reddit unless I see something otherwise. 

I don't think I've ever mentioned you before but thank you for your MAL setup! It's very neat and easy to read and was what got me to finally make one (although I gave up on trying to get things perfect and just settled for the way I have it now). 

I pretty much use your MAL as a reference to get a feel on what to watch next.
>> ARTICLE
That's a huge compliment so thank you!
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter. I heard so much good about it that I eventually overcame my aversion for the childish character design and promo material. The first few episodes felt like the worst shounen clichs one could ask for, but I still nonchalantly went from episode to episode as I had really nothing else to do. It eventually started clicking. I finished it 2 or 3 days later with minimal sleeping.
>> ARTICLE
Jojo. The first 4 episodes took me over a month to get through. I was in love by episode 6 and it made it into my top 10 by episode 11
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B after having just watched the original FMA. 

It was just a much inferior telling and it felt "off", the drama nor the comedy really hit. Once the characters from Xing were introduced it became great almost instantly.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that as well. I watched the 2003 version before brotherhood and it felt like brotherhood did the beginning  (before all the major changes to the plot) a lot worse.
>> ARTICLE
From my understanding, the reason FMA:B was so rushed at the beginning was because they were under the assumption that these people had seen the first series, hence why it was a bit more rushed. Brotherhood got insanely good once it started hitting the separation in the original series when the manga was outpaced by the original anime.
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense, it was good to get past all of the intro and into the good stuff really fast.
>> ARTICLE
one punch man. thought it was overrated before it came out looking at the description and where people were ranking it on mal. First 2-3 episodes i thought were alright but nothing amazing apart from the animation. Then mumen rider scene with the fish dude got me emotional. Next thing i knew i started getting excited about every episode and loved it
>> ARTICLE
That was episode 9 of 12, I'd say you were relatively invested already 
>> ARTICLE
Quite a few of my 9s and 10s on MAL were shows I had to revisit. This was mostly due to being new to the anime medium though.

The most notable, and this probably happened to a lot of people but it was One Piece. Now let me clarify, it was the 4Kids One Piece. My roommates in college tried to force me to watch it, I just couldn't do it. I revisited it a few times, but just couldn't do it. Finally after finishing another anime (I was still very new to anime) someone alluded to 4Kids ruining One Piece, and I went to a different OP streaming site, and it was like an entirely different show. I think I watched ~400 episodes in a month after that. I now consider OP a category of it's own in terms of greatness. Just impossible to compare a 26 episode series to something with 700 episodes that I've been watching for years.  
  
TTGL and Steins;Gate were the same in that I had a hard time watching multiple episodes without considering dropping them. I dropped TTGL probably 3 times. Both I got 2-3 episodes in before quitting each time. But one thing I've come to understand is that 99% of the time if you can't enter a "Best XYZ" thread on r/anime without seeing the mention of a certain anime chances are there's something that makes it so popular. So I powered through them, and there was always an episode where it all clicked and I went from an episode a week to finishing the entire series in a night.   

I've learned that most anime of the anime that is revered as amazing, is almost never actually bad, but more about mindset going into it. Too many people watch nothing but action, then are recommended a SOL and hate it, it's not the show that's bad it's the mindset.
>> ARTICLE
Without a doubt, Cross Ange.

At the start, the sheer unlikability of almost all the cast, combined with really, **really** uncomfortable titaliting presentation of things like Ange's "prison rape" scene really turned me off of the show, but it had just enough promise that I gave it a few more episodes. By the end of the series it was my favorite anime of the season, I'd downloaded the soundtracks, and overall loved the turns the show took.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone is supposed to start off unlikeable as fuck I think
>> ARTICLE
Same here, the first prison scene was something I really found disturbing. After dropping it for a while, I reluctantly came back to it and actually enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.

This doesn't happen to me much but I guess I'll say School Rumble.  When I watched it I was in the mood for a semi-serious romance ala Toradora, so I obviously wasn't incredibly fond of School Rumble.  I took a break before watching season 2 though until I was ready to watch it for what it was and it was amazing.

[Wanna Be the Strongest in the World!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11763/Sekai_de_Ichiban_Tsuyoku_Naritai!), the show kinda had a really had a really rough start for me with the first 3 episodes on my first watch of it, but I got past that & ended up enjoying it a lot (enough so that it is one of my favorites!).  But if I remember correctly the main reason why I didn't  initial like it was because it took a while for the better wrestling matches to kick in & the main characters screams of tortuous agony as she the stuffing beaten out of her was quite jarring. I have gotten use to it with the rewatches I have done with it but my initial viewing for the start of it was quite rough.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I've kind of put that on hold for the same reason. There is like 5 episodes of her getting beaten over and over and her just yelling and screaming in pain. I got bored pretty quickly.
>> ARTICLE
I probably should have mentioned that I did not put the show on hold,  basically at the time I was determined to finish the show since I was dropping too many shows after watching  [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica). 

Anyways are you 5 episodes into the show? Your MAL doesn't have it on it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm on episode 7

Hunter x Hunter (2011).

The Hunter Exams arc was somehow really boring at first and the rules were kinda stupid but after a while it took off and i really enjoyed and in the end binge watched it in a flash just because people were praising it like hell and i know for a fact that i like shounen so there would be no way that i couldnt like Hunter x Hunter. Thats why i knew it was only a matter of time until i liked Hunter x Hunter.
>> ARTICLE
I remember being unimpressed with Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) in it's first run on Toonami. I thought the first episode was alright, but I burned out pretty fast with the odd comedy turn, not even sticking around for the "daddy..." episode.

I was only way way later in the year when I stumbled upon the Homunculi episodes and actually dozed off and saw the last episode while half episode (nothing like mixing an anime with a dream to get you really fascinated in what is happening - [spoilers](/s "did that guy really turn into a dragon or did I dream that?") ) and had to finish the show.
>> ARTICLE
Punch Line for me.

Couldn't even get pass the first 5 min. 

Came back a few months later and finally understood why everyone said it got way better.
>> ARTICLE
I think most everyone who has watched Hanasaku Iroha can say that they didn't like the show at first (for those who haven't watched it, the characters are pretty unlikable at the beginning minus ohana)
>> ARTICLE
TTGL, S;G, and Baccano!

I had the exact same experience with each. I watced ep 1 of S;G and Baccano and ep 4 of TTGL, quit because lulz boring, came back to them once I was a more "experienced" anime watcher (and found out about the hype behind all 3 series) and ended up loving them all. Baccano is probably my favorite out of the three, even though I enjoyed its first episode the least the first time around.
>> ARTICLE
To Love Ru. Couldn't stand Rito Yuuki to begin with so I just dropped it. 
Just finished it last week and glad I did!


Lala best girl
>> ARTICLE
Mitsudomoe kinda weirded me out at first, but as I kept watching it, I loved it more and more.
>> ARTICLE
Punch Line
>> ARTICLE
I've had quite a few series where that happened. Here's just a small number of the ones that has happened with for me. 

Steins;Gate is one of them. Like some others have said, the first episode is very off putting, and having played the VN, I have to say that I think they did a really interesting job adapting the prologue. It's not the most sensible way, and it threw me the first time I watched it, but it's definitely interesting. I'm now currently working my way through the rest of the anime because it's doing such a good job at adapting the VN. 

Another one would have to be Durarara!. I love this series now, but when I started, back when it had initially finished airing, I had trouble getting past the long introductory section. Finally going back to it a couple years ago, I watched from the start, and with my new view on the world after growing up a bit, I was able to start connecting to characters earlier and getting into the feel for the series. Now it's one of my absolute favourites, as everything just clicks together so darn well. 

The last one I'll mention is Garo. While I had watched some of the live action series before the anime started, I was somewhat thrown by the European setting. After the first few episodes I just kind of drifted away from it, but after coming back to it recently I've found myself really getting into it. 
>> ARTICLE
bleach
>> ARTICLE
Yowamushi Pedal. I first started it when I was up all night due to being sick and the secondhand embarrassment from Onoda mixed with strong waves of nausea was unbearable. I barely got through 3 episodes and just ended up giving on up it. Tried it again a few weeks later though, had watched the whole thing in about a week, and even got excited for the, what was then, upcoming season two. 
>> ARTICLE
Baccano for sure. Tried it way back when, got bored/discovered Gungrave, later in life watched Durarara. Loved it,noticed the Baccano references, discussed it with a friend who loved Baccano. He pointed out that it's the same creators and I decided to give it another chance. Glad I did.
>> ARTICLE
Ajin, started with episode 1 didn't really like it, 2 weeks later someone recommended I give it another go, now I sit here waiting for the next section of it to air!
>> ARTICLE
Monster musume. Didnt think I would start liking monster girls so much.
>> ARTICLE
double zeta

cause the start is shit, and the end isnt
>> ARTICLE
Aria actually. 

I watched the first episode then dropped the show for 3-4 weeks cause the resolution available at the time was just so eugh. Not to mention the first episode just kind threw you into the thick of things, which is not a format I particularly like. 

Decided to pick it back up for shits after watching Gurren Lagann and now it's my favorite show lol. Go figure. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really like Katanagatari's art style, but after seeing everyone sing it's praises I finally gave it a shot. It actually grew on me, and I like the art quite a bit now. And the series is absolutely incredible.
>> ARTICLE
For me it would have to be Clannad.

I herd so much about the anime so I tried it out and my god I HATED the first like 8 episodes. The characters looked so odd, I felt nothing was happening, and I was told it was supposed to be this huge feels train but got random stories and weird character backgrounds. 

But, the second half of the first season is actually really damn good. It was also surprisingly funny too!...Which is why you don't expect the shit storm that is Clannad: After Story. You watch the first season and think "Oh man this anime is actually pretty funny and witty! It's so nice :D"

**NOPE!**

One you start Clannad: After Story, it's a whole different ball game. That anime has left a emotional scar that will never heal and quite honestly I love it. Never have I contemplated the meaning of life after watching an anime until Clannad came along. 

To anyone who hasn't seen it. Do it.
>> ARTICLE
Mine would have to be Puella Magi Madoka Magica. I tried watching it a long time ago, and I was weirded out and turned off by the weird world they go into when they fight the witches. For some reason, at the time that just didn't appeal to me visually. I couldn't get past the first episode. It just came across as too strange.

A while back a few months ago, I decided to give it a second chance, and loved it. Now I would say it was one of the best anime I have ever seen. The music, visuals, and story were all really well done. Just goes to show that if you don't like something at first, then it's fine to put it aside for a while and come back later with a fresh perspective. Maybe it will change how you think of whatever it was you gave up on.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano! My best friend recommended it and after the first episode, thought it was terrible. Little did I know it was amazing during my 2nd go! 

Btw, Jacuzzi Splot (sp?) was my least favorite character towards the beginning. However, by the end, he was my favorite of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy

First I thought: What kind is this? 

After watched: Why this anime doesn't has sequel!?
>> ARTICLE
This happened with my for all my favorite shows. Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Kekkai Sensen, and (will you crucify me for this?) Avatar: The Last Airbender. 

Watched the first episode or first few in all of these, dropped them for some reason or another, and then came back to them and watched them all to completion very quickly as well as them becoming my favorites. Cowboy Bebop I'm not fully done yet (2 episodes left) but I will be finishing it and it does rank up there with my favorites as it should.
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't much now animated, haha. Guess everybody is waiting for foodgasms, especially the voice acting part and the tsundere judges.
>> ARTICLE
Equal opportunity fanservice gooooo.
>> ARTICLE
>foodgasms, especially the voice acting part 

They need to get Kitamura Eri for this!
>> ARTICLE
i might be just stupid but what would make Eri Kitamura perfect for this show? (my guess would be because of the scene from Nisemonogatari)
>> ARTICLE
That and Suzutsuki Kanade from Mayo Chiki.

And another show I can't remember right now but involved her character being massaged.

She sounds like she's always having a blast voicing that type of scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
im going to have to watch Mayo Chiki now... for science^^jk^^eri^kitamura^voiceacting^^is^^orgasmic.
>> ARTICLE
Just be careful towards the end in the Inn scene, Sakama has a very active imagination.

Oh definitely go ahead. It's a fun show and Kanade is an awesome character.

The beach episode has the particular scene I'm talking about, btw.

Kitamura Eri as Erina would be awesome asf

It will be very interesting to see if this can live up to the manga. Yakitate Japan did work out after all. Over the top cooking and foodgasms really need to have thoughtful production not to fail, like the high quality art of the manga that just works.

Also I hope somebody fitting will voice [this badass cook](http://i.imgur.com/TBUn8Ul.jpg)

Haven't been this hyped for an anime adaption in years!

[according to this img](http://chomanga.com/archives/41602477.html) the three main casts are:

Souma: Furukawa Makoto

Erina: Amamiya Sora

Megumi: Hanazawa Kana

food plot hype!
>> ARTICLE
I don't see any images with the cast in your link
>> ARTICLE
Is this really confirmed ? D:
>> ARTICLE
> Megumi: Hanazawa Kana

YES! That's how I always imagined how Megumi would sound like. ALL ABOARD THE HANAKANA HYPE TRAIN
>> ARTICLE
This list is fake though the one who post this is already delete it.

from what I know they only announce Soma and Erina CV

Nakahara Mai as Erina

Yuuki Ono as Souma Yukihira
>> ARTICLE
That's only for the vomic, and they usually change when it gets animated, so they're probably different.
>> ARTICLE
But that list still fake though.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, that list was fake, but the two you listed were for the Vomic ones, which are *probably* going to change. The only series it didn't change was Sket Dance, but that was a rare case. You can expect it to change if they make an anime for this as well.
>> ARTICLE
I would like Nakahara Mai better for Megumi and would vote for Tanaka Rie as Erina.
>> ARTICLE
Tanaka Rie would be great but Nakahara Mai has also done a stellar job voicing tsunderes even though she usually voices more Megumi like roles.
>> ARTICLE
It has to be fake. The world isn't ready for HanaKana as Megumi.
>> ARTICLE
Kana Hanazawa is in everything! 
>> ARTICLE
Furukawa Makoto: Barni of Golden Time and Yuutarou of Haikyuu!!

Amamiya Sora: Akame of Akame ga Kill, Princess Asseylum of Aldnoah.Zero, and Touka of Tokyo Ghoul

Hanazawa Kana: Kanada of Angel Beats, Shiemi of Blue Exorcist, and Nadeko of Bakemonogatari (she does a lot of other voice acting)

Anyways! Pretty pumped up to see Sora voice act for Erina! :3
>> ARTICLE
Of all the parts you could of chosen for Hana Kana, you chose Shiemi? She has done much more amazing parts than that; Kobato from Haganai, Kawai Ritsu from Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou, Onodera from Nisekoi, Shiomiya Shiori (library girl) from The World Only God Knows, Mikan in To LOVE-Ru, Kuroneko in OreImo, Tsunemori Akane in Psycho-Pass and Shiina Mayuri in Steins;Gate. That is just from what I've watched, which isn't much compared to some people.

But yeah, she has done some incredible voice acting work and going *totally* against the hivemind she is one of my favourite VA's, she is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
If you haven't watched Tonari no Seki-kun, you need to. Short (like 13 minutes) episodes of nothing but funny antics and HanaKana reactions. I really enjoyed it.

I tried, it just wasn't my thing, it was enjoyable what I did watch though!

Wait, I'm a little confused. Both the OP's and your article are from today, does that mean this adaptation isn't happening? :(

I went and looked up the manga since I love this kinda stuff and it looks really interesting.

There was a tweet about an anime but it got deleted afterwards and TONKAM mentioned an anime too but later notified that nothing was actually planned. 

So there is a chance of it happening but it's not 100% yet.

I see, I see. Thanks for the clarification. I guess I'll start by reading the manga, I was just gonna check it out but I'm already on the third chapter..

Also: Alice best girl. Pls have Kanahana voice Tadokoro

Let's hope this is actually true, and not some fake news-grab.

I always read the manga with Souma's voice being Takuya Eguchi (Hachiman, Ryouma Ichijou, Kon, etc.), but we'll see what happens.

Have they said if this is a 1 or 2 cour series or is it going to be an ongoing series like many other shonen titles?

Fucking finally. I've been following this manga for the past few months and the entire time all I could think was "How has this not been animated yet?"

Although it makes sense, [Manga spoilers](/s "seeing as how they just got to the climax of the big tournament arc.")

I have been waiting for this forever! I won't even care if they tone down the foodgasms! I hope this will be actually confirmed, with trailer, soon

>> ARTICLE
I've been waiting for this. So excited! This is the only manga I've ever followed from the beginning and it is epic.

However, as a foodie, one of the things I really love about the manga is the actual food-related content. The foodgasms shouldn't be a problem, but I wonder how the detailed food explanations will go.

Obviously the best girl debates have already started (my vote is Alice), but I'm surprised there's no mention of Nikumi on this thread yet.

I cannot wait for this.

I'm not a big manga reader, and generally speaking when I read a manga it's usually after an anime is finished so it'll be really interesting to see one of my favourites animated first. Looking forward to Monster Musume getting an anime adaptation as well (from the look of things).

Yeah it's one of the first things I check the discussion threads for after watching. This weeks foodgasim was great.

Don't know who downvoted you a bit. It has definitely came up before. I think after the 2nd episode someone noticed. Doesn't mean it still isn't cool. I always look forward to the ED of this show.

I looked through the discussion threads from 1 to 3 and 10 to 12, didn't see any picture after hitting the "show all pictures" from the reddit enhancement suite to load everything in the page in one go. Maybe it was just mentioned through text.

Over in /r/anime there's someone who always posts the foodgasms from the ed and has all the other ones as well

Oh yes for sure it was mentioned in text. It's totally fine OP I'm sure a lot of people didn't notice. I still like seeing them again!

Thought this duet between Soma and Erina was hilarious... Soma has the most angelic humming voice here!

>> ARTICLE
We all know they are the Ship of the Future.... 
>> ARTICLE
First girl + tsundere (a good tsundere, at least imo) so she's pretty much a lock.

I like Megumi but I think her best ending is if she ends up being able to stand on her own and make it big in the culinery world without Souma or anybody else's help. I wouldn't even mind if she was the one that graduated with the 1st Seat.

Honestly, a lot of characters on this show don't deserve the hate they get. They're all a little flawed, but each has a charming quality or two. IMO I don't think there's a real villainous antagonist [unless](/s "you count the few unsavory members of the Elite 10... or Subaru, but I actually just found his character hilarious in the end")
>> ARTICLE
Erina best girl 
>> ARTICLE
Please, with Chapter 118 we all know the real ship is [this is a joke but I'll tag it anyways] (/s "SomaXHisako")
>> ARTICLE
She's cute tho. [](/s "But not as cute as Megumi")

Ehhhhh I ship megumi with isami's brother I think his name's takashi

But neither Erina or Megumi is as awesome as Alice. 
>> ARTICLE
I want this to happen.
>> ARTICLE
Loved Erina's reaction to that interaction haha.

Out of all the episodes thus far, I laughed the most at this. Not just  because it's funny, but because...I dunno, it's charming, it's cute, it's adorable.

Well i might not have been there as they were humming the ending.
>> ARTICLE
it was but only Erina was humming and who knows what song..
>> ARTICLE
Not only the best scene from this episode but also the show, and now I get it why people like Erina and am only talking about the duet humming the song... C'mon Erina is now the best girl... I hate her and now with one scene she is the best..

although Soma looking like a dense MC...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah man, that scene was just beautiful! 
>> ARTICLE
true da, brother. and now Erina is the best girl.
>> ARTICLE
She was always best girl for me :3 The Megumi crowd is just too overwhelming here.
>> ARTICLE
how was she the best girl before this, tho?? she really didn't do much.
>> ARTICLE
I just like her character traits and character design.
>> ARTICLE
C'mon there's has to be more than just that to truly become the best promise girl, but to each his own, I guess... wait you are talking about Erina yeah best girl so far in this show... 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah I was talking about Erina, the author ships her too, so we will be fine :3

Megumi is just boring and plain, even though I admit she has funny reactions.
>> ARTICLE
For what reason did you hate her?
>> ARTICLE
Because everything she did, failing Soma because he's not rich, acting like she's entitled to everything, and just being a bitch all the time... seriously she had no good qualities at all, well before this.
>> ARTICLE
>no good qualities

Wtf. She's a top chef who is highly talented and has accounted many expectations. Not only that but she's beautiful and hot as fuck. She's also polite. How aren't these good qualities? I honestly don't understand how you came to that conclusion. Yeah. She has a shit attitude but that's due to her fucking upbringing. She [](/s "doesn't know shit about society, friends, love and true happiness. She's more pure than you think she is").
>> ARTICLE
>she's also polite

When?? and Where??

>she has a shit attitude due to her fucking upbringing

yes she does and her upbringing is not an excuse to act like that..


am only talking about the anime, I haven't read the Manga so strictly going on the anime there was nothing (beside looks) good about her... fail Soma for no good reason even though he's a great cook, once big boobs lost to Soma she took away her kitchen and is no longer her friend even though big boobs was  loyal to her and was doing it for her, and she also apparently destroys other clubs like the sumo one because she needs space for something.. none of the girl has had a good amount of screen time so many later they will be able to develop more but right now not so much... 
>> ARTICLE
Yes it is an excuse. She views society differently than other people. People with higher status generally look down on other people. Her personality is mainly like that with Souma only. She was brought up to be the best; not to like second rate food like Souma makes. Also thanks for the down vote.
>> ARTICLE
>Yes it is an excuse....People with higher status generally look down on other people. 

What are you talking about, that's not true and a big generalization on your part.

>Her personality is mainly like that with Souma only. 

What about the Sumo guy, she destroy his clud. And what about big boobs (forgot her name) she loses once and gets kicked out and her kitchen taken away from her.... she's been acting like that with everyone. Again I'm only going by the anime not the Manga.

>Also thanks for the down vote.

I don't do down vote, it's the people not me... 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah yeah so far ahead a tsundere and a rich one she's obviously gonna be like this later on you'll see some stuff in fact at the end of this arc actually
>> ARTICLE
No idea what you are talking about..
>> ARTICLE
Talking about her in general this whole threads about how she's a bitch and stuff when the whole point of a tsundere us to be a bitch I'm just saying the dere side will comeout soon enough
>> ARTICLE
Yuuki is best girl, and I don't mind being alone on my ship.

The tsundere can go fuck herself. Megumi is a second place.

How in the H double hockey stick is she best girl, if you sum up her screen time or talking parts I'll be surprise if it's more than 5 minutes... am only going by the anime not the manga.... everyone keeps talking about how cute the best girl is but if she doesn't do anything then how are you upset when other people don't like her or don't even "notice me senpai" her.
>> ARTICLE
I was kidding, duh. As I said, I don't mind being alone on my ship.

Since when is screentime a deciding factor in adorableness ? No need to be a main character to be cute. And other people I don't give a fuck about, they have shit taste. Yuuki is love, t's all. You all faggots are blind.
>> ARTICLE
> Downvote

You don't understand sarcasm or jokes, don't you ? O.o
>> ARTICLE
yeah cause sarcasms and/or jokes are so easily convey thru text.. if you're joking write a "jk" or a ":p" or ";)" or something that's what they are for. and the down vote was only because of the word you used, I usually don't down vote anything but that was crossing the line, no need for hate crimes.. jk... :p.
>> ARTICLE
What's wrong with "faggot", "fucktard", "idiotic shit", "human trash", "bastard", "asshole", "bloody cunt", "fucking bitch" or even "retarded douchebag" ? Those are just words, my friend, just words. Being offended by something that tiny is just laughable.

oh I get it, sarcasm or is it a joke... well either way, good job..

If the purpose is to introduce new anime to new people instead of just doing 4 joke contests can you maybe introduce some contests like best art style, best character development, etc. The only problem that I can see with that is it might just end up as another popularity contest following the best anime contest. 
>> ARTICLE
Because they'll all turn into a "best anime" contest regardless of what  they are created for, because people will just vote for their favorite as opposed to the one they think looks the best or has the best character development & so on.

The extra contest involves anime that nobody knows.  I could Best Animation, but it will become a popularity contest once again.  Instead I will do most underrated anime contest which the users vote on the anime they don't know during the elimination round.  Also anime on the top 20 on MAL is not allowed.  Less complaining.

Best Sister! Winner : Komachi (Oregairu) 

Best Trap! Finals : Saika (oregairu) vs Ruka (Steins;Gate)

EDIT : I'll just add Best Chuunibyou! Yoshiteru (Oregairu) to rattle more cages.

More of that Oregairu salt to go around, yo!

Well in Komachi's case she really does deserve best Sister and it honestly wouldn't be hype/recency fueled.

Komachi is the best wingman of all time.

Best Mecha contest. This sub doesn't appreciate giant robots enough. 

TTGL would probably end up winning tho because that, Eva, and Geass are the only mecha series half this sub has seen
>> ARTICLE
False. Some of us know who Char Aznable is. And some others might remember the popularity of Gundam SEED.

On the other hand, there is a new Gundam series coming out this fall, so this could be a well-timed contest.

True

Part 3 Joseph Joestar would dominate this one.  And I'd be okay with that.

There may be many great bathrooms in anime, but none shall ever top the Araragi family porcelain fortress.

Best bathroom by far across any medium of fiction.

Also although I know this would mean a lot more work for you, consider creating a losers bracket to allow entries a chance at a comeback. It gives entries from obscure series a second wind if they get knocked out early by a rabidly popular series.

Posts should also encourage people to do something constructive like making recommendation comments instead of salt puns.

Alright.  Second Chance Contest

> While you guys are at it, check out the winners of the bonus matches here!

Chitoge, Yukino, and Rin are the winners.

Never seen it, but I'll argue this to the death. Don't make me release my inner fanboy.

PS. What show is it and is it good?
>> ARTICLE
Kaichou wa Maid sama. The anime was great and the manga was god putting on paper. The purest form of OTP and romance. I reread it 2 times a year and it still stays the same level of perfection each time.
>> ARTICLE
So, I don't really read manga, I'll check out the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Ok but the anime only covers the first 32 chapters of their relationship. the manga is around 100 chapters so I suggest you read it so you can get the full effect of the story. It was one of those manga that gave you feels even though it didn't intend to. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll consider it. The manga that might push me into manga, and that I'm considering because it looks funny af is One Punch Man.
>> ARTICLE
Well it has its comedic moments but overall you will find it to be far more serious a shoujo/romance story than your typical on this forum. It takes connections and such very deeply.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, might have to read it then
>> ARTICLE
You forgot the part where Usui is not from a heavily popular show...

He'd just straight up drown in Round3 against someone like Shirou or Sora. We know /r/anime by now.

I'd like to see most badass girl contest. I was disappointed to see badass characters like Motoko Kusinagi lose so early on in best girl. 
>> ARTICLE
I still stand by **Best Mount/Vehicle Contest**


Can be any specific vehicle that was shown in any anime (specific as in: it must serve some kind of purpose to a character in the show - so you can't nominate a random car, but you can nominate the firetruck from TWGOK because it serves as a recurring comedic element). It can be a Gundam, it can be Nozaki's bicycle, heck it can even be the fucking helicopter thighhighs from Strike Witches. As long as it serves the purpose of transporting someone or something from A to B it should be eligible. (Although things like the Phone Microwave (name subject to chance) could be debatable)


Restrictions should be obvious: The vehicle in question must not have a distinct character on its own. It's fine for a living mount to show a bit of personality (for example Yakul from Princess Mononoke), but it should not be on the level of someone like Bumblebee from Transformers or Imperialdramon from Digimon Adventures. Being a mount or vehicle must come first. I'm sorry KanColle fans.


Second restriction: A vehicle / mount can only be nominated once, regardless of its different forms. If a vehicle / mount with different forms is nominated, that entry will automatically include all of its forms. This is to prevent TTGL from getting all of the top spots (lol).

How about a best soundtrack contest (per show) or best ED?

Best sidekick

Best catchphrase 

Best death scene

Just some ideas...

Best MC who doesn't have time for your shit, aka the best MC who doesn't pussyfoot around romance/plot and take 24 episodes to kiss someone. 

Basically the most refreshing MC to cut through all the dumb-as-a-pile-of-bricks MCs there are out there. 

It would be an interesting competition to introduce some fresh or under-recognized (hello, Cross Ange) anime to a wider audience.

I would honestly like to see a *Most Overrated Anime* contest. Imagine the salt that would bring about. Although given how this  is a hotbed for anti-SAO opinions, I think I already know which one would win. It would however silence the myth that there is a huge anti-Fate circlejerk on this sub.

Most tepid love (maybe more excitingly phrased "least convincing love/lovers")

Best weapon contest. 

Best wingman contest. 

Best character killed off in the first episode.

I want to see a best of the baddies and freaks contest. 

So we have all the psychos the bad ladies the non generic anime girls. 

So like the muscle lady from dangenronpa the parasite lady from parasyte pricilla from claymore. There are probably way more examples that I can't think of. 

I think it would be fun to see people hyping up and defending these characters. 

I don't want to call it a worst girl competition because then it would just be taiga 20 times. I'll see myself out. 
>> ARTICLE
Best beard/hair contest.

Honestly I think these contests should be on contest mode.

Best Anime Title.

Note: You're only 'allowed' to vote for something if you haven't heard of it nor what it's matched against. (That way it's truly based off the titles)

No pictures of characters from the anime, no title art, nothing like that... just the titles themselves.

edit: More serious (or less serious? I mean it is for a joke contest...) idea: "Worst Bath Scene" contest.

I vote for Best Harem Contest.

Not best harem anime. Not best harem girl. Certainly not best Harem MC. But a contest based on which harem is the best.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of suggestions already, but I guess I'll suggest Best Imouto Contest too. It has a rather specific qualifier, and a very large pool of characters to choose from. Bring forth your Komachis, your Karens and your Ayumis. Might have a few doubles from the Best Girl Contest, but the criteria happens to be a bit different for this one.

If the numbers still aren't enough for that, though (don't see how they wouldn't be) we can add in a few Otoutos and just make it the best younger sibling contest.

You definitely should. It's a great anime that has some relation with economics, but not too much.

People that talk about economics in Spice and Wolf are exaggerating in my opinion. It's barely present in it at all.

Yeah, it's more like a backdrop. The real meat of the series is in the awesome character interactions.

Dunkin Donuts missed a big opportunity here to make a splash ala Code Geass Pizza Hut.

Maybe with your re-imagining they can right this wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, they got all their advertising through Monogatari. Mister Donut got bought out by Dunkin Donut's parent company Allied-Lyons back in the 90s, so up until 2014 - when Dunkin Donuts got sold to a bunch of different private equity firms - they were part of the same company.

I now have you tagged as Keeper of the Donut Lore

hahaha. God if Ufotable animates this route, I hope they change Shirou's character ever so slightly. Shirou's personality should be "protect the one you love because you love them and don't want to see them get hurt" not "protect woman cuz womans is weak"
>> ARTICLE
It's even stated in the game that he is only using the "you're a girl" card as an excuse to not potentially get killed in battle, all DEEN needed to do was to point that out D:
>> ARTICLE
I'd buy that. But this famous [quote](http://i.imgur.com/1Ev8xyT.png) makes it difficult.
>> ARTICLE
> Shirou's personality should be "protect the one you love because you love them and don't want to see them get hurt"

.....but.....that's exactly his reasoning in the Visual Novel. That plus he doesn't want to see anyone die for his sake. You have to keep in mind Shirou doesn't see her as a servant he sees her as a person first and foremost. Shirou has no self-preservation instinct. If anyone is about to die he'll go out of his way to help. He has a savior complex. His protecting Saber because "she's a girl" is just an excuse he gives. It's not his actual reason. He doesn't want to see her die.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but viewers are idiots so you need to explicitly state things for them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's true. They really should at least include some of Shirou's inner thoughts and monologues more. It would clear up problems like this in a heart beat.

I like to think that what makes that scene so special is how it happened. [One of the only spoilers for Nichijou ever](/s "Hakase, the spoiled, dependent, and childish creator, saw something that would make Nano happier than anything, but she was hesitant because Nano wouldn't be there as often. But one night, something occurred to her, and it was in that moment that she looked past herself for once, and realized that this would be the best thing to happen to Nano (and her because her plan was never entirely selfless), so she did what she needed to do.")

Shirobako is the only anime to make me cry.

That scene where [Shirobako spoilers](/s "Miyamori goes with the president back to his old studio, and revisits the moment when the legendary blizzard Andes Chucky episode was created."). That hit real hard. So much emotions, contained in one scene, conveyed masterfully to the viewers. [](/s "In what was simply a 5 minutes flashback, I had glimpsed into the core of anime creators, seeing all the passion for their work, pouring all their heart and soul into their creation, leaving behind a legacy for many generations to follow.")

I bawled like a kid after that scene. Pure, raw unadulterated emotions. I don't even bat an eye on death scenes so many cry to. And yet this scene made me tear up so hard.

The pool episode...

[spoilers](/s "I feel like that was a major overreaction, and sorta a dick move in that episode. If someone's passed out, not breathing, etc. then you should let/try to find people who actually know what they're doing to deal with the person. Not letting someone get medical attention because "he's mine!" is just endangering the person's life, and a terrible thing to do.")
>> ARTICLE
I mean, realistically you're right.

[Toradora! spoilers](/s "However you do have to keep in mind that she was the one who saved him while nobody gave a fuck. After she saves him and carries him out of the water, then everyone notices him and panics? I think a big theme of Toradora! is the gritty, not very nice side of real love- and that scene was one of them. It still really moved me.")

You mean after Santa left? :'(

Yea that one

For some reason, the signing scene affected me more than the ones coming after that.

That whole episode just kind of went Diver Down on my insides. It really fucked me up for a good bit. I got the same numb, dead inside feeling that I got from the ending of Cowboy Bebop.

Toradora is one of my favorites, watched it multiple times, but I can't, for the life of me, figure out what scene you're talking about here...

Yep, that's the one, I love that scene.

Holy hit this is amazing. You can almost pinpoint the exact frame to every line of text written.

More like when Yuuji yelled at his mom. That made me burst. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah...and Ryuuji's mom is one of the best moms ever in an anime. 
>> ARTICLE
seriously, i absolutely adored her at the end.  kind of shocking to me as how she was portrayed in the beginning.  the entire ryuujis grandparents episode was just awesome.
  i just love toradora in general so i may be biased
>> ARTICLE
Well, you were seeing everything through Ryuuji's eyes...and that's kind of the whole point of Toradora...that people can be really awesome and people can suck.

I still think that Ami x Ryuuji is best ship, but oh well lol 
>> ARTICLE
I never liked Ami
>> ARTICLE
Yeah dude, for some reason issues between parents and children get me the most in anime. Like if a bunch of characters die whatever, but if a mom sacrifices herself for her son or something it's just GG for me.

This is exactly it for me. Character deaths usually don't get me, but if you let me watch Usagi Drop/Wolf Children/etc. you can bet that the waterworks are going full power.

That scene when he started [talking to](/s "his grandma"), I lost it, really did not expect it to hit me that hard, even after everyone warned me

[The first scene we see](/s "Fuko is back") got to me too, even though it was pretty lighthearted

Then we hear Kurisu's monologue about hoping to be remembered and Okabe holds a speech for completing the mission. As the d-mail is being sent, Kurisu enters into the room, finally having the courage to voice her affection for Okabe and gets cut of mid sentence. I was destroyed. The entire build-up to that moment was very emotional and tears were already welling up and then that scene happens and it's ok, I didn't need those 5 liters of water anyways, b-baka!")

The tape gets me especially when [Cowboy Bebop](/s "Young Faye starts cheering for herself. For Faye, no one has been rooting for her the entire show, and yet it serves as a reminder (for something that is so easy to forget) that we should always be rooting for ourselves. No matter how much we change.")

God I love that Faye episode.

Does Ed's departure count? It's In a way a death because she's leaving, but that one gets to me.

Yea i agree with steins gate and oh god white album 2 _ fuckin awesome and it destroyed me.
>> ARTICLE
Jumping on your [Steins;Gate](/s "When Mayushii is by her grandmothers grave and you find out that she pretty much remembers and feels all of the times that she died, with Okabe right behind her listening just gets me and is one of the saddest scenes I think I've seen as someone who generally watches more comedy/action shows. I think it has something to do with Okabe being right there behind her and knowing that he must hear it and realize that while he is trying his best to fix it so that she doesn't die he's causing her pain")

Toradora "Again, again, again" scene
>> ARTICLE
After an entire show's worth of her being irascible and constantly attacking everything... When the series neared it's end & Tora just became super soft and sweet all the time, I got all warm and fuzzy. I'm pretty sure, I was just wandering around in my everyday life being extra nice to people.

Homeless dude's getting $5 notes. Doors being held open for the elderly, bus seats vacated for anyone who vaguely looked like they were a bit tired. I temporarily became Mr Softie.

Yes, I love how she became all soft and sweet in the end, and I feel as Toradora changed how I am as a person after watching it. It's truly an amazing anime.

This kids is what happens when a Tsundere that is basically a loner and detaches herself from others if possible.

Tougu's breakdown in [Yuuki Yuna is a hero, episode 9](/s "Maybe I'm weak, but when she flipped out and starts shooting the defensive wall, I couldn't help but cheer her on. It was a very human reaction when the realisation of what was going on hit home. It brought me to tears, not because it is sad but because it is so understandable. Her entire world has been betrayed and she lashes out in the only way she knows how to end this. If she can't kill herself with normal suicide, she'll take out the lie that is reality.")

It might have been episode 8. Those that saw it will know what I'm referring to.

They run around and have great fun, the friend got a camera and Renge loves it. Then Renge goes to the friends house one morning, but the grandma tells her the visitors had to go home due to work for the dad. Renge got really sad, as she really looked forward to play with the new friend again. She was really down for days actually")

*Edit: Fixed spoiler tag*

Thanks a lot. :)
>> ARTICLE
That show does such a fantastic job of turning seemingly small moments in a person's life and making it so full of emotions. For example when hotura was trying to conquer her fear of jumping offer the bridge and when she final did it was freaking amazing. Also when renge was learning to ride a bike. I never thought I would get emotional over scenes like this.

That one was really unexpected for me.  Up until then, I thought the drama in the show had been well done, but it was mostly just a fun SoL anime.  Then the graduation speech came and for some reason I just started crying, and I realized how much I cared about every character.

I was just a trainwreck at that scene. It was raining pretty hard that day.

The scene gets resolved literally second later but for some reason it has stayed with me in the years since I saw it. I never want to be the cause for such a reaction in a person. Maybe I'm just weird. (Also I can't for the life of me find this scene at the moment)

There was no mention of death or sadness, I was just hypnotized by the premise, the art and the music.

A particularly memorable moment for me is [Gatchaman Crowds](/s "when a disaffected Jou sees his friend helping an old lady and realises that despite how lame old-fashioned heroism may appear in the modern age, it's still far better than being a cool poser doing nothing. It was a beautiful sequence from there, to him lighting his cigarette and joining the fray to the group shot of all of the team together.")

Two scenes come to mind for this particular topic, though I'm not sure how well they'd count. I'll just roll with it, anyway.

Firstly, there's episode 10 of A Certain Scientific Railgun. More specifically, the phone call between Saten and Uiharu. I won't go into detail here, but it's one of the most emotionally driven scenes I've watched in anime, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't misty-eyed from the entire ordeal.

As for the second scene, it may not count depending on how you look at it, but I'm going to say most of episode 14 from [Railgun S.](/s "Touma confronting Misaka on the bridge was so intense from everything that had led both of them here, and seeing Touma take shock after shock without any sort of resistance was rather jarring, but I think that was the point. Like the previous scene, it was so emotionally charged, especially when you consider the several episodes prior that built upon it, that I got caught up in all of it.") I'm not afraid to say that I cried during this series. In a couple areas, I think it deserved it.

There was also Sore ga Seiyuu episode 6 I believe where [](/s "Futaba was telling Rin how she was jealous of her.") Also there was this one line at the end of episode 7 of Danmachi that got me too. It was like the most cliched line ever so I still don't really understand how it got that reaction out of me.

okay, I have to write this. so most of the episodes mentioned above - yes, I swam in my tears there too (Clannad and Toradora, you heartless bastards brought that up, I teared up just reading the word Christmas)


but I have to mention **Nana** - how in hell isn't it at the top? I cry *all* the time rewatching it what makes me truly feel like a M (though manga is even worse). can't even pinpoint the episodes, but the most of it, I guess at the "DON'T TELL NOBU" part. just every time I lose it completely


**Girl Who Leapt Through Time** - starting from their first ride on the bycicle together, when she starts leaping all the time, the railroad at the end, the disappearance, the last words ALL OF IT 


**Kimi ni todoke** - when they first sit with her, and she cries, and oh I cried

**Lovely complex** - just two words: Bear. Curry.

**Death Note** - the last episodes, when it's shown what happened to his family, and his mother sitting in the kitchen

**Playful Kiss** - the words she says near the end about love transforming sad days to brilliants *all the feels oh my god*

**Ouran** - episode about the twins' childhood and the last half of the final episode, though it's not even canon, but that was amazing

**Hanasakeru Seishounen** - when she finally tells him. you know what I'm talking about

**Special A** - all episodes featuring Yahiro (he's the best ok) and Tadashi finally saying "Don't go" to HER.


*k better stop or this will go on forever*


**P.S.** and the last episode of **Tatami Galaxy**, just all of it

>> ARTICLE
The new promotional video... also known as the last episode of the first season. Don't get me wrong, I like the show and all, but I really don't see the massive hype behind it. Not when [Hell's Kitchen](http://i4.mangareader.net/hells-kitchen/10/hells-kitchen-3554219.jpg) exists. Shokugeki is entertaining, but it's been pretty damn formulaic so far. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean it isn't *good*, but I wouldn't say it's great (like I've been seeing).
>> ARTICLE
I don't know dude, but the premise wherein once the MC ultimately achieve his goals of becoming the best chef, his soul will only be eaten by the demon who forced the MC to train as a chef and possess and teaches the MC (who doesn't even know a single thing about cooking) along the way, doesn't sit well on me. 

Being on top of the world literary mean Death for the MC. How ridiculous is that?

And the artwork does not compare with Tosh.

My two cents though.
>> ARTICLE
It's a different style, but it isn't particularly bad, I honestly really like the artstyle.

The premise is bizarre and the end goal isn't very clear, but what stands out about the series is the characters, the scenarios, and the humor. 

* With Shokugeki (what we've seen so far, because I only watch the anime) we get the same formula over and over again, don't get me wrong I'm not complaining, but there's definitely a pattern the show follows. New school activity > Cocky person in charge challenges Souma > Souma does something amazing > (Stupid and Stale [insert personal opinion]) Sexual reaction to cooking. The problem with this is that it gets far too predictable time and time again. Especially in the last arc of the anime, "There's this big bad lady that isn't letting anyone pass!" (Oh yeah, this is definitely gonna turn into some type of fetish appeal...) I believe the best deviation from this was the Shokugeki where Souma *wasn't* in charge. This was refreshing and kept you guessing as to how he could possibly turn the situation around and led to character development for all parties involved. It was truly well done. The humor was also different in this particular scenario and didn't lean on the "ecchi crutch" but held it's own which I really liked.
 
* Hell's Kitchen touches on every aspect of cooking in a very satisfying way that keeps the viewer involved throughout the whole process, because the character is learning. The school dynamic also broadens this experience by having students of every aspect of food and an internal struggle between each faction that feels very satisfying and informative and because of this, each arc is different and interesting in it's own special way. He might be skinning potatoes one day, but a week later he's out in the fields working hard to get on good terms with the farmers. In regards to the supernatural element, much like with Black Butler or AssClass, the dynamic isn't as cut and try as "I'm gonna kill you one day so we're enemies forever". There's the threat of a fallout but you can still tell that the characters care about each other and the situation they're on more than a basic level. In regards to the humor well, [it speaks for itself](http://i76.servimg.com/u/f76/18/35/57/42/hells-11.jpg). It touches on the zany side of things and adds an innocent heart on other subjects like romance. Does the show touch on the ridiculous side of things? Well it's a supernatural genre anime, there aren't many anime out there that couldn't be considered "ridiculous" however, the direction of the series carries itself well.
>> ARTICLE
Formulaic? I don't know. But I didn't felt like SnS was formulaic for me. Probably because I've read the manga since the author brought us in a roller coaster ride up to the latest arc.

For HK, I'm not behind an MC who is a butt monkey and who doesn't have a personal goal of his own. Dogma is simply forcing his will on the MC whom he will just eat at the end is just a stupid premise for me. That alone lost the appeal of the manga. But that's me.

In any case, come back to /r/anime when Hell Kitchen gets an anime adaptation. No use recommending something that does not have an anime adaptation here.
>> ARTICLE
> New school activity > Cocky person in charge challenges Souma > Souma does something amazing > (Stupid and Stale [insert personal opinion]) Sexual reaction to cooking.

It definitely follows this formula with every arc. The school introduction, the research clubs, the rookie training camp, all followed this formula.

> MC who is a butt monkey 

 Not really sure how that describes the character but um... okay? A character having a life/responsibility thrust upon them isn't exactly uncommon or unworthy, but it's fine if that's not your cup of tea. Also I wasn't recommending HK, I was just referencing it.
>> ARTICLE
> Cocky person in charge... 

I digress. After the supposedly challenge against the cocky Nikumi, next cook off were on the training arc then followed by the Preliminaries for the Autumn election arc where he did not challenge anyone except his own self. Unofficial cook-offs against someone were that against Shinomiya to save Megumi and where it was Megumi who took the helm, then against his father to gauge his progress in Tootsuki and the Karaage mini-arc to save his town's shopping district. The next serious battle of Souma will be in this upcoming Season 2 where he square off against the top 7 first years. And that cook off was not a result of Souma or anyone being cocky but it was a regular annual event in Tootsuki. So where's the formula there?

If anything, I think HK is the one that is formulaic. Dogma possesses MC and states something cocky to force a cook off > opponent of the week is riled up and accepts the challenge from some uneducated nobody just to show him who is the boss (which I found silly) > cook off shows MC being slaved to death by Dogma as he instructs him of what to do to win.

And since Dogma already ate the souls of tons of supposedly inferior chefs, he has this perfectly placed DEM of knowing ALL cooking techniques that will absolutely give the inexperienced MC the upperhand no matter how much odds are stacked against him. So yeah... that basically sums up HK though there will be some variations along the way but the fact that Dogma is the all knowing DEM kills it for me in contrast to how Souma and gang grows from all their failures and trial and error in SnS.

I find the way they cook rice weird. I couldn't help but keep thinking that despite the catchy-ness of the song
>> ARTICLE
How so? If you are wondering about the bit at the start, it's to wash off the starch/dust on the rice to prevent it from going horribly gooey in the rice cooker.
>> ARTICLE
This is how I cook rice.

Wash the rise twice to remove the starch and stuff (as you've said) then place into a cooker/pan/pot/whateveryouwanttocookitin. Then pour water in so that the water reaches the midpoint of the first two bands on your index finger when you touch the base of the cooker/pan/pot/etc.

What I found weird was that they mixed the water and the rice together then poured them both into another container.
>> ARTICLE
They washed the rice in another bowl and not directly in the kind of bowl for the rice-cooker so they had to put the rice/water mix in it afterwards.

I think it's only normal if you wash your rice in a different bowl than the one you use with the rice-cooker... Or maybe I'm misunderstanding you. I have to admit, my vocabulary in English when it comes to cooking kind of sucks. 
>> ARTICLE
Then why not just wash it in what you're cooking it with? It may have been because the cooking "instrument" is too small to do so but that raises the question "why use such an inconvenient item?"

It confuses me so much.
>> ARTICLE
 I dunno man! Ask them! Hahaha. 
>> ARTICLE
That's interesting. I found both the video's way and the way you do it "weird". I do it a completely different way:

1. Put a bit of olive oil (yes, I'm Portuguese, so I love olive oil. Other types of oil should work, but I can't guarantee the taste as I've never tried using them for rice) in a [pot](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/main/56265/274440/vollrath-77520-tribute-8-qt-sauce-stock-pot.jpg).

2. Turn on the heat.

2. Once the olive oil becomes hot enough, add some diced garlic and onion.

3. Wait until the garlic and onion starts to "become golden", slowly mix in the meantime so that it doesn't actually burn.

2. Optionally add some other stuff. If so, wait a bit longer before proceeding to the next step while mixing to avoid things burning.

4. Put in the rice. Mix strongly for a few seconds (be careful, if you don't mix, or wait for too long before doing the next step, the rice might begin to stick to the pot!)

5. Pour in water right up to the level of the rice (just enough so that the rice is underwater), so that the rice at the top of the pot is just slightly underwater. *Do not flood the rice!*.

5. Add some salt, depending on taste (some people don't add any salt, but I personally add a bit, like a teaspoon or two, depending on amount of rice)

6. Mix slowly. Whenever the water level drops noticeably below the level of the rice (i.e. the top of the rice in the pot seems to be outside of water), pour some more water in. *Do not flood the rice!* Repeat until rice has the desired consistency.

7. Drain the water by using some kind of a [drainer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/ONTWERPWERK_03_jo_drainer-022.jpg). The rice is ready to eat.

The idea here is that you're giving the water taste (and trying not to overdo on the water). Rice is relatively tasteless, most of it's taste comes from what it absorbs while cooking, so if the water tastes well (and you don't flood the rice), the rice will taste well as well. Not flooding the rice (using *just enough* water) allows you to control its consistency much better, as well as forcing the rice a less watery taste (and more like whatever you put *before* the water).

The slightly olive-oil-fried garlic and onion give the rice a great taste. Though, while just onion/garlic tastes great, if you add something after the onion/garlic (step 5) you will change the final taste of the rice - I've used many things, for example diced carrot and tomato pulp, or some (strong) mustard. It's a matter of preference and experimentation (and whatever you have lying around).

It takes more work than other ways, but the rice tastes much better, in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. I might try that.

Yeah. I was taught to "overflow" the rice and cook it at low heat for a long period of time so that it ends up fluffy while also being definitely cooked. The rice doesn't end up tasting watery because much of the water evaporates over time.
>> ARTICLE
>The rice doesn't end up tasting watery because much of the water evaporates over time.

Though it still tastes a bit "bland", right? At least when I do it "the lazy way" (just overflow the rice and let it cook at low heat for a long time, much less work, so that's what I do when I'm tired and want to get something ready quickly) it always tastes like... rice... Basically, tasteless.

As a side dish for something with a strong taste, it's not bad, don't get me wrong. But the way I do it, the rice doesn't become "tasteless" though, especially if you don't add just oil+garlic+onion. Personally, I prefer the rice with taste. I have done some combinations (for example, diced carrot and some tomato pulp is good, IMO) where the rice *almost* works as a second main dish.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I'm used to the taste of rice (it's not tasteless. We're just so used to the taste of it kinda like the taste of the water in your area.) and I like it. I do always have a side dish with a strong taste. I don't like my food to stroke my tongue with flavour. I want it to punch me in the face with it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I understand. I also love strong tastes. I always put a ton of spices onto everything. I'm not the biggest fan of "bland" side dishes. I know rice isn't tasteless, but I think you understood what I mean - it's tasteless relative to a main dish.

For example, I do spaghetti and pasta a similar way to this, too (and usually add some strong mustard in step 5, or nothing at all). Pasta works similarly to rice - it absorbs the water's taste.

Though don't get me wrong, the rice/pasta cooked that way doesn't get a very strong taste. It's still rice (and tastes like rice), so it has a rather "weak" taste (especially if you add nothing in step 5), just stronger than "normal".
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, you misread my comment. I love strong tastes too. 

I rarely eat pasta as I don't know how to make the pasta itself flavourful.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, right. I completely forgot - you **should** add salt to both the rice and pasta (after pouring the water into the pot). It's just something I do that's relatively obvious that I do it subconsciously, so I forgot to mention it.

I personally don't add much myself, but if I add none I later feel like something is missing in terms of taste (though it's *passable*, so to be honest you do not *need* to add salt, if that's what you prefer). With pasta even more so.
>> ARTICLE
Ah. Oops. I kind of noticed right before you replied but I guess I was too late.

My point still stands. I'm not the biggest cook when it comes to pasta, but as a simple side dish (like rice) I do it very similarly to rice (except I don't worry as much about not overflowing it). Pasta works very similarly to rice, being relatively "tasteless" by itself, much of the taste coming from the water it absorbs while cooking.

Basically, I fry some diced onion and garlic with olive oil, then maybe add something else (I especially like strong mustard with pasta) exactly the same way as with rice. Then pour some water, add some salt, and then the pasta itself (I usually "overflow" it, unlike rice, with pasta the water level is harder to control IMO, and I rarely have the patience). Mix slowly until the pasta has the right consistency, then drain the water and eat.

As with the rice, it's not exactly a main dish, but the pasta gets relatively tasty for a side dish. I especially like to eat it with some sort of meat with sauce, like [bolognese](http://www.bestfreejpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/best-spaghetti-taste-17.jpg), where the pasta becomes "part of the main dish".

It's just a fun show.  It's not "deep" and there aren't any huge themes, but it's bloody entertaining.  It does what it sets out to do very well.

My only criticism is that the narrating of the food and all the things that went into it got a bit repetitive.  Also, the fanservice at first was a bit of a turn off.  I felt like the show was using fanservice as a crutch with which to stand, but it didn't actually need the crutch and could walk on its own(unlike other shows)

No there are not and yes it is! :3

> My only criticism is that the narrating of the food and all the things that went into it got a bit repetitive.

Interesting!

They actually did a nice job of varying the dishes and subsequently the ingredients used, making each description differ from the one before and after. Of course, the actual process of investigating the dishes is indeed repetitive, but SnS quells that through the crazy reactions, the different characters being assessed, and the overall presentation (art, music, and so on).

> Also, the fanservice at first was a bit of a turn off.

I find that this one would have benefited from *more* fan-service, considering what it is and what it set out to do!

>lack of a purposeful theme

This is probably why, while I really enjoy Shokugeki, I don't think I can ever really consider it a masterpiece (even in it's future seasons). I actually really enjoy Shounen Jump series and long-running battle shounens which influence Shokugeki's style greatly, and the ones I consider "masterpieces" would be Gintama (well, this one is quite different), Hunter x Hunter and One Piece. I feel like these shows, while being extremely well-crafted and entertaining, also offer valuable messages to their audience and maintain well-defined themes. It lets you take away something valuable from the show and, to a certain extent, influences your outlook on certain things in life, and influence the way you think. Anime that can do this are the ones that truly standout from the rest. Shokugeki, though, really just focuses on the entertainment (which is fine), but I've always been wondering "this show is **so** fun, but something is missing. what is it?". I think you writing that let me hit the nail on the head.
>> ARTICLE
Hi, Sougo.

> ...also offer valuable messages to their audience and maintain well-defined themes.

Yep. Some anime are not really designed with these heavier messages in mind, but in SnS's case, it *wanted* to have these kinds of themes. Unfortunately, it was too preoccupied with being crazy over-the-top and ridiculous to make anything that it was saying underneath these layers worthwhile. :(

> Anime that can do this are the ones that truly standout from the rest.

Especially the ones that do this *and* connect with you on a deeply personal level make for some truly special experiences!

Not this time around, though. :3

That Banjo origin story, 10/10.

Shokugeki no Soma was a one fun ride, but it was also painful when it was showing off its food, while I didn't have anything on my side and if I had, it was nowhere near as appetising, I blame my almost nonexistent cooking skills.

Many people disliked Soma, but he's the kind of character that I love, cocky, but has a reason to act like this and the skill to back it up.

I also liked his relationship with his father and their hobby of cooking disgusting food.

In a way, this anime is really similar to Prison School, both have tons of fun characters, great soundtrack and animation, fanservice that's both hilarious and not the main appeal of these shows and both are hype as fuck.

I hope that Boku no Hero Academia and Enen no Shouboutai (both are new battle shounen manga with the second one being made by Soul Eater's mangaka) will both become as good and hopefully receive good anime adaptations.
>> ARTICLE

> That Banjo origin story, 10/10.

And it is all true!

I hate *nothing* growing up. My parents were always concerned for my health, my weight always below the "correct" BMI for my age, my muscles lame and weak. I was a scrawny kid, my diet mostly the cause for it (that, and I would prefer playing Super Mario than run outside :3).

But I am all good now! Still do not exercise as much as I should. I really need to change that.

> ...I blame my almost nonexistent cooking skills.

Same!

I need to learn how to cook. However, I can make a real mean grilled cheese. :3

> Many people disliked Soma, but he's the kind of character that I love, cocky, but has a reason to act like this and the skill to back it up.

True.

And he is not *too* cocky. At least, he is not when away from the kitchen. When he is in the kitchen, though, good luck turning down the fire in his eyes!

> I also liked his relationship with his father and their hobby of cooking disgusting food.

It is probably going to happen (the setup is already there), but I cannot wait to see what happens when he finally beats his dad! Theme of growing up and what-not.

Not gonna lie, I was not the biggest fan of the show during its early run. I really disliked Souma and a lot of early episodes felt too formulaic and predictable to me. However, as show went on and we were given more insight into other characters, I started liking it more. Megumi is undeniably my favorite and the best character in the show. She's actually different from everyone else in the school, she's incredibly likable, and she exhibits some insane character growth. During the election arc I was legit cheering for her and I shed couple tears when she actually made it. 

Speaking of election arc, it was fucking awesome! They managed to give an insane amount of characterization to a lot of different characters in a very entertaining and fitting for the show manner.

All in all, I liked Shokugeki no Souma, but not as much as many other people around here. While it might be off-topic, but I kinda prefer Kouffuku Graffiti to it, simply because it had a stronger theme of love bringing flavor to the food. 
>> ARTICLE
> I really disliked Souma and a lot of early episodes felt too formulaic and predictable to me

Hrmmm!

It is formulaic and it is predictable. There is always going to be overreactions and it is always going to have Souma dominating or barely squeaking by.

Still, it is a huge amount of fun, so much so that it essentially masks these potential problems. Masking is not fixing, meaning it stays throughout the entire experience, but it is at least better than feeling bored throughout!

> ...and she exhibits some insane character growth.

She is a vegetable: she starts off in the dirt, afraid and alone. But after some sun, water, and affection, she sprouts into the country *pumpkin* that she had always been. :3

> During the election arc I was legit cheering for her and I shed couple tears when she actually made it.

She totally deserved it, too, after everything she went through and everything she learned!

> They managed to give an insane amount of characterization to a lot of different characters in a very entertaining and fitting for the show manner.

That is one reason why SnS bumped up a bit in my eyes. That late into the anime, they were still giving new characters while also reusing old ones, all the while expounding on a ton of them at once, both individually and together. It was quite the spectacle to witness.

> While it might be off-topic, but I kinda prefer Kouffuku Graffiti to it, simply because it had a stronger theme of love bringing flavor to the food.

KG definitely has the feel-good-food-game over SnS.

That is actually an interesting comparison, since they essentially take the same topic but go in wildly opposite directions. KG goes super mellow, using food as this thing that connects us whereas SnS goes super ridiculous, using food as this thing that separates.

Just *food* for thought.

(I made *so* many food-related puns/metaphors in my actual review that I cannot stop. :3)

Thanks for the comment, ill!

Pretty much a very solid 9/10 show from me. It just needed more convincing arcs to hit that perfection levels for me.

Do note how there are no off frames in this show. It is basically one of the most perfect and we'll crafted manga to anime adaptations in recent years. Just solid music, great OP/ED and pitch perfect voice acting.

If there is one nitpick I  have with the story, the author clearly took a lot of inspiration and even actual food knowledge and plot twists from Iron Wok Jan manga of the 90s. I guess it is an obscure enough manga and it gets under the radar of even fanatical manga/anime fans, but as an Iron Wok Jan fan, I  knew Shokugeki took direct notes. Fans of this show should definitely check Iron Wok Jan as well. In some ways, that old manga series is more sexual and it also is definitely way more violent  (a LOT of blood, involving both human and animal). I think people who never followed a food manga will get a ton out of Shokugeki , though it disappointed me a little bit that some recipes came straight out of some older series, including Yakitate Japan. But the story did those elements justice, so I  can't  get too peeved about it.

That being said, both the manga and anime are escalating things very nicely and it looks to remain strong in the coming anime arcs. 


>> ARTICLE
> It just needed more convincing arcs to hit that perfection levels for me.

True, the arcs are not too meaty beyond its same recipe of challenge, food, and overreact. Thinking on it more, I wonder if it could even do anything more than this, since otherwise it would simply hurt itself trying to be something it is not.

> It is basically one of the most perfect and we'll crafted manga to anime adaptations in recent years.

That is good to know!

I do not read source material, but I am glad to hear that people found the transition from manga to anime was a highly successful one.

That first ED is to die for! :3

> I guess it is an obscure enough manga and it gets under the radar of even fanatical manga/anime fans...

I certainly have never heard of it, so I am going to have to take your word on it!

> ...and it looks to remain strong in the coming anime arcs.

Hopefully the source ends soon so that me and other anime-only watchers can have a satisfying conclusion!

Hey Banjo.

Was looking forward to see what you thought about Shokugeki. Personally I gave the show a 10/10 (which makes it my 4th 10/10 show) and believe that for a first season, Shokugeki exceeded all of my possible expectations. As with many shows of the genre, the first arcs seem to be slightly weaker and I felt like Shokugeki was still pretty good during it's first cour which I rated as an 8/10. The second cour improved quite a bit and the biggest improvement was the ample character development given to Megumi and the minor characters.

I loved Shokugeki immensely and actually read the manga after the first cour ended. All I can say is that many characters receive more screen-time and development and that a purposeful theme does arrise. If Shokugeki does end up getting additional seasons, I can't really knock them for not really having a defined theme introduced during the first 24 episodes.

I  haven't enjoyed a show as much as Shokugeki in a really long time and that is ultimately the most important factor for me when rating a show.

> Hey Banjo.

Hello! :)

> Was looking forward to see what you thought about Shokugeki.

I hope that I did not disappoint!

> ...the first arcs seem to be slightly weaker and I felt like Shokugeki was still pretty good during it's first cour which I rated as an 8/10.

The first arc (compared to the second) is definitely weaker, mostly because it is still trying to set everything up -- the characters, the bigger "fish to fry," the direction it wanted to go, and so on. Lots of setup is not bad so long as something is done with it...

> The second cour improved quite a bit and the biggest improvement was the ample character development given to Megumi and the minor characters.

...Which more or less happens! Especially with Megumi as you mention; her character and development is awesome to watch because it so visible to watch from week-to-week. Starting so low and ending so high, it was endearing to see her finally find happiness at the top rather than sadness at the bottom.

> ...I can't really knock them for not really having a defined theme introduced during the first 24 episodes.

Hrmmm!

That is always the difficulty with anime like this or those that split their cours. Determining the "right" amount of leniency is always tricky. In this case, I think SnS would have served to have something a bit more concrete throughout the season rather than *always* going back to its hype, comedy, and sex. Mostly because it does try to get soft and sentimental at times, but those moments are not as powerful (emotional) as they could have been since more grounded themes do not exist in the first place.

> I haven't enjoyed a show as much as Shokugeki in a really long time...

That is awesome to hear!

Shoku-fuckin-geki.

I remember picking this up on the same day as Danmachi because I was really eager for the season to start and wanted to watch something new. I entirely ruled out both of them before they even started but I'm super glad that I gave them a chance. 

Episode 1 was really iffy for me because it was *too* ecchi for me but I quickly warmed up to it. Saturdays quickly became Shokugeki day and I always knew that 24 glorious minutes were waiting for me. It's been a bit sad with that not being the case anymore.

I feel that Shokugeki is something that I could watch hundreds of episodes of and still not get tired of it as long as the author could keep coming up with so many unique recipes. It's just so incredibly fun to watch - all of the characters are loveable, the reactions are goddamn hilarious, and the atmosphere is always spot on. For something I thought I was destined to hate, it really gave me a good reason to not judge things by their cover.

All anime, from the only-fan-service to the deeply thematic, want to be loved, andehh.

And DanMachi and SnS are no different!!!

> Episode 1 was really iffy for me because it was too ecchi for me but I quickly warmed up to it.

I have a diverse anime palate, meaning I like pretty much everything that anime has to offer. This includes overly "ecchi" material. :3

> It's just so incredibly fun to watch - all of the characters are loveable, the reactions are goddamn hilarious...

Especially when the characters and the reactions are used in combination, like with Erina eating Souma's dishes (that ending Indian chant/mini-Souma attack to mirror the first angelic one was so gosh darn funny). It really was just a super-fun time all-around.

> ...it really gave me a good reason to not judge things by their cover.

 Doesn't really matter if it sold well, since  they don't want to take the risk of making a season two and it dropping. And even if you say,"Oh, but it sold really well!" they don't see it that way.

Deadman Wonderland just kinda left off with everyone still stuck in the prison. Also 07 Ghost. Great series, and the manga goes to some cool places, but it just kinda trails off at the end. And maybe Trinity Blood? I don't know if the material continued, I think the writer passed away, but I heard someone else picked up where he left off.
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't popular enough in Japan, so the anime wasn't continued.  Not only that, but from what I understand, there were two characters left out of the first season that play big roles in the second, so it'd be impossible to just throw them in there.  If they made another one, they'd have to start all over.

Honestly, I want Monster Musume S2.

Nah, it just changes in that another major character is introduced in the next volume and they stick around for half the series after that.

Why are you making me remember this awesome anime. BibleThump

Zombies, comedy, and Tomonori. What more could I ask for?

I should rewatch both seasons... I will probably have a blast watching it again!
>> ARTICLE
Is Btooom (manga) worth picking up? I finished the anime and loved it, but I don't feel like I need to read the manga. Like, I felt satisfied with the anime ending. Without spoiling, am I missing anything if I decide to just forget about Btooom and move on? 
>> ARTICLE
I  read manga to at least finish the initial island part.. well it doesn't finish since the manga is rarely released. 

There is a lot more action with his friend(sunglasses guy) that was never in the anime though and the island part is coming to a close. 
>> ARTICLE
I would read it to see how it ends honestly. Do Ryouta and Himiko manage to escape the island together and live happily ever after? Read the manga to find out. Chapter releases are slow since they are released monthly.

You're not missing a whole lot. If you were satisfied with the anime ending then the manga isn't really worth it at this point in the story.

Log Horizon. Second season was mostly dissapointing, but still hoping for third one.
>> ARTICLE
When did it start getting dissapointing? I am like halfway through second season and I havent seen any problems except some animation issues
>> ARTICLE
Most people find the plot arc immediately following the raid to be the low point. It focuses on Minori & her gang, who a lot of people dislike in the first place, and very little of interest happens for most of it unless you really love learning trivia about the world.
>> ARTICLE
Really, it was just really improperly paced. Like, S2 actually has some of the most god-awful pacing in a show I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
That's my opinion as well but I've seen others complain that the kids add nothing to the story and shouldn't even exist. I wouldn't go that far but I have to admit they are rarely involved in anything exciting.
>> ARTICLE
It was fine in the first season because they tied the kids arc into the overarching plot with the goblin army/politics with landers. It sucked in the second season because they dragged it out by two episodes too long and we didn't get to see anything but the scrubs for six episodes, despite leaving us with huge cliffhangers just before.

Did the novels themselves even get a satisfactory conclusion?

Not yet. The last novel was in 2011, though. 
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru!

No way it should end with so much more karuta to play, and the romances unresolved.
>> ARTICLE
Rokka no Yuusha. They cancelled the BluRay DVD release so I guess it wasn't received well...
>> ARTICLE
They didn't cancel the BD/DVD Release - Pony Canyon USA pulled their offer for their standard release, opting to only have a Collector's Edition. The title was received incredibly well, and was one of the most-watched titles on Crunchyroll this summer.

The BD didn't sell well in Japan, but that's an entirely different market with an entirely different base. It's also CRITICALLY important to understand that not every anime makes its money the same way - for example, since Rokka did so well overseas, or if it did well with merchandizing, it may be considered very successful regardless of disc sales.
>> ARTICLE
Damn I liked the mystery aspect and the new Aztec setting. I wanted to see where it would go :/
>> ARTICLE
The next volume (volume 2) is really good. They could probably make another season out of the next two novels if they were to do so. The problem is that it would leave you with another inconclusive ending, and on top of that the first wasn't received well so I doubt it will happen.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, all of the light novels end on cliffhangers. Some are just worst than others

TWGOK. Still has one more mega-arc to be animated, and that is not counting the other conquest arcs between *Tenri-hen* and *Megami-hen*...

I was pretty sure I read there was. I haven't read the novels personally though. Season 1 adapted like 3 volumes and theres a total of 7.

The ending of the first season skipped a few to the end/start of volume 7 iirc.
>> ARTICLE
.. why the fuck would they skip several volumes?

I can pretty much guarantee the ending of s1 was just to summon god and leave a cliffhanger. If there's an s2 it'll begin with a lame joke and go about the show normally

>> ARTICLE
He was being sarcastic
>> ARTICLE
Yea, but that's because the next arc will be better than both the previous seasons. From what I see in this sub, there are more Railgun fans than there are Index fans. 
>> ARTICLE
We (Index fans) are there, but we like Railgun just as much (the manga, not the anime).

Most Index fans are those who read the source material, the Railgun fans are mostly anime-only who have a shallower view of the Indexverse because the adaptations leave out so much. Because Railgun is animated better, I can see why many anime-only viewers would prefer it over Index.

Also, that butchered as hell Railgun adaptation didn't make things better.

Agreed. Index anime left much to be desired compared to the source material.

What was unfinished about that? I remember it having a fine ending... is this referring to [](/s "the black kirin")?

The anime was axed, it's the definition of unfinished. [12 Kingdoms](/s "Biggest thing from the anime was that the Taiki arc wasn't resolved. It was still ongoing in the novels at the time, not sure about now. Youko's story goes on as well. There's also a lot more material from the novels involving the other kingdom and Kirins. I think even the novels are ongoing, but I haven't followed it for a few years.")
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. Just to be clear, I didn't mean to sound like I thought it was finished, I was just wondering what wasn't resolved that the novels had.

So, most of the obvious choices are taken, so I go with Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance. Good adaptation/pacing for the first season, so much entertaining stuff happening later and enough best girls to make it good :D

Nothing that would be really awesome, but I would love just more constantly good entertainment =)
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed Sekirei. Would have loved another season or two of that.
>> ARTICLE
that show was amazing. great fight scenes and cool characters. was still much more to cover with the "tournament"
>> ARTICLE
NANA needs a season 2 and an ending, even if its just a Madhouse-original ending.


For something more recent, I hope Akatsuki no Yona gets a second season, not right now, but at some point in the future (although I know that's wishful thinking). The series basically ended [Akatsuki no Yona Ep. 24 spoiler](/s "right when they added the last dragon to their team.")


The arcs covered in the manga from where they left off is pretty strong material for another season, but unfortunately still leaves enough unanswered questions that I would probably only want another season when there is an ending in sight.

Yozakura Quartet for sure. I'd love to have more of that.

Rokka no Yuusha...I loved the anime and the LN...but it will never get a sequel anime.

Let's name the ones I can think of:

* **High School of the Dead**-There is enough Manga to get one more season, but it would still be left with a cliff hanger, unless of course the animation studio made a clear ending. 

* **Berskerk**-Again can we get anything more than the golden age Arc, this is actually really frustrating considering we haven't seen the best character Puk get animated yet. 

* **Sekirei**-So this is a pretty good ecchi/action/harem/comedy show and I think the manga just wrapped up earlier this year and there is enough content to make a 100+ episode series. Went two seasons, and we got a pretty awful cliffhanger. 

* **Panty&Stocking**-All right Gainax unruin Christmas already, it's been 5 years and we're still waiting. Season 2 literally writes itself.

* **Spice and Wolf**- I mean, there's more light novels and there is plenty of more of medieval economic goodness. 

* **Rosario+Vampire**- This one is a stretch because you can do two things here- continuation or reboot. The show was fun to watch even though it was way off the manga by season 2. A reboot could get all the epic stuff that was made in the first season of the Manga (yes the manga is separated into two seasons) and get a more honest translation.

It's not the string. The author just took the formula which made SAO popular and nearly copied it.

Ok you need to elaborate how DanMachi is similar to SAO, I'm not seeing it at all past superficial stuff or common shonen tropes.

1. bland protagonist (who has special skill)

2. RPG-like fantasy setting

3. no real plot, only a premise as a base

4. In case something actually happens, it's more random than foreshadowed

5. harem (girls are interested in protagonist without a reason)

6. thin characterization

(I've only seen the first episode and bits of the second, so my opinion is very limited)

Edit: After rethinking, Kirito isn't actually a bland character. The protagonist from DanMachi is, though.

1. The protagonist of DanMachi actually isn't that bland. Sure he isn't the next Vash but he's definitely likeable and has a 3D personality. 

2. Alright. You got that one, but that's less a ripoff and more of a similar trait. 

3. Sure there's plot. There's the MC attempting to better himself for his familia and for Wallenstein and also that goddess being shady as fuck. 

4. Can you elaborate more on this point? I don't understand what you're getting at. 

5. Only two girls are really interested in the MC so far and that's Hestia who has always liked him and the bar girl who's just crushing on him. 

6. Which characters are thin?

Anyway, these are just my opinions, but I think it's a little harsh to call it just the SAO formula. It's a good show. It isn't amazing, but it's very entertaining and so far isn't tumbling over itself. 
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I didn't want to talk bad about DanMachi. I've only seen 1.5 episodes. So don't put weight into my comment.

It's just my first impression I got. Maybe it's not similar in characters or plot, but the style, which the content is presented in, reminds me of SAO. And that's because both are modern-style first-person shounen adventure fantasy LNs (and I think all of these are similar to a certain degree).
>> ARTICLE
Well sure that's fair enough and I'd agree. 
>> ARTICLE
Just goes to show how little writing matters nowadays. I mean, just give him the fucking dagger and stop being so dramatic. NOPE. Not till next episode.

The results from the /r/japan_anime version are starting to trickle in. I set the results release for Saturday on that one, but I can already see some major differences between our results and their results.

Interesting how DanMachi is the most watched but drops sharply on the top 5 and recommended

whereas Kekkai Sensen is 6th watching but top for both passion and recommended for new shows 
>> ARTICLE
I'm only watching DanMachi due to the insane popularity, guess I just want in to try and understand all the hype. I guess there's a ton of people on the same boat.
>> ARTICLE
alot of people riding the hestia train
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of sequel series this season.  Those get an automatic advantage.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed the same thing about Plastic Memories. I was debating whether to pick it up and those numbers are not encouraging.
>> ARTICLE
going from 56% watching to a dismal 5.5% recommend and 19% top 5 yea thats not a good indicator.

Ep 3 was really lacking from the first 2 so probably alot of people are cautious about whether the show will pick back up again
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, it's a good show but there's just so many other good shows to choose from so it didn't make the cut for top 5. And as for most recommended, you could only choose one and that went to Kekkai Sensen for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Same Same, I recommended KS as well
>> ARTICLE
It was between KS and OreMono for something that would maintain a high standard of quality as we move through the season. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm expecting a lot of great things from Arslan Senki as well. 
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't on my watchlist so I couldn't comment, although I've heard nothing but praises for it. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's a lot of fun!
>> ARTICLE
DanMachi's a show that people are watching more for fun than an intriguing plotline.  When top 5's are mentioned people usually take it a little more seriously and think about the later.  Personally I find it god enough to fit in my top 5 but I'm sure for most it would fall just under the bubble especially since this season is a little stronger.

Edit-gonna leave that typo.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in it for the fun and I put it in the top 5, entertainment value is certainly a deciding factor on whether or not a show is in the top 5
>> ARTICLE
I think so too, I just find that a lot of people seem to get to critical when top 5's get mentioned.
>> ARTICLE
Salt and Butthurt is very rampant whenever rankings come out
>> ARTICLE
Oregairu2 <3
>> ARTICLE
Glad I caught up on this show. It might be my favorite this season, though this season isn't especially strong. Still a good show, though.


>> ARTICLE
I would go as far to say this is the strongest season in years. Oregairu is by far my favorite, but there are so many good shows right now. I have 8 I'm watch this season. Compare that to winter, I only had two and I didn't even finish one of them. The other was Aldnoah...

Now that's just me and my opinion. I'm curious tho, what makes you thing this is a bad season, or not like it much? 
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm actually watching more shows this season as well. Nothing is really impressing me as much as Death Parade, nor even Parasyte (which kinda nosedived the second half). Oregairu is good, yeah, but I can't think of any other shows that are good. Maybe Fate UBW? It's not really the depth I'm looking for, though. It's visually appealing, I guess. Kekkai Sensen is stylistically interesting, but it hasn't left a strong impression besides that. Arslan might end up being good, but at the moment it's just story-building. I also hate 14 year old male MCs, so there's that. Plastic Memories and Owari no Seraph are just kinda bad. And Knights of Sidonia, well, the weird alien tentacle love shit is kinda off putting.

Personally, one critically strong show like Death Parade beats having 4-5 alright shows. There's also the value of entertainment - while Aldnoah and TG were kinda shit from a critical perspective, they managed to be entertaining. Watching Slaine be a badass was pretty fun, even if his motives ultimately made no sense at all. I'm not expecting critical depth from shows like Owari no Seraph, but at the moment they're not even providing the entertainment value that AZ provided.

WHERE IS EPISODE 4 IM REFRESHING MULTIPLE PAGES
>> ARTICLE
I'm reminded of The West Wing episode where a bunch of people come and ask the President to flip the atlas over, so the southern countries will appear on top and the northern on the bottom. Seeing the tables where it goes from least to highest is just messing up my brain :P

Also, for "Passion Chart," there's a reason I usually used to cut away the sequels/continuing.

Top 6 without them this time around:

Anime	|	% in Top 5 of those watching
:--	|	:--
Kekkai Sensen	|	65.7%
Ore Monogatari!!	|	61.8%
Shokugeki no Souma	|	61.3%
Dungeon ni Deai o etc.?	|	52.4%
Hibike! Euphonium	|	52.2%
Arslan Senki	|	46.8%

Thanks for doing this! In mid-season, hopefully you'll track change from week 3. As to why people post/upvote results less, I think it's because people can't lobby here, can't convince people to watch/vote for what they like, and are more, "Damn, my show didn't do so hot," or "Damn, my show is on *fire*!"

But seriously dude, the cognitive dissonance from the images' reverse order ;_;

**Edit:** Not surprisingly, the "top 6 passion non sequels" correlates perfectly in terms of shows to the answers to "SURVEY 3: Recommend a non-sequel that you think other people should check out." Even the order is almost entirely the same, with only Ore Monogatari and Shokugeki no Soma switching positions, which shows that question is somewhat extraneous.
>> ARTICLE
Gotta put the bad shows at the top. Stuff like Triage X needs *some* recognition. Or maybe it doesn't...
>> ARTICLE
Can't some people be happy with a dumb show with boobs and explosions every once in a while? Granted, it needs less fog so we can see more of the ridiculous plot...

You mean a Michael Bay movie?

no it really doesnt
>> ARTICLE
Do a chart for the shows people are least passionate about, that'd help single them out ;-)
>> ARTICLE
> ...which shows that question is somewhat extraneous.

Which is the point of including sequels, no?
>> ARTICLE
You only need one question, but when posting the results do it in both ways, once with sequels, and once without. The additional *question* does not lead to different data.
>> ARTICLE
Ohhh that's what you meant. 

Though considering the results are nigh identical to the recommendation question and that you can just mentally remove the sequels from the last one, the without results don't seem too necessary.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, really surprised Shokugeki no Souma is in the top 5 for popularity and favorites.  Maybe I should check it out, I thought it was just foodgasms
>> ARTICLE
I find it really similar to No Game No Life in how it's presented. MC is a lot like Sora (same VA, so that might have something to do with it).  If you like NGNL, I think you'll like Shokugeki no Souma.
>> ARTICLE
:
>> ARTICLE
For some reason their foodgasms come across as hilarious rather than perverted, so I rather enjoy it. I also get inspired to cook after watching each episode, heh.
>> ARTICLE
The Soma cherubs with wide-eyed blank stares help lampoon the foodgasms

>> ARTICLE
It is, but they execute it very well.  I was honestly ignoring SnS until I saw that gif of the foodgasm -- the scene was just so *funny* unlike that Shaft foodgasm show last season.  I started watching SnS and it's just entertaining as hell, IMO.  I totally recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
No mention of show by rock anywhere :(
>> ARTICLE
I thought the same thing, not turning out to be too popular with the western audience it seems. Apparently it's one of the more popular shows in Japan according to /u/Futatsu  
3D probably scared all the western audience away honestly, even when it's done really well people get way too upset over it. 
>> ARTICLE
Same here, the popularity in Japan is incredibly high. It might destroy the shelves once the Blu-ray are released since Sanrio is apparently teasing with extra content and small promos on the game. 

Honestly the western audience sense of vanity is way to narrow to appreciate show by rock! Ground breaking production. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the game has been doing promos on the game for the anime, as well as some sort of event. If my Japanese didn't suck I would tell you what it was exactly but I'm too lazy to practice reading it beyond Hirigana honestly.

I've watched the first two episodes and don't find it funny at all.

1st 2 are literally the only fillers Gintama has, skip them and just watch the character intro and then the show.

I have watched the first 3 episodes and I really enjoyed it! A lot of people say that episode 3 "really brought down" the quality of the show, but my opinion is that they are exaggerating a bit (you know how a lot of us are). The writing may not be the best out there, but it sure is really enjoying and fun to watch. You should definitely try it out!

Never let critical analysis get in the way of enjoyment. I'm enjoying +ticmemo but at the same time I realize that it fumbled the third episode hurdle and didn't maintain the momentum that the first two episodes produced.

The lack of Yuki-chan makes me sad. I guess the days of the Haruhi's popularity really are over.

no, I know most of my friends are waiting for the dub. We all started watching anime when Haruhi was being dubbed. Its kind of hard to switch this late in the game, you know?

I hear ya, I watched it dubbed myself as well, probably one of the best dubs out there (and I'm usually a subs guy). I just couldn't resist the temptation! Anyway, Yuki-chan has had a pretty rough start sales-wise in Japan, and there doesn't seem to be as much discussion online about it as I was expecting. I'm a little disappointed, since usually viewership trends downwards.

Dropped Plastic Memories at episode 1,does it get better ?
>> ARTICLE
Episode 1 was the best episode honestly so if you didn't enjoy that it's probably not for you. There is some world expansion in the second episode but the third was really disappointing. I'd wait to see what people have to say about episode 4/5 before picking it back up again. It has potential if it goes back in the direction of the first episode I think but I'm not really sure what route it's going down atm.

What about the "Passion Chart" (% of people who watch a show that voted for it for top show)? [We discussed it last time as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33lpey/ranime_spring_2015_what_are_you_watching_top/cqm2cso).

That sort of "normalized" figure is very useful, because it takes into account shows that have more or less watchers, also often better to pick shows by - can also be used to get "underwatched" and "overwatched", by comparing position here to position on the "What are you watching" table. I do suggest putting a cut-off at shows that are watched by under 50 people.

But for instance, with today's numbers, only accounting for shows appearing in both charts. Positive numbers on Overwatched means it's overwatched by that much, negative means underwatched. Again, would be better with the entire seasonal offering, for this.

Anime	|	% passionate	| Over/Under-watched
:--	|	:--	|	:--
OreGairu S2 | 78.3%| -2
Shokugeki no Soma | 69.49%| -2
Kekkai Sensen | 67.48%| -3
Fate/Stay Night: UBW 2| 67.43%| 2
Hibike! Euphonium| 65.28%| -2
Ore Monogatari!!| 57.49%| -3
Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches| 52.05%| -3
Dungeon ni Deai o etc.?| 37.76%| 7
Plastic Memories| 33.26%| 1
Nisekoi: | 30.85%| 5

In this case, it almost feels like the "overwatched" shows are "guilty pleasures."

This is why looking at it without continuations is nice too. Maybe bold the new shows (continuations tend to dominate this).

Sound! Ephonium on the rise. Still more than half of you are missing it though. I highly recommend picking it up!

I might pick it back up, I dropped it after episode 5. Made me sleepy because it was so boring.

Stick around for episode 8! 
>> ARTICLE
Well the last episode was the best of the series. Seriously some beautiful moments. I guess if you didn't like the first 5 episodes though, it probably hasn't changed enough for you to like the rest. It's far and away my favorite, but I suppose everyone has different tastes.

Here's how I'd rank what I'm currently watching from this season:

A: Sound! Euphonium  
B: Plastic Memories, Heroic Legend of Arslan, Is It Wrong to Pick Up Chicks in a Dungeon?, My Love Story!!  
C: Assassination Classroom, Rinne of the Boundary  
D: Kiniro Mosaic, World Trigger, Nisekoi

No failing grades from me yet for this season, but Kiniro Mosaic is pretty close...
>> ARTICLE
I'm a little bit tougher on this season than you are, Pix.

S-rank: Ore Monogatari!!  

A-rank: Hibike! Euphonium

B-rank: Plastic Memories, GITS: Arise, Yuki-chan, AssClass

C-rank: DanMachi, Danna ga Nani 2, Sidonia 2, Comical Psychosomatic Medicine (Talk about an anime nobody is talking about! Sheeeesh.)

D-rank: Grisaia 2, OreGairu 2

F-rank: Urawa no Usagi-chan, Ame-iro Cocoa, Nisekoi:, Denpa Kyoushi.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm a little bit tougher on this season

Has DanMachi above an F.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'd rather keep DanMachi at a C for now and see where it actually goes instead of dropping it on the second episode and talking shit about it while pretending to actually know something. 
>> ARTICLE
After the first two episodes it was very clear what kind of show it was going to be, and I thought it was really obvious that is was going to be a trainwreck, so I would rather not waste my life watching such a not-worthwhile show. 
>> ARTICLE
check out arslan senki
>> ARTICLE
It's on my to-marathon list from this season, along with Kekkai Sensen and that food wars show that I can never remember how to spell...
>> ARTICLE
yeah arslan would be better marathoned.  Shokugeki no Souma has its merits for watching episodic.  They make food each episode. Good with food.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, man. I easily gained ten pounds over the Winter season, because I would always get hungry while watching Koufuku Graffiti on a weekly basis. So if I can just eat one or two heavy meals with SnS, it'll be better for my waistline. 
>> ARTICLE
How is Sidonia rank C lol..
>> ARTICLE
It'd be a B-tier if they had stuck with the main plot instead of trying to turn it into a harem with all of these girls, used-to-be-girls, and suddenly-girls. 'Cause that main plot is a damn good concept.
>> ARTICLE
They only started doing that for like 2 episodes.. And is called character development. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel that Sidonia switches between tension and lightheartedness quite naturally - it's perhaps the best at doing this out of all the shows this season. I have no problem with the slice-of-life aspects it shows, because displaying how Sidonia's citizenry - a population in perpetual war - gets on with everyday life in the midst of conflict is almost something I feel that's greatly underexplored in most anime (the other honorable mention goes to NGE). It's honestly a critique I don't understand, because 100% action or continuity makes for a rather boring and predictable plot. 

It's probably my single favorite anime this season, followed by Shokugeki no Soma and Hibike Euphonium. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't mind showing the other side of life within Sidonia. I actually find that to be part of the charm of the show, as it reminds me a lot of what both Macross and Space Battleship Yamato did. It shows a community of people working and playing together, and that does a *lot* for making an anime like this seem more believable.

The only problem I have is the needless harem. *That* is where things tend to go off the rails with anime.
>> ARTICLE
I don't find the harem needless, because it sets up for a lot of the comedy that otherwise couldn't be achieved in the otherwise serious tone. How else are we going to argue over best girl?!

I do agree with your distaste for Nisekoi and OreGaru - they do nothing for me. 
>> ARTICLE
I totally agree, it has some of the more realistic space combat, (for the fact they are basically fighting the flood) and I like Izana, but they are simply throwing in all these other girls for no reason than why not. 

Its really the only massive negative about all of S2.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not watching any of those :/ dropped them all. Planning on binging Kyoukai no Rinne once it's over though.

Sidonia Spoilers in link! [Look at this segment](http://a.pomf.se/mwoqvz.webm), it is a higher end animation but it shows what the studio is capable of and I think accurately reflects what you could expect. There shouldn't be any spoilers, but if you watch past 0:40 it could be considered a few.

knights of sidonia s2 is airing this season?

huh.
>> ARTICLE
I also think its better than the first season, but I haven't seen much talk about it. I'm guessing that's partly because people are waiting for it to go up on Netflix and partly because they got turned off by the CGI in the first season. It's a shame, seeing as I see the CGI as a strong point now.

I can't believe we live in a world where Yukino gets more than twice as many best girl votes as Yui.
>> ARTICLE
Genki gets no love :(
>> ARTICLE
Considering the following facts, it's inevitable:

1. In 80% of the ways that matter, Yukino is a female version of Hachiman.
1. First season had way too many like Hachiman for how "right" and "correct" he is, how much less of a shit he gives about those around him. Yukino is like him in those ways (which the show later shits on), meaning those "8man = batman" lovers like it.
3. This is the big one, /r/anime's userbase in general likes tsunderes a lot, a lot more than genki-girls.

To be clear, I don't ship, and don't mind either Yui or Yukino, or the people who like them.

I said as a whole. It doesn't apply 100% of the time. Taiga is... a pretty meh character. But how would you feel about Ami, who can also be considered a tsundere, to a degree?
>> ARTICLE
Ami would have been a better girl if she wasn't always vague when talking to Ryuuji
>> ARTICLE
Heh, you got me. Ami is best girl, but has the least chemistry with Ryuuji out of all of them.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I never discussed "ships", just "best girls", as did the question :)

A lot of people choose "Ships" based on "best girl", meaning the girl they like the most. I too prefer to go by what makes sense for the characters involved.

I also don't think Ami and Ryuuji lack chemistry, it's more that Ami is in a different place than the rest of the characters, emotionally.

Yukino is a kuudere, not a tsundere.

ctrl f Etotama 0/0

Shit taste
>> ARTICLE
Etotama might not be the best show of this season, but it's definitely the most criminally underwatched. I just picked it up this week on a lark, and I'm really glad I did. It's hilarious, and the fight scenes are awesome!
>> ARTICLE
> Etotama might not be the best show of this season

No, it is the best show of this season.

>> ARTICLE
It's super self aware too. It's well aware that it's not the greatest show created, but the 3D in it is by far the best 3D I've seen. Compare a fight scene of that to something like show by rock and to me it's night and day. Again, it may not blow anyone away, but it's dam entertaining.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one watching Tesagure! Bukatsumono Spin-off? It's rather entertaining.

I feel the same way about Gunslinger Stratos. It's hardly talked about, but it's a really cool premise and pretty entertaining as well.

Why is there no love for Ore Monogatori?

Its the only guaranteed smile show this Spring!
>> ARTICLE
I'm behind on this a few episodes. I enjoy it, I like the characters, it makes me smile and feel good.... but it's boring.

And I have to get myself to watch it because every episode contains: Yamato being cute, Takeo being Captain Hero Lifesaver Of The Galaxy and Bro being a bro.

Your missing out. Story is finally progressing past that.

Did they hold hands or kiss or have sex or anything?

What sort of progression are we talking about here?

Lol no Spoilers. It moves away from Just the usual kawai/Moe stuff.

>SURVEY 1: What are you watching?

Houkago no Pleiades and Show By Rock!! should be higher.

>Best girl

OP's mom should be higher.
>> ARTICLE
As someone watching Pleiades I don't think it should be higher.  It looks nice (other than the side-mouth snout-faces), it has *a* good character (Nanoka), but the writing...oh god the writing is awful.  
>> ARTICLE
It's better and more consistent than Triage X and Gunslinger Stratos, though, both of which are higher.
>> ARTICLE
My top priority for this season are (in no particular order):

* Hibike ! Euphonium
* Danmachi
* Kekkai Sensen
* Yamada and 7 witches
* Oregairu ss2
* Sidonia no Kishi ss2

I still watch others beside these I've mentioned but I did not enjoy them as much as the top picks.
>> ARTICLE
the fact that Shokugeki no Soma isn't #1 in all catagories, further proofes the shit taste of this community. /s

but for real, i'd put SnS and Ore Monogatari a little higher, but other than that it's pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
Ore Monogatari is quite predictable now Hopefully something happens 
>> ARTICLE
Did you see the last episode? I'd say they're progressing the story.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah their progressing but imo I think Takeo got his girlfriend too early but that's just me
>> ARTICLE
That's actually fairly common in shoujo romances. Sometimes girls really like watching a heroine that just dives straight in and gets a boyfriend.
>> ARTICLE
after getting my heart ripped out by first time binges of both NGE and Gurren Laggan, predictable and vanilla is nice once in a while.
>> ARTICLE
Too many people watching Hestia *for her personality*.

And soundtrack wise, gotta hand it to Kekkai Sensen really. Great job there.
>> ARTICLE
Composer's [Iwasaki Taisei](http://myanimelist.net/people/35743/Iwasaki_Taisei) (no relation afaik to Iwasaki Taku). This is his first anime music composer job, and boy howdy is this fucker absolute *killing it*. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow. First work, and a great one! Though I was not that impressed overall for the season soundtracks (have yet to watch Euphonium and I don't watch Fate, so I guess there is that too?)
>> ARTICLE
*Eupho*'s actually surprisingly tame despite being an orchestra show - we haven't gotten a lot of pieces being played, mostly just light background music. It's very good at setting the mood, but the music itself's not very memorable imo.  

*Fate UBW*, loathe as I am to admit it since it's now the most aggravating show I'm watching, is actually quite good in the music department. The action scene music (when there is any - we've got a lot of talking recently) has been appropriately pulse-pounding, and the Aimer songs for the OP and episode 20 are great. Not remotely as good as *Kekkai Sensen*'s, but definitely a good soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
Just started to embark on the Fate train, this time I made sure I had everything set properly (for the VN), because last time I had some issues (noticeably only the Fate/saber route), so watching UBW will not be before i clear the route on the VN :3
>> ARTICLE
I didn't vote in any of these but nice to see that **Punch Line** came up for getting better and better. The show hit a really poor vibe with me in the beginning and I'm still pretty sure it won't become outright amazing, but the turnaround has made it the show I look forward to the most each week because it is basically a giant puzzle at this point, and I'm enjoying the time-travel related theories about what could happen next.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed it from the beginning, but it's just getting better and better every episode
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised to see Chain Sumeragi so low on the list... but I guess when she's in contention with goddess Yukinon and Yui, not a lot can be done.


On another note, I'm just finishing up K-On!! and I'm kinda interested in watching Hibike!... this pretty much solidifies what I'm watching next.
>> ARTICLE
FYI, Hibike is very different from K-On. Both have cute girls who (sometimes) play instruments, but that's about it. Both are still good though.
>> ARTICLE
Hibike Euphonium's rise is mainly because of yuri between Reina and Kumiko. lel best episode last week
>> ARTICLE
Surprised more people aren't into Plastic Memories. Yeah, it's had some heavy-handed drama in it, but I really like how it's been shaping up in the 2nd half. Also grapples with some rather weighty moral/philosophical issues about how we'll treat sentient androids assuming we build them in the future.

It seems like they merely mapped out the human brain and created a replica as best they could. Except it's somewhat of a blackbox, and they could only pack in enough neurons for 9 years worth of memories. So while they were created, they essentially act and feel human to a degree that would be considered cruel and unusual if kept as slaves. Yet they do appear to basically be indentured servants for all intents and purposes, despite having a modicum of rights.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see people voting Megumi as best girl!

I'm surprised UBW isn't the most popular yet its discussion thread participation far exceeds that of everything else

I don't fucking know. I guess it looks good? And yeah, it does look good, but the only visually outstanding thing about it is special effects.

And freaking Etotama shits all over them in terms of battle choreography. 
>> ARTICLE
Good to know. I'd pick it up but it's not my thing.
>> ARTICLE
*sigh* I'm just going to repost what I said to you before since you seem to want to avoid responding to that comment, here:

>I think DEEN is just thrown around as an example without even a second thought of what makes them look bad. Give me an example where ufotable has done [this bad](http://a.pomf.se/uyhwwr.webm) or [this bad](http://i.imgur.com/SKWL7se.jpg) or [this bad](http://i.imgur.com/bO62ii5.jpg). Never have I once seen ufotable have quality this bad in their recent works, with the exception being episode 11 of Fate/Zero. So no, Ufotable does not have DEEN quality animation, stop using them as an example to thrash studios when said studios arent like that.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even notice lol, my inbox was filled to the brim this morning. 

I never said DEEN looks bad, I'm using a comparison that other people throw around since it's more relatable. And as I said, I'm talking about ANIMATION, not ART. There's a difference. The framerate is similar in all the scenes where they aren't fighting. 

I don't know why you're getting so worked up about this, in the end it's just my preference.
>> ARTICLE
Animations is Art, its meant to be the visual that the audience goes "Oooh" over. Its purely aesthetic, its not a videogame where you need visual representation to be smooth and prettiness is only an added option, the whole point of the visual medium is to look good. I also responded to your opinions about character animation:

>In regards to character animation [I still disagree](http://gyazo.com/b3a721f3b5d01ca4cc089f628f1da76a). [1](http://gyazo.com/5f3d25733d00a4f24234b90c262bda40)

You responded to the comment but you didnt respond to that particular point. If your only grievance with ufotable is the character animation outside of the fight scenes (very specific considering you're calling their entire animation average) then I dont see how you can call the entire studio's animation average when you yourself admitted that their backgrounds are beautiful, they do amazing looking CG, and the fight scenes are also pretty.
>> ARTICLE
Well you can disagree, I still hate the way they animate their characters. And I'm referring to the process of animation, which is when they are specifically making motion out of still pictures. I don't see much of a difference between ufotable's animation and the average studio. Fight scenes and CG are already expected to be high framerate because of the way they're rendered, and the backgrounds are the only things I think they animate well.

In the end everything we're arguing about is our opinions, so what's the point? Nothing you say can honestly change my original stance, which is that ufotable is an overrated studio.
>> ARTICLE
>In the end everything we're arguing about is our opinions, so what's the point? Nothing you say can honestly change my original stance, which is that ufotable is an overrated studio.

Fine whatever, theres no use arguing this then. I think your stance is stupid considering you can only find *one* thing you dislike, and thats the characters. Everything else you say is beautiful yet you still call them average and compare them to DEEN despite my earlier pictures of DEENquality.
>> ARTICLE
Look at my chart, it's actually 4th of the top 10 in terms of "% passionate about it," and 2 spots "overwatched", out of the top 10 shows alone.

I think UBW has been going downhill this season, myself. I also didn't vote for OreGairu in getting better because it was consistent. I left that bit empty. Everything's been more or less stable or going downhill for me this season.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, I personally feel that this is the worst season since I started watching, which was around 2-3 years ago.
>> ARTICLE
Well to be fair animation and art is a big thing being a anime I mean if its a video Game I would understand since gameplay>>graphics . 
>> ARTICLE
I think it *has* gotten much better. I was only watching it out of a sense of obligation before. The first season was boring as heck, probably since I'd already seen Fate/Zero.
>> ARTICLE
It's just been one big reveal after another, at this point I can't be hyped for anything that's going to happen. I'm only watching for the fight scenes, which have been very disappointing for this whole cour.
>> ARTICLE
At least Oregairu is above in "getting better". Technically it's more that there was a long build up and that it all recently climax'd.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually rewatching the first season of Oregairu right now since apparently I missed what was so good about it. Hopefully S2 meets my expectations.
>> ARTICLE
I hope so for you too! Though to me season 2 is really building up the climax, and at some point it does feel slow (up until episode 8 basically). And there is a big part of the pre episode 8 (they are supposed to organize a christmas party, blabla) that does feel a bit ... uhm, exaggerated, but I will leave that up to you.
>> ARTICLE
What's so good about it is 1. It is "realistic" (lol) and serious and isn't a generic harem with a dense stupid MC so ergo it is the best thing ever (let the fans ignore that there is in fact a generic harem with a dense MC that the author has camouflaged so well they can still have that little quirk they love without having to accept it is there) and 2. Because the MC is a huge "I'm actually better than you" self insert that tickles their fancy. 

There's also stuff like pretty animation (this season), presentation and the characters and situations being more believable (though still hard to believe if you ask me) than most other anime so by subconscious comparison this anime is Jesus. It's presumptuous as fuck but I'd rather have 10 Oregairus over another Nisekoi, or seiken tsukai whatever or Dungeon whatnot. It's not the best thing ever but it's a serious improvement over the harem genre.

Edit: Extra word
>> ARTICLE
None of the characters act realistically at all. Normal high schoolers are way more shallow  and less expressive than any of the main characters.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, normal high schoolers generally don't grow up in a situation where they are forced to keep anything they think to themselves but then later have a situation where they can openly express themselves.

The reason I think that Oregairu's main characters act so "melodramatically" is because they never really learned how to actually act in a situation like this, so they're finding their own way together. Surprisingly, I find myself relating to it much more than not.

^^^i ^^^love ^^^oregairu
>> ARTICLE
I know, although I'd say they're not as "expressive" but more pro-active. Real ones don't just let tension rise overdramatically over stupid, negligible stuff. But more than half of its fans would tell you one of its good points is how realistic they are. I'm sure they're just comparing it to harems against which it looks super realistic, even though it really isn't at all.
>> ARTICLE
I also think it's gotten better, but I thought it started weak so getting better isn't saying much.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't watch Fate/Zero first because of all the Fate fanboys telling me not to because spoilers or something. Still found UBW to be kind of boring. Haven't picked up the new season yet and not sure if I will.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero is miles ahead of even the Fate/Stay Night VN. I'd suggest reading plot summaries of the HF route after FSN is finished airing and then go ahead and watch FZ, since it'll probably be years before all of HF is animated.
>> ARTICLE
Might end up doing that. Fate/Zero *is* Urobuchi, who I tend to like. Stay Night just didn't appeal to me.

Isn't it nice, though, to see the Fate fanboys letting their downvotes do the talking rather than discussing it with us cordially? Stay classy, /r/anime.

Anime | % in top five | % change
-----|----------|--------
Fate / stay night | 41.0% | -9%

Big drops, but not surprised by any of them. Plastic memories just got worse and worse, and DanMachi/UBW have been poster children for people's rants about the disappointments of this season. I'd be interested to know how many of those no longer considering UBW a favourite are VN readers unhappy with ufotable's adaptation, and how many are Zero fans. 

Best Soundtrack | % chosen
---------------|--------
Fate/stay night | 20.1%

If I had to choose one thing as the biggest disappointment with UBW, I would definitely pick the soundtrack. It's so uninteresting, I really cannot see why 20% of people would pick that.

This is a good idea! If you're open to more categories I have a few suggestions-

**Shows that get you hyped up** (This one's pretty common for people who want recommendations)

**Shows where a main character plays straight man to the insanity around him** (This one also gives a good idea of the kind of comedy involved in the show)

**Shows with good fight choreography** (As an action anime fan, I've often been disappointed by action scenes heavy on beamspam or those that are simply decided by whoever uses a more powerful attack. Shows with good fight choreography or those that use powers in a creative way are always a plus)
>> ARTICLE
> (As an action anime fan, I've often been disappointed by action scenes heavy on beamspam or those that are simply decided by whoever uses a more powerful attack. Shows with good fight choreography or those that use powers in a creative way are always a plus)

All of OP's recs fit that.

I agree with you. I love action anime. Not just "beam vs bigger beam" fights though. It always feels like a let down.

Not necessarily action anime, but Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell have some great fight scene choreography when they have them. As does Akira (though it's really just about the insanity of the  fights many times since they are mostly one sided)

But I will 100% back Samurai Champloo, FMA:B, and Sword of the Stranger out of OP's recs if we're talking choreography.

REEEEEEEEEEE
>> ARTICLE
Are we doing the whole arbitrary thing where if it was made in the West it's not anime thing? I don't care, I don't even like RWBY that much but it seems like an extreme reaction. It's on crunchyroll in the anime section, that's good enough for me.
>> ARTICLE
At the risk of getting into a long discussion, it's not arbitrary. The usage of the word anime (except, ironically, in Japan where it's just short for animation), denotes animated media made in Japan. It's pretty clear-cut and it's not like there's no reason for the distinction either; if we could include any animated show this wouldn't exist as a subreddit. Things like Avatar and RWBY do cause some discussion, because they're based on or inspired by Japanese animation, but there are still significant differences, even more so in RWBY than in Avatar. Just because a streaming service includes it in a category for simplicity's sake doesn't mean it's not incredibly different in terms of animation, fps, production quality, and culture of origin.
>> ARTICLE
lets just say the topic of whether RWBY is anime is highly controversial, so people tend to avoid getting into it.

> Shows where a main character plays straight man to the insanity around him

Gintama?
>> ARTICLE
As much I like Gintama I feel it's different in this show where it utilizes Shinpachi as the straight man for[ the tsukkomi comedy style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_owarai_terms). It does question the craziness but quickly changes to another joke and doesn't dwell much deeper in the topic. 

Many comedy shows are like that in Japan but I don't think they all fit into this category.


>> ARTICLE
Thing about Gintama that I've noticed is that everyone get's to be the straight man at some point (depending on the circumstances) and everyone get's to be the eccentric one (even Shinpachi, many times)

So it makes the characters feel more humorous, and it expands the possibilities when multiple characters are around. It can also make things unpredictable when you set multiple characters to eccentric or straight at the same time, and many Gintama moments that have a great comedic impact revolve around multiple characters seemingly in the straight man role to other eccentric characters and gradually shifting within a single gag or scene.

They also explore other combinations and types of shifts from eccentric to straight man, and vice versa and combinations with other characters on their own comedic arc within a scene. 

It's comedy genius, and I feel like I learn a ton about comedy writing just by observing the different character combinations they come up with for situations that allow some straight men to become eccentrics. A huge part of it is the context as well, which is something that they are able to get right and experiment with because they defined their characters so well before as not only eccentric or straight man, but the possibility for both.

Shinpachi is considered mostly the straightman in the show by most of the characters, since he is only eccentric in a few circumstances, but definitely get's to go up against other characters as straight men.

>> ARTICLE
So... Am I the only one who didn't like SAO's romance at all? It seemed so fast forced and contrived to me, like it was written by a horny teenager who only knew what their ideal relationship would be like. 
>> ARTICLE
Thing is that anime romances aren't that great in the first place. What SAO does great is that the romance actually progresses after getting into the relationship. How many other shows can say the same for themselves? It's rarity, really. 

There is a reason why SAO is popular despite its glaring issues.
>> ARTICLE
Does it really progress, though? They move into the same house, then they stay the same until game over. Then the whole arc of him getting her back from a pedo (which was an arc _filled_ with problems) is followed by their real life romance staying the same as before.               

I agree that great anime romances are very rare, but I wouldn't use scarcity of good to call something that's mediocre as great.         

As far as SAO's popularity, I always thought it was popular for the idea of VR MMO and the cool fight scenes it does on occassion. Plus a lot of people like overpowered bland-nice-guy protagonists, which Kirito hits all marks for.
>> ARTICLE
Well, they do spend time together as couple which counts as progression for many people. Oh yeah, "great" might be not the best word to describe it but its still refreshing to see, especially for anime newbies.

> As far as SAO's popularity, I always thought it was popular for the idea of VR MMO and the cool fight scenes it does on occassion. Plus a lot of people like overpowered bland-nice-guy protagonists, which Kirito hits all marks for.

This too of course, but Asuna x Kirito is really popular ship as well.

If spending time with a girl was enough to be progression Nisekoi: would be the best romance anime ever :\^)

Agreed, the whole "O HAI LET'S GET MARRIED" thing was a complete headscratcher. I mean its not like they're in Vegas or something, they could have actually developed a relationship but instead its just thrust forward (of course without any real thrusting because harem be jelly) and then skids to a halt. Don't get me wrong, I like the show because its entertaining and has some nice action scenes, but sometimes the writing and pacing is just not very good.
>> ARTICLE
Without diving too deep into Katanagatari and hitting potential spoilers, the romantic subplot also works well as a coming of age tale for Shichika. The overarching story in conjunction with the romantic subplot take him from extremely naive at the beginning of the show to far more grown-up and adult by the end, all with a protagonist who is in his mid twenties, rather than the traditional high schooler. One of the many reason why it is tied for my favorite show.

I don't think anyone hates the beginning of S; G.  Most people just find it slow
>> ARTICLE
You'd be surprised at how many people say anything the beginning of S;G is "terrible", "the most boring thing ever", or "ruins the show". I've seen *so* many complaints about the first half that I'm convinced anyone who actually likes the first half is in the minority. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah I don't think we are. Only people that have problems with the first half are going to complain about it. If it was good for them then there's really nothing to talk about. 

Besides, every time the "slow"  first half is mentioned on here I see someone else reply that it wasn't slow at all or they enjoyed it just as much. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope we aren't. I'd think that most people would be fine with it since it's such an acclaimed anime but it seems I always run into people who say "how can Steins;Gate be considered a masterpiece if it has such a terrible beginning?"

[MFW](#facepalm)

Maybe I just run into all the haters somehow.
>> ARTICLE
I like to think the Reddit community of negative opinions is a vocal minority. I've recommended Steins;Gate to around 10 other people irl and only one of them said the first half was slow but he still loved the show just like the others. It really does have to do with expectations I'd say.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Er...okay I can understand that but you aren't making me any less right. You just happened to be one of the few that hated it and decided to voice that opinion. For one of you, there are probably 20 others that feel the opposite but didn't say anything because they have nothing to say. If this weren't the case, Steins;Gate wouldn't be nearly as highly rated and praised as it is. 
>> ARTICLE
Saying that it pulled you in from the start is probably a stretch though.

I strongly believe most didn't find the show "interesting" and "hype" until middle part of the anime (figures out how  the time machine works). Although that's just my guess. But you can't deny that there's lots of people complaining about how boring it is, and how most recommendations tell you to at least watch half the show before dropping it.

The post about how boring S;G is comes quite regularly even on reddit.

I don't dislike the show, but you can't really deny it either. I strongly recommend to not include a show as S;G in "Shows that pull you in from the start" since it's so well known for being boring during the first half. There's not even a plot to pull you into the anime to start with.
>> ARTICLE
I legitimately fell asleep during the intro when [Steins;Gate](/n "Kurisu was delivering her science lecture.") Once she [Steins;Gate](/s "joins the Future Gadget club") it picks up though and had my full interest from then onward. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually really enjoyed the lecture in the VN. I thought it was really thought-provoking and it brought up a lot of the time-travel paradoxes that we in real life question too.
>> ARTICLE
You fell asleep during the VN? Because I don't think that part was really long and I think it was during the beginning of the episode? I'm glad you thought it picked up when she joined the lab though.
>> ARTICLE
Ya I think the anime cuts out most of that part while the VN has Okabe stand in for the full experience. [It's not that long but it was enough to give me a 10 hour nap.](http://i.imgur.com/zVzp1UH.png)

To be fair the music playing during the part was pretty smoothing unlike the rest of the OST which is more upbeat/electronic.

I'm playing through the VN now so hopefully I won't fall alseep during it!

I'm watching S;G now and I'm only a few episodes in. I'd agree that it's slow and there's no action to break things up. In other time travel stories (Back to the Future and Terminator for example) the protagonist is usually time-traveling within the first 20 minutes. I'm on ep 5 and they've sent back a couple texts and banana. The big focus of the show seems to be it's character interactions rather than its plot. The characters are all great and I'm enjoying it so far, but I can see why people don't like this part of the show. S;G really takes it time to set up its science and mystery, so I'm excited to see it pay off later.

>> ARTICLE
I'm excited to see what you think! Let me know what you think when you finish the show :D
>> ARTICLE
I guess it's because people walked in expecting action/thriller with time travel and got a SoL with gooey bananas. 

Most people would be burned out by the time [steins gate second half](/s "Mayuri's death cycle begins")
>> ARTICLE
I think a lot of it has to do with the shows that it's often recommended with. If you're not used to SOL shows and get Steins;Gate recommended with Death Note, FMAB, and Code Geass of course it's going to seem slow because it's a different type of show.

Great list, but shouldn't it be:

Short and Sweet: ( < 20 eps or equivalent runtime)?

since

x < 20 | x (amount of episodes) smaller than 20

The "x" is implied. You would read it as "less than twenty episodes or equivalent runtime". Similarly, you would read > 20 as "greater than twenty".

**Mind Zero** shows (shows that have such a ridiculous or simple plot you don't need to think):

* Ojisan to Marshmallow
* Ben-To

After going through my list I realize I didn't describe it that well, for e.g. you don't need to think a lot with OPM, but you wouldn't recommend it as a Mind Zero.

I'd add Mirai Nikki to that list.

Um... Why? Don't get me wrong, not trying to start an argument or Internet rage, I'm just curious as to your reasoning.

Don't get me wrong, I like Mirai Nikki as a whole, but there's just no denying the fact that the show also has some characters who are straight up ridiculous in their appearance and/or behaviour for example [Mirai Nikki spoiler](/s "5th, 8th and 12th.") Also there's a ton of blatant and unnecessary fanservice which can be irritating considering the series wants to take itself seriously. Also why does the god of space and time himself want to potentially pass his powers to these particular people? Aren't most of them basically psychopaths?

The more you think about it, the quicker it all falls apart, hence why I'd put it in the "Mind Zero" category. That's fine though, as the show has great pacing, a new plottwist around every corner and the best implementation of a "Yandere" type character I've seen so far.

> **Shows That Have a Solid Argument for the Ends Justifying the Means:**
>
> Fate/Zero

I disagree. If anything, *Fate/Zero* is an argument *against* the ends justifying the means.

[F/Z Spoilers](/s "While Kiritsugu thoroughly tears apart Saber's deontological ideology of honor and chivalry, his own "end-justifies-the-means" utilitarianism is also torn to shreds by the end of the show. His character arc is a demonstration of how, even if you're pragmatic and do whatever it takes to achieve your goals, a black-and-white, good-and-evil philosophy is still incompatible with reality, unless you can achieve a miracle.")

[](/s "Kiritsugu's only hope for the world he dreams of is having his wish granted by the Grail, and he gives up everything and slaughters without mercy in order to acquire it. When he discovers that the Grail cannot perform the miracle he desires, the weight of everything he's done and all the loss he's endured crushes him. When Kirei sees him in the fire, he doesn't bother to attack him because it's clear that Kiritsugu has been destroyed beyond anything Kirei could ever do to him.")
>> ARTICLE
I think the show has a solid argument both for and against. It argues for a lot of ideologies. Just because his [F/Z](/s "philosophy failed at the end of the show doesn't make his arguments any less rational. He was operating with incomplete information and it ended up biting him in the ass")
>> ARTICLE
[F/Z Spoilers](/s "While it's true that he was making his decisions based on false information, I still believe the overall message of the series is one dismantling his ideology.")

[](/s "He's trying to do the right thing, and he's trying to do it in the most logical and pragmatic way possiblehe believes in good, he's just trying to achieve it through doing evil. *But it's eating him up from the inside.* His breakdown after killing Natalia shows the toll this internally conflicting ideology has taken on him, and it's just a prelude to his complete implosion when his last hopethe Grailfails him.")

[](/s "As I said above, the point of all this is that his philosophy is *incompatible with reality*. Miracles don't exist, and without one, evil cannot be exterminated. All a genuinely good-hearted person like Kiritsugu achieves by taking an "ends-justifies-the-means" philosophy to its logical extreme is their own suffering, as guilt over their evil actions builds up and up until it becomes too much to bear.")
>> ARTICLE
I still don't think any of that really makes him wrong, because his philosophy is that [Fate/Zero](/s "He is irrelevant. He is one person on the scale of many. Yeah, his philosophy ultimately wrecks him, but my interpretation was that he always kind of accepted that. Most people's philosophies end up with an unhappy outcome at the end of that show. Saber is shown that she is wrong, Kirei and Gil get what they want but they're evil. I guess you could argue that the show is saying that you should approach the world with a sort of Randian self centred view, but if you take human empathy into account then you're back to square one. Caster/Ryunosuke's philosophy of life being a play turns out well for them, at least they die happy, but that's an abstraction more than it is a way to approach life. Rider has the closest to a happy ending, as he has this idea of fighting harder for the sake of those who died for you to get where you are. I really like that philosophy, but it doesn't invalidate Kiritsugu's at all, even if it is a happier way of living from a personal perspective. In the end, I think Kiritsugu's actions are still perfectly reasonable. He did his best to save people even though the way he did it was destroying him, and when he was told by seemingly trustworthy sources about a device that could end all suffering he made the decision that everything else was irrelevant. To me that is more heroic than pretty much anyone else in that show, and even though it didn't work out for him I don't think there's anything there that invalidates what he was doing as a concept.")
>> ARTICLE
[F/Z Spoilers](/s "I think that the most crucial thing about Fate/Zero and the philosophies it explores are the endings each character receives. Each character comes into the Grail War with an ideology, and that ideology is then stress-tested by the situations they go through and the decisions they're forced to make. The show demonstratesthrough the end each of them meetshow compatible their ideology is with the world as it really is (as opposed to the world as they idealize it).")

[](/s "I'd say that the show is absolutely presenting Kirei and Archer's philosophy as one way to achieve a "happy" ending. If you live a life of hedonistic nihilism, pursuing pleasure above all else, then you won't suffer the way individuals with a grander ideology do. You might dieI mean, Kirei gets better, but he *does* get shotbut you'll never be mentally and emotionally destroyed the way that characters like Saber are when their ideologies are torn apart.")

[](/s "However, this isn't the only ideology presented in a positive light. Every character's beliefs are put under the microscope as we're shown the consequences of their actions. Caster and Rynosuke both die, but they live with such disregard for their own livespursuing bloodshed and spectacle above all elsethat they die happy and contented. Similarly, Tokiomi's deathwhile unexpected to himdoes not discredit his ideology. His death actually affirms his prioritization of the family name and line over the wellbeing of the individual. He may die, but Rin survives to continue his name and become a great magus.")

[](/s "A big one is obviously Rider. His ending, and the message therein, is arguably the most positive one in the whole showhis ideology survives everything the Grail War throws at it, and he comes away stronger for it, not weaker. By reaching for the unreachableand acknowledging that he does so *because* it's unreachable, that it's the excitement of trying and not the satisfaction of succeeding that makes it worthwhilehe is mentally prepared for failure, even though he approaches every battle with the intention of winning. By making it his responsibility to inspire others, and to honor those who have been inspired by him, he knows that his positive influence will extend far beyond his lifetime, and that even if he fails, he will have made his mark in their hearts.")

[](/s "By contrast, Kariya's foolishly "heroic" actionspursuing a set of goals he can never realistically achieve, just to try to save the people he cares aboutbring him nothing but suffering, and ultimately destroy him. And Kayneth dies with his belief in the supreme superiority of magical heritageand disdain for everything elseutterly demolished. His own ideology causes him to repeatedly underestimate Kiritsugu, and he is humiliated by him over and over until it kills him.")

[](/s "It's not all as cut-and-dried as "this ideology will make you happy, this one will fuck you", either. The lesson from Lancer's arc is that, if you devote yourself to faithfully and honorably to serving another, your happiness or suffering is subject to their whims. All Lancer wants to do is be true to his lord. But in both his life and as a Servant, he is sworn to selfish masters who betray him and cast him aside for their own ends.")

[](/s "The series comes down heaviest, however, on black-and-white, good-and-evil moralitieson the ideologies of characters who would be "heroes". I don't think we need to talk about Saber; every other scene is some character coming up to her and explaining in detail why she's a terrible person. But Kiritsugu suffers equally poorly. I feel like Fate/Zero is providing almost metafictional commentary at the endit's so common for heroes to achieve some kind of pseudo-miracle, to save the world and have everybody live happily ever after. By showing what happens when the miracle is taken away, and a would-be hero is force to confront their actions in the light of a world where no such resolution exists, the series presents a powerful narrative against the traditional concept of heroism and "doing the right thing". Through Kiritsugu's flashback episodes, we see that he has been following his ideology long before he learned of the Grail's existence, and that this is just the latest ends that he has decided justifies the means.")

[](/s "While Kiritsugu arguably made the best decision he could with the information he had, the show isn't just rejecting his choice to fight for the Grail. It's rejecting the underlying motivation that guided him throughout his entire life. Yes, if your ambition is to save the world, and you hear of an omnipotent wish-granting device, pursuing that device at all costs is the correct course of action. But Fate/Zero is rejecting the idea of *having* that ambition in the first place. Such an ambition is irreconcilable with reality. Yes, Kiritsugu makes all the correct decisions after starting down that road, but the decision to take that road in the first place (which, to be fair, he made as a child) was an incorrect one.")

[](/s "I think the overall message of the series is that heroism is an unrealistic ambition, and that you should embrace more relativistic ideals instead. Kiritsugu is a cautionary tale, a lesson that if you're going to believe in an ideology that will place yourself and the people who trust you in danger, it needs to be one that can weather reality (such as Rider's) and not one which will crumble apart and leave you with nothing but regrets.")

[](/s "...I've rambled quite a lot here, but I hope you have at least some idea of what I'm getting at.")

There are also a bunch of moe/SoL/comedies I could put up, like K-On!, Yuru Yuri, Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka?, Kiniro Mosaic, Yuyushiki etc, but that would probably fit another category like "Shows if you want something cute and light" for example.

Well, if you are looking for more categories, I've got a few.

# **So Bad it's Good**

Shows that aren't necessarily good on their own merits, but their attitude makes up for any flaws in full. Possibly subjective?

- Twintails

- Symphogear 

- Cross Ange

- Samurai Flamenco

- Valvrave (the reason I said possibly subjective)

- Highschool of the Dead (as a zombie show) 

- Inferno Cop

- Ninja Slayer

# **Romance that Goes Somewhere**

Romance where a couple goes on to become an actual couple, not just stopping shortly after the kiss or confession, or worse going nowhere with no payoff.

- Clannad Afterstory

- The fact that I don't have another off the top of my head demonstrates the problem with romance anime: most of the examples of this aren't well known.

# **Involves an established couple**

Doesn't have to be the MC and another character, can even be a pair of secondary characters. Just as they get a decent amount of screen-time together.

- Clannad and Clannad Afterstory

- Baccanno!

- LovelyComplex

- Kantoku Fuyuki Todoki

- I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying 

Edit: Added some examples!

>> ARTICLE
For the first suggestion you definitely want to put twintails there. 
>> ARTICLE
and INFERNO COP
>> ARTICLE
and Symphogear!
>> ARTICLE
"Involves an established couple" is a little broad, could you be a little more explicit in what you're looking for (since by that things like the Nagisa's parents in Clannad might fit your current definition and I don't know if you want that).
>> ARTICLE
From the shoujo side, add in *Kareshi Kanojo no Jijuu* (romance that goes somewhere - although the manga takes it a lot further than Ano Hideaki managed to to get in 24 eps) - and the very newish *Akagami no Shirayuki* (slow burn romance but it's definitely going somewhere. On second season now.)
>> ARTICLE
I didn't realize how much I like romance that goes somewhere and estaished couple until I read this.
>> ARTICLE
> romance that goes somewhere/involves an established couple

you know what annoys me just as much as the ending after the kiss/confession is when they're like together super early and then - nothing.

Hey yo we have or 2 year anniversity maybe we should have or first kiss? goddamnit NO ONE IS THAT SLOW.
>> ARTICLE
Man, there is no way I can put Samurai Flamenco in the same category as fucking Cross Ange.  Samumenco had some pacing issues and got really damn silly at times, but I think it very much succeeded its own merits.  And that show had heart; there was a real, tangible reverence for the shows it was inspired by.  If anything, I'd categorize it as "Rough around the edges, but a solid core."

For Romance that Goes Somewhere, I suppose you could include Golden Time.  I ended up pretty tepid on it, but it does spend the vast majority of its run time with the two leads as an actual couple.

And since everyone's doing romance-related categories, why not...

# **Who Cares About Love?**

For series and movies that don't have romance as a priority at all.  No shoehorned love interest, no pointless sexual tension.  Its priorities are elsewhere, and it never looks back.

* Gatchaman Crowds
* Girls und Panzer
* Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji
* Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita
* Kino no Tabi
* Little Witch Academia
* Paranoia Agent
* Perfect Blue
* Shirobako
* Tokyo Magnitude 8.0

1) Holy shit, another fan of Baby Steps.  Such a fantastic show! 

To shows you don't know if they will end happy or not, I'd add Gakkou Garashi.  The show itself was excellent, and the ending could have gone either way really.  

To shows you watch because happy, I'd add Amagi Brilliant Park.  Probably my second favorite anime, I was smiling from start to finish.

> Short and Sweet: ( > 20 eps or equivalent runtime)

Considering that many, many shows are only 1 cour (12-13 episodes), I'd change it to be under 10 episodes. I wouldn't think of Baccano as "short" when it's longer than half of the things I've watched.

I'd also split it into three categories: movies, series with normal episode length but fewer episodes (e.g. FLCL), and series with shorter episodes (e.g. Sekko Boys) since they require different amounts of time per consumable chunk of content.
>> ARTICLE
Ohh /u/7TeenWriters , you truly are a gift to our community.  Kara no Kyoukai forever :D
>> ARTICLE
The number of slice of life shows in the "If you just want to be happy" is too damn low.

Also can you please explain how Baccano fits that category? I love the show but characters getting brutally murdered regularly does not exactly lead to the feeling of "happy" unless you're a psychopath or something. The happy stuff was mostly comedy relief involving Isaac and Miria. Durarara also makes me raise an eyebrow but it's not as at ends with the theme as Baccano is.

For that section I'd include stuff like Haruhi, K-On, Azumanga Diaoh, Little Witch Academia, Lucky Star... 
>> ARTICLE
Baccano! makes me the happiest of any other show I've seen. Kind of hard to explain, but it just has the right energy. Puts me in a good mood for a week at least. And Yeah, I just haven't seen a lot of moe stuff. Taking suggestions and adding to the list currently.

You could add [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso) to **Shows if You Want More Complex Feels** dunno if you missed it or just didn't know yet :D

Yeah, just haven't seen it yet.

It's not complex though. At first it's a hope vs despair thing, and more hope and despair, near the end it's still doing its hope vs despair... and then [ending emotion spoiler.](/s "sadness that you saw coming from a mile away")

Great show to add to "Shows That Im Constantly Trying to Solve in Some Way" would be:

I would love a category for shows that would make me feel depressed, miserable and pathetic - TexhnolyzeAdding some more.. NHK, Grave of Fireflies, EoE, Angel's Egg, Penguindrum.. Mostly anything that includes the inability of one to fight against fate..I heard Bokurano is something that's more depressing that Eva, dunno but could help.
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen NHK of the ones you mentioned, but Now and Then, Here and There probably belongs on this list.
>> ARTICLE
Adding onto this category, 0080 War in the Pocket works. 
>> ARTICLE
Good point. I haven't really seen any sad shows without some amount of hope or light to them yet which is why I just had the bittersweet category. Will start that when I get off mobile and probably move Eva into it too since even the happy moments are tainted there.
>> ARTICLE
I'd certainly add Bokurano to your "Genuinely unsure if there will be a happy ending or not", but even more applicable in the bittersweet in general category if there will be one. This is an amazing idea, and I hope it gets off its feet!

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Gunslinger Girl and Berserk are others which would fit that kind of category.

I'd add Oregairu to Non-romance W/romance subplots or complex feels.  :D

Oregairu is hard to pin as I'd kind of consider it to be a romance and kind of not. Definitely complex feels though.
>> ARTICLE
I get that this is going to be heavily opinionated, but I don't understand why Fate/Zero and KLK was listed under the Complex Feels category. The reason is that neither of those shows had a high depth as tear-jerkers, imo.

I think it really depends on your investment in both. F/Z is kind of hard to dispute because that one wrecks a lot of people emotionally in places. I might be alone on the whole KlK thing.

Baccano!'s dialogue turned me off...  It didn't feel real. Should I try it again?

100%. It is absolutely fantastic. Also watch the dub if no one has told you that already.

You see, I did watch the dub! But I thought the accents and actual English being used didn't fit what I considered more foreign phrasing. Kind of a dissonance.  I'm thinking if I watch the sub I'll be able to justify what I consider to be a kinda awkward sentence structure.

So basically Code Geass is the answer to everything.

I'm not sure where it fits, but _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ needs to be here somewhere. Maybe under "Complex Feels"? Or "Shows You're Trying to Solve"? It's sort of a deconstruction of romance, coming of age story, and general headtrip. It's also hilarious, surreal, and beautiful. It really needs to be seen.

That's a great name for a category.

While it fits for the runtime, I'd be reluctant [to put](/s "White Album 2") in anything with the title 'sweet,' unless it was 'bittersweet.' It might fit better in the *Romance that Goes Somewhere After Kiss/Confession* category, though there's a strong case for the *Complicated Feels* category, too.

Well you just fucking sold me on that show. That sounds pretty awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Really solid list and like the idea. Off the bat though I disagree with saying Hyouka is a "Non-Romance Shows with Good Romantic Subplots". Hyouka is very much a romance show.
>> ARTICLE
I like your approach of trying to recommend Anime on the basis of more abstract feelings. However the examples of recommendation lists you give are sometimes too vague to actually tell me anything about why I might like a specific show on a certain list. 

For example: 

>Shows that I'm constantly trying to solve in some way. 

That title tells me YOU are trying to constantly solve these shows. You note, I think, with the use of the quotation marks around solve, that you mean that word to be deliberately ambiguous. But what if I felt that I understood Death Note entirely on the first viewing? Or, if not entirely, at least adequately enough? Then this list would not be able to tell me whether or not I would like Steins;Gate because I liked Death Note. 

>Shows if you want more complex feels. 

I'll take you using "complex feels" to mean complex feelings. Again, this tells me that YOU found these shows to have complex feelings in them. That term, complex feelings, is general and unspecific. What about the feelings Code Geass gives are complex? How are they complex in a similar way to the feelings Clannad gives you? What if on that list I had only seen Clannad, and found the feelings it gave me to be overdramatic, corny and for those reasons *not* complex? 

>Shows where the ends justify the means

You will probably now anticipate my response. Basically these three lists tend to assume that the viewer you are making a recommendation to will think in a similar way to you, but you actually have no evidence for that assumption.  As much as you might not like MyAnimeList recommendations, the format, I would argue, encourages you to give evidence for your claims. "If you liked the tsundere girl in show A then you might like show B because it also has a Tsundere character." That is tangible evidence you can give for your recommendation that actually tells me something solid about the show. You do this in your last example "Short and sweet." If you liked this shorter show because it was short, then you might like this other shorter show because it is also short. 

This is not to mention that including a show on multiple lists, with such abstract titles, might cause you to contradict yourself. Obviously Baccano! cannot be a show that wants you **just** to be happy if it is also a show that inspires some sort of tension that must be solved or resolved. 

Just some general feedback, I like the attempt though. I also feel dissatisfied with recommendations on MAL, so we're alike in that way.  
>> ARTICLE
> Then this list would not be able to tell me whether or not I would like Steins;Gate because I liked Death Note.

Good point. I don't think that this works very well for comparing shows that fit into the same category and it obviously gets better as with any recommendation if you write a long description. I don't think genres work well for that either though. Just because I liked NGE doesn't mean I'll like TTGL because they're both mecha shows.

> Basically these three lists tend to assume that the viewer you are making a recommendation to will think in a similar way to you

Yeah, there's no real way around that, and when I write a rec I'm going to be more wordy about why obviously, but I think that the issue that you take with this is the same issue that you might have with any other "labeling" system. Yeah, Cowboy Bebop might be "objectively" a SciFi show, but that doesn't really help as to whether or not I want to watch it, so subjective experience has to come in somewhere when saying whether or not something is good. Therefore I like this idea better (though I do agree that the "people who like x usually like y format is probably the best that we have".

> If you liked this shorter show because it was short, then you might like this other shorter show because it is also short.

This is kind of missing the point. This list isn't about comparisons so much as something to help when you're thinking "I want to watch a show that I can wrap up quickly right now" or "I want to watch something positive", etc...

I don't like this, honestly. It's no different from the big ass "recommendation lists" that just lists popular shows and gives me no reason to want to watch these.

I prefer the specialized, high effort recommendations that motivate me to watch a show even if it gives me a lesser gamut of shows and genres.
>> ARTICLE
> I prefer the specialized, high effort recommendations that motivate me to watch a show even if it gives me a lesser gamut of shows and genres.

I do too, but that's not the purpose of this list. I'm sure I'm not the only person who wants a specific kind of show at a given time, and I like the idea of having longer compilations. Since looking through a list of shows of a specific genre never really does it for me I thought it would be interesting to try somethign different.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, awesome post. Great job.
>> ARTICLE
>Shows That Im Constantly Trying to Solve in Some Way:

I kinda get what this section is for, from what I watched of them, but even so I would like you to clarify it. 
>> ARTICLE
Basically here I'm referring to shows that are a mystery (rather than mystery shows). Any show where you're constantly trying to figure out why something is happening, the motives behind a particular characters actions, what someone will do next, or even a straight up mystery. 
>> ARTICLE
Is there a list of shows with a good argument *against* the ends justifying the means? Because I'd be much more intrigued by that

Edit: for example, I would put Fate/Zero in there because of the finale, and I would also throw Unlimited Blade Works in there
>> ARTICLE
For sure, a lot of the shows with a good argument for have one against. I'll put some thought into it as I edit the post (went for a walk and this blew up a bit).
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I agree with any show you put in that list. Most shows there I watched go from being half supportive at best to completly against it.
>> ARTICLE
You should add Samurai Champloo to the get go interest list.
>> ARTICLE
I want this idea expanded to MAL levels of scale, i never knew it but this is what i always wanted

When i read "Shows That Have a Solid Argument for the Ends Justifying the Means: and saw code geass and shin sekai yori in it, i was ready for some good reccomendations. unfortunatley i had already made it to the end of the list and realized i've seen it all already. Damnit, i want more.
>> ARTICLE
This is a great idea. Hopefully everyone could put a big list together with lots of subcategory stop get stickyed or for the sidebar
>> ARTICLE

*Now and Then, Here and There* should be at the top of such a list. Emphasis on complex.

>> ARTICLE
> Non-Romance Shows with Good Romantic Subplots

More people watch this show. It is amazing. I plan on making a rewatch soon if i can at least get some interest in the show.
>> ARTICLE
This list needs some GiTS:Stand Alone Complex love. 
The build up in the series works great, with introducing the main plot point very early on while still keeping it at bay and exploring other areas based on the world lore and the potential issues that all the technology brings. The situations and scenarios don't seem out of place at all, but actually feel like things you would expect in a world like that. The character development feels subtle enough to blend in with the story, and ontop of that the Tachikomas keep it nice and fresh with some humor here and there. 

I also feel like Trigun belongs somewhere on this list. Such a gem of a show.

>> ARTICLE
Where would you suggest putting GiTS then. I haven't seen it yet (and before you explode, it's high on my list, just a bit of a time investment since there's so much of it and so many series). I wasn't really sure where to add Trigun, but I have a new idea for a category where it would fit.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for the seriousness, the GiTS Fanboyism was leaking out, haha. The closest i guess would be complex feels since they do really go pretty indepth with the motives on a political, and moralistic standpoint. I guess it would be on the list where you would consider, but maybe doubt, putting Paranoia agent on. They both kind of give you some thought with the experience, altough PA does make you feel more involved. 

Maybe that's an idea for another List. How believable it is. (Immersive is a better word i guess)

Edit: I do really recommend starting with the Movie though, if you want to get to know the characters, while enjoying a cinematic piece of art, the first movie is the best way to start. From there on you can start the series. Or watch the movie/compiled versions of the series' both 2 seasons. innocence is best savored for last i feel. While it's good, it just didn't live up to the first movie. After you've seen all that, i guess you can try arise, which is more or less an art style reboot
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, believable is a good idea, but should probably be more fleshed out. I tend to care about internal logic (and therefore Steins;Gate would be believable for me because it doesn't break its own rules, at least from a story perspective. Some of the characters are less believable but that's its own argument.), but I also get that some people are looking for actual realism. Thoughts? 
>> ARTICLE
>Shows for if You Just Want to be Happy:

* Love Live! School Idol Project will most definitely suffice for this too.
>> ARTICLE
This list makes me feel really unsure if you actually watched Baccano!. You've only really correctly assigned it once, to the "Solve" category. And most shows average around 20 episodes so if want a "Short" category, you should keep it to the 12 episode shows. There are good ones that exist. 

This comes off as a list of your favorite things with categories attached, which is fine, we all want to share our favorite things. I'd just make sure I was only assigning each show to a single category. Sometimes that can be difficult, but a lot of feelings that shows convey can often be chalked up to one thing. The few exceptions are things like Kill la Kill, which has a broad range of potential depending on the episode.

I only watched the first episode of One Punch Man. It really didn't pull me. Maybe it is that I just expect him to beat everything with one punch, and that would be kinda boring.

Not adding airing shows just for ease of use since any number of things can happen with them, but yeah, this is a potential favorite so far with a great beginning.

It might be interesting to see what important or well-liked shows are missing from your lists. These would be indicative of a blind spot, or some sense that you are not capturing.

The biggest missed shows I'm seeing is *A Certain Magical Index*, *A Certain Scientific Railgun*, and *FMA:Brotherhood*. I don't think they fit many of the current lists, and they are extremely popular.

Is it worth trying to pick up again? I barely made it through the first ep before I dropped it because I couldn't stand the humor.

I honestly think the first 1 or 2 episodes were intentionally designed to drive away the faint of heart. The rest of the show is a mind fuck, wrapped in a feels trip, with a humorous bow on top. All of the tropey humor or fan service actually serves a real purpose in the show and is tied in or explained.

Ok, neat. Yeah, I don't mind fanservice if it has a place, it's more that the comedy made me cringe rather than laugh through the first episode. I'll add it back to my ptw then I guess.

Hey OP, I wonder if you could add in the "tag" "Shows where you don't really know at all what to think/feel". What I mean with that is when you are hit with so many different things that can be interpreted in so many ways and end up confusing you (in a "good" way that is). They tend to make you think a lot more than your average show. I think shows like White Album 2 is one of those.

Also it would be helpful to find "realistic" shows too, such as Madoka for mahou shojou, Grimgar for MMO, etc.

I would add Konosuba to **Shows that feel like a tabletop RPG**. It doesn't feel like a serious campaign, but if you ever played with a semi-dysfunctional group that is exactly what it feels like. 

One guy spends all his money in stupid shit, another wastes his XP learning useless skills, yet another player spends all his time trying to pull off his character's nonsensical shenanigans, all while the GM tries to get the plot moving only to see his BBEG get somehow destroyed by an insane yet oddly effective tactic the party pulls out of their ass.

Ghost Stories (Dub only)  
I haven't seen it personally, but I'm going to trust [Glass Reflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePQJMluhLjQ) on this one.  
  
I'd also like to see the category of **Psychological Torture**. I'm not exactly sure how to word it - you could probably come up with something better. What I mean is basically shows that are dark and leave the characters thinking really hard about their actions and if they're humane (or something to that extent). These shows are usually demented and hard to watch all in one sitting, and have scenes that make you just sit there and think "did that seriously just happen?". These are pretty much the opposite of "feel good" shows. Here are a few examples:  
Fullmetal Alchemist

OP, I'd like to add "Parasyte The Maxim" under the category "Shows That Have a Solid Argument for the Ends Justifying the Means." It's an argument they make throughout the series, and it's only 24 episodes long. By the way, I think this is a much better type of recommendation list since I look for specific "feelings" as well, and not so much a genre.
>> ARTICLE
I'm late to the party here, but I would probably take Mirai Nikki off Mind Zero, I don't really know why it's there in the first place, sure there are shows that are more mind intensive, but it definitely makes you think. (And I didn't even particularly like the show)
>> ARTICLE
[Rainbow Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6114/Rainbow__Nisha_Rokubou_no_Shichinin) should definitely be in the GAR section. It fits so well

I've seen 18 of these shows. Putting Durarara!! in the 'feel happy' category seems questionable to me. There are some humorous scenes, but I felt uneasy a lot of the time watching it.

I'm surprised at the lack of Claymore. It would fit a few roles here, and it seemed popular enough. Show is 26 episodes, ends semi-conclusively(?) The Manga its based on is different to the show as well and its been completed.
It would fit in good fight choreography, as well as having a pretty dark setting. Sorry if a little late.

I'm suggesting the category **"Shows to introduce your reluctant/new parents/family/friends into anime"**
>> ARTICLE
What would you suggest for this category? No matter what you pick there are a lot of caveats and it depends on who you're suggesting to.

Miyazaki films pretty much work, and FMA:B is great for anyone willing to get into a longer series... but from there it gets a bit more complicated. I got my grandfather into anime with Baccano!, but I certainly wouldn't recommend that to anyone. It's good for beginners *if* they're ok with blood, gore, and confusing story lines. Steins;Gate is sort of solid, but there are *some* pervy anime moments, if pretty tame. Cowboy Bebop is a classic, but more and more new viewers are bored by it. Idk, thoughts on how to handle this?

Interesting list (though any general anime recommendation list should find a place for mushi-shi) I like the format and there are some I don't know yet.

"Romance that Goes Somewhere After Kiss/Confession" good category so many romances only go until they get together and often I would like to see their actual relationship a bit. (Monogatari theoretically counts too.)

RWBY? Is there a new season now?
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Mushi-Shi, so if you know somewhere it fits or want a new category for it and similar shows let me know.

And RWBY season 3 just recently finished. IMO it just got a lot better. Up to this point it's just been a kind of fun ride but after this season it's a potential favorite depending on where it goes and I NEED more.
>> ARTICLE
> To Love Ru

>not hentai

Although I admit I love this show because it's hilarious in that the whole thing it built on comedy, calling it anything other than hentai simply does not capture the lewd. I mean seriously, borderline is an understatement 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't label Mirai Nikki "Mind Zero". It DOES require you suspend your disbelief a little bit, but from your description it sounds like "Mind Zero" would be something plotless or without big twists. Mirai Nikki actually has a lot of subtle hints towards the conclusion, from the first scene, to the OP, all the way to the reveal. I think a lot of the people that dislike it do so because they just sort of watched it without thinking. Like, multiple characters do things that seem out of character or look like a Dues Ex Machina (I think that's a pun) when really the twists that come later retroactively make those "plot holes" or "bad character writing" suddenly make perfect sense. 

I think it's best to watch it with a mindset of "Yeah it has flaws, but it's still good". Like, it's fine that the Pillsbury Doughboy's wife snuck into the cast somehow, you can look past it even though it's just sort of absurd. The fight scenes are nice, the comedy scenes are nice, and the plot as a whole is nice. There are plenty of flaws, but I don't think there are many series you could call flawless. You might hate a character or two, but there are a LOT of them and you'll probably love some of them too if you don't come into the show thinking "this will probably suck so I won't get invested".

If you like **Hunter x Hunter,** then I bet you'd like **Yu Yu Hakusho.**

If you like **FLCL,** then I bet you'd like [**Abenobashi.**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/306/Abenobashi_Mahou%E2%98%86Shoutengai)
>> ARTICLE
If I watched Yu Yu Hakusho first, would I enjoy HxH? Or is the former superior?
>> ARTICLE
While Yu Yu Hakusho is by no means a bad show (in fact, it is one of my favorites of all time), it feels like Togashi took everything he learned while writing YYH and applied it to HxH, making a better show in the end. I would definitely recommend watching both regardless of which is watched first.

I assume you already know this, but you'll wanna watch Hunter x Hunter 2011. They both follow the manga really well, but 1999 stopped when it caught up, and 2011 goes well past that point.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! Will try to watch it this year, but seeing I have watched none of the popular Kyoani shows I'll probably watch a couple of them first. That, and I really need to get watching Berserk before I spoil myself of stuff from after the first arc.
>> ARTICLE
I would recommend watching both as well, but I disagree that HxH is a better show. As YYH was my favorite show growing up and still near the top today, I'm not impartial, but please hear me out. If I were to explain it, I think of YYH as a hand-crafted product while I view HxH as a thoroughly polished generic item. This is not to say that it is bad, but, rather, it relies heavily on what has proven successful. This can make it seem too formulaic at times. In addition, I find that the characters play heavily into my preference of YYH over HxH. This is personal preference, but if you fail to connect with a central character then a lot of the story can fall flat.

I think that both shows are good, but I think that the comparison being made does a disservice to both shows.  Thank you for your time.
>> ARTICLE
Completely disagree with how generic they both are. YYH relied way more on normal shonen standards. And Togashi didn't really want to. HxH isn't as generic because he was able to do whatever the hell he wanted the 2nd time around. 

I can only imagine what YYH would of been like if he was able to do what he wanted or didn't give up on the series. 

But yes, the original quartet is fantastic and I definitely like them more. That's a very good reason to prefer YYH.

I thought it was alright. I was hoping for an extra scene or two, but I think it told a mostly completely story.

Nah, my problems aren't with the story ending without explanation; it's more that I felt like it was going completely against what I thought the show had been trying to say for the past 11 episodes and felt like a cop-out.

Fair enough. I can see what you're saying.

Thank you for your excellent suggestion. I finished *House of Five Leaves*. I loved it from the first OP all the way through to the last ED.. and now I'm going to turn around and watch the first episode again just to see for myself that tricky thing the mangaka does in matching up the scenes to bookend the story.

It's an enchantingly beautiful show. I enjoyed how each of the characters became more truthful to themselves. It's hard to think of a flaw. Gosh.

I like Rakugo, *and* I like Namikawa Daisuke. Picked up.

>If you like Ghost in the Shell, you might like Mardock Scramble.

I watched the first OVA of Mardock Scramble this week. I really like GitS, and these have a similar cyberpunk setting- neon high rise metropolis, cybernetic technology. Mardock seems a lot more personal, and magical. If you're implyig that Rune develops into a badass on the same tier as the Major, then I'd be really looking forward to the next two instalments. At the moment Oeufcoque is carrying the show for me.
>> ARTICLE
I actually haven't watched past the first installment of Mardock, but the direction was solid enough for me to recommend it. And yeah, Saraiya Goyou is worth it, as there unfortunately isn't enough Josei out there. You should check out Texhnolyze as well. It's an entirely unique experience, and it's extremely well-made. A little despair never hurt anyone!

I'll have to circle back to that one- I've tried to watch it once, and I ended up dropping it after five episodes :/ It's not you- it's me. I'm not so interested in dark, edgy, cybernoir atm.

[PMMM](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_MadokaMagica) > [Princess Tutu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/721/Princess_Tutu?q=princess%20tutu)

Transforming cute girl shows that seem cutesy and simple at first but then escalates to wonderful narratives centered on the characters. The difference is Princess Tutu has romantic elements and is commonly regarded as a shoujo anime.
>> ARTICLE
Seconding this. They also both have wonderful soundtracks, with Princess Tutu directly using a lot of ballets' scores (particularly The Nutcracker and Swan Lake).
>> ARTICLE
Had Tutu on my PTW, but that tipped it over the edge for me. Sounds like a pretty interesting concept!

If you like [**Working!!**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6956/Working), then I bet you'd like [**Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21405/Bokura_wa_Minna_Kawaisou)

Both have a ridiculously fun and diverse cast, great comedy, and a side of romance. 
>> ARTICLE
Both are great because they actually have good writing, there are no crutches like magic or sudden engagements or tropey shit, they're character driven and well written.  And  straight up adorable. 

Heads up, Kawai Complex is unfinished and neither is the manga. Even with that though, its one of my top 3 anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Another one people who like Working!! is Durarara!, which seems out of left field but if you enjoyed the comedic scenes between Satou and Souma, their VAs voice two characters in DRRR (Shizuoe and Izaya), who have the same great dynamic and banter but with the violence dialed up to 11 (unless I missed an episode of Working!! where Satou throws a traffic light at Souma).
>> ARTICLE
I also think it's with pointing out that Kawai Complex has some damn beautiful animation. 
>> ARTICLE
I can say the same thing with Servant x Service. Both Working!! and Servant x Service are made by the same mangaka.
>> ARTICLE
You could really tell they were done by the same person. Both felt similar in so many ways. I'm surprised there were no cameo appearances, these 2 shows feel like they take place in the same town.
>> ARTICLE
If you liked **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann**, then I bet you'd like [**Getter Robo Armageddon**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/978/Change_Getter_Robo__Sekai_Saigo_no_Hi).

If you liked **Nisekoi**, then I bet you'd like [**School Rumble**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24/School_Rumble).

If you liked **Neon Genesis Evangelion**, then I bet you'd like [**RahXephon**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/165/RahXephon).

[**Hunter x Hunter**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011) <- -> [**Magi**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14513/Magi__The_Labyrinth_of_Magic)

Main characters have some similarity, both deal with some darker themes despite being a shounen. Magi really picks up in the second season, and HxH takes a while to pick up too. 

[**Shinsekai Yori** ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) <- -> [**Shiki**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7724/Shiki)

Both have horror with similar philosophical themes (moral ambiguity, defining humanity, meaning of life / nihilism, etc.) Shiki is criminally underrated for a show with so much depth IMO, but I guess the slow pace + whacky art styles put off people. Arguably, it comes off as a bit more heavy handed than Shinsekai Yori, mainly due to its love of violence near the end, whereas SSY handles it with more subtlety by making some pretty gruesome implications rather than actually showing it.

How does those 2 relate?
>> ARTICLE
Both are work place comedies with a similar feel in characters. The main characters originally didn't want to work at their jobs, there's a character who no one likes to mess with. Overall both are very funny with some heartwarming moments thrown in. Working!! is a bit more serious though.

>> ARTICLE
If you liked **Code Geass**, **Gurren Lagann**, and/or **Neon Genesis Evangelion**, then you might be able to find at least a few other mecha series that are of similar appeal.

* Code Geass is from the same studio that brought us the entire **Mobile Suit Gundam** franchise, and borrows several tropes/cliches from various Gundams and other Sunrise mecha series. 

* Gurren Lagann has had spiritual predecessors in the form of **GaoGaiGar**, **Gunbuster/Diebuster**, and **Giant Robo: the Day the Earth Stood Still**.

* Evangelion was inspired by mecha shows like **Space Runaway Ideon** and early Gundam shows (mainly in the "being a mech pilot would actually suck" sense) while also probably being an inspiration for **RahXephon** and **Bokurano**. 

In addition to those examples, there's a whole plethora of mecha anime to watch. **Patlabor**, **The Vision of Escaflowne**, **The Big O**, **IGPX**, **Eureka Seven**, **Gargantia**, all of **Ghost in the Shell**... I could go on and on.
>> ARTICLE
Especially if one of the things you like about Gurren Lagann is how it just continues escalating and shit never stops getting bigger and flashier...  GGG should be right up your alley.  Tons of pointless but awesome transformation they do every single episode, robots-inside-of-bigger-robots, colored bars filling up, and the new forms just never stop getting larger.

If you liked [**Overlord**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/29803/Overlord), then I bet you'd like [**Detroit Metal City**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3702/Detroit_Metal_City).

This is because the main characters in both of these series are "pretending" that they are someone else. Both are powerful and worshiped by others, but in reality they have completely different personalities (more or less). This is more for those that enjoyed the character/trope of Ainz Ooal Gown rather than the setting of Overlord itself, though.

If you like **Lucky Star**, then you should give [**gdgd Fairies**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11809/gdgd_Fairies) a try. Don't let the cheap-looking visuals and childish character designs fool you. Despite appearances, the tone of the series is very similar to Lucky Star, with the characters engaging in hilarious conversations about random and mundane topics, with occasional parodies and references to other anime. The series also features a segment in which the seiyuu ad lib their lines, a trend which would be popularized by Tesagure! Bukatsumono (which was directed by the writer of gdgd Fairies).

But OP, what if I don't like sports anime?

If you like Samurai Champloo, then I bet you'd like Michiko to Hatchin.

If you like Steins;Gate, then I bet you'd like Robotics;Notes.
>> ARTICLE
is there a specific element of sports anime you dislike?
>> ARTICLE
The format. Team joins and then trains to perform and competitions. Rivalities and stuff.

The only ones that I've enjoyed are because they have something else going for them: Love Live, Girls und Panzer and Ping Pong.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't really say that format's unlike what we've seen in Shokugeki no Souma though? Unfortunately, I haven't watched those 3 series you mentioned so I can't say what elements are like or unlike..
>> ARTICLE
Souma pretty much just goes around roflstomping people on his own, I'd say that the series is more like a battle shounen.

Girls und Panzer is half a standard sports anime and half a SoL. But it has tanks. Motherfucking WWII-era tanks. Love Live is exactly the same, but with idols instead of tanks. And Ping Pong is a psychological character-driven drama that happens to have a sport as its setting.
>> ARTICLE
If it's roflstomping and "superpower" level skills you're interested in, there are sports anime that definitely do that as well. One that doesn't get mentioned here frequently is "Prince of Tennis" which has a cocky main character who is probably the closest to Souma in character than any competitive anime charcter out there. Famous dad, way above average skills, pretty much invincible curbstomping, and the attitude to match - the main character of prince of tennis literally is Souma. Kuroko is a "superpower" one that get mentioned often with plenty of roflstomping.

But I still have to goback and say that, what it lacks in tanks, Haikyuu makes up for in characters.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say that a lot of other sports shows are character dramas too. the struggles the characters face may not be life-changing dilemmas like in Ping Pong, but even so, they do a great job if developing their characters.

But if you are solely interested in sports anime that have other things going for them though, check out Cross Game. It's a sports/SoL show with a pretty cool theme. The first episode is all you need to watch to get hooked.

I didn't like sports anime till I started haikyuu either.

I found the humor to be different and even the characters and plot. What's the similarities? I enjoy everything monogatari, but tatami galaxy was just meh.

They're dialogue heavy, character driven shows with heaps of artistic embellishment.  They're different in plenty of ways as well, but if you enjoyed the character dissection in Monogatari there's a decent chance Tatami Galaxy will appeal to you as well.

Monogatari was actually my ceiling of how fast paced dialogue can be before it becomes obnoxious instead of entertaining. I really freakin' love Monogatari and couldn't watch The Tatami Galaxy because of the excessively fast dialogue :(.

Hyouka > [Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30187/Sakurako-san_no_Ashimoto_ni_wa_Shitai_ga_Umatteiru)

>> ARTICLE
For Hyouka, I would honestly recommend checking out [HaruChika](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30895/HaruChika__Haruta_to_Chika_wa_Seishun_Suru), currently airing. The characters are fairly different, but it has the same overall theme of solving small or mundane mysteries around school and making them seem interesting. [Sakurako-san/Beautiful Bones](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30187/Sakurako-san_no_Ashimoto_ni_wa_Shitai_ga_Umatteiru) is another one worth checking out if you're looking for an episodic mystery series. The Haruhi Suzumiya and Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU series are good ones if you're looking for protagonists similar to Oreki, but I see that they're both already on your MAL list.
>> ARTICLE
ill try sakurako-san maybe

not really into haruchika. thanks tho m8
>> ARTICLE
For monogatari, it may be a stretch, but you should watch Death Parade. They are both visually stylistic, are character/dialogue heavy, and deal with internal conflicts and how those conflicts affect relationships. I haven't seen it, but people also generally recommend Tatami Galaxy for Monogatari fans.

If you want to go darker in the character/dialogue heavy with massive internal conflict genre, watch Bokurano and slip into a harsh, never ending pit of sadness and emotional emptiness.
>> ARTICLE
As strange as it may sound, a [y] for Hyouka is Hibike Euphonium. Like Hyouka it's based on a series of novels, which means that the writing is way better than the usual light novel crap. Same high level of art, great characters, about as much romance. No mysteries, but Hyouka's mysteries are not the important part anyway. Another [y] is So Ra No Wo To. Great art, roughly the same degree of intimacy and wonder as in Hyouka. Subtle character development.

If you like *A Certain Scientific Railgun* then I bet you'd like [Ookami-San and Her Seven Companions] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/7769/Ookami-san_to_Shichinin_no_Nakama-tachi). 

You might say at first, "What the hell do these shows have to do with each other?"

And then you notice that the Narrator for Ookamisan is Kuroko. Not just the same VA, but *literally* the same person. Both shows are developed by JCStaff (take that as you will) and although Ookamisan is a slower show, it's really sweet and almost a moe anime, while having its own elements of romance/action. I really love it, and I hope you'll give it a try!

Kill la Kill =>  Senki Zesshou Symphogear

Symphogear starts out a little slow, but I believe if you like Kill la Kill and singing/music, you will almost certainly enjoy Symphogear. Symphogear has battles that get on a level of hype near to Kill la Kill's final battle. Both shows have awesome transformation scenes (Symphogear's gets improved after first season). While it is a lot of fun, it also has its serious moments. 

The most important thing: I loved both of their OST's. They fit the action very well, and reflect the state of the character's feelings in the particular scene.

I really like the manga and think it would make an excellent anime, but this preview does not capture the spirit of the manga at all. It makes it seem all serious and edgy, when the manga is lighthearted and goofy. The art is great, and the recipes seem pretty realistic, I think he consults with real chefs, but the main appeal of the series is the ridiculous reactions to the food, kind of like those old York Peppermint Patty commercials.

While Shokugeki no Soma is certainly a fun manga (although too pervy imo), I wish more serious ones like Vinland Saga would get an anime. But I guess that's not the path the anime industry is taking :/
>> ARTICLE
It's a good adaption.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. The OP is awesome, and the ED is god-tier. They are closely following the manga and even added a few details that greatly notched up the series higher. For example, [Ep. 9 spoilers](/s "the humming scene (yep, a humming duet between Soma and Erina)"). 

The voice actors chosen for each roles are also great. At first I thought Daisuke Ono would fit Shinomiya's voice more, however, I was wrong since Nakamura-san did amazingly well.

Ok, now you guys convinced me. I will watch it soon, then.

I havent heard any complaints about a bad adaptation
>> ARTICLE
From the manga readers, perhaps? Because from some other forum discussions I read people posting that it's mediocre, generic shounen, and it's also from people who haven't read the manga, and I do believe that the manga (even the first few chapters) didn't leave the same impression, so I thought maybe it's a problem with the adaptation? 
>> ARTICLE
Like i said in the discussions i havent seen a single complaint of bad adaptation               
Although i can understand Generic shounen critism                     
The MC is currently overpowered from a cooking standpoint and has breezed through everything                          
             
The format of special MC who cant loose leaves this standpoint alot

>> ARTICLE
There's a rubber duck.  That means it's a-okay in my book.
>> ARTICLE
After reading the manga, I've noticed that they have skipped some chapters out.
>> ARTICLE
It's a so-so adaptation. It played straightly from the manfa with a little bit of extra gimmicks here and there. The fanservice was increased a lot with the voice acting and animation and sometimes it can be distracting. The emotional and badass scene from the manga while stays true to its tone, it generally lacking the impact the manga give. 
>> ARTICLE
It isn't really increased at all.. However, animation etc gives it alot more impact than it had when it were some stills on a page (obviously).

So far I think they've adapted it quite well, maybe not Yona level (almost following it page by page), but..

>> ARTICLE
That's why I give it a so-so. It's not a bad adaptation, it's just a basic routine adaptation following the manga. It doesn't offer up so much for me to enjoy the anime better than the manga. The manga is just more enjoyable. Doesn't mean the anime is bad, it's just a little bit lacking what the manga could offer


P.S : And I'm still bummed they didn't cast Sakamaya and Suzuken as Alice and Ryou
>> ARTICLE
To me it is one of the better ways to adapt a **long** source (manga/LN/whatever).

I mean, the usual is to remove alot here and there to shorten it to fit whatever number of episodes, often/usually creating an inferior representation of the source material.
If the content fits the number of episodes or not tend to be up in the air when it is adapted that way, but at least it is closer and more loyal to the original.
With an ongoing **long** source, the anime most likely won't reach the source's real end anyway.

So-so implies it is average based on how a series is usually adapted, which to me sounds a bit unfair (but then again, it is a matter of opinion).
For an adaption to be better than the source (as you apparently wish for) seldom happens, but one can always dream.

I think that the japan_anime number is inflated, since they usually do not have anime databases/lists. If you have to guess the number of anime you easily overestimate it.

Average year this sub started watching anime; **2009**. Let that sink in for a minute. If a show came out prior to Summer Wars, r/anime could very well be unaware it even exists.

I'm a huge lurker on here, but just had to comment because this just blows my mind as someone whose be watching anime since the mid to late 90's.
>> ARTICLE
I hear that. Started with Ranma 1/2 in about 1995 or so.
>> ARTICLE
I was really confused by your comment because I thought you were talking about your age. Now I'm really disappointed because I thought we'd have a over 90 year old fart here.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to disappoint, I've just been watching for a long time :P As I grew up, early on I was watching things like Miyazaki movies, Sailor Moon, etc. Then anime started becoming more popular in the late 90's with shows like Pokmon, which started airing in '98 to put it in perspective. By the early 2000's Adult Swim was airing shows like Evangelion, Inuyasha, Case Closed, Lupin the Third, as well as the internet beginning to not suck as much, so anime became more mainstream and had increased access. So to me 2009 seems like a decade or so too late for most people to have gotten into anime xD
>> ARTICLE
This shit is unsettling... 
>> ARTICLE
I like how you used *Summer Wars* as your reference point. I think I'll go rewatch that next week. It's basically the *Digimon Movie* with an alt skin.
>> ARTICLE
16 years old here and I don't even know what Summer Wars *is*.

I feel like I missed out by only beginning to watch anime recently. I'm very new, and it kind of sucks.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend watching it, as it was a pretty significant movie in the evolution of how anime looks, imo. Very visually pleasing and stylized in a way that not many anime were before, but several were after. The plot was interesting, if unoriginal, as it basically was a remake of the *Digimon Movie* just without actual digimon. But I guess that's ok, as it was the same director.

The fact that this poll thinks 28 counts as middle aged got under my skin a bit (I'm 36...still not fucking middle aged, by most definitions.)

The average age appears to be 19-20, so that would put those users at 13-14.  

Seems right to me.

And makes me feel old.
>> ARTICLE
Im actually fucking surprised that Danmachi was more watched than Oregairu and UBW . 

The Oregairu and Fate/stay Night episode threads are always so active with many users (like 1000+ comments for UBW alone)  never expected Danmachi to be this popular . 


Also Prison School is so underrated not even in the top 10 for summer most popular and surprise hits .So far this is my AOTS of this summer.
>> ARTICLE
I found it easier to watch Danmachi week to week.
I felt like I was forgetting subtle things while waiting each week for the next episode of Oregairu. I'm picking it back up now that it's finished.
>> ARTICLE
really easy to watch danmachi because it's story is really not that special i go to /r/anime to see what i'm missing or discuss something great to that episode, but danmachi doesn't have much to discuss and danmachi has 10%+ dropped watchers so yeah that's why oregairu and ubw is much more pack in discussions.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of lurkers that's why, plus it a show that isn't a sequel unlike Oregairu and UBW. 
>> ARTICLE
true was just surprised even though I know it was one of the most popular along with UBW and Oregairu . 
>> ARTICLE
I also find it surprising that almost all of the top 10 are 50% watched. 
>> ARTICLE
I ran out of space, so I'll continue here:

I'd like to thank mostly /u/higi1024 but also /u/Jiecut for helping me out and giving me feedback, and /u/KousakaReina for translating this to Japanese.

One thing I want to address in a future survey is the *length of the survey*. This survey was/felt too long, it got only ~2500 responses, whereas previous seasonal surveys got ~3000 responses. The length could also be a reason for the little amount of responses from /r/japan_anime, so cutting down the amount of questions is something I definitely need to do.

Another thing is that I didn't include shorts. I'm definitely going to add shorts in the next survey. I didn't include them at first since there are a lot of them, of which many are *really* obscure. I thought they'd clutter up the answers. What I didn't think of is giving them their own sections/questions, so that's what I'm going to do.

I also only included anime that *started* and/or *ended* in the spring/summer season, since I didn't want to have the same anime in more than two surveys. If I include shows that have more than two cours, that'd mean also including a couple of the long running shows (One Piece, Naruto, Doraemon, etc.). I excluded these for the same reason I excluded shorts. I can add those shows, as long as I can make the survey look shorter/less intimidating.

The final thing is that all shows only had their *romanized Japanese* names, and not also their *English* names. Frankly, this survey was really something I decided to do last-minute, since no one else did it. Since I had to do both Japanese and English surveys, adding a third name for every show would've been more work than I wanted it to be, and I wanted to focus on setting up the survey. Since everything is now set up and since I don't have university stuff to do this summer, adding the English names won't be a problem.
>> ARTICLE
Having the questions spread out over many pages makes the survey feel longer. I don't know if this is possible with Google Forms, but maybe you could have a table of all the season's anime that combines many questions into one, e.g. a dropdown next to each with the choices "Completed/Dropped/Still Watching" and checkboxes for whether it had the best first episode, best last episode, best music, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it certainly felt long because of the multiple pages. Previous surveys usually only had one page. You also tried to fit in summer stuff also in the survey. While you got more data it also increased the length.

I haven't seen this implemented but what about a grid? That would make it look a lot shorter. I'm not exactly sure if you'll be able to output the data the same way in quick summary. I don't have experience with it. But a grid would make it a lot shorter.

Also no need to sweat getting only 2500 responses. Advenna had a summer survey with 2k responses and Hemoglobin had a big demographic one with only 2k also. 2500 is a respectable number for a survey.

Yeah you got good experience running a survey for future stuff.

How's your progress with the results?

I have some projects that I've been thinking of doing. The meta survey analysis. I also want to do some big query analysis for subreddit cliques (what other subreddits reddit /r/anime users use) and vice versa. I think I can also use the bigquery data for comment face popularity, that'd be cool.
>> ARTICLE
lol I thought this was from Free Talk Friday.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean a grid like this?

 |Watching|Finished|Dropped|Picked up
-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
F/SN: UBW|x|||x
Danmachi||x
Denpa Kyoushi|||x|

That actually looks better than four lists of checkboxes, heh. higi1024 also came with the idea to split up the post-season (spring) and pre-season (summer) surveys, making it look like two shorter surveys, both of which are optional.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, please make a grid!

I never understood (and I'm sure I'm not the only one) what "Picked up" means.

* If you are "Watching" a show, you picked it up.
* If you have "Finished" a show, you picked it up.
* If you "Dropped" a show, you picked it up at least for one episode.

So what's the point behind "Picked up"?
>> ARTICLE
My understanding of it is picking up a show after it's started airing, rather than from the first episode. It helps with certain metrics because then you're able to see how first impressions of viewers may have affected people's decisions to pick up a show they weren't considering before.

Hmmm... Let's see here... I'll go with "anime seldom mentioned except by myself", instead. Because if there's one thing I love to do, it's talk about the uncommon anime I love. I've even been accused of being an anime hipster for some reason...

* [Hourou Musuko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko) is the only one of my top-10 that doesn't get a lot of traffic on this subreddit. Some, yes. But that's mostly me and two or three other people that just can't stop talking about it. This is not an anime for everybody, but it should be.  
* [Bartender](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1589/Bartender) is a criminally underwatched title. Which is kinda understanding, given the relative age of this subreddit. But it's a great choice to put your feet up, crack a beverage open, and relax for a while.  
* [Kimikiss Pure Rouge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2927/Kimikiss_Pure_Rouge) is getting a bit more attention these days, but not enough for my taste. A seinen romance drama, this one has a Best Girl that can beat the crap out of most of the wannabe Best Girls out there.
* I think I'm the only person that puts [Yama no Susume](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355/Yama_no_Susume) forward. And I love my cute-girls-climbing-cute-mountains show. I find it just as relaxing as Aiura.  
* [Expelled From Paradise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13391/Rakuen_Tsuihou:_Expelled_from_Paradise) is a movie from Toei that doesn't get a lot of traffic these days, yet I enjoyed it almost as much as Summer Wars.  
* Everyone will mention Sakura Trick when talking about the Year of the Yuri celebration, but few people will dare broach the topic of [Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22123/Inugami-san_to_Nekoyama-san). I actually enjoyed this a lot more than Sakura Trick.
* [Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1562/Yamato_Nadeshiko_Shichihenge%E2%99%A5) is a shoujo faux-reverse harem by the same guy that brought us Excel Saga. That's right. Nabeshin did a shoujo. And it is awesomely weird.  
* [Kiniro no Corda: Primo Passo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1579/Kiniro_no_Corda:_Primo_Passo) is another shoujo reverse harem, and it is the capstone of my Music Appreciation Through Anime series.  
* [Blue Drop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2964/Blue_Drop:_Tenshi-tachi_no_Gikyoku) is one of more curious shoujo-ai titles around. It's like a lot more tame version of Utena crossed with Noir, and was rather unfairly panned on by most of the critics because of it.  
* [Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10079/Hoshizora_e_Kakaru_Hashi) is my favorite cheesy generic harem, and has one of the best confession scenes I've ever watched.
* Speaking of favorite cheesy generic harems, [Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13367/Kono_Naka_ni_Hitori_Imouto_ga_Iru!) very efficiently lampshades all of the little sister routes by making the MC specifically try to avoid the secret sister in the harem.  
* And finally, because I've been typing for half an hour and want to go get something to eat, [Mouse](http://myanimelist.net/anime/624/Mouse) is one of my guilty pleasure anime. It's awful, but it's the greatest *because* it is so awful.

Hmmm... I think an AMA should go in the Free Talk thread.

But weirdest anime? That's something a bit more nebulous. Weird as in my brain noping straight out of my skull and fleeing to Mexico in order to drown itself in tequila? Cosprayers. Weird as in not being able to easily comprehend what's happening? [Tenshi no Tamago.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/885/Tenshi_no_Tamago) Weird but still really liking it? Probably when I watched FLCL and Kyousogiga on the same day. Weird as in "Why the hell did they do this to a sequel"? Kite Liberator. 

I've seen a lot of weird anime, so I kinda need to keep it categorized.
>> ARTICLE
> I think an AMA should go in the Free Talk thread.

I guess, yeah. 

Categorizing them seems good. In-between seasons when I'm bored I watch some unpopular or terribly rated animes to rate it myself. Some were okay-ish, others are a taste thing I'd say, but most of the time I just facepalm and laugh. Last time it was Kenzen Robo Daimidaler. 

Anyway, I'll add them to my list, thanks for it.

Maybe even [Wonder Momo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22377/Wonder_Momo), if you want to see a bad anime that isn't very commonly watched.

Its not that i don't believe you, but have a source?

Just so i can use a link when someone says *"Hibike! Euphonium is just a moe show of cute girls doing cute things like K-on"*.
>> ARTICLE
If think it was on the second 'Hibike Euphonium' special episode of the [sokoani](http://sokoani.com/archives/9398.html) podcast that the hosts were the most praising.


There have been regular highlights in newtype/animage etc very positive about the anime, but as it's more commercial the tone is more flat and void. 

What has been intersting is that the soundtrack is currently #49 in the global amazon ranking, #5 in the soundtrack ranking, with the BD/DVD are also around #50 globally, #16 in the anime ranking.

Looking only at the numbers K-on was huge as well, but in the reviews you hear a lot of adults watching with their kids, musicians, and overall pretty mature people. Having these numbers on such a wide base is pretty unprecedented for Kyoani I think.

Well I think I know what the true sleeper hit is going to be this season (Seriously, Overlord and Gangsta are sleepers?)...or at least I hope...At least it's nice to see Akagami top that list, deserves the attention. But summer overall is pretty promising and can't wait to keep watching!

I didn't select it at the time, but I probably would now. The more Sore ga Seiyuu I watch, the more I like it.

Dunno about everyone else but I simply took a chance on Overlord knowing nothing about it except that it has what looked like a best girl on it's front cover.

Given that there seem to be a lot less subscribers around 30ish responses was probably the most we could get? Still really cool that they answered, and thanks a lot for making the effort to do this!

Glad Yuki-Chan wasn't in Most Disappointing. 

Didn't see too many surprises but /r/japan_anime has gr8 taste m8. I think the most eye opening thing was how much longer /r/japan_anime has been watching and how much more they watch. 

I guess we're all just filthy casuals.
>> ARTICLE
We're not *all* filthy casuals... we just average out as such.
>> ARTICLE
Well, everyone else may be but my taste is superb
>> ARTICLE
Okay onto the results.

Age distribution chart looks really cool. While /r/anime looks really young the average age is actually 20 and median age is around 19.5. Yeah that's still young but the majority aren't in high school, not that there's anything wrong with HS.

Interesting to note that not everyone lives in North America.

Dungeon in the lead with 75% is quite significant. That's a big lead and really significant chunk of people. I think the hype worked. For comparison 65% to 70% watched SAO II.

Slightly sad that Arslan isn't that popular but 33% is decent. Another interesting thing to note is that most of the top 10 are above 50% watched.

But while a lot of people watched Dungeon, only 33% of them rated it in their top 5.

I was going to say something about the vocal crowd of prison school but it's not actually on the list. % on summer shows are a bit lower but we'll see if people picked up more shows for week 3. Still the Top 5 plan to watch are solid. (we'll see if people are going to be disappointed by God Eater)

Combining age and year started watching anime would be interesting.

For shows watched per season, this can be quite a difficult question. It's interesting how you can see people like to guestimate at round numbers.

50-200 full length shows is cool. 

For some of these questions median might be a more suitable stat.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that this proves that watching more anime doesn't mean you have better taste
>> ARTICLE
Watching more anime almost always means watching worse anime... at least once you start getting into like 300/400+ shows finished.

As the apparently sole representative of the UK, I can confirm that ~~I~~ we have the best taste as a nation. On a slightly more serious note, hooray for 7 witches being in people's top 5, also if this survey says anything, more people should watch Etotama.

181 people = just you??

Sorry, I was reading it on mobile and I just realised that half the table was cut off, making it look like it was a 1 -.-

jesus fucking asshats, I'm older than ~80% of you (23) and I'm pretty sure people think "fucking 14 year old" at least 80% of the time when they see one of my comments

I've also seen more anime than the median answer (50-100) and I've been watching anime since November.. (No Anime, No Life)

FUCK YEAH ETOTAMA! Good to see that people agree that it is terribly underwatched and underappreciated!

Sad to see that so many people dropped Re-Kan!, but at the same time it has the biggest "Picked it back up" ratio, so I guess it's okay.

Also, surprised how fucking right people were when they called Akagami a sleeper-hit.

God Eater is way too popular, undeservingly so compared to Akagami no Shirayuki-hime. I am upset.

I already know that /r/anime (and reddit in general) was predominantly male, ma >90%? WTF? As a woman, I find it sad :(

/u/DragonsOnOurMountain if you could clarify: On the question "Why do people hate CG anime?" does this mean 3DCG animation inserted into traditional anime, full 3DCG anime, or animation produced using other computer-based methods (Flash etc.)?

I... have no idea. That's almost literally what one of the Japanese guys wanted to ask. While answering, just try to cover as much as possible, so CG in anime and full CG anime

That is a big difference

Only 4 people from Czech republic?! No wonder I don't know anyone who watches anime irl. I'm really happy to be part of /r/anime. Thank you, guys :)

and in-case you were on the fence about watching eto-tama, [here is a glorious video that should persuade you to watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V9IMgeJ74M&ab_channel=JimmyNutron)
>> ARTICLE
Watch it because they make full CGI look amazing. Plus it's funny as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like a 5-6/10 show just from first glance.
>> ARTICLE
I started Oregairu with season 1, read all the light novels and eagerly awaited it to be adapted into an anime. Oregairu S1 wasn't very popular so it was awesome watching it grow to what it is now when S2 came out and ended. I'm glad everyone could experience one of my favorite animes and FEEL did an excellent job adapting it.

Edit:FEEL not Shaft
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't shaft, Studio FEEL did season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding me Dungeon no Deai is like SAO with more oppai.

(I feel like I'm going to get a fair amount of downvotes :P)
>> ARTICLE
Is like SAO, but with better animation and far less pretentiousness.

DanMachi is better than SAO because it's more like Accel World.
>> ARTICLE
But not as good as Accel World. Accel World had some unique and interesting elements to it, Danmachi is still just 100% cookie-cutter. It wasn't necessarily *bad*, I still watched it and enjoyed it, but it wasn't exactly new and fresh in literally any way. You're still right, though, because SAO was nauseatingly generic.

Accel World season 2 when?
>> ARTICLE
Danmachi is like SAO with a better girl. 
>> ARTICLE
Is the soundtrack based on the titles OP and ED? Cuz I think the OP of Fate UBW Ideal White/Brave Shine is just pure Epicness
>> ARTICLE
And one one talking about Aquarion Logos...Good. Fuck that show.
>> ARTICLE
Its kinda unfortunate so many people dropped Gunslinger Stratos...has a very heartwarming conclusion that is definitely worth the rest of the series being; at best, average.

If nothing else I'd recommend watching it when you got nothing else to do just so you can get to that ending.

Symphogear such an enjoyable trainwrecker, expected to be the sleeper.

I'm surprised and happy how many are watching Monster Musume. Thought that was gonna be Uber niche

How come I miss the original post for surveys like these in subreddits like 4/5 times but I always see the results post on my front page?
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe it! I mean, i didn't watch the other two, but i can't believe oregairu (yahari) got third place. I mean, if you take it seriously (and not just like your common romance/slice of life), it goes much deeper  than many series without losing points in terms of humor and lightness!

Man, mongolia really has to step its anime game up

Wish there were more people from Asia voting so that the results are not just geared towards 1/2 regions, especially since most people tend to like the same anime. And it surprises me that the number of voters from Asia are so little considering that anime in asian countries are generally quite popular and almost 70-80% of people ranging from 12-24 have at least watched anime once before

<3 to all my 34 fellow Singaporeans who voted

Hibike! Euphonium was my shit!  Didn't think an anime based on the "Band Geeks" episode of Spongebob would get me going.  But damn that surprise yuri love with Oumae and Kosaka was intense!

>The top 3 most beautiful and/or most visually impressing show

How does UBW not get into the top 3 of this category, let alone win it? I was really disappointed with the story but that doesn't stop me acknowledging that it's visually stunning. 
>> ARTICLE
Only the fight scenes are well done, and generally they were a step down from season 1.
>> ARTICLE
I say the background art is fantastic (not a big fan of their  character designs). Im a big jojo fan and there is no way its more visually impressive than UBW.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure you could mount an argument that JoJo's is far more visually interesting than UBW: the aggressively stylised designs, the unusual colour choices, the use of text, the 3DCG OPs, the inventive EDs. Ufotable's work on UBW, meanwhile, is often about sweeping artistic flair under the rug in the interests of consistency and a polished sheen.  The storyboarding in UBW is often kind of dull too -- unlike JoJo's, or indeed Kekkai Sensen and Euphonium. In that sense, UBW's sometimes closer to the more anodyne kind of US animation.

I don't know whether I'd say JoJo's was the third most visually impressive title of the season either, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm going crazy I swear it was on the top 3 last time I looked at it but now it's JoJo .
>> ARTICLE
Oh fucking damnit, I accidentally switched it with Kekkai Sensen >.>

It's fixed now, but kinda too late
>> ARTICLE
Hah, ah well. I have my answer at least!
>> ARTICLE
Heh it's slightly amusing that my age, the amount I've watched and the year I started watching is far more accurately represented by the approximate results from the Japs.
>> ARTICLE
So this confirms that /r/anime and /r/japan_anime both have horrible taste in anime, as expected.
