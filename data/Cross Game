That first episode... I wasn't prepared.

Those next 49 episodes flew by. I don't think I ever finished a long anime that quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Cross game was 50 episodes?  Wow, I remembered it as like 24
>> ARTICLE

I watched half the first episode last week but dropped it. I don't think it's my kind of show, but I'll try again today anyway.
>> ARTICLE
You should try to finish the first episode. The show changes in the second episode.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game is easily my favourite sports anime out of the ones I have watched so far. I absolutely loved it.
>> ARTICLE
If you liked cross game you should watch the first season of Major!  It has a very similar baseball with real life problems theme.  Don't get discouraged by the episode count, as the first season can stand on its own quite well and doesn't have a cliff hanger ending(though you can keep watching if you like it)
>> ARTICLE
Major only has like 25 more episodes than Cross Game
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I'll throw it in the PTW. I need to finish making my way through Touch before I start any other baseball themed anime though. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
I gave major and Cross Game a 10/10. Both were so good. 
>> ARTICLE
At the end of each episode, I was repeating to myself "this show is reaaaally good". This is a must watch.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game is amazing, it has right about everything.

romance, comedy, drama,intense match episodes, laid back SoL episodes...

Also Aoba, if you want to see a tsundere done right watch this show: yes she hates the guy at the start of the show and is really a jerk to him but the audience is provided with a backstory to explain why this is, it's not just "well she's tsundere so that's the way she is" there's more to it.

The anime also goes out of its way to show the audience that while she doesn't get along with the MC she's quite a nice person overall, not to mention hard working and talented,her tsundereness towards the MC does not define her.

>> ARTICLE
Ok I realize that this WT! is months old but your comment really bothers me: Aoba *is* a tsundere, but she doesn't *actually* hate Kou at any point in the show. I thought the show made it pretty clear (at least by the end) that [](/s "Aoba was struggling over her feelings for Kou because, since her sister and him were basically a couple before, she felt guilty for maybe liking him. She acts kind of like a jerk sometimes because of her personality, dealing with her feelings and the loss of a sister who she was very close to, and her jealousy of Kou's natural baseball ability- *not* because she ever hated him.")
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind that comment was just made as an introduction , not as an analysis, that's why I say "there's more to it".

[Cross Game](/s "I agree with you, but I think this only becomes evident the more episodes you watch, on episode 2 which is titled  "I Hate You!" I wouldn't blame a viewer on the first watch to take it at face value.You could argue that Aoba isn't being sincere when she goes around telling everyone who will listen that she hates Kou, but I'd say the first person she isn't being sincere with is herself, she has herself convinced she hates him and throughout the show she'll have to admit to herself that she in fact doesn't. This reminds me of why I love Cross Game so much, a rewatch of it is a different experience from the first watch.")
>> ARTICLE
Cool cool. You make very good points and I can agree a lot with your clarification.
>> ARTICLE
Aoba is one of my favorite girls ever, seeing her relationship with Kou develop throughout the story makes it one of my favorite series ever.  Even people who don't like sports anime will enjoy it.  Baseball is really only part of the equation in this series, it's all about the characters.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed this anime, [but](/s "I just felt like they didn't fit as a pair. It felt like the relationship was forced because she was Wakaba's younger sister. Loved the anime in general, but was disappointed by how things were tied up at the end. It just felt like Aoba x Azuma and Kou x Akane made much more sense to me. That "twist" in the relationships just felt like it was put in place to throw everything up in the air. Just my two cents. Sorry for the late reply, watched this series because of this thread and I came back to it to read back over the comments.")
>> ARTICLE
Reading your recommendation made me so happy!  Your analysis definitely covered all the great qualities this show has.  This show is just perfect (it's in my top 5).
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen a good sports anime since Ping Pong. You better deliver with this one, OP! Sounds awesome! :)
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game is first rate as far as sports series go. Adachi (the author) has been churning out sports series for decades and had more hits than misses.

If you do enjoy Cross Game, I highly recommend you try his other two big series, Touch and H2.

Personally I think that H2 is the best work he's done, with the best moment in the series not even belonging to one of the main characters.
>> ARTICLE
You'll love it.  It doesn't emphasize so much on the sports any more than Ping Pong did, it's really more about the character's and development.
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty great. The art is early 2000s style, so that might turn some people off, but the characters really pull you through the story. Try the first few episodes and decide. Like the OP stated, it's consistent, so if you don't like the early episodes feel free to drop it.
>> ARTICLE
It's slice of life so the feel will be very different, but like ping pong the plot is focused on the characters. Both are among my all time favorites, hope you enjoy it. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
But that would be less of a good thing as the pacing never really suffered from the high ep count. I can see how it can be daunting for someone just picking up the series though. 
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game was probably the most "real" slice of life I've ever watched.  I loved every second of it and highly recommend it to anyone regardless of interest in baseball. 

One of those shows that stays with you forever. :)
>> ARTICLE
Episodes 47-50 of Cross Game were the most gratifying moments in anime I've ever experienced. Episode 47 is really damn memorable especially the line Kou delivered.
>> ARTICLE
underneath the humor, slice of life, and sports, there is an amazing amount of thematic and narrative depth, developed such masterfully that i would argue that Cross Game is actually significantly superior to many other more popular and well-received shows of the same genres.

i do not with to sound mean, but i personally feel as if you did not do Cross Game justice at all with your [WT!] thread, as there is much more to mention, but then again, that is only because Cross Game is such an excellent anime, and i do wonder how does one actually do justice to an anime with depth and complexity yet also simple at the same time



>> ARTICLE
Just finished Cross Game. 

I loved it. Made me spend 3 days binge watching it 
>> ARTICLE
And it was all worth it for those last five episodes, wasn't it?
>> ARTICLE
YUP. The beginning and the ending of this anime was perfect!

This is now my second all-time favorite anime 
>> ARTICLE
Binge watched 50 episodes in approximately 2 days. It is an absolute favourite of mine with my favourite tsundere Tsukishima Aoba.


>> ARTICLE
It's unfortunate that an OST never was released for this, as it has some great tracks.
>> ARTICLE
I watched this while thinking at every minute that the title was meant to be "Close Game."
>> ARTICLE
Anywhere to watch legally? 
>> ARTICLE
It's really a shame, but I don't think there is.  I haven't been able to watch it since Hulu took it down.  I was in the middle of a re-watch, and it just disappeared, so I haven't been able to watch it anywhere since then.  Hopefully it will get another legal stream or a DVD/Blu-Ray release, neither of which has happened yet (to my knowledge).

>> ARTICLE
I think they fit well together as a couple, but I could see where you could disagree. As for the "twist": [CG Spoilers](/s "Adachi heavily implies that they had feelings for each other for years, but needed come to terms with their own feelings first. For Aoba, it was her guilt over her longstanding feelings for Kou. Adachi shows this with the scene where Wakaba insists Kou is amazing, and then tells Aoba that she can't have him because he's hers. As for Kou, I think he was lacking closure with Wakaba, which is why Akane was an important character, allowing him to come to grips with her death.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I thought that's the way they were going with it, too, but still felt that the characters didn't match. Oh well! My heart is broken. Better just go find something else.
>> ARTICLE
Ive seen hunfreds of animes. This is the no.1 on my list right above steins gate.
>> ARTICLE
So its K-On! But with baseball? I'll have to check it out :-)
>> ARTICLE
There's much more baseball in Cross Game than music playing in K-On! But, this is far more about the characters and a well-done romance as well.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! 
>> ARTICLE
If you go in expecting k-on! that first episode might surprise you a bit...
>> ARTICLE
Lol no nothing can be that. It was a very loose comparison.
>> ARTICLE
The 50 episodes felt like 12 and left me wanting more!!
>> ARTICLE
It was pretty fun watching Mo'Ne Davis kick ass in the Little Leagues a few weeks after finishing Cross Game.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck everybody in this thread... "Just watch the first episode".. The fuck was that noise? You can't throw something like that at me that quick.

Here was my thought process, "oh I'm off the next two days, maybe I'll watch this feel good romance." Buuuuuut nope... Noped right the fuck out having a good time off. Just going to sit here and be sad now.

Fuck OP, fuck Cross Game, fuck anime; I'm out.

From your answer, and the other comments, I have deduced that HGG should be a 7.

That leaves a 10 and an 8. Nobody tried putting LH and 10 together, so there is that.

And finally there is KonoSuba. Which obviously would be the 8.

To get: KS: 8, HGG: 7, LH: 10. Which means that /u/lucacp_ysoz was rather close with his first answer.

>> ARTICLE
3/3

Had Grimgar at a 6 until the second half where it started to pick up a bit.

KonoSuba was extremely funny, but some of Deen's wonky animation and Aqua in general put it at 8.

Log Horizon struck the right chords with me, having spent many hours in MMOs. First season got the 10, second was an 8.

>> ARTICLE
My all-time favorite show which I'm always recommending to basically everyone on this sub ^^^Sorry ^^^for ^^^that... And I'm glad more people are starting to watch it!

Sadly it isn't exactly an anime to discuss much about. There isn't a mystery plotline or a major dramatic twist. It's a simple feel-good children's show made for adults, but the execution is flawless and the dialogues are fantastic.

I'd be so up for a group watch of Cross Game though, because although I don't think it's a show to write a marvelous review about , an episode-to-episode discussion thread would be enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. Flawless execution and down-to-earth characters.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
The most interesting aspect is simply that it seemed much more believable and realistic than the things we get to see these days in anime (which, to be fair, usually is of an either cringe- or laugh-worthy level).
>> ARTICLE
I decided to watch this show on a whim awhile back, wasn't even on my radar but I was in the mood for a sports anime so I thought, why not? Watch 1 episode and I was hooked for obvious reasons. Was totally not expecting that end to the first episode.

Right after I finished it I told my brother to watch it. He says he hates sports anime and had previously refused to watch any of the sports anime I recommended him. I told him to just watch 1 episode and if he didn't want to watch the 2nd episode after watching the 1st I would never recommend another sports series to him again. Needless to say he watched the whole series in less than a week and it's still one of his favorite series to this day ^_^
>> ARTICLE
Much to my shame, I watched half of the first episode a few months ago and thought "eh, I'll get back to it later..."

> Was totally not expecting that end to the first episode.

Seeing this earlier today made me go back to it to see what happened, and now I'm on episode 15. Thank you.

Haha, yes. Its an amazing Slice of Life anime. :)
>> ARTICLE
Well this is one anime in my list of romcoms to watch, so it's definitely nice to see it being praised, which means I probably wont regret watching it. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't really call it a romcom, more of a slice of life with a tiny bit of romance and quirky comedy.
>> ARTICLE
Calling Cross Game a "romcom" is the metaphorical equivalent of saying that The Grave of the Fireflies is family-friendly because it's made by Ghibli.

My apologies, I asked for some good romcoms to watch and that was one of the ones suggested so I just assumed it was one.

No need for apologies. I was just taking the chance to say something witty.

My top 2 gets talked about a lot here but from the rest of my favorites


Great Teacher Onizuka. Legendary comedy/school anime and it rarely gets mentioned here, probably because it's old.


Magi. It's my favourite shounen after HxH and while it's not anything exceptional, I find it pretty strange that no one ever mentions it.


Darker than Black. For some reason, 99% of discussion about this show is either about S2 sucking ass, Chinese Electric Batman memes or the gif where Hei slaps bitches.



>> ARTICLE
Great Teacher Onizuka is just an incredible series. From the way Onizuka got kicked out so early in the best guy contest it's pretty obvious that the sub doesn't buzz about the series very much.

Which sucks because it's honestly a 10/10. It's just so good and one of the most hilarious series I've seen. I really hope they adapt the rest of the manga though I know that'll never happen.
>> ARTICLE
Totally agreed. I'd kill for a sequel, the manga too good to be left unadapted but sadly that's what's most likely gonna happen.
>> ARTICLE
yeah Magi gets weirdly overlooked imo as well. 

It's a shame because I think Alibaba is one of the best shounen characters ever created.
>> ARTICLE
>Alibaba is one of the best shounen characters ever created

This show is distingushed by adding politics to the Shonen mix as well as a good dose of Alibaba [suffering](http://imgur.com/kaAoqR3). 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, Alibaba's pretty cool. [Morgiana]( http://imgur.com/aFmxtOC) is my favorite from that show though.
>> ARTICLE
There is never enough Morgiana love.  She needs to be top in those "badass females" thread.
>> ARTICLE
I loved all of the main characters so much. Morgiana and Alibaba especially.

The thing that kills me is how underrated darker than black's OST was. Kanno Yoko pulled some crazy tunes in that show.

>> ARTICLE
I love that this is the top comment in this thread. Amazing series, it shares its 10/10 with only Steins Gate. 

The world building is reminiscent (to me) of Ghibli fare - Howl's Moving Castle, specifically. Not to say that the worlds themselves are similar, but they both feel very alive and real. 
>> ARTICLE
Finally! I knew people on this sub liked the show, but I almost never see it talked about. Every time somebody mentions it I get pretty hyped up, and to see it have this many upvotes makes my day. It's my all time favorite anime thus far. I wish it'd come out this year so the sub could talk about it more. 
>> ARTICLE
I remember when it came out, everyone was calling it k-on with girls in the army xD 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, what is there to talk about with this one? There's really not much to discuss other than to tell people to watch it for themselves. It's a neat little series that stands on its own and kind of defies words why it's so good
>> ARTICLE
>Helvetian Army

Wait what? As a Swiss guy my interest has been piqued... Do I interpret that correctly?
>> ARTICLE
The environment could be interpreted as such, yes. You should probably watch it to form your own opinion ;)
>> ARTICLE
Sort of? It's set in what is pretty clearly a [European mountain town] (http://static.zerochan.net/So.Ra.No.Wo.To.full.429652.jpg) (based off a real-world Spanish town, I believe). But the setting is not quite real-world. There are implications made about the world and its current state that, in my mind, should have been explored a lot more given how interesting it might have been, but generally remove the nations in the show from those in the real world. But if you want to interpret it as a Swiss town, then there's not going to be much stopping you. It's just not really all that connected to the Switzerland of today.
>> ARTICLE
> There are implications made about the world and its current state that, in my mind, should have been explored a lot more given how interesting it might have been

The world of Sora no Woto isn't supposed to make sense, as far as I understand. The show imitates Jack Vance's and Ursela LeGuin's styles in this way. LeGuin in particular has stated many times that she's not interested in laying out all the particulars of her settings for readers and that she intentionally makes them so that they're often the opposite of what a reader would expect, from what he knows of his own world. For example, she's fond of mixing racial and cultural characteristics--Rocannon's world, for example, features dark-skinned, red-headed people culturally resembling Anglo-Saxons or Norsemen but lacking all their physical characteristics. LeGuin does this because she wants you to focus on more important things and also to really hammer it in that she's constructed a world which is totally alien to us. Sora no Woto owes quite a lot to LeGuin's style in general, and I think this is one of them--the last place we expect Helvetia to be is the place that it really is, and it's totally inexplicable how things have ended up like that. Nor is it particularly important to the creators to explain or even come up with a reason, the work simply isn't about that 
>> ARTICLE
So I just watched the first episode and it appears to be a mixture of many European countries:

- Name of the country - Switzerland
- Interior architecture (porcelain tiles) - Greek?
- Written language - French
- Glass figures - Italy
- City - Spanish (according to the wikia)
- Paintings for story telling - Austria ([Gustav Klimt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Klimt))

...either way, I love the show already.

One of my all-time favorites. I don't cry for anime, but for this, I nearly broke down three times in the course of those 14 episodes.

>> ARTICLE
rated low but reviews are really high on mal

So whats you opinion on the show and some highs points of it, to decide if its going to ptw or not. Give me a "mini WT!"
>> ARTICLE
Boogiepop should be on anyone's list if they adore psychological, existential and mystery/supernatural anime. 



I believe it is tagged as dementia,  which very few shows are listed as such. Evangelion and Lain sharing that tag, so you can get the psychological aspect of you've watched these two. 



The story-telling is non-linear, which works great for focusing on the episodic characters whole giving you little pieces of the over-arching story. 



It's done by Madhouse so you know of the sound and visuals are going to be fantastic, right? Well, the sound is great and works very,  very well for the settings. The visuals are really what set it apart from a lot of Madhouse productions and other anime titles in general. Very muted pallet, using mainly grays and the focus give you a sense of tunnel vision; a strength as it subtly makes the viewer watch the character in front of them. 



It is confusing at the start, and that is only because of the non-linear story telling. It has some of the best re-watch value you'll experience due to finally understanding the time jumps and getting to piece the story early on when you watch it again.

Kemono no Souja Erin. Still watching it, but it's definitely around the 9 or even 10 for me (depending on the rest). 
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll still end up loving it. There's some plots that could have been elaborated upon at the end, but it ends pretty solidly.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to hear that, looking forward to the rest of the episodes!
>> ARTICLE
Erin is hands down one of the best characters in the medium, in my opinion, and the show capitalizes on that extremely well. I have a few problems with the show, but it's still easily one of my favorites.

I'm really happy to see it get more attention on this sub lately.

[Trigun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun) and [s-CRY-ed](http://myanimelist.net/anime/168/Scryed). I watched both on adult swim back in the day and fell in love. I see Vash and Wolfwood mentioned every now and then but not very much. And I don't think I've ever seen Scryed mentioned. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been considering watching s-CRY-ed because I'm currently reading the Oregairu LN and there are a ton of references to it.
>> ARTICLE
I came here to say s-CRY-ed. I watched it a few weeks ago and holy shit was it one of the most hype shows I've ever seen.

Plus the animation is really good, even though the show is 14 years old. Loved all of the characters and the rivalry between Kazuma and Ryuhou, the setting was brilliant too.
>> ARTICLE
Trigun and s-CRY-ed were some of my favorite shows on Adult Swim.

The thing I liked about Kazuma was that he knew what he wanted and just went for it.

[Nana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/877/Nana), by and large the best shojo/josei out there.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno. I love Nana to death but it gets mentioned ALL the time whenever anyone talks about romance drama or josei.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, really? Anytime anyone talks about romance, I barely *ever* see Nana/ParaKiss brought up. Even in that recent thread about [Romance in Anime](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33qsad/the_problem_with_anime_romance/) I didn't see anyone talk about Nana. It's sad, but I feel like I'm one of the only people around here that tries to constantly bring up Nana, even though it's decently popular as it is.
>> ARTICLE
Oh that thread and video are bad representations of romance anime (but I think people were trying to use examples with less drama).

I pretty much hang around romance anime threads and there are quite a few people that post Nana. Not so much ParaKiss, but that may be due to George being the worst boyfriend. ;)

* [Ocean Waves](http://myanimelist.net/anime/743/Umi_ga_Kikoeru) - Studio Ghibli taking a shot at a basic romance anime. Typical high school romance at first glance and light on character depth, but still a great watch. Think of it as a soft precursor to 5cm per second.


* [Hatsukoi Limited](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5150/Hatsukoi_Limited) - Technically a shounen, which is weird because it's one of the better romance anime that deals with multiple perceptions and characters in an enticing way. May not have the depth you are looking for in characters, but the multiple storie
s are engrossing and the comedy works well.

* [Sukitte Ii na yo.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14289/Sukitte_Ii_na_yo.) - Possibly the closest you'll find to a high school shoujo/josie version of Nana (minus the musical talent). Does use a lot of typical shoujo tropes, but that doesn't hinder the show at all, it actually solidifies how well they make the MC in the show: flawed, jealous, and human. One of the better female MCs you see in a shoujo.


* [Skip Beat!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4722/Skip_Beat!) - Pretty sure this is a big title in shoujo manga. Anyway, the anime is great, funny and puts in a really nice twist in the whole romance story. Give this a shot, and if you enjoy it, read the manga. Sadly it does fall into some basic story telling traps, but the episodic nature makes it a lot of fun.


* [Mystery Girlfriend X](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12467/Nazo_no_Kanojo_X) - Technically not shoujo nor josie. Bizarre as all hell, but definitely a must watch. A great, great take on romance, and innocent romance at that. You just have to get past the one bizarre part of their relationship, and it's great storytelling trust, communication, and basic relationship skills.


* [The Garden of Words](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16782/Kotonoha_no_Niwa) - Prepare your eyes to be visually blown away. Bittersweet story of growth, romance and moving forward. Its strongest suit would be the use of scenery to convey emotion.


* [Kare Kano (His and Her Circumstances)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/145/Kareshi_Kanojo_no_Jijou) - Surprised you did not have this classic on here. Staple for shoujo romance. It's funny, dramatic at times and has a well-rounded set of developed characters. Sadly it ran out of money so the last two episodes are horrendous, but it's still worth the watch, and if you truly enjoy it, I suggest you continue on in the manga because damn it's great.


* [Voice of a Distant Star](http://myanimelist.net/anime/256/Hoshi_no_Koe) - First published anime from Makoto (5cm/Garden of Words). Not really much to explain without spoiling the experience of watching the movie. You'll feel the same type of themes from his other movies.

* [Kimi no Iru Machi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17741/Kimi_no_Iru_Machi) - First part may bore you a little with an overused plot device, but that quickly goes away and leaves you with quite a compelling story that is dotted with some amazing flashbacks. Engrossing way of getting you to continue watching it, and at the end of the day it is a good story. I am going to start the manga and apparently it's quite different.

* [Kimi no Todoka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6045/Kimi_ni_Todoke) - I'd say it's a lighter version of Sukitte Ii na yo in terms of themes and general tropes. Not to say it's a bad thing, as this is a very sweet show with a lot of endearing moments. Lighter on the drama, and I felt more engrossed by the side characters than the two mains.


* [Honey & Clover](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16/Hachimitsu_to_Clover) - Prepare the bittersweetness. This show. I cannot express enough on how much this show hits the nail on relationships within groups, feeling listless, unrequited love and just trying to be. Basically what indie films try to do and fail 95% of the time, this show (both seasons) nails it. It comes across as a soft comedy/romance at first, and the change are subtle, until you realise you're watching a completely different genre.

Out of the list, I think you may enjoy Sukitte Ii na yo. and Honey & Clover the most.

If you ever get around to them, let me know what you think. :)

[Seirei no Moribito](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1827/Seirei_no_Moribito) (Guardian of the sacred Spirit)

Adventure show set in low fantasy feudal Japan. It has gorgeous music and beautiful artwork. And I love how "realistic" many of the sword fights are portrayed. And I'm a sucker for the amazing strong female lead.

Some fans call it very similar to Studio Ghibli's work. Also the guys that made the story, direction, and music are the same staff as for [GitS:SAC.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex)

Edit: Nevermind, I just saw that this show had some exposure on /r/anime in the last month: There have been two [Watch this!] threads ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33cs76/wt_seirei_no_moribitoguardian_of_the_sacred_spirit/) & [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2y2u0y/wt_seirei_no_moribito/)) and one [rewatch discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/32dzbh/spoilersreviewdiscussion_seirei_no_moribito/).

- Zetsuen no Tempest

I just finished this about 3-4 weeks ago and, damn, was it amazing. If /r/anime had actually talked about it more I could have discovered this masterpiece sooner. The best part was all the Shakespearian quotes and the fact that the story loosley paralleled the Hamlet and Tempest. I definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.

Although Zetsuen no Tempest isn't my favourite series, Aika is one of my favourite characters ever. I just thought she was really interesting and not held back by any shitty character tropes.

[***Space Brothers***](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai)

Seriously, if you haven't watched this thing stop whatever the hell you're doing and go watch it now. It's a SoL (kinda) that **DOESN'T** take place in school and I'm pretty confused as to why not many people mention it seeing its rated so highly on MAL.

An honorable mention goes to [Yakitate!! Japan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28/Yakitate!!_Japan), which is actually pretty similar to Shokugeki no Soma except it has no ecchi, it's only about bread, and its reactions are way, WAY, ***WAY*** more over the top.
>> ARTICLE
Yakitate!! Japan is an amazing show. I don't see it mentioned much in here. The reactions and the puns are glorious!
>> ARTICLE
Shakugan no Shana
>> ARTICLE
Also known as *the Misadventures of the Literally Fiery Tsundere and the Guy without a Real Soul*.
>> ARTICLE
Higurashi - especially season 2 (Kai). I feel like it gets brought up every now and again; but I think it's a fantastic series, especially considering where it goes in that second season =)
>> ARTICLE
I really need to continue with the 2nd season. Watched the first ep but then put it on hold and started like 10 other shows.
>> ARTICLE
[Rainbow](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6114/Rainbow:_Nisha_Rokubou_no_Shichinin) for me
>> ARTICLE
Haibane Renmei.
>> ARTICLE
It gets mentioned quite a bit still. 
>> ARTICLE
Most of my all time favorite anime /r/anime does not talk about at all (Oniisama e, Patlabor, Giant Robo, Honneamise, Sky Crawlers). I could list most shows I've rated 8+, really.
>> ARTICLE
Koi Kaze. I bring it up whenever I can.
>> ARTICLE
[Kino no tabi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/486/Kino_no_Tabi:_The_Beautiful_World).

It's criminal how little people talk about this show while they consider mushishi their favorite anime. If you enjoy mushishi you'll definitely love this as well.
>> ARTICLE
[Kyousougiga.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_(TV)
>> ARTICLE
It was incredibly unique with good characters and art, but for some reason it just couldn't hook me in ( I watched most of it, but not all).
>> ARTICLE
Everybody's been telling me to watch kyousougiga if kekkai sensen has been hitting my buttons so far!
>> ARTICLE
That's one I really almost never see anyone mention. Don't know why; it was probably my favorite show from that year (haven't seen the OVAs). It's as if no one even heard about it.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed [planetes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/329/Planetes) but i almost never see the show or the awesome [characters](https://thecajunsamurai.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/254062.jpg) mentioned.
>> ARTICLE
Fee is the best. It also has one of the most nostalgic OP sequences ever, at least for those of us who love the history of mankind's attempts to foray into space.
>> ARTICLE
i thought Tanabe was the best, sad that she had to take a backseat for the second part of the show
>> ARTICLE
Oh I thought fee was just a rad character, but in terms of maturing, tanabe definitely had the most growth.The focus on hachimaki in the second half was a little grating, but still ok...
>> ARTICLE
[Sakamichi no Apollon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon)

2nd best Watanabe series imo

Dennou Coil, which is barely talked about and Arjuna which is completly unkown.

Omg GTO is the best. I don't even care that it had janky 90s animation. A remake of it would be nice, you know, to follow through to the end of the manga?

Ouran High School Host Club (and a good amount of shoujos that are out there)
>> ARTICLE

The opening and ending were my jams back in the day

**[Shigofumi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3420/Shigofumi)** - one of my favourite shows of all times, very underwatched (but not under-rated, most people I've spoken to who've watched it appreciate it) - master class on how to get you caring about characters in under 20 minutes. Beautiful vignettes. The main background story is a bit weaker, but takes up less space. Just make sure to watch the first two episodes together.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it was the Death Parade of its time. And maybe a slightly more modernized version of Hell Girl too. Somewhere between those two. 
>> ARTICLE
"Did you like Death Parade? Then you should definitely check out Shigofumi!" is often on my mind as the newest ploy to get more people to watch this show.
>> ARTICLE
Would you recommend it to someone who didn't really like Death Parade but acknowledges what it did well?
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend it to everyone, basically. Just that "If you liked Death Parade, you might also like this," makes it an easier sale.

Its focus is on vignettes, emotional, focusing on the pain of humanity. If that really doesn't sound like your thing, then maybe give it a pass.
>> ARTICLE
Wolf's Rain. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes!! This has always been one of my favorites and it is almost unheard of here. 
>> ARTICLE
[Tantei Gakuen Q](http://myanimelist.net/anime/407/Tantei_Gakuen_Q)

One of my first anime. Wouldn't say it's mind-blowingly good or anything, but if you like detective shows, this should be a fun watch.
>> ARTICLE
Encouragement of Climb/Yama no Susume (Seasons 1 and 2). It's a cute SoL series with likable characters, great visuals, a lot of heart, and quite a bit to relate to.  It garnered a large amount of viewership, but rarely is brought up in any discussion. I think this is because of how straightforward the series is, but I don't know. I wouldn't mind seeing it mentioned more, regardless.
>> ARTICLE
Joshiraku.
>> ARTICLE
[Yozakura Quartet: Hana no Uta!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18497/Yozakura_Quartet:_Hana_no_Uta)  I fucking love this anime.  It isn't a great adaptation of the Manga since its kind of all over the place with where the story starts, but goddamn if it isn't so much fun and animated beautifully.  It wouldn't be a bad idea to maybe read a few chapters of the ~~anime~~ manga (jeez) to get your main characters grounded, or watch the first adaptation, [Yozakura Quartet](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4548/Yozakura_Quartet).

This is [the webm](https://danbooru.donmai.us/data/1847e98fb7cc880bdc75952fdc397d6c.webm) that made me want to watch this show.

You should have seen me a year ago. I was talking about Bartender at every given opportunity, and driving most everyone else to drink because of it. Not because they all watched it, but because it was the only way to tune me out.

Ended up doing a little write-up comment over in [another sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/2q5b0y/is_bartender_worth_watching/cn33jv5) that I immediately saved for future reference whenever the subject of Bartender comes up.

Outlaw Star and Trigun.  Outlaw Star constantly gets overshadowed by Cowboy Bebop due to their similarities.  Trigun does have Vash mentioned in the "Favorite Character" threads quite a bit, but it's not really talked about outside of that context.
>> ARTICLE
You do realise that someone basically made a HUGE [WT!] of all three shows you just mentioned, all in this week as well. 

Trigun gets mentioned, a lot. Outlaw Star not so much, but it still gets mentioned.
>> ARTICLE
Well there's a [WT!] because not enough people were watching it.. And the guy who commented is the one who's hosting the [WT!]'s.

Cowboy Bebop is talked a lot. Probably not as much as it should, though. Trigun and Outlaw Star receive very little discussion, which is sad because the three series make up a core of 1998, and Trigun and Bebop are very good. I have yet to see Outlaw Star though.
>> ARTICLE
[Jeez, I wonder](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33h1kk/wt_the_space_western_trio_part_1_cowboy_bebop/), [who that was](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33lg0v/wt_the_space_western_trio_part_2_outlaw_star/), [that did that](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33s7fu/wt_the_space_western_trio_part_3_trigun/). There's a reason I did it because Outlaw Star deserves a lot more attention and Trigun as I've said does have Vash mentioned often but often doesn't have it's other elements mentioned/discussed often (Cowboy Bebop was done just to use that one gif, the similarity it came out the same year and same genre as the other two, "Trio" sounds cooler than "Duo")

If you liked Cross Game, maybe you might like Princess Nine. It's a really old 90s baseball anime with romance and drama subplot in a pretty straightforward tournament setting. It has since been localized but it's a really lovely show from one of the most underrated directors in anime, Tomomi Mochizuki.

In fact, he went with a pen-name 'Go Sakamoto' and he story-boarded many other underappreciated shows. Though he did story-board for Code Geass and that was a gigantic show.

I'm sure some fans know of Kimagure Orange Road and he actually directed that one eons ago. It was considered one of the forerunners in romance anime during 1985 and it's a quirky romantic story with kids having psychic powers.

House of Five Leaves being a fairly recent example of his genius at storytelling and characterizations. It is about a bodyguard samurai who often is let go from a job and has settled down at a peculiar 'shop' that is willing to hire  him for good.

He even did a fantastic job of putting in some drama and personality into Dirty Pair Flash shows as well. And Dirty Pair Flash is a sexy sci-fi comedy/action show that is a re-imagining of the classic Dirty Pair franchise.
>> ARTICLE
kimagure orange road is amazing
>> ARTICLE
Most of my favourites I see mentioned here quite regularly but I rarely see Tsuritama, Dusk Maiden of Amnesia and, to an extent, Love Live! spoken about here. There are also the Persona 4 animations but I suppose people refer to the games more often in that case.
>> ARTICLE
Tenchi Muyo and love hina.
>> ARTICLE
Of my top 5... Zeta Gundam get's talked about but it's still not very common. School Rumble almost never get's talked about except on threads like this and it generally seems to be criminally underwatched. I often find myself mentioning it as the paramount of RomCom's and get the internet's equivalent of blank stares in threads.

Angel's Egg as well almost never get's mentioned but that shouldn't be surprising.

Samurai Champloo is pretty mainstream but I'd really like some more buzz about it.. no one on this sub really likes to talk about it since it's overshadowed by it's counterpart, Cowboy Bebop. Which really sucks because I'm of the unpopular opinion that Samurai Champloo is better than Bebop.

Blood-C. 

A lot of people give it a shit because the characters suck dick and the first 10 episodes are pretty much terrible for the most part, but I love it. I knew something was up when I watched, but I thought that Saya was simply an Elder God, or Elder One or whatever the fuck the Lovecraftian monstrosities were called. But the ending was easily the best ending to any anime I've ever seen. What cemented it was when [Blood-C] (/s "Saya leaps to the helicopter with Military Scientist Von Dickboy standing there, and you think she is gonna slice him down with her katana and then we switch to a POV and see a gun staring her in the face and hear it being fired.") 

I feel like that was such a masterstroke and cemented Blood-C's place as one of my 5 favorite shows because it just repeatedly overturned my expectations of what was going on and what was gonna happen next in the show.

Trava: Fist Planet.
>> ARTICLE
The Eccentric Family is my all time favorite anime series, however it's rarely mentioned at all on this subreddit. My favorite kind of storytelling is used, character based storytelling. It's a SoL with a plot revolving around a family of tanuki trying to make it in the modern world after their fathers death. It's filled with brilliantly fun and surprisingly deep characters all around, what it also does is it avoids forcing things down your throat, at some times in the series things are left to the viewers discretion. I often compare it too Durarara, the art is similar and they both adhere to a character driven story, the main difference is that The Eccentric Family is more lighthearted than Durarara.

Clicked Show All Comments and searched Yuyushiki. OK nothing found.

Yuyushiki is a well executed slice-of-life show, IMO even better than KinMoza or GochiUsa. It looks like generic moe yuri show and even the title is confusing with the existence of Yuruyuri, but it has something other shows don't offer.

The main focus of the show is friendship of characters, not on jokes or moe elements unlike other SoL shows. In this show cute girls do cute things *for themselves*. They don't offer cuteness or jokes directly to us viewers, but we watch them being cute and joking around between them. It's like watching a pet dog playing with other dogs. We sometimes don't fully understand their jokes or thoughts, but we are happy if they are happy. Even if [they are meaninglessly repeating a sentence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaPECzXKvgU) they just looks happy and we become happy by seeing them. That is yuyushik offers.

So much have you all seen? I have seen a solid 34/100.
>> ARTICLE
40/100, not bad
>> ARTICLE
A half-decent 24, plus another ~2 shows' worth of incomplete stuff. I should get around to more of these.
>> ARTICLE
10/100. I haven't been an anime fan for that long, plus I'm busy with college, so I think that's pretty good
>> ARTICLE
Ive completed 27, and if you include shows that I have read the manga instead, or watched but drop / didnt finish because I decided to read the manga, 34. 
>> ARTICLE
I've seen 67, and I've still yet to get to Bebop, Beck, and Death Note (although I read the manga once upon a time, so I have no real motivation to go watch Death Note at the moment).  Kyoukai No Kanata movie is on my radar as well, even though I wasn't too impressed by the series itself.  

Its nice to see my favorite (Kino's Journey) make the list though.  
>> ARTICLE
39, and working on 3 more.
>> ARTICLE
What was the methodology here?  Highest rank sets the franchise rank?  Or votes  avg = score, sum of show scores is franchise score, sort by franchise score?  Or?
>> ARTICLE
Highest rank sets the franchise rank was this one. I'll probably do another one that is average score later on as well. 
>> ARTICLE
If you count partially watched, it's 31/100. If it's only completed ones, probably like 25.
>> ARTICLE
26/100. That's just completed. If you include stuff I've started and put on hold/dropped/just haven't finished, it's more like 35 or 40.
>> ARTICLE
32, :( so much left
>> ARTICLE
Around 71/100 for me. I know many of the ones i haven't seen are great but just can't bring myself to watch them, waiting for the right mood.
>> ARTICLE
Only 15/100. I have a long way to go...
>> ARTICLE
38 Finished, 1 for which I finished S1 and never started S2 (Psycho-Pass), 6 Dropped, and 4 for which I've seen at least one whole random episode in the middle of the series. Total of 49 for which I've seen at least one full episode.
>> ARTICLE
33/100 watching like 4 rn so I'm on my way!
>> ARTICLE
57/100 not to bad.
>> ARTICLE
65/100

Not too bad.
>> ARTICLE
62/100, probably around 50/100 if I don't count anime I dropped or only watched a few seasons of.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty proud of myself for having about 43
>> ARTICLE
Kudos for the effort man
>> ARTICLE
Only 24/100, I haven't completed some of them yet like Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

Counted 67/100. I was expecting around 80ish. [Looks like I'm not as well versed I thought.](http://i.imgur.com/XquEb01.gifv)

Only 28/100 but I'm at also at episode 723 of one piece.

>Oldest member: Rose of Versailles (Fall 1979)

>Ashita no Joe aired: Apr 1, 1970 to Sep 29, 1971 

Is that a mistake or am I missing something?
>> ARTICLE
The one that is ranked high enough to make the list is the second season from Fall 1980.
>> ARTICLE
41/100 seen, if you count the ones I haven't finished.. Need to start watching more of them, like Clannad After Story, Monster and Hajime no Ippo.
>> ARTICLE
20/100. I love this feeling.
>> ARTICLE
32/100, so I'm about a third of the way there!
>> ARTICLE
I've completed 46, started quite a few others.
>> ARTICLE
21/100

25/100 ish, and dropped about an extra ~5

Also all of my top 10 are in that list unless I count Summer Wars which I'm not entirely sure whether it would be top 10 in replacement of something else.

I've seen 75/100, and I'm still missing out on many of the more recent or popular series like Bepop, Death Note, Shokugeki, Noragami, Parasyte, Jojo, FSN and Kuroko.

Pls watch these. Especially Bebop, Death Note and Parasyte. 
>> ARTICLE
I need to get around to watching Death Note. I've just heard so much about the second half ...it's hard not wanting to get invested.

Also, I'm still surprised people like Shigatsu/Your Lie In April so much. I mean I enjoyed it, but wouldn't think of it as #10 (in this list).
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Death Note yesterday actually and I can see why people enjoy the first half more but the second half is still really thrilling! 

Yeah same! I guess people really like their feels anime

[](#whowouldathunkit)

yes. not watching bebop is a crime
>> ARTICLE
It's a crime Bebop isn't in the top 10 :(
>> ARTICLE
Bebop is too overrated and too overhyped
>> ARTICLE
its just not your taste, but im sure like 80% of people here think differently as you.
>> ARTICLE
My statement may be incorrect. Let's say that i wouldn't recommend it as a first anime to someone.
>> ARTICLE
How come? I'm curious. Especially since you gave it a 9.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously don't remember anymore lol, that was a long time ago when i started watching anime. I guess i said that because there are animes that i would watch rather than Bebop. It's really great, but not that "holy shit" great. I have to watch it again some day, wish it wasn't episodic.
>> ARTICLE
I see lol I have anime that I would rather watch than Bebop but I still think it's one of the best out there. Different perspective I guess.

[](#whowouldathunkit)
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, while it's a great classic, a classic shouldn't be held to a higher value than newer anime simply because it's a classic. That's called being biased.
>> ARTICLE
But how did Bebop come to be considered a classic? It has an interesting, compelling story with a fantastic ending, unique characters, fantastic animation that still holds up to newer animation and it has one of the best soundtracks in all of anime. All of these contribute to why it's considered a class and are why it should be in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it does have all of that, and that's exactly why I call it a great anime. However, putting it in the top 10 of all anime isn't as cut and dry as that. There are plenty of anime that are as you described, certainly more than 10. A top 10 list simply cannot be anything but subjective. So it's not a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10. The top 10 on MAL is simply a popularity figure, it's not objective at all. It's a rough approximation of an anime's true worth at its best.
>> ARTICLE
That's true and since it's all subjective and this is all based on my opinion, *I* think it's a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I strongly believe it doesn't deserve top 10.

 Bebop is great, but it's episodic, and many people prefer a coherent story over a series of short stories, even if the characters and settings are interesting

Downvotes for not believing a show is top 10? I even think it's good, just not top 10 anime of all time... wtf.
>> ARTICLE
So much this yes. I watched Bebop only 2 days ago after my 3 years of Anime watching only to see that it is damn overrated. Characters were great, sound was amazing, stories were entertaining and execution was top notch. One of the best shows I have watched but it seriously lacked a plot. You can easily make connections with characters but events were so unrelated you never feel the show as a whole to like it so much. Just look at  [Cowboy Bebop](/s "what happened to Julia after all that hype? She just died."). You are exactly right about the show being episodic. Thus there is no room for Bebop at top 10. 

When I see people claim Bebop is one of the best shows I think that people are trying to show off that they pick a classic old show as their favorite to feel somehow superior against the people who like new, popular stuff. It is the same as people hating on SAO for no apparent reason other than it being popular. I didn't watch the second season but first season was definitely a good entertaining normal show. Same hate on Kirito too. Kirito is not some outstanding character to be the favorite character for anyone but he is not that notable as a bad character to become anyone's most hated character either. Just because he is popular, no reason to hate on him to show off your *unique/s* and *mature/s* taste.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry but I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial. It's kind of like saying a SOL show is better than an action/adventure show just because it fits into the SOL genre and a certain group of people like SOL more.

People having a problem with the actual content of an episodic show is one thing but saying it's not great *because* its episodic is completely different.

>> ARTICLE
If you're issue is being invested in the fate of the characters, because at the end of the episode everything reverts back to ~ status quo, and there's no longer arc to get heavily invested in the characters.




>> ARTICLE
This isn't necessarily true.  Certain episodic shows have more development per episode than others.  Not all episodic shows are law and order.
>> ARTICLE
That's a different issue that has to deal with the actual content of the episodes including the characters.

Also, Bebop does have an overarching story that's highlighted in specific episodes that helps you feel connected to the characters. If Bebop was really a completely episodic show with no main plot then the ending wouldn't have hit as hard as it did.
>> ARTICLE
>I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial

If a work from of a medium tailored for storytelling falls short on storytelling, it's a pretty legitimate argument to make.
>> ARTICLE
I agree but that comes down to the actual story being told not simply the format of storytelling.
>> ARTICLE
Never understood the hype. Watched it a few years back because it's supposedly divine and untouchable, but it looked rather bland to me.
>> ARTICLE
It's episodic nature isn't for everyone. I could defend it all day long as my favorite anime but the most recent rewatch thread had really great write ups and does a much better job. If you read some (episode 5 and the last few are probably the better ones) you may find some appreciation for it.

Noragami was not in the top 100 before the top 100, so it's the newest member because it's a completely new entry. Haikyuu!! season 1 was already in the top 100, and while it moved up due to season 2, it isn't really a new member.

Irionically I feel that after signing up to MAL back around August 2015, I've rated some of my favorite shows of the past with rose-colored glasses.  Like, I'm pretty sure if I rewatched R.O.D. OVA now, it would no longer be 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I go back maybe once a year and re-rate things to more match what Im feeling over the long term.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously look at the numbers for 2011-2014 3/4 years have 9 entries and 2013 must've been a pretty barren year to only get 5. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, Japan produces ~5x as many shows a year these days, so you might want to take that into account.
>> ARTICLE
Also the fact that (just like movies, books, music 
, etc.) people and generations change - thier interests and perceptions shift, tropes go in and out of fashion. It's fine not to like something classic because it was made by different folks for different folks. Things that transcend that are very rare. Worst case scenario - this shows that the average MAL user is around 20. Maybe even not because there are less older users but because in the past decade or so, popularity of manga/anime in the west has exploded.

More often than not, we just have something very dear to us and we can't accept that stuff we don't like surpass it in quality and popularity. Because we want to think that if something is good, we will like it and by extension - if we like something, it must be good. Thus - recency bias explains that away really well for us.
>> ARTICLE
Also animation quality is going up. I don't really care if you think the older style is more appealing; recent shows have been pushing limits with [backgrounds](http://i.imgur.com/aqnN7Zp.gifv), [foregrounds, and effects](http://i.imgur.com/i5pRxBN.gifv).

The only show that really feels like the old cell animation fits better than digital imo is Trigun. I love the graininess, but new animation is definitely higher quality.
>> ARTICLE
I think there is something missing for very specific types of show, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and especially the absolutely gorgeous Ghost in the Shell movie all benefited from either the grittiness and colouring/shading styles of older animation.

I feel its a similar way to how Noir films benefit from being black and white.

The original is not in the top 100.

That's a shame, the original gets so much flack even though it has better early character development, a better OST, and the better movie. I also like how [](/s "it takes more than 10 people to make a philosopher stone")

There was always certain things that bugged me about the original. I wasn't a fan of how the homunculi were handled, I liked the idea of the villain in the original but I thought Brotherhood's was more interesting, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I love father way more than Dante, but at least there was consequences in the original. Everything seems to convenient in brotherhoods end game. There is also the fact that everyone just kinda watched as greed died. Everyone holds brotherhood way higher than the original when in reality they are pretty balanced in their strengthens and faults, but if you have watched the 2003 previously brotherhood becomes a lot better. Where as the opposite is not true. 
>> ARTICLE
I imagine watching Brotherhood first is a bit like watching DBZ and then going to the older original Dragonball when it wasn't all about the fights.
>> ARTICLE
This is better. Evangelion not being in the top 200 was giving me serious buttpain. Also glad to see Disappearance closer to the #1 position it once upon a time righteously held.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually disgusted by the fact that everyone keeps mentioning evangelion like it's the greatest masterpiece ever and then I look at it's myanimelist rating and I think it is where it should be, similiar about the mentions of madoka magica.

And then there is Hajime no Ippo, a show that is so damn good, yet people won't try it cause there is some "pact" that people don't want to watch sports anime, and only mention of it is when someone asks other good sports anime in a haikyuu!! (great anime though) thread, and it gets mentioned afterwards fucking baby steps...

smh.

Well, NGE is one of the (very, very) few anime i would consider a masterpiece.

Death note to me is Light vs L. That's where the anime ends.
>> ARTICLE
[But](/s "didn't L die in episode 25, not 18?")
>> ARTICLE
L vs Light, not L *with* Light
>> ARTICLE
NGE is either the most impactful anime on art in general or the third msot impactful ever. I mean, we're talking about *an anime* which influenced the *Western film industry* more than a lot of actual Western film masterpieces ffs. NGE is like 100x more important to science fiction than GITS is for any **real** sci-fi fan and sci-fi is a lot bigger than just anime! You seriously have to be like 15 if you don't understand how big of a fucking deal NGE is, when in just anime alone it popularized (didn't originate, necessarily) huge swathes of standard tropes and is at most the second most impactful show for the industry (after the original astroboy ofc).

EDIT: You're like someone who is insulting the position of Diablo 2 as possibly the most influential video game that will ever be produced after, like, the early 80's.
>> ARTICLE
That is of course one way of looking at it. Again, it is a good anime - masterpiece? I don't think so.

By that, I'll put Dragonball and Z as a masterpiece, even though it had it's flaws. I even rate DBZ higher than evangelion  as an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not a masterpiece. If you really can't recognize that it was a masterpiece and one of the most impactful works of anime or science fiction of the 90's, [you've got a serious disease for which there is no cure.](http://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarCHcNNbZRIpsyY/giphy.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Are you serious? How can you say it is even a masterpiece by todays standards when it is rated low compared to other anime... the point stands that its only 8.3 and maybe higher/lower in other forums. I agree with that rating. That rating shouldn't be called a fucking masterpiece.

What does it matter that it was influential in anime. Do you think Survivor (still a great show) is also a masterpiece cause it greatly influenced reality tv shows? 
>> ARTICLE
Um, It's got a low rating because it's actual art and a lot of people can't handle the concept of anime as art, not because it deserves such a shitty low rating. Just take your shit opinions and go troll somewhere else, mate.
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding me? How is my opinion troll? You are the one being ignorant here that you can't understand that people just don't think it's that amazing.what does actual art even mean? Are you some kind of snob who thinks their opinion is better than others?

Well, nothing else to say than I am sorry that you have grown up to have such a big ego.

It is not a masterpiece in my eyes, and according to ratings and comments, a lot of people have the same opinion, so fuck off.

I've just noticed a lot of people who are disgusted by OPM even being on the list. Even if you don't enjoy the action or comedy, it's confusing that people can think it's not objectively a well made anime, even with all the praise it has earned.

We're not saying it's bad it's just not top 7. I think top 15-25.

OPM isn't even my favorite from this year.

There's a difference between bad and not top 10 material.
>> ARTICLE
I think it deserves top 10, there's a reason why it's so well loved and famous.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. You're absolutely correct in that there's a reason it's well loved and famous. It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

/u/icedino said (implied, rather) that OPM isn't top ten material. To be fair, that's his own opinion and he's entitled to it, just as you're entitled to your own. More people than not found it to be top ten material, so by definition it's top ten material, assuming it holds its place in the coming months. It's just not necessarily in EVERYONE'S top ten.
>> ARTICLE
> It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

Also hype. Let's not kid ourselves, there are so many anime series that can be considered better but simply don''t have the amount of mainstream hype OPM does. Hell even in the top 100. Do you think the average mainstream anime fan has heard of LogH or Cross Game? They're still in the top 100 for a good reason. The reason why CG or LoGH don't have a huge anti-movement is *because* it hardly ever gets talked about (respective to huge hypes like SAO/AOT/OPM that is).
>> ARTICLE
I think it's too soon to say whether or not OPM is top 10 *of all time* material. A few seasons from now we'll be able to tell whether it's high rating is because of it's recent hype or because everyone truly believes that it's the 7th best anime of all time.

It's lost like .05 points over the past two weeks.

Dropped from 10 to 11, giving the first season of gintana its spot back.

Recency bias coupled with the fact that it went mainstream is correlated with this, makes complete sense.

I know you're most likely using the term "recency bias" to fuck with me again, but that doesn't apply here *at all.* 

People aren't choosing between two different anime, you're just scoring them separately. You don't have to choose between Cowboy Bebop or Hunter x Hunter for 10/10's, it's not a contest like that. And it's not as if people are saying "Oh wow, this anime just came out in 2015! That makes it automatically better than this 2001 anime." nor is it the case that because recent anime are going to tend to be more popular (OPM is at #91 in popularity anyways) that they'll automatically rank in the top 100 as Ashita no Joe, Ping Pong, and LoGH have proven.

I wonder if OPM didn't get that much hype that it could take a higher spot. I mean before the anime was announced the One Punch Man community was at least average in number but still a little unknown. /r/OnePunchMan didn't even have their own subreddit style and I'm happy just to see a reference out of nowherein reddit. It was one manga that if you read before the adaptation, you couldn't imagine to be animated just because of the art(of the manga).
>> ARTICLE
If they animated it in ONE's style it could have become another Ping Pong :)
>> ARTICLE
Very likely.  People would have regarded it as an underrated gem with the quality of its animation.  Personally, the show was extremely entertaining and interesting from start to finish and I think it deserves all the praise it gets.  It's definitely not a perfect show, but that's not really saying much when talking subjectively.  In another time and place, the detractors of the show could have been its defenders.

The Kyoukai no Kanata entry confused me at first because I knew the series was a lot lower, and it's seem like the few fans that liked the series are the ones who voted high on the film...But with the exception of that (can't find another in a similar case), it seems like a good job with the listing. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for others, but the film is probably higher because it provided a satisfying ending, which the original series was seriously lacking.
>> ARTICLE
When you say you combined series, do you mean you averaged the scores or did you just take the highest ranked entry in the series? It looks like you did the latter, but that can be pretty misleading since later entries in series almost always receive higher scores due to people who disliked the original not bothering to continue.

The list is intended to be relatively useful, not an absolute ranking.  It helps to remove half the list because of duplicates / semi-duplicates.

True, but I think there can be problems with either approach: there are franchises where the first one or more installments are well-received and then things go downhill. Kind of damned if you do and damned if you don't...
>> ARTICLE
I did the latter. I'll probably make another one that averages as well in a week or two. There is a problem with both options though. Due to the rating that MAL ratings work, long running shows like Hunter x Hunter or One Piece only have the ratings of people who have seen most of the show are counted. I'll probably be making more of this with different methods to try and get a more general idea in the future.

So far I'm thinking of making top 100 lists that:

1. Average everything
2. Only includes the initial/first aired season
3. Only includes the most recent season

>> ARTICLE
Oh, I didn't know that long runners only counted ratings from people who've watched most of the show. No wonder so many of them end so on high on MAL. That'd complicate this kind of ranking even more.
>> ARTICLE
1/100

Do I have bad taste? No.. No. It's everyone else who's wrong.
>> ARTICLE
If I ~~have enough time~~ stop being lazy I could make one which takes the averages of each entry and its sequels/whatevers.
>> ARTICLE
I would like so much a list of these but only counting TV Series with 12 episodes or more. (Not counting, specials, movies, etc)
>> ARTICLE
Wow, is FMA:B really that good? Why have I delayed watching it for so long???
>> ARTICLE
What I really enjoyed, is that it's a longer show that really pays off in the end (character development etc...). And its a pretty wild journey (I knew nothing going into the show).
>> ARTICLE
All anime is subjective just like movies and any other medium.  Honestly, I found it to be good, but not amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was a gateway anime for many, so that could be a factor. To me it just seemed like an above-average shounen battle show, but I don't generally enjoy that genre so I didn't care for it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely wasn't a gateway series for me, but I'm a huge fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I felt FMA:B to be equally good, or better. I wouldn't call it a battle shounen, but I would call it a family adventure show. Pretty much just Avatar.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's harder to accept mediocre shows being so highly rated or great shows barely making the list.
>> ARTICLE
from the top 100 any romance/harem  in there?
>> ARTICLE
Ouran High School Host Club is the only harem anime in there.

Romance has a lot. Clannad:After Story, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Ruroni Kenshin, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, the Monogatari Series, Bakuman, Howl's Moving Castle, Kara no Kyoukai, Hotarubi no Mori e, The Tatami Galxy, Major, Nana, Cross Game, Nodame Cantabile, Romeo no Aoi Sora, Sakamachi no Apollon, The Girl who Leapt through Time, Toradora, Spice and Wolf, Tsubasa, Ouran High School Host Club, Sakurasou, Rose of Versailles, Welcome to the NHK, and Honey and Clover.
>> ARTICLE
thanks for that, ,gonna check them 
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is also a harem, even if mal doesnt say so (at least by defenition).
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari and Clannad (first season) are technically harem anime, they just aren't labelled as such by MAL for whatever reason.
>> ARTICLE
You missed Kyoukai no Kanata in your list - very strong romance subplot in that one, overwhelming the action/youmu stuff really.

>  Ruroni Kenshin

Is that really considered a "Romance"?  I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a *small* subplot IIRC.  Though I only watched through the Shishio arc so dunno if it gets more emphasis later on, but from what I recall the romance aspect wasn't much stronger than Naruto's.

Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance, but I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series since they are 1000% different in just about everything.
>> ARTICLE
> Is that really considered a "Romance"? I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a small subplot IIRC.

Nope it is not, RK cannot be considered a romance anime. It might involve romance in it (which it doesn't really btw but that's another topic) but RK is not a "romance anime" as the focus is completely different.

> Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance
It had more but even then it is still minimal considering the story in general. The things it focuses on is much more different. 

> I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series

OP made some huge mistakes in the list. Some shows still have more than one entry with different adaptations and movies like Fate/s Evangelion but made some omitting with others. I understand that he merged 3 seasons of the Gintama and Benizakura movie was a recap but why add Final Chapter as well. RK suffers from this the most because the movies and the original series are too far away from each other many people wouldn't believe they are the parts of the same series. '96 TV series of Rurouni Kenshin and Star Wars are more similar to each other than   original series and Trust&Betrayal OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
Mind you, Ouran is a reverse harem. A great one, and really funny, but the MC is still a girl, which will probably put some people off.
>> ARTICLE
Ouran is like one of the best comedy anime I've ever seen. it's very good to pass the time and be relaxed while laughing your ass off
>> ARTICLE
In case anyone is reading this, hasn't seen it, and thinks they might be put off by the reverse harem bit: try it anyway. Please. It's a good fucking show.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I greatly enjoyed both the manga and anime, like I said it's great, but some people will(sadly) be put off by the fact that it's a reverse harem, even though it's nothing like say Diabolik lovers or Dance with Devils. I can recommend it to everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Great effort, thanks! 

Have watched about half of the list.
>> ARTICLE
47/100
i need to watch more high rated shows.
>> ARTICLE
What's interesting about a consolidated lost like this is that the upward push of Eva 2.22 (which was highly received by fans) carried all the Rebuilds 47 spots ahead of the original series.

Obviously the original show is > than the Rebuilds but it's interesting to see how a superior movie/episode in a set of OVAs can influence the whole.

Anyway--great job on the list, OP this helps me know more of a real top 100 I can pick and watch from!
>> ARTICLE
Well that's because the OP just congregates EVERY spinoff and sequels and prequels while compiling the list. He did NOT average scores. As someone else said, franchises with multiple seasons that people would have dropped cause they didn't like the first ones are bound NOT TO watch and berate the latter ones. That's how you get Aria who's only got one really high rated season (Origination) while the rest were 8/10 or lower. That makes this list a bit misleading.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Haikyuu at 12
>> ARTICLE
I love haikyuu too! Though I believe it will drop just a bit and Hajime no Ippo (my favorite sport anime) will surpass it!
>> ARTICLE
I'm still stunned DBZ isn't on here. 
>> ARTICLE
I need to stop looking at these lists. I disagree with so much of it. ;__;
>> ARTICLE
This gives more of a insight about a franchise's popularity, thanks for the list OP!

I've seen like 10 of those, lmao. I've got only about other 15 on my PTW too. TIL I'm an anime hipster I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Well, there are so many more shows I like outside of top100 than within it. Polarizing shows are not neccessarily bad, but get mediocre scoring by definition. Long-running shows also have a higher scores because only fans stick to watching it. And just as newer shows start off with high ratings, that decay over time, really old shows are rated higher than they are worth because of nostalgia. I would most definitely rate DBZ higher than if I would watch it now for the first time. I think most people don't really take the top100 seriously.
>> ARTICLE
34/100. It's sad to look at this and realize some amazing anime aren't on the list while some really bad ones are. A good example would be that Haibane Renmei is not on the list while it's much inferior rip-off, Angel Beats is...

It also lacks Berserk, the original FMA, GiTS movie, Princess Tutu...
>> ARTICLE
Recency bias :D.  And demographic bias ...
>> ARTICLE
How is angel beats a rip off or Haibane renmei? They are completely diffirent and the only thing they have in common is a story being about dead people.
>> ARTICLE
35 finished.
5 dropped.

And seeing Shigatsu in Top 10 hurts more then anything.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked shigatsu. in my mind it deserves its spot in the top 10 way more than one punch man, which I dropped after 5 episodes. however I can see how people like it and even though I dont think it deserves to be that high, I understand that it is there.
in the end it just comes down to taste :/
>> ARTICLE
I thought Berserk would be there... it's better than some in this list. Both the anime series and the third movie.

It's almost like other people have different tastes than you or something.

The anime is basically a generic action shounen, but it is *very good* for an action shounen, comparatively.  The pacing, action, characters are all fairly tight.  I'd rate it among the top 5 generic action shounen quite easily.

34/100. I dropped about an additional 5 shows from this list on top of that though.
A lot of these titles feel very over inflated with their list placement due to sheer popularity. Your Lie in April seems like the most overrated anime of the past few years to me; it wasn't bad though. I'm happy OPM is pretty high on the list. I don't know if it deserves top 10 but it's definitely had an impact on the anime medium. Probably for the better.

Why can't we do that? I mean when I want to put a series in my PTW, it would be cool to like put the whole series in it, not just the first season, everything, OVAs, films, extra episodes everything, together with an watch order if possible. It would be a whole lot simplier to sort through my list of 4 different fate seasons/films/OVAs or whatever, not to mention you don't miss an OVA or film when you were looking for an series to watch because you didn't see the others adaptions/sequels tab in the info page.

for the curious, check out legend of the galactic heroes. it's a very good scifi anime. it's dialogue heavy with a lot of political intrigue, but there's enough action to satisfy. if i were to compare it to a live action show, i'd say it's like a grittier battlestar galactica.

>> ARTICLE
"6- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (1988)"

Any advice about this anime? is it worth? is it better than newer shows? or maybe its just more nostalgic points.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very talky space opera. It's by no means perfect: the animation is often quite limited and sometimes error prone (both problems are most common near the show's beginning), for example, and the animation and direction don't always convey the scale and details of the battles that well. And leaving aside actual problems, it's not something which everyone would enjoy watching. As I said, it's talkative, plus it's very sincere and not terribly interested in being hard science fiction.

That said... if you do have any appreciation at all for space operas, or dialogue-driven political/military stories, it's worth a shot because it is very satisfying to watch. It's unique in anime for the size of its cast and kind of unique for the ambition of its storythere are longer anime, but there aren't many which can do 110 episodes of continuous epic narrative with no filler. It's pleasingly capacious in its ideas: it doesn't necessarily get very incisive about any one ideology or behaviour but it includes so many ideas and arguments and incidents. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is certainly 'better than newer shows' in the sense that nothing since has done, or has even really been able to attempt to do, the kinds of things that it does.

So I'd say it's worth giving it a try if it interests you, though you shouldn't feel obliged to watch it and if you do try it and dislike it that's fine.

> nostalgic points

This is unlikely, because the show was only made widely available with an English translation in the mid to late 2000s. I'd bet that a substantial majority of the people on MAL who've seen it saw it within the last decade. From my memory it was almost unknown among English-speaking fans until 2007 or 2008, when it gradually took off.

There is a clear(and unsurprising to me) recency bias. It also seems several genres are more in the list than others, i.e. shonen, romance, supernatural and action, whereas harem seems underpresented(Monogatari and Ouran?). Theres also a distinct lack of cute girls doing cute things - anime

Great work OP

> It also seems several genres are more in the list than others

Demographic bias.


>> ARTICLE
fucking Katekyo Hitman Reborn? seriously? jesus people, i don't really like some of this show but i get why they're so popular, but reborn? that's just wrong, it had a good premise and the first couple arc were good, but after that it became just complete trash, its one of the most generic, repetitive, stereotyped, poorly written shonen i've ever seen

i just don't get it


>> ARTICLE
Well you obviously won't agree but what I loved about it was that it was just a fun show. The characters were fun, the action was fun, the plot was fun, etc. Characters like Gokudera, Lambo, Hibari, Squalo...they really did do a great job of making them feel like a family. I started to love the characters so much that I didn't even mind the "daily life" episodes and began to miss them a bit

Plus it was amazingly creative. Small touches like the ten-year bazooka added so much flavor to the show for me. Not to mention the abilities that each character had and some of the really spectacular fight scenes (Yamamoto vs Squalo, Gokudera vs Gamma, Hibari vs Genkishi, Tsuna vs Xanxus, etc)

I won't deny that the show has more than its fair share of problems (sexism, Tsuna constantly realizing his resolve comes from protecting his friends, filler arcs) but it is pretty special to me 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm ... KHR was pretty generic as a shounen but it went beyond generic a bit with the expansion of its scope through the middle of the series.  So, I felt it "ramped up" then stayed in good, high gear all the way until the very end where they rushed the last few episodes pretty hard.

At the end of the day it still remains a "shounen+" to me, so nothing super outstanding, but I rate is as definitely a step above average and "100"th place isn't really overrating it, IMO.

Only completed 25/100

6/100 dropped because of too much episode (and already read manga) (FMA, Gintama, One Piece, Chihayafuru, Monster, Hunter X Hunter)

12/100 Dropped because no enjoyment and bored when watching, some of it I just skipped to read the ending (Steins Gate, Shigatsu, Ping pong, Jojo, Kuroko, Noragami, Fate UBM, Shirobako, Toradora, Katanagatari, Bakuman, Psycho Pass)
>> ARTICLE
I can understand dropping shows when they're too long or you've already watched the manga... But just skipping to the end of shows is strange.

Because people says its has good story, but I'm not enjoy while watching it, so I ended up reading how it was ended to see what happen in the plot.. You didn't waste time on something you didn't enjoy right? :D

I've never been interested in watching sports anime but Cross Game was indeed a welcome surprise.  I think what I like the most is the breaking of cliches throughout the series.  

The guy who you expect to be the heated rival throughout the show ends up just being a friend and trusted teammate, games that you expect to be neck and neck until the last minute end up being a fairly easy win, or end in a loss, etc.

Plus the OP is pretty damn catchy.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite anime of all time for many reasons. 

I went into this show knowing nothing about it aside from having already read a few of Adachi's works, and I was BLOWN AWAY by episode 1. I was NOT expecting it to go in the direction it did with the character circumstances.

This song used as an insert in episode 1 will always be burned in my brain. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Utm-7voQjc
>> ARTICLE
I have to check my facts but I think the first volume (manga) won a bunch of awards. I got hook because of that first episode it's so intense just putting myself in Ko's shoes felt so emotional and I'm not an emotional person
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree. Cross Game is one of my favorites. Doesn't get much recognition but it is truly a great story, slice of life. I think anyone would enjoy it even if they don't like baseball.

Enjoy the rest of the series. It only gets better.
>> ARTICLE
Cross game is one of my favourites. I always recommend it to people since it tends to get overlooked. The first episode always catches people of guard. The story does great job of progressing each character in bot subtle and overt ways. Definitely one of those shows where you can watch second time and understand something new about the characters.

I really enjoy all of Adachi's work. Even with similar feel all of them have, each of his stories have a uniqueness about them because of the way the characters are developed.
>> ARTICLE
the first episode already told me i HAD to watch it fully. no anime gets me that emotional on the first episode.....
>> ARTICLE
i teared up at the ending of the 1st episode. This is after about a year since I first saw the series and decided to rewatch it.
>> ARTICLE
Be sure to check out the other anime out there based on [Adachi's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsuru_Adachi#Adaptations) work. One of the best writers out there. 

Cross Game was super enjoyable, definitely one of the better sports anime out there. You might also enjoy Ookuki furibatte, another great character driven baseball anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I love everything Adachi Mitsuru! Though a lot of the shows have the same feel, it doesn't subtract from some of the great characters he's able to create. After coming from watching H2 and Miyuki, Cross Game just continued the trend of greatness. I'm glad a lot of other people enjoy this series as well.
>> ARTICLE
I've only read the manga, which is great. The ending felt really appropriate considering the characters. At some point I do want to get around to watching the anime adaption. Also, I think the first episode covers the entire first volume of the manga.

Also, the guy who wrote Cross Game is the same guy who wrote Touch
>> ARTICLE
A lot of Adachi Mitsuru's stuff feel the same. It's not that they're bad per say, just similar. Someone I know recommended it to me, and just by knowing it was about baseball, I managed to guess how it ended.

I agree, they are all pretty similar. That doesn't make any of them bad thou.

Yea it's wonderfully goofy and very enjoyable.  While it was still on Netflix, I found myself watching an episode after particularly heavy episodes of Game of Thrones to sooth my mind.

There's one character who usually wears a bulky costume and turns out to be a pretty young woman. She is rarely seen in swimwear but it's not something to roll your eyes. I think she's the daughter of the rival restaurant's owner. 
>> ARTICLE
The other characters wears swimwear too sometimes.  A bathing suit/bikini isn't automatically "fanservice" if the characters are just wearing them.  Close-up shots of boobs/asses in swimwear or "anime-falls" and other stuff like that is, and this show has none of that.

It's really funny and cute.

Best guess, on how much staying power does Splatoon have?

At the very least, it can survive for the rest of this month.

I don't know if it can survive until August/Whenever the mysterious update is, however. I sure as hell am enjoying the game so far though.
>> ARTICLE
It already got a small update adding Splat Zones in Ranked, the N-Zap '85 weapon, and a new map called Port Mackerel. I expect this will happen fairly often with at least 8 more DLC maps (shown in the direct), as well as several additional weapons planned for release somewhere down the line.

I'm hoping it doesn't go the way of titanfall.

20 million years from now, the only reason anyone will remember Earth is as "that planet that created Splatoon".

It really depends on how well Nintendo supports it.

Mechanically the game is brilliant, I can play it for hours and never feel like the core gameplay gets dull. But there's not enough different multiplayer modes or singleplayer content to justify the $60 price tag just yet, but Nintendo has said they're going to be releasing free content for the game so we'll see if it gets more variety.
>> ARTICLE
It really cost $60 in the US? Its only 30 brand new here in the UK which i think even tho there is a lag of modes the price point is fine, as most games these days are 55. 
>> ARTICLE
> as most games these days are 55.

If you're paying 55 for a game, you're doing it very, very wrong. You shouldn't be paying more than 45.

Um dude standard price for a console game in the uk is anywhere between 45 to 55, depending on the game ofcourse. Most AAA try and run for 50 in most retail stores.

The most I've paid for a game recently is 48 for Bloodborne, from Tesco, because I really wanted it there and then and didn't want to wait for online postage. You can EASILY get a new game for <45 if you shop around.

Yea most supermarkets like Asda and Tesco are fine, sell new releases at around 45, same with online retailers like Zavvi and Amazon. Anyway my original point still stands, $60 for Splatoon in the US seems overpriced to me.

Americans are already getting matched up with Japanese (not very often) which shows that the birth of the playerbase is very fucking slow, it will die off but only in 1-2 years. Jeroz said the staying power is plenty, when it won't even come close to CoD2 or 4

What are you talking about? Being paired up with other countries has nothing to do with playerbase, otherwise Ultra Street Fighter 4 wouldn't still be going strong internationally.

Usf4 is going strong because its a competitive fighter with a recognizable brand name, its online has been criticized heavily for shitty online code. Do you know what ping is? There's a reason LoL/Dota/CS don't do NA vs EU tourneys online
>> ARTICLE
There's no need to be condescending, I know what ping is. Let's face the facts, though. CoD, Battlefield, CS, and Halo  all have poor sales figures in Japan. Splatoon has taken off over there, so there's going to be more international players online. Ping also doesn't just have to do with distance, netcode does nothing for a poor connection regardless of region.

More to the point, though. Ping still has nothing to do with how many people are playing in a given country. Splatoon fills up lobbies by finding people with decent connections that are waiting for a match, and pairs them up regardless of region. This does cause communication errors from time-to-time (not often) for the reasons you stated, but that's all the more reason that your hypothesis is flawed. Splatoon's netcode is...quirky. It functions pretty well, yet has some weird flaws that can frustrate players. For this reason, the actual playerbase is difficult to determine.

Am I explaining this ok? Does this make sense?
>> ARTICLE
Sure, but you can be less popular than God yet still be fairly popular yourself. I mean, there are more folks playing WoW than CS after all.

Every time wow has a significant playerbase drop, they release a new expansion, so wow is a bad example, also the game is dangerously addictive (which is why the game has more players) to the point it has ruined lives, don't compare it to shooters

**Yamato 2199**

I'm going to talk about this show at every opportunity that I can. This show is just that excellently crafted.

When I finished watching this series, it actually felt crushing. It was like the end of a great adventure. I don't know how, but this series made me feel like I was there with the characters, traveling on a starship to save the Earth. I understood their motivations, and I cared deeply about their struggles, failings, and triumphs. 

I don't know how else to describe what I mean by an "adventure" but I believe that you guys all have had seen such a show at one point. It is the sense of journey, and loss. 

The ending was fantastic, and wrapped everything up tremendously well. If you guys have seen Top wo Nerae Gunbuster, it was that kind of a beautiful ending. 


>> ARTICLE
I remember I once watched Japanese live-action movie which was adaptation of older series. If you also watched this, can you compare the two? 

I didn't like the film at all, but from what I remember mainly because of two reasons - plot was convoluted and acting ridiculous. Anime tv series probably doesn't share these flaws.
>> ARTICLE
Oh the live action is completely different. I didnt like it much either. 

The movie plot is also heavily, heavily modified whereas 2199 is a faithful remake of the original space battleship yamato. I dont remember too much from the movie anymore as it was really forgetable, but i can pretty much tell you about every episode of 2199. No matter where you lean on the spectrum of story, animation, characters, etc i know you wont be disappointed. Please check it out for yourself and let me know what you think!
>> ARTICLE
The story is too epic to be told in a single film. 
>> ARTICLE
Partly disagree. The original was turned into an anime movie [back in 1977](http://myanimelist.net/anime/711/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato_%28Movie%29), and they did a very serviceable job at condensing the story into a 140-minute running time.
>> ARTICLE
The original also was one of the earliest anime to be broadcast in North America in English. I loved it (Star Blazers) as a kid. Of course, I didn't know it was an anime until much later.
>> ARTICLE
I actually didn't get the chance to watch Star Blazers as a kid. Robotech, Voltron, and Battle of the Planets? Absolutely. 

Unfortunately, my local stations didn't run Star Blazers. So I missed out on that one until I got into college where one of my roommates had the Yamato movie on laser disc. Mind = blown before it was even a meme.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately, the Star Blazers DVDs are now extremely expensive. But, 2199 is a very good update of the original story.
>> ARTICLE
I just started this series a few days ago and it has been simply fantastic. It's really been a while since I got impressed by a new anime and this is the first series, which has the potential to rise to one of my favorite anime since years.
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, glad this is the top comment because this is an anime I am really looking forward to after I watch FLCL and FMA Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
So everyone who knows anything about anime is aware of the fact the original [Space Battleship Yamato](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1650/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato) is one of the most influential anime titles in history. But given how dated it is, not a lot of people get around to watching it. I think the best part of Yamato 2199 is that it does a good job of remaking a classic by modern standards, without losing that slightly goofy 70's sci-fi feel that the original has. It really surprised me to see so few people have bothered with the remake.
>> ARTICLE
It really surprises me too. Space Battleship Yamato is so popular in Japan, and its remake is one of the best remakes I have ever seen.

> No [Cross Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5941/Cross_Game)

*cries*

I'm too lazy right now to check the formula for Cross Game but it's gotta be like number 11 or something. Nice work though! I'll definitely check these out.

Edit: grammar fix.
>> ARTICLE
It's just another *sports anime* DansGame
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so is Cross Game any good? Someone suggested it to me a while back but I've also heard people say its not that great and I don't really want to watch it for 50 episodes if its not worth it or has a half-assed ending.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game is really, really good. It didn't sound like my sort of thing at all, but someone challenged me to watch it, and I loved it. It hooked me very quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone else says it's great, but for me, it was the kind of show where I started off loving it, but ending up quite disliking it and dropping it. The show became tedious to watch as it did stuff like make no plot progression in 3 episodes, and stringing along the romance aspect of the show with a painful lack of progress.

I'll say this though: if it was just about baseball, I would of quite enjoyed it. It dealt with the sports aspect of the show very well.
>> ARTICLE
> stringing along the romance aspect of the show with a painful lack of progress.

I think to come to that opinion you would have to choose to actively deny why it was so "strung out". [](/s "The show even refrains the reasons pretty frequently. It's not some drawn out excuse but a valid weight hanging over both of them constantly. Her last words. Her last wishes. His lingering feelings. Despite that, they still do have progress. Slow, painful, but very noticeable progress. It's what makes the victory of them getting to the point where they can start to move beyond the ghosts of the past so powerful.")
>> ARTICLE
You do have a point. I still feel that it was strung out though.

It may have had the factor of [](/s "the lingering memory of someone who passed away"), but outside of that, it pulled a lot of the same romance anime tropes I've seen time and time again. The misunderstandings. The interruptions during possible points of progress. The returning back to square one.

I wouldn't mind the lack of progress if it was just what you said. Sadly though, it seemed to create situations again and again in a way that wouldn't reach progress. So rather that it being the [](/s "characters' minds stopping them from loving each other, it was the writers.")

[](/s "In the end, I just didn't like it. It felt to me like the whole dead person idea was an excuse for the writers to add easy filler to their show re-labelled as "psychological character development". I'm no critic, so it could have the makings of a masterpiece for all I know, but it was just not enjoyable for me.")
>> ARTICLE
Someone already gave you an answer, but I thought I'd throw my two cents in too: yes, it is. The WT! linked to by OP here summarizes why pretty well; extremely balanced pacing, character development for everyone, a refreshing art style, and plenty of appropriate drama. After reading the MAL summary and watching only the first episode, if you're not intrigued and interested in continuing the series, maybe it's not for you. But I genuinely believe it's a worthwhile watch for anyone and the ending is definitely **not** half-assed.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's one of the best character stories I've ever seen of anything. It genuinely understands people in a way that so many series can only dream of doing. Watch the first episode, and all of a sudden 50 episodes will go by faster than most 12 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, you've convinced me to try it out.
>> ARTICLE
Just watch at least the first episode. If you are not convinced it can tell good story which just happens to revolve around sports I am very surprised.
>> ARTICLE
that's extremely funny, because yes, Cross Game indeed is no. 11 

I kid you not. Maybe I'll expand this list.

EDIT: Actually in top 20 there are two another **baseball** shows: Major and Touch, respectively 16th and 15th. In first draft of my post I even mentioned that it's quite bizarre that baseball sports anime are so well-received.
>> ARTICLE
Baseball is japan's favorite sport
>> ARTICLE
>it's quite bizarre that baseball sports anime are so well-received.

I think the reason for that is twofold;

1- Sports anime, much like real sports, tend to attract quite rabid fans.

2- As many sports anime are quite long the people who stick with them till the end are the ones most likely to rate them highly. 

Combine those two points and you end up with super high scores. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok, but why specifically baseball? 

and your second point doesn't address Major - the anime is split by MAL into six seasons - yes, season 5 is ranked #58 but season 1 alone is still ranked #118. 
>> ARTICLE
Because baseball has quite localized popularity for a multitude of reasons.

Most of Europe has only the most rudimentary understanding of baseball. I have read Cross Game and read/watched One Outs and they are the only two baseball manga/anime that have interested me and I still don't understand the rules.

As such, usually only people who care about baseball watch baseball anime, which in turn means there is a higher consideration level before watching and less of "hey, what the hell, I'll try this" which results in much higher than average ratings. Similarly, length - most sports anime is quite long and the casual anime viewers/manga readers are more interested in shorter stuff as well as are much more fickle about their ratings. Long time weeaboos with a lot of time on their hands are much more likely to be "was this not absolutely terrible? 8-9/10".
>> ARTICLE
> Long time weeaboos with a lot of time on their hands are much more likely to be "was this not absolutely terrible? 8-9/10".

From my own experience it's pretty much the other way around. I believe that pretty much the only people who are OCD enough to care whether their ratings are spread out or not are the ones who spend excessive amounts of time watching anime.
>> ARTICLE
It's a phenomenon that is seen not only in anime. 

People who don't have much time (or more often - think they don't have much time) are used to being more critical about what they watch. It is more likely the more time you spend on a type of media, the more you judge things based on enjoyment instead. At that point unless it conflicts with your personal biases you vote things quite highly. A part of it is also the "i've seen some weird shit" mentality - once you are used to all the shenanigans and tropes a hundred times, you stop being anal about them (being opposite is more rare because it more or less forces you to abandon the medium). Lastly people who enjoy shorter shows and clock less hours are also more likely to judge things based on a single scale rather than see different genres for what they are. This also can streamline ratings more.

The main reason why there is an illusion of the opposite is because of the vocal minority of hardcore fans - they do fall under all of the opposites of what I mentioned, which makes them very hungry for "that one good anime", which when they get, they elevate to godhood and make out everything else to be shit. Sometimes, like recently there's even two such series. 

Also there are a few people who started watching anime when it got popular in the west and adamantly hold on to the few better above average series of that time as legendary. As long time veterans they are not shy at the least to express their opinions.

Not that what I said applies to everyone. As a seasoned weeaboo myself, I fall into some categories and complete opposite in others.
>> ARTICLE
there's shitloads of baseball anime, more than any other sports anime. off the top of my head: ookiku furikabutte, major, touch, cross game, ace of diamonds, h2, one outs...most of them are pretty good. not only that but baseball is really popular in japan and in the US.
>> ARTICLE
Well, like I said,

> I think

I also never said it was anything specific to baseball, you can see that a lot of multi cour sports shows have very high ratings. Even something relatively short, like Major, is still 6 months/8 hours worth of anime and it's unlikely that anyone not inherently interested in sports is going to keep up with the show. 
>> ARTICLE
Well I could offer a different suggestion versus there just being more baseball anime... baseball is a very disjointed sport. It's not fluid in the way other sports, especially soccer and basketball, are. That means it's easier to have individual confrontations for narrative purposes that still capture the spirit of the game (Cross Game was great at this).  Also, the confrontations are kind of cool in that technically they can keep going, i.e. a batter can stay at a full count for 10+ balls, which allows for good suspense.
>> ARTICLE
Baseball is really popular in Japan so there's a ton of baseball anime. Major, Cross Game, and Touch are some of the best of those and so all of them are pretty big series in the sports genre. Touch is also old so that always lower popularity.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't Japan kind of hot for baseball too?
>> ARTICLE
They are, but I doubt many Japanese fans use MAL. 
>> ARTICLE
True. I just figured that their relative popularity in Japan might influence the high ratings on MAL here, and that more effort was put into them when due to the interest in baseball there.
>> ARTICLE
Baseball is among the top 3 most popular sports in North America as well. Right among Ice Hockey and American Football.
>> ARTICLE
Despite Canada's size of 32 million people, I'm pretty sure basketball is #3 in North America in popularity, not ice hockey. The NBA is far more lucrative than the NHL and nets far higher TV ratings on the whole, and college basketball rivals college football in terms of popularity in the US, while college hockey and even junior hockey barely register on the national radar.

Then again, I'm pretty sure soccer is Mexico's most popular sport, so it might still be soccer instead of basketball at #3 for all of North America (since, despite being #5 in the US, it's not in a terrible position). Baseball and American Football are definitely #2 and #1, respectively, though.
>> ARTICLE
Really? Source? I'm not sure whether or not Canada isn't a humongous fan of baseball (I would assume not, but you never know) but I do know for sure that baseball definitely isn't top 3 most popular sports in the U.S. Soccer, basketball, and football definitely trump baseball in terms of popularity in the U.S. Canada and the U.S. are by far the largest countries in North America so I'm going to assume what Mexico and other countries enjoy don't have enough fans to justify baseball being at the top 3.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure where you got the idea that soccer is more popular than baseball in the US, but I can assure you it's not. It doesn't even come close. There's a reason baseball is named *America's National Passtime*. There's so many sources I could link, you're better off just googling "most popular sports in America", but for your convenience: according to the [Harris Poll](http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/mid/1508/ArticleId/1546/Default.aspx) annual inquiry about sports popularity in the US, Baseball is #2 in popularity, and has been since the poll was first taken thirty years ago.

I can't find a sufficiently reliable statistic about Baseball's popularity as a spectator sport in Canada, but I did find this admittedly dated graph about [active participation rates of sports](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/81-595-m/2008060/t-c-g/c-g9-eng.htm) in Canada. According to other sources, Baseball is the sixth most popular sport in Canada, which I'm inclined to believe.

In Mexico, baseball is the most popular sport in the Northwest regions of the country, where as futbal enjoys primary popularity in the rest of the country with baseball being in the top 5.

In Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, baseball is by far the most popular sport

Cross Game is really good. Touch is by the same author and was hugely influential in Japan when it aired.

So I think it's more coincidental than anything. Three really good shows were made, but many people avoided them because they featured baseball.
>> ARTICLE
I think another thing to add with Cross Game is that it isn't just about baseball. It has a lot of drama and romance and highlights the characters when they are not playing baseball a lot more than other sports anime. It's a really refreshing blend
>> ARTICLE
That's hilarious! Very unsurprising, though. And yeah, I've heard great things about Major and am currently watching Touch, so those are pretty unsurprising, too. I'd agree with some other people below who said baseball anime are probably so well-received due to 1) baseball's popularity ~~in Japan~~ compared to other sports and 2) sports anime frequently being longer or multi-cour/season. I don't think sports anime really attract "rabid" fans any more than any other genre, though; I'm not a sports fan at all in real life, but sports anime usually have a way of drawing me in anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Don't let the childish look of the **Kemono no Souja Erin** fool you. It has a lot to offer including one of the best developed heroines in anime. I put it off for a long time because of the look of the art on the MAL page but I was just being an idiot.

Admittedly though the first few episodes are somewhat slow and sometimes there are moments/characters that are kind of silly but I don't think those things really take away from it that much.
>> ARTICLE
As a Kaiba, Ping Pong and Shin Chan fan, no art style will ever stop me.
>> ARTICLE
It's one of my favourite, if not my favourite anime. But you're completely right about the looks. I actually recommended it to someone just today and their first reaction was "it looks so bad". If only they would look further than that, it's so worth it. Every person i know that has seen it (which arent that many unfortunately) thinks it's an amazing anime.
>> ARTICLE
This was the third anime I watched (that k recognized as anime), and the first I watched in subtitles.

I most definitely say that it was worth watching. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think LoTGH and Ping Pong are overlooked.
>> ARTICLE
They deserve much more attention then they get though....

>> ARTICLE
Both are spoken of highly and occasionally on this subreddit, but outside of here they're very overlooked. 
>> ARTICLE
Whats interesting is OP defined "overlooked" by a formula which was applied to MAL and spat this stuff out. So its not so much what is thought to be overlooked, but what, by this definition, came up.
>> ARTICLE
You *think* that they are not overlooked, because probably you heard about them a lot. On the other hand we have data which show that they are insanely highly rated and much less popular then over seven hundred other shows, including such masterpieces as Highschool of the Dead, Deadmen Wonderland, Infinite Stratos, KissxSis or Rosario to Vampire. I'm not sure what you are contesting 
>> ARTICLE
I really would wish more of these lists would be made though that included anime only after like  2005 or so, and with 26 (MAYBE 50) or less episodes.

Part of the reason some of these shows aren't watched much is simply because the animation is VERY old compared to newer shows like Fate/ Zero or Monogatari, and many of the others have over 26 episodes (the usual mount for a double cour anime.)

Getting invested in a show with 110 episodes, especially one with much older animation is just not something people are going to want to do. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey....  don't you badmouth Highschool of the Dead 
>> ARTICLE
I don't personally. Ratings do :)

Not on the subreddit maybe, but across anime fans in general? Definitely.
>> ARTICLE
I think LotGH is one of those eternally PTW'd shows for a lot of people. Something people want to see (or at the very least want to have seen) but takes a lot of willpower to start because of its length. Personally, now that its been licensed, I'm just waiting for the stateside Blu-Rays.
>> ARTICLE
Wait wait wait wait wait? LoGH has been licenced? Any chance for a dub? I really want to watch this show, but I've got bad vision and really can't read 110 episodes of subtitles. 
>> ARTICLE
The good news is that the subtitles are actually really easy to read. I'm starting to get a little vision problem over here as well (actually had to increase the font size on my e-reader last week), and the subs I'm watching have stood out wonderfully without being a distraction from the events on the screen.
>> ARTICLE
I ended up getting glasses purely because I noticed I was having trouble reading anime subtitles.  
>> ARTICLE
Glasses won't help certain people. I have learned to still enjoy a show even with excessive spacebar usage, however.
>> ARTICLE
Is it because they're too small?
>> ARTICLE
You mean the fonts? No, they are big enough, but, since my vision is variably blurry, I usually have to concentrate my vision before I understand what's written.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that makes sense. Thanks for answering!
>> ARTICLE
>Any chance for a dub?

next to 0 chance.
>> ARTICLE
It has 110 episodes. There are hundreds of characters. It has niche appeal. It will never be dubbed.
>> ARTICLE
It's 110 episodes of just the mains series to dub, and it's not popular enough to actually sell enough for that to be profitable. Not to mention that it's animation is very old, which will turn *even more* people off of it. I know a ton of people who avoid retro shows for that very reason.

Sorry for crushing your hopes. There might be a small chance, though. You could watch an episode a week maybe. It's a slow-burn show that takes place  over multiple years, so it won't affect your watch that much. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry about crushing my hopes, I've come to terms with the fact that a lot of older shows like this or the Arias aren't going to be easy to watch.  An episode a weak is about 2 years worth of watching so I should probably get started. 
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty much was it was for me, I had it in my library nearly a good 4 years before I finally sat down and said "ok lets try breaking into this".  I'm pretty sure I watched the entire first season that night.  I was initially worried that I would be too spoiled on current day animation but it didn't end up being a problem at all.  The story and the characters are amazing to watch and grow with as the show progress.

I went though the 110esp and ova/movies in prob about a month.
>> ARTICLE
The barrier of entry is also threefold. Having never been licensed outside of Japan there's no chance of stumbling upon it. Also, being so old at this point is a natural barrier to viewers. Lastly, it is not an FMA type show; LOTGH specifically appeals to people who like sci-fi, and LOVE military/politics shows that go knee deep in political theory.
>> ARTICLE
That's a good point! 

It's actually not that bad, though - if anyone reading this hasn't watched LotGH yet, you don't have to do the entire thing in one sitting! There are 4 pretty distinct story arcs that are 24-32 episodes long (i.e. the length of your average anime season) so it's perfectly reasonable to watch an arc, take a break, then watch another etc. 

Dunno, at least this has been working for me - the 110 episodes seem a lot less intimidating if I think of them as 4 seasons instead of one massive... thing.

my point is there no official upload and there is no official version with english subtitles. and for the old series I doubt there ever will be, so why would you just prevent your self from seeing one of the best series of all time. Just watch it and support all this relicensed stuff that is about to come, If there was a way to buy LOGH and give money to the people who made it I definitely would but sadly there isn't yet.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that sums it up pretty well. Many people know if it but how many have actually watched it?
>> ARTICLE
I did and god was it a good decision.
>> ARTICLE
The /r/anime rewatch of the series is wrapping up this week, having started over three months ago. So, going by comment numbers, at least 20 new full-watchers added to the list!
>> ARTICLE
> Internet claims that it's an oldschool comedy series which once had significant cult following in Saudi Arabia, Greece and Cyprus, partly because of hilarious dub

Wait what?
>> ARTICLE
Hmm hilarious dub? Must be a Ghost Stories vibe.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, I meant Greek dub and it obviously applies only to Greece and Cyprus. Why it was popular in Saudi Arabia, I have no idea.
>> ARTICLE
Wikipedia also says that the Arabic dub had problems (such as replacing the voice actors of characters mid-season).
>> ARTICLE
I was confused how an anime got a cult following and how that makes it dangerous to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I was just not very convinced to watch it after reading [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igano_Kabamaru#Reception)
>> ARTICLE
Isn't the MAL popularity determined by number of "members"? Which includes "dropped", "plan to watch", etc, as well as "completed" entries. If so, I could see that being quite a big flaw because it would surely mean that entries get pushed up in popularity just by having a lot of people who plan to watch it, but haven't actually done it yet. 

That said, it would probably only push LotGH up further because almost half of its "members" are plan-to-watch entries. :P 
>> ARTICLE
Yep it include PTW, which screw the popularity rating IMO, MAL should really change that.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure including anything but completed for anything but airing shows would mess up the popularity pretty badly.
>> ARTICLE
Really? lets take bleach as an example, I dropped it around 315 episodes in, not including me in the popularity rank seem pretty stupid, same if someone is in the middle of watching a show, why wouldn't that be an indication of how popular the show is?
>> ARTICLE
Because either they'll finish it or they won't. Maybe they could use that special rule they have for like if you watched 75% of it then your rating counts for determining popularity, but unless a show just aired or is airing, it's logical to assume far more people have finished watching it than are currently watching it.
>> ARTICLE
75% seem like an awful high amount when we are talking about popularity, as an example you are saying people who have watched 400 episodes of One Piece shouldn't be included in the popularity rank. What you want doesn't sound like an actual popularity rank, but more the most acknowledge show rank.  
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit are you me
>> ARTICLE
_everyone_ dropped bleach.  
The luckiest out us did before they even got to soul society.
>> ARTICLE
But I dropped it at ep 310

I guess that's around the time it got unbearably shitty
>> ARTICLE
Let me check.. i did at 316.   
We're three in that range, huh.
>> ARTICLE
I hope not, existing two places at the same time, sound like a lot of works :S
>> ARTICLE
Galactic Heroes is overlooked because it's 110 episodes long. People who watch enough to rate it basically have to love it, which explains the score. And some people take one glance at it and are either intimidated by its length or turned off by its age.

Having said that, just started the show Thursday as it happens. Haven't decided how I feel yet, but I still want to keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
Then why isn't One Piece or Bleach rated higher? LotGH it's actually pretty reasonable in comparison (it's only 50% or so longer than FMA: B).
>> ARTICLE
Maybe because they are less liked?
>> ARTICLE
Your entire reasoning was that LotGH is only highly rated because it's long, please explain why doesn't that logic also apply to other long series and only, specifically to LotGH? Are all long series besides LotGH bad?
>> ARTICLE
No. I didn't say that's the only reason it's rated high. It's one reason it's rated high while being relatively unpopular according to the stats. You need to calm the fuck down.
>> ARTICLE
Well the other shows are much more popular and aimed to modern teens/otaku/weebs/dedicated fans..etc (what ever you choose to call them) in order to get funds from merchandise and more views (good examples is the constant changing of character designs to become more sexualised) While LOTGH stayed constant and depended on the actually development and characters to be the money and the popularity maker...sadly just not as many people are interested in the story as they are in boobs. I'm generalizing here a bit but most people are not looking for a deep show, they just want something to "play in the background" while they eat their morning cereal.
>> ARTICLE
I watched 5 ep and probably the best thing out there, but man, its so dated I barely able to watch through an episode. Not just the art/animation, the voices are strange as well... I just hope one day I will finish this...
>> ARTICLE
Please don't base your opinion until you finish the first season [1-26].
The start is very slow, the show has so many characters and is epic in scope which makes it impossible to push so much in a short amount of time. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a testament to the show that I don't feel like I have to force myself to watch it. I keep going because I'm interested so far.
>> ARTICLE
Watch one episode at a time until you feel like you can binge it. 
>> ARTICLE
I think this is also a large part of the reason Gintama has so many iterations in the top 10. People who don't like it drop it a few episodes in and don't rate it.
>> ARTICLE
Very true. That's another show I just started, last night, as a matter of fact. First episode and I think I'm more or less hooked.
>> ARTICLE
LOTGH AND Gintama? Oh boy you are in for a emotional roller coaster. I'll see you in a few months. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope the first episode wasn't episode 1&2 because that's non canon and frankly it doesn't even compare to the rest of the series.

However if you got hooked on that non-canon episode then you should love the series even more.
>> ARTICLE
So, we can start by episode 3? Also, I may start Gintama, can we skip movies or are they must watch for major plots? I tried to watch it years ago, stopped after 2 eps, then again, One Piece took me five tries to get used to it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, should start at episode 3, there are many that thinks it has a very slow start but if you believe so as well you should continue watching, the series gets a lot better later on when the really serious arcs start.

I know of 3 gintama movies and only 1 of them has it's own special story. The other 2 is basically 1 arc (4-6 episodes maybe, the arcs are pretty small, but good) put into a movie, I haven't watched those 2 myself but I heard there might be some slight changes to make it fit into a movie or w/e but it's basically the same as in the series. So imo you should finish the series up until current season and then watch the movie that holds 9.14 or so on myanimelist [Movie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15335/Gintama:_Kanketsu-hen_-_Yorozuya_yo_Eien_Nare)

edit: Gintama has a mix of everything, feels, really exciting action but most of all there's a lot of hilarious comedy, and the scene that made me laugh the most was [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvmTQ2kVs4) it might convince you that you'll be laughing a lot throughout this anime. lmk your thoughts on this particular scene ;D
>> ARTICLE
Hilarious scene lol. I can't say for sure I will be watching, I will have to find time for it, at least it went to the top of my "Waiting to watch" list.
>> ARTICLE
3 movies? What 3 movies? The first movie was Benizakura followed by Kanketsu. So what was the third? o_O
>> ARTICLE
Probably the movie version of the Four Devas arc, at least based on [this](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21899/Gintama:_Yorinuki_Gintama-san_on_Theater_2D).
>> ARTICLE
Non-canon at Gintama? Like its matter... Theres so little in it what really matters for the so-called canon. Its not a story driven series.
>> ARTICLE
Actually it is, but the story is more spread out by episodes. Like we saw stuff back in episode 15 that just recently (episode 230) came around and finally connected 2 of the major plot dots. Gintama is a much bigger story that requires you to step back and look at the whole picture. Also the new character that was recently introduced...well I won't spoil much but he's kind of a big deal. 
>> ARTICLE
There is no big story. Gintoki day by day, thats all. Laughin, fighting, laughing. Its a never ending shonen. They dont have a big story, cos they would crash under it over the years. Its a gag manga, they make fun of everything and everyone. And they do this amazingly while throwing in the mix some fight. Theres nothing more to it....
>> ARTICLE
I don't know where you are in the anime and manga so I don't want to spoil it for you or anyone else, but trust me things happen because other things happened earlier in the show. Heck just the last anime arc had this and we finally found out why and how something happened that was introduced in earlier chapters/episodes. It is all following a big story, it's just the way this information is delivered by having little bit of information in each or every few episode between all those gags and stuff. Heck even right now we are just beginning to find out and see the repercussions of the 4 de as arc war including the "new" 4 decks and stuff and why they were selected. It took 200 episodes  but it is all falling into place, slowly but it is. This is one of the reasons us Gintama  fans are worried that the end might be near because lately a lot of stuff has been happening which made the 2nd movie canon. So trust that there is a story and not just episodic fluff.
>> ARTICLE
It matters because the first and second episode is complete and utter shit compared to the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
6 of these are very famous in arab countries, I wonder if that have anything to do with it.
>> ARTICLE
that's interesting. Which ones? Except Igano Kabamaru, I already know that.
>> ARTICLE
Rose of Versailles (was called lady oscar I think), Hanada Shounen-shi, Ginga Sengoku Gunyuuden Rai, Igano Kabamaru, and Romeo no Aoi Sora.
>> ARTICLE
I recommend Erin every chance I get.  It has one of the best coming of age stories in, or outside of anime.  
>> ARTICLE
Oh, Kyou Kara Ore Wa not only has an OVA series but one that's almost 2-cour in length? And it's well-liked? I should check that out.

Interesting list though. I've only seen 2 anime here and one other is on my PTW list. I'd be curious to see an expanded list (top 20 or 30 or so) since I was expecting to see a few more sports series.

Edit: I guess one issue I'd have with it is I don't like MAL's popularity ranking much. It includes all instances of an entry appearing on a list, even when it's in the PTW section. I'd be really curious to see what changes would occur if PTW data was removed.
>> ARTICLE
this is actually a good list. nj OP.
>> ARTICLE
These lists are always fun. I guess you discluded sequels altogether? I'm a bit surprised at how few of them I've actually watched, and that I hadn't even heard of Igano Kabamaru and Ginga Sengoku Gunyuuden Rai before (though Igano Kabamaru was on my PTW list, so I guess I have stumbled upon it before).
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I excluded sequels. And it was actually a necessity. If I did not, my list would be **dominated** by them, particularly by Gintama sequels and numerous seasons of [Major](http://myanimelist.net/anime/627/Major_S1). One of the Gintama sequels would even beat LOGH for the top spot. 

I believe the list without sequels is a little bit more interesting.
>> ARTICLE
>Romeo no Aoi Sora  
  
Oh man i watched this as kid! I didn't know the Japanese name and i really wanted to rewatch this thanks! 
>> ARTICLE
This is the first time I've seen a list on here namecheck Hanada Shounen-shi -- that said, I still haven't tried it myself, so I suppose I'm part of the problem. But supposedly it contains some characterful animation and good direction.
>> ARTICLE
I recommend showing the formula outside the spoiler. It's really hard to read and should be clear. Three asterisks on a blank line creates a horizontal rule which might be a better way of separating it.

***

Here is the formula for anyone who wanted to read it easily

>O (how overlooked the show is) = sqrt(exp(R)/(sqrt(P)+A)), 
where R=rating, P=popularity (by number of members), A - scale factor which weighs relative importance of popularity to ranking. 

>I set A at 140. Outer square root is unnecessary - it preserves the order, it only flattens the results. The top underwatched series would be similar (with exact same top2) to the results determined by simpler formula: O = #P/#R, where #P - rank in popularity, #R - rank in rating. But this one determines that out of all things the single most overwatched show is infamous Sword Art Online. Maybe it's too popular, but I don't think to that extent. So ultimately I chose the version with sqrt and exp. I also excluded from the ranking all sequels, 1episode specials, second seasons e.t.c.
>> ARTICLE
LoGH is just magnificent, a shame people don't pick it up :( 
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game was was a very nice take on romance. Not very typical to the romance genre.
>> ARTICLE
You mentioned "overwatched" shows in the formula description - can you list those as well?  Offhand my guess is that School Days would be #1 with the current formula.
>> ARTICLE
School days was awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
the last one is Pupa with rating 3,96 and 59947 members. It is #6829 in score and #627 in popularity. But yes, School days is also very high (low) on this list, it's #29 from the very end. But it has reasonably good rating 6,34, so it's beaten also for example by Glasslip (score 5,59 and 70000 members)

Edit: I excluded 1-episode ovas and specials from my ratings. If I didn't Mars of Destruction would be probably very last.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I loved School Days, and I don't care how much hate it gets.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, School Days is, *by far*, more fun to watch than Glasslip was. The trick is recognising that the creators *intended* for you to be angry, and that anger just as relevant an emotion to evoke and experience as fear (horror) or sadness (drama).
>> ARTICLE
These were quite popular at the time they were on air if I remember correctly.

it's just that as time passes on, people who watched these leave and new bloods come in and the information on it disappears.
>> ARTICLE
Incidentally I'm starting a rewatch of of Romeo no Aoi Sora/Romeo and the Black Brothers over on /r/watchinganime this week (probably Wednesday).
>> ARTICLE
An anime topic is one of the last places I expected Kyo Kara Ore Wa repped, one of my favorite mangas of all time and the anime though not as much as the manga was hilariously great too.

I have really only been watching anime for one year and the only one I have seen from this list is Cross Game (actually about to finish it tonight!) other than that LotGH is on my immediate PTW as well as Ping Pong the animation.
>> ARTICLE
Math nerd much :p thanks I've got some great shows added to my list.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not interested in Baseball in any way. Can I enjoy Cross Game ?
>> ARTICLE
\#5, Ginga Sengoku Gunyuuden Rai sounded interesting to me, I love a good space opera, but I think I found out why its so unwatched

there isn't a quality sub of it, all that are around are terrible crabstick HK subs
>> ARTICLE
that's a shame, because I also found it interesting. 

btw, i'm not very familiar with terminology, what are HK subs?
>> ARTICLE
hk as in hong kong, japanese (less than fluently)->chinese->english

[an example, with the origin of 'crabstick'](http://i.imgur.com/K9lY9YZ.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I tried watching Legend of Galactic Heroes on several occasions, but I still couldn't get past episode 3.

Not only has the animation aged, but barely existent. The sound effects are repetitive and the voice acting is simply monotone.

The entire show feels like a unenthusiastic audiobook.
>> ARTICLE
Don't let the animesnob see this or he'll give you an essay on why you're wrong and a casual

His essay opinions are as irrelevant as his videos are.

Summoning /u/thatanimesnob

Not about LOGH, but this is probably exactly the same person whose review on Igano Kabamaru I read. Maybe s/he will explain also if that show is worth anything outside "nostalgia factor".
>> ARTICLE
For a school comedy nobody outside a few countries know of, it is one of the best there in the genre.
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of Igano Kabamaru... I consider it one of my favorite shows and I've only seen it a couple of years ago. It is a very rare example of Josei Comedy and while it might seem as a generic gag show it really has its own unique flavor of humor. 
>> ARTICLE
that's strange, you are telling it's josei, MAL identifies it as a shounen, and Wikipedia as a shoujo. these demographics...
>> ARTICLE
Wikipedia should be correct, I suppose. 
~~I don't know/remember why I thought Bessatsu Margaret was Josei.~~Oh, it's because the Japanese wikipedia listed the magazine as Josei. 
>> ARTICLE
It's fairly shonen in style and pokes fun at girly romances, ala Rumiko Takahashi.
>> ARTICLE
POOF! WHO DARES SUMMON ME?!
>> ARTICLE
he was wrong and a casual
>> ARTICLE
You actually don't need to watch the first two episodes. There's an movie or OVA to replace them.
>> ARTICLE
> unenthusiastic audiobook

That is how hard sci-fi works. They really are unenthusiastic audiobooks because they care about good sci-fi stories, not Michael Bay explosions and big tits. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually for many people the fact it is 'like a book' is significant part of its appeal.
>> ARTICLE
Well I was considering watching the show instead of reading the book since the Japanese it uses is a bit hard for me, but now that you say that, I think I'm gonna try reading it again once I finish the book I'm reading currently.
>> ARTICLE
> voice acting is simply monotone.

It's more that it's not really strongly over the top and melodramatic like a lot of anime now. The voice acting is stellar in Legend of the Galactic Heroes because people actually sound like people instead of characters who start screaming their lines at any sign of a slightly stronger emotion. It's got more nuance in the way it's delivered. 
>> ARTICLE
It also has what is very possibly Norio Wakamoto's career-best performance.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the days when Norio Wakamoto played people other than Norio Wakamoto. I mean, I like Norio-Wakamoto-does-Wakamoto, but...
>> ARTICLE
To each his own I guess. The more episodes I watch, the less the style has begun to stick out to me. I was entertained from the very start but I can see that it may take time for others. The characters develop well but not at a blistering pace. Because of this however, the show gets extremely compelling as time goes on.
>> ARTICLE
That's a good list, very similar to other ones I've seen made by other formulas. Many of these shows haunt all the automatic recommendations I get from sites (Kabamaru, Hanada Shounen-shi, Romeo no Aoi Sora, Ginga Sengoku Gunyuuden Rai...) so it's interesting to see them all linked together here.

While some people might disagree with LoGH's inclusion, I think they're missing the fact that it's rated *over 9* but barely any members compared to other shows rated so highly. Basically only MAL's top 10 is rated that high. So even if you've heard someone talk about it, that's not a meaningful measure because this list has to do with the score as much as the popularity.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the most thrilling thing about being an anime fan is *watching anime*.
>> ARTICLE
making lists is better!

I even had a choice - I could make this list and immerse myself in ~~the Wired~~ /r/anime's discussion or I could finish Serial Experiments Lain. I chose the former....

But wait, were alternatives really that different?
>> ARTICLE
Added some to my ptw, thanks
>> ARTICLE
Well I freaking love me some Legend of the Galactic Heroes. 5 Episodes left and it's on it's way to be my all time favorite. I'll be adding these others to my PTW. Thanks for the thread, OP!
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about all these other shows, but Ping Pong is one the best pieces of animated anything I have ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
For a moment I thought **Rose of Versailles** was **Candy Candy**
>> ARTICLE
I have to find a way to watch Rose of Versailles.
>> ARTICLE
It's available to watch for free on Crunchyroll and Hulu because it's older. There is no dub, however. Don't let that deter you, as it's absolutely fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Cool, ty. I don't mind sub/dub
>> ARTICLE
Number 2, Romeo no Aoi Sora is really good.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think LoGH is overlooked at all. Plenty of people know about it, it's just that the majority of fans nowadays choose not to watch the series. Sci-fi space stuff has always been more of a niche even in anime (especially nowadays), and aside from that the series is one of these that suffer immensely from their age. While I think it's still very watchable, I've seen tons of people complain that they don't want to watch it because it simply looks unpleasant.
>> ARTICLE
How did Giant Killing score?
>> ARTICLE
it's #680 - so according to ranking neither really "overwatched" nor "overlooked", maybe deserves a little bit more attention, but only very slightly - with 7,77 rating that's all it can do, probably.

Birdy is really underrated, and rarely mentioned. Its biggest problem is that it needs another season.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Mmm, there is that, and there's also the (albeit smaller) distortion of recent shows not having had as much time to gain members, so it suddenly becomes a lot harder to make a list everyone agrees on (not to mention, that's never going to happen anyway)
>> ARTICLE
So you're saying that these shows aren't viewed as often and noted on MAL because they're old?

Isn't that exactly what this list is for? To find lesser-watched shows and display them as they have a high rating and aren't lost in the massively popular ones?
>> ARTICLE
I totally don't understand your complaints. I came up with formula and applied it to **all** of the series from MAL, whether they are from 70s, 90s or 10s. I haven't decided the results at all.

So what you are actually criticizing? Data I was working with? If so, provide me better data. 

Wait a moment... I noticed - on my list there is one show from the 70s, two from the 80s, three from the 90s and **four** from 21st century, with two being rather very new. WTF are you talking about?


>> ARTICLE
I expected a lot more from Kotoura-san after the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, that first episode is the biggest bait and switch ever. I was actually about to post this.
>> ARTICLE
The first episode is essentially an entirely different show
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the first Episode of Haikyuu. That Hinata jump immediately hyped me up.
>> ARTICLE
and the really cool thing about Haikyuu is that every episode is better than the last. I mean in terms of the whole show the first episode is one of the worst, but it's still REALLY FUCKING GOOD.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck yeah!!!!!  Haikyuu is one of my favorite sports anime
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its also one of my Favorites :D my no 1. is [Hajime no Ippo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo)

TWGOK episode one. It presents all the basic premises and having a satisfying hook to continue watching it.
>> ARTICLE
uhm which anime is TWGOK? 
>> ARTICLE
TWGOK stands for The World God Only Knows, it's one of my favorite shows overall, really worth watching. The thing that's great about it is its take on the harem genre, being completely different from what you usually see, it also has an amazing not dense main character, something that's pretty rare for the genre, I can't recommend it enough.
>> ARTICLE
i think i will try to watch it sometime
>> ARTICLE
Personally I watched episodes 1 & 2 and thought "Eh...maybe some other time." I waited a few months, revisited it, and fell in love. I'd put TWGOK in my top 5 now for sure. I also love how the show improved drastically in the Goddesses season!
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game . "Looks at the cover* me: Yay this looks like a fun and happy slice of life series to watch. "after first episode" me: fuck. 
>> ARTICLE
Saw your comment and decided to check it out. Damn
>> ARTICLE
I fucking love Cross Game. Haven't seen the anime, only read the manga, but damn, it blew me away. Read it all the way through in one sitting last week. I have a review of it up on MAL and on my site, if you want to check that out.

I havent completed the anime yet, i put it on hold after first episode because i knew it i need it to watch that anime in the right mood otherwise i wouldn't enjoy it much, but yeah, first episode, damn feels

I'm a big fan of Adachi, even though a lot of his works are pretty similar, especially his baseball stuff, but I never get enough of his mangas. His characters and their interactions, everything is just so likable.
>> ARTICLE
I have read part of Adachi's work and I really like it, even when he repeat himself. Cross Game characters are a lot like the main characters from Katsu! and was a great way to live it up (since it seems it will never have an adaptation).
>> ARTICLE
Just finished episode 1 of crossgame. What the fuck I got owned.
>> ARTICLE
Crossgame is pretty good. I think I was a little let down because I was expecting a sports anime but overall it is pretty entertaining. It was around when I finished major and overdrive
>> ARTICLE
I almost teared up after the first episode. It was definitely one of the most amazing first episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul.

Really really great first episode, whatever else one might think of the series..
>> ARTICLE
I'd also say that TGS1 has one of the best last episodes as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually when I went back and watched it again a lot of what I thought was in that last episode was actually in the first episode of season 2.

That season 1 finale was not as good as I remembered it to be, still good though to be sure.
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul season 1 is a solid action show with a great character arc. A has terrible characters, and an incoherent plot, but I still think it's better than S1. Why? Because of the beautiful aesthetic design, subtle symbolism, and probably the best directing in recent anime.
>> ARTICLE
There was almost no symbolism compared to the manga
Or better said: there was nothing good compared to the manga
>> ARTICLE
For how much of a slog the other episodes were, I was immensely surprised at how good the last episode was, it was kind of baffling, and it hurt. Hurt that if every other episode had that level of pacing and animation quality, it could have been a very decent show.
>> ARTICLE
Psycho Pass has one of the most engaging first episodes. Great transition into opening at the end, great chase scene, great anticipation for what would happen next and solid animation.

Cross game would have to be my other nomination. It has the first episode that is able to create the most feels out of any anime I've ever seen. If anybody would like to contest that feel free to give me examples cause I probably need to watch those shows.
>> ARTICLE
The opening scene alone drew me in 
>> ARTICLE
The gun transforming in Psycho Pass sold me out
>> ARTICLE
Aldnoah Zero

Not a single first episode from any anime I've watched made me go ''Holyyyy shittttt'' so badly after watching it (maybe Attack on Titan too?).
>> ARTICLE
Looks like you're like me and you're a Hiroyuki Sawano fan.  He made the music for both of those. 
>> ARTICLE
Xenoblade, Nanatsu no Taizai, Kill La Kill, Guilty Crown, Blue Exorcist ... I love his compositions
>> ARTICLE
The music is probably the best part of most of those shows. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you heard Gundam Unicorn's its probably one the best OST's i've heard.
>> ARTICLE
Should I watch Nanatsu no Taizai?


>> ARTICLE
Short answer: yes

Edit:

Long answer: The story isn't particularly special, but it's about a group of people that are misunderstood and portrayed as evil by everyone as they try to fulfill the promise of the princess of the corrupted kingdom they were exiled from.

Most of the characters have some great development and backstory, even the secondary ones. I don't need to mention the music...

The downside could be the art (if you like Fairy Tail this shouldn't concern you), some people might not like it because it's a bit bubbly, but it didn't bother me much. The animation was decent though.

Nanatsu no Taizai made me go through hype, laughter and tears. It has a good balance of action, romance and comedy.

I would totally recommend.

>> ARTICLE
Well you've sold me, I'll start it up tomorrow as Sunday is my obligatory anime day due to One Punch Man. 
>> ARTICLE
Aldnoah... where did you go wrong...

Probably after Urobuchi stopped writing the script like 3 episodes in.
>> ARTICLE
Season 1 was amazing, some of my favourite amine ever there, season 2 was such a let down :(
>> ARTICLE
Inaho had very little character growth, all the other earth characters were boring as fuck, Slaine was the best character and he went off the deep end in season 2, the ending sucked, the ending to season 1 was amazing but was all but retconned in season 2, the entire reason Inaho and Slaine were enemies was because of a complete misunderstanding. The show was still very entertaining and I personally enjoyed the shit out of it, but I still wonder what it could've been had a competent author and director been put in charge of the entire thing. They made some mind bogglingly poor directional choices, especially in season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly Slaine carried the show so hard. It was Slaine suffering or being a badass, and then some Inaho vs Knight of the week bullshit.

I love this anime, especially the ending in season 2. Not sure why everyone hate it so much. It was so different compared to most anime. [](/s "Maybe I just sometime like shows where the hero doesn't get the girl at the end.")

Watch episode 1 of [Ga-Rei: Zero] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/4725/Ga-Rei:_Zero) I can guarantee you'll be saying more than just holy shit

Kekkai Sensen

My favourite first episode. Epic atmosphere, quick explanation, lots of characters, *dat soundtrack* etc.
>> ARTICLE
Funnily enough, the first episode of KS is the reason I could never get into it. It feels like a clusterfuck. 

>> ARTICLE
Watch the dub.
>> ARTICLE
Well that's pretty much the entire show. Twas a wild ride. 
>> ARTICLE
Gakkou Gurashi by far. It's so well designed to catch you off guard with the twist.

And then you rewatch and see all the hints you missed.
>> ARTICLE
Can you tell me more? Is it more than just cute girls doing cute things?
>> ARTICLE
Just avoid spoilers and watch the first episode.  That should be enough.
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't agree with you more. Out of all of the animes that I've watched, Gakkou Gurashi and its twist in the first episode is the best. 
>> ARTICLE
I went into that expecting cute lesbians to be cute. Fuck that twist.

even the op was very detailed

Mushishi had an amazing first episode.

Personally, it is Durarara!!'s first episode. I still remember Mikado's thoughts ,"  [Foreshadowing/hints](/s "Here, in this city, I'd experienced something I couldn't even have dreamed of.... I was trembling at the feeling that a new reality had begun for me.")  "

Also did I do the spoiler tag thing right? Still kinda new at this.

The first part when Gamagoori enters the room in typical gainax fashion and then is falling outside the window while the dude runs down the stairs was all I needed to see to know that I would love this show.

SAO is up there for sure.

Then it went to shit after episode three :(

Actually, I agree. It was so hype and had so much potential but it fell short

Definitely. It set up a great premise and had me thinking about all the cool ways it could go. What a let down...

oh here we go, another SAO debate..
>> ARTICLE
I just buckle down and wonder if this lot will like Alicization or not...
>> ARTICLE
Having read it, i'm expecting it to be quite controversial.
>> ARTICLE
What debate?
>> ARTICLE
A considerable number of people this subreddit are 'hardcore' anime fans who after watching anime for years, have developed a standard of character development, plot, animation etc which is needed to describe a 'good' anime. You can find extensive write ups that are multiple pages long on why SAO is not good if you look for them (I dont want to start another argument). The minority on here are people who genuinely enjoyed SAO and dont realize/dont care/disagree about its faults. Although pretty much everyone agrees that it is one of the best entry-level anime.
>> ARTICLE
It's more like a circlejerk
>> ARTICLE
Let us hope the progressive is animated. As so far it has been pretty good from the Light Novel prospective. As it surrounds the first half of season 1 about going up the tower. Not just stories from here and there with him being OP. 

[Asuna](/s "Really shines and plays an important role in the Progressive series.")
>> ARTICLE
Is the progressive stuff his way of re-creating the story? I always felt like the reason he kept going back to "old SAO" in season 2 and shit was because he realized himself how hard he fucked it up.

I would love a real good story about it.
>> ARTICLE
It is actually about his characters 'growth' In the actual game. They talk about the games lore as they're ascending the tower. It more or less starts on floor 1 and works from there, floor by floor. So I wouldn't say that it's re-creating but adding more body to something that could have been expanded on and what many of the fans actually would have wanted. 

It's more of a day to day what's going on and how they're advancing. So if the author actually plans things right, they could include that arc the influences GGO that we actually never heard of. But that's still further down the road. 
>> ARTICLE
Osomatsu-san
>> ARTICLE
To bad the episode is now banned from BD sets and streaming sites :(
>> ARTICLE
I'm not familiar with the show, why did it get banned?
>> ARTICLE
it parodied a bunch of other anime, and it got taken down everywhere for copyright issues.
>> ARTICLE
In Japan you don't have the right to parody anything freely. They don't have a fair use part in their copyright laws.

Osomatsu-san parodied a series without asking the author first and the author told them to take down the episode because of copyright infringement.
>> ARTICLE
im not sure, but I think it's because it made reference to many anime titles 
>> ARTICLE
The first episode of Space Dandy, actually even just the first 5 minutes of Space Dandy does a fantastic job of showing exactly what the series has to offer.
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, personally I don't like the first episode much. 

When I watched it for the first time, I didn't pick it up after
>> ARTICLE
When the first few lines of dialogue are "boobs boobs boobs" you know it's going to be a good show.

it's all about the booty, baby!

In all the anime TV and movies I've seen Space Dandy holds the record for fastest fourth wall break. They bust that shit wide open in the first couple minutes of dialogue.

* Best first episode - [Mobile Suit Gundam 00](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2581/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_00)

Zetsuen no Tempest has my favorite first episode. It establishes its primary cast without needless exposition, *shows* us who they are by their actions, and transitions between scenes beautifully.

Haibane Renmei. Only first episode that has ever made me cry.

Charlotte
>> ARTICLE
Darker Than Black's first episode really drew me in, especially the opening scene.

I gotta say, Owari No Seraphs 1st episode was personally, really good 
>> ARTICLE
Its second episode was about the MC in highschool.

And I dropped it immediately. 
>> ARTICLE
S2 actually made suffering through S1 worth it IMO. S2 is much more intense, though it takes a few episodes to really ramp up.
>> ARTICLE
He leaves the school after a few episodes and we never see it again.
>> ARTICLE
if you dropped it like most probably did, I will say the 2nd season got a good bit better.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I dropped S2 on Episode 4 or something... Yet was i really curious in S1.
>> ARTICLE
Yea it picks up soon after 4 i think can't remember exactly when but for instance 8 is good and 9 is probably my favorite episode.

The 2nd season is better, I agree. But the 1st episode is for me the best episode, so far at least.

I think season 2 episode 9 is very close to it.

Code geass

Couldn't agree more. As soon as she gave him his Geass power I was hooked.

Not really talked about much but I thought the first episode of The World God Only Knows did an excellent job showing off what the show was going to be about. It did the introduction and the conquest really well and Ayumi is still one of my favorite girls in the series. 
>> ARTICLE
Gotta say I was let down by the rest of the show after the first episode. I expected many heart-warming moments later on, which is why I picked the show up. Welp, Ayumi still best s1 girl. Hadn't seen the rest yet.
>> ARTICLE
S3 is where the show signs and the following arc in the manga was fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Angel beats. It throws you off by making you think it's a comedy...
>> ARTICLE
Isn't it?
>> ARTICLE
The first episode is nothing like the rest of the series. I watched the first episode thinking it was going to be a comedy but it gets emotional very quickly. They still keep the comedy aspect for most of the show but it's definitely a very sad show that can also be looked at joyfully/optimistically. Definitely worth the watch. I cried.

I just started Yuri Kuma Arashi an hour ago and holy shit that first ep...

this is an interesting topic to me because people say anything.

Strangely, Toradora had a really great first episode. I really liked how much story they were able to put into that opener.
>> ARTICLE
The first episode of Great Teacher Onizuka was beyond fantastic. It's twice the length of a regular episode, but it does a great job showing off Onizuka, both his good side and his bad side. The ending of the episode, though, is easily my favorite scene of any anime. I didn't see it coming at all, and [mild spoiler](/s "it really showed just how far Onizuka was willing to go to help his students, no matter how they acted towards him.")

This might be a little weird, but hear me out, You cant realise the beauty of episode one until you have seen the final, once you rewatch episode one you get the HOLY SHIT moment. But for first time watching its pretty confusing and weird.

Agreed

You might say its a great first episode for an entirely different reason than these other first episodes.

Elfen Lied.

Seriously, that first episode hook you up so much

Tetsujin-28 (2004)

It ends on such an awesome note. The music that plays as Tetsujin rises up covered in bandages and blood. The idea behind an unforgivable crime from WWII being reborn. The entire atmosphere of the scene... so great. Imagawa really knows how to make awesome first episodes (see also; Shin Mazinger Z and Giant Robo).
>> ARTICLE
I really liked Punch Line.
>> ARTICLE
[Sora no Woto](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To)'s first episode is really awesome. It explains how the world looks and works and how story is going to be told, it shows protagonist, her ambitions, her reasons to come to the town. Additionaly there's also awesome [french song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4A0uCYDxE0) and animation is really good.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I'm surprised not many people are saying Gakkou Gurashi. My vote goes towards that and it's fucking mindblowing plot twist

Sakurako had the best first episode of this season imo

Rage of Bahamut had a nice one

Baccano!

I had no idea what I was watching, but it seemed like an epic start to several stories and I fell in love with it.

SAO. I was extremely disappointed by SAO because it couldn't keep up that fantastic first episode to the end. It should have ended at the right timing...
>> ARTICLE
Ga-Rei Zero.

Too bad the ending sucked.
>> ARTICLE
ending sucked? how?
>> ARTICLE
Just a lot of dumb choices. [](/s "Why didn't Yomi just kill the wheelchair lady and her assistant? How does getting stabbed in the stomach give you amnesia? The entirety of Ga-Rei.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what you mean by [](/s "the entirety of Ga Rei"). You mean manga? I've heard it was completely different and sucked but it has nothing to do with the anime.

You other points are minor. [](/s "Yomi didn't kill wheelchair lady because at no point she was thoroughly evil. For the plot it didn't really matter if she did this or not, anyway. Stabbed in stomach -> amnesia - come on, that's striving for realism in an anime where highschool girls are swinging katanas to fight monsters from hell. It's just petty objection which has nothing to do with the plot")
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's because I hated those characters and wanted them to die.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann
>> ARTICLE
The episode as a whole was pretty great, but more specifically, the first scene of the show completely hooked me on how awesome it was going to be. The [music](https://youtu.be/6xozBWZr_68?t=34), with the pan out of the Gurren Lagann, then cut to the shows title put the biggest grin on my face, even though I had no idea what it was about.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I really can't agree with this. In fact GL had such a generic start, I almost dropped it. I mean it's alright, fun, action-packed... But it doesn't have anything that special about it. I didn't get really hooked until episode 8. Then it's a rollercoaster until the end.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, different tastes. I suppose it helped that it was my first anime... I'm probably biased here.
>> ARTICLE
Is it worth to give it another shot? I got to like episode 4 and their plan is to attack the enemy from where they came from.. and then they had some filler story or something and met a guy and his sisters that apparently love them..
>> ARTICLE
You're not alone with stopping at episode 4. Although it's not filler (they are very important later on), episode 4 is largely regarded to be the worst episode. Mostly because of the art though. Anyhoo, 

[**YES**](#rengehype)

It is worth it to pick it back up. The show only gets more awesome from there. (Especially episode 8 coming up)

Ao no Exorcist episode 2 hit me pretty hard, especially when [this](https://youtu.be/bQvLggRfJ2U?t=108) starts playing.

I'm going to go with Charlotte here. 

Episode 1 was damn captivating with the MC shaping up to be LeLouche 2.0 and multiple promising supporting characters to go along with an interesting premise. 

The rest of the series was god awful, but episode 1 was pretty hype.

Fate/Zero
>> ARTICLE
Really? As much as I do love Fate Zero, I think the first episode is one of it's weaker episodes. It's still better than every episode of all the F/SN adaptations though. F/SN Visual Novel >>> Zero >>> Prilliya manga >>>>>>>>>>> All the F/SN anime adaptations
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero is far from best first in MY OPINION. It's just like Baccano or Durarara. It's messy... you don't really know whats going on...

If gakkou gurashi isn't one of the top comments I SWEAR TO GOD.

I think guilty crown had some awesome first episodes

The very first episode of Attack on Titan was so good it made me grossly overrate the entire series for at least a year.  I had to rewatch the first season to realize that holy shit, there were a lot of mediocre episodes.

Kill La Kill for sure

Death Note
>> ARTICLE
A Certain Magical Index (S01) episode 1-6

I think Tokyo Ghoul has a really good first episode. It really shows the psychological aspects of the series.

As a confused kid who was trying to take in his parent's divorce, the beginning of Naruto really hit home. Not that I connected with Naruto's situation (can't say that I had a demon fox inside me that offed my parents) but I thought Iruka was so cool when he first gave that speech in episode 1. Reminded me of my own dad. Kill la Kill and Space Dandy also had awesome opening episodes imo.  
>> ARTICLE
Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse. If you want to talk about a show that is completely different between the first and last episodes.

attack on titan.

honestly, i think about this question a lot since most of my friends don't really like anime and if i try to show one to them i have to know that i can get them hooked using only one episode.  for compression:death note takes 2, madoka takes 3, gurren langan takes several as well, clannad takes an entire season :(

Code Geass had me hooked first episode. I just love it.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Hellsing Ultimate mentioned anywhere. And God Eater, though it's not finished yet...
>> ARTICLE
I think Berserk had some of the best first episodes ever, seeing that first episode really got me into it, knowing what a fucking insane man Guts is and how hardcore he is and then you get this amazing story of his past and when he was a kid the few episodes after, really brings you in,
>> ARTICLE
I'm probably only a part of a handful of people who think this, but I consider the first episode of Shokugeki no Soma one of my favorites.  Also Eden of the East's Jason Bourne-like fist episode was really good.  
>> ARTICLE
i would say not best but one of the best first episode are Shokugeki no soma, (Nanatsu no Taizai and DanMachi not really but they had there some great moments), Mondaiji, **especially Mirai Nikki and Akame ga Kill**
>> ARTICLE
Terror in Resonance
>> ARTICLE
Tiger and Bunny had a great start that was full of action and it explained the setting.

Also being my very first experience with anime, I'd have to say One Piece.

When Luffy popped out of the barrel screaming like a maniac, I knew this show was something else!

I wouldn't say the entirety of the first episode of TTGL is great but holy shit the whole Gurren Lagann Spin On! part at the start is one of the coolest opening scenes I've ever seen, boy did it get me hyped.

I recall Fate/Stay Night UBW's first episodes being pretty hype

Akame Ga Kill

Can't believe I haven't found this posted yet, but AgK had an amazing pilot episode. Unfortunately, the rest of the series didn't quite go as well, but the pilot is what convinced me to watch the entire series.

I'd say Honey and Clover has a very nice first episode. It's not about hype or stuff like that, you just relax and appreciate good friendship.
>> ARTICLE
Symphogear GX. cant beat that hype mang
>> ARTICLE
I'm of the opinion that very, VERY few anime have good first episodes. They're mostly very rushed (or rather, poorly paced), often going through way more chapters than necessary (or sometimes, fewer) just so they can end on a specific plot point (usually a cliffhanger). It annoys the fuck out of me.

That being said...[Space Brothers](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai) has a very good opening episode, IMO.
>> ARTICLE
Bleach is amazing with the buildup 
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou. Walk in expecting a nice slice of life, walk out laughing your ass off ready to see more. 
>> ARTICLE
I realized that my opening post is all about multiple opening episodes, instead of just one. The best single first episode is Gurren Lagann. Amazing characterization, 3 of the most iconic shots in anime, beautiful and unique directing, perfectly sets up the show's themes. As to be expected from my favorite anime.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop had a really great first episode, it introduced the characters and their situations very well I thought. 
>> ARTICLE
it did not, at least for me. I dropped the show after the first episode cause it was so damn boring.

I love Bebop, and if they started with episode 5 and 6, then back to episode 1 and so on, I think it would have been a stronger hook... Thoughts?

Anime adaptation doesnt really reflect its manga. Example, Gate:

Anime and manga both are adaptation. Gate: is a novel.

Oh TIL.  So, comparing the manga to its novel how far the violence got diluted? 
>> ARTICLE
Violence getting diluted doesn't really detract from the story for me. Spice and Wolf for instance has Holo on her wolf form just running around and people fall to the ground just because when they're in the sewers. On the LN, a lot of people got ravaged on that scene.

I mean, that rarely ever affects the story, so why bother?

/r/anime

lmao

I know, but still, someone CAN actually be so addicted to the manga to go the stretch and say it'll be good no matter what... right? I mean, if they announced a season 3 for S&W it probably would be an auto-include on my 10 list because of the content of the LN :D.

I'm actually surprised Hunter x Hunter is second on this list, especially when it lost to Spice and Wolf in the Best Anime bracket. I feel like it's always mentioned on this sub but it isn't overly hyped up which is interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
> but it isn't overly hyped up which is interesting. 

Really? People talk about CA like it was the pinnacle of fiction.
>> ARTICLE
I meant it doesn't have a huge circle-jerk going for it to the point where it dominates every bracket.

And I've never seen the CA arc brought up without a mixture of praise and criticism. 
>> ARTICLE
Its kind of the same with Steins;Gate and FMA:B, I don't think that people rave on about it too much because they are very secure that they are regarded as good shows, they don't need to convince other people that it is a good show just to reaffirm their belief. I fucking loved HxH, but I anit gonna preach the shit out of it and put people off, not what I want to do at all.
>> ARTICLE
This is what initially turned me off of HxH, that and the episode count.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much everyone who watches it ends up loving it, but a lot of people are turned off the either its length, art style, or beginning that make it seem like it's an anime for kids. It is pretty damn hyped in the comment sections, but that's simply not enough to boost it above other really popular anime with broader appeal in contests that have thousands of voters.
>> ARTICLE
It was a 9/10 for me... until the ant arc. The change in tone, ridiculously slow pacing, overpowered (dues ex machine) enemies ruined it for me. It took like 40 episodes for anything to happen and once it started it was so over narrated and over explained ever little detail. Until that point everyone  was strong because they trained and earn their power. The ants also felt so cartoony and out of place in what had been a dark Shonen. The mc's anger felt so forced and blown out of proportion.

/end rant 

Edit:Downvote isnt a disagree button. 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree with everything you say lol. A lot of people think the ant arc was the best.
>> ARTICLE
There's many that considers it the best arc of any shounen.
>> ARTICLE
did you watch the show while it was airing or after it finished?
>> ARTICLE
I watched it after it was finished and thought the ant arc was the best by far, albeit it started off rather slow.
>> ARTICLE
If you watched it while it was airing, you would realize how bad and slow the pacing was. They basically copy pasted the manga, they showed whats going on, AND the narrator explained it. Which imo is bad in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Animes are much better when you can binge watch them though, chimera ant arc might have been really slow when it was airing but it would have had an extremely different feeling if you had been able to see everything at once, I was watching 40 episodes a day so this made it definitely one of the best arcs of any shounen to me.
>> ARTICLE
that's my point, many people ignore the terrible pacing of shows because they binge watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Aren't the majority of anime created to promote the source material anyway? I'm also sure a good portion of the people that watched it (including me) didn't even touch the manga so it was a new experience to them. As far as the pacing, I already admitted that I also thought it was pretty slow, but the second half more than makes up for it imo.
>> ARTICLE
the second half is where it was slowest, 6 episodes for 3 minutes. Also that isn't an excuse to have godawful pacing, they promoted the manga by completely ending the show in a satisfying way so for the people that want more, they need to read the manga (even though there isn't much material).
>> ARTICLE
When it was finishes, and i'm used to shounen pacing. I loved it from the first episode as i knew it was going to be an epic journey. I'm glad they did it after the manga, that's the only way anime should be done.
>> ARTICLE
which "dues ex machine" are you talking about?
>> ARTICLE
The people who comment on shit are different from the people who'd upvote shit. People who've watched HxH will have very strong opinions about it
>> ARTICLE
This is true. There are >300,000 subscribers here, but I'd say there's only around 500-1000 of us that regularly comment. What we tend to think of as "the /r/anime community" is only a tiny sliver of it. This is also a big part of the reason you'll see a tremendous outpouring of love for certain characters in the contests' comment sections only to have them get absolutely mutilated in the results.

Darker than Black 66... what the fuck guys.
>> ARTICLE
that's much cleaner. Thank you!
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda of curious on what makes Steins;Gate that good. I finished it last week and it was really good, but I feel it's a bit overrated. Maybe I was a bit overhyped on how it was going to end, but the ending left me kinda underwhelmed. Intro and outro songs are really awesome, I like the lyric change at the final two episodes and what the lyrics of the intro have to say, real interesting and ties in well with the story. 
>> ARTICLE
 Steins;Gate has various elements/genre in it, the characters aren't all that interesting but the amount of human emotions mixed in, all the feels, driving each one to their own desires, characters development. I'm assuming that you have watched both the OVAs and the movie, you would only not like it if you don't understand jack shit. I personally don't find anything lacking in Steins;Gate. 

But yeah overhyping it might be a factor, when does the real thing meets your expectation when you overhype, really?

ANWS DONT YOU FEEL THE PAIN OKABE IS GOING THROUGH


>> ARTICLE
Tu... tu... ruu
>> ARTICLE
I'm not talking about /r/anime folks but the general Steins;Gate audience: If you think from the perspective of a random adult you'd run into on the street in the Western world, Steins;Gate is the only show they might like out of the top 10 shows. The other 9 are extreme levels of "okay wtf am I watching?" to those outside of fantasy/fiction/anime culture.

For that specific non-anime audience, it would be a toss up between Steins;Gate, Cowboy Bebop and Death Note. Steins;Gate would win the popularity contest because the other two are older series.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on the same boat. I recently watched, too. And enjoyed but overall ranking in mine is not so high. I also wonder what makes it to the top. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Steins;Gate is a lot better when it's the first anime you've seen because it's more accessible to a western audience. It was the first anime I ever saw and I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread; I recently *rewatched* it a year after being introduced to anime and whilst I still thought it was great, it wasn't as incredible as I remembered it being. 
>> ARTICLE
It has good character development, a time travel mechanic that makes sense and is explained well, and isn't based on magic. 
>> ARTICLE
[We also had a Best Anime bracket just a few months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/32yq8d/ranimes_favourite_anime_of_all_time_and_the/)
>> ARTICLE
Yep, and I did this anyway since the results could be different due to that one being a head-to-head tournament kinda thing and this just being raw favorites.
>> ARTICLE
It's nice seeing Higurashi, Mawaru Penguindrum and Great Teacher Onizuka on this list. Looks like r/anime's taste isn't so bad after all. 

How many votes did each of the Fate series get individually OP?

>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure, I was too far into it before realizing I should have kept track of them individually. I think it was about 40% F/Zero, 30% UBW and 30% F/SN
>> ARTICLE
>30% F/SN

That doesn't seem right... Maybe it would get like 5% vote if we were just talking about favorite in the Fate series, but favorite anime, on /r/anime? Nah, no way man.

EDIT: Okay i've decided to count up all of the Fate votes using Ctrl f.

Fate/Zero - 54 (I searched for "Fate/Zero" and "Fate Zero" and "F/Z")

Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works - 14 (I searched for UBW, Unlimited Blade Works, Fate/Stay Night and Fate Stay Night)

Fate/Stay Night - 2 (Although one didn't specify if UBW or DEEN.) and (I searched for Fate/Stay Night and DEEN)

There was also one vote that said "Fate Zero/sn" so I don't know who to give that to...
>> ARTICLE
Well at least I knew zero was more popular than the others :P haha
>> ARTICLE
Because it's by far the best.
>> ARTICLE
Prisma illya says Hi 

Also the fights in Prisma illya>>> Fate/zero Batcave and Unlimited flashy works final fight. Ufotable can learn from Silver Link.

But don't people usually say the popular stuff is shit, like sao or naruto? So shouldn't that mean that fate/zero is actually the worst, because it's so popular?
>> ARTICLE
popular irl =/= popular on r/anime

If anyone dares to say anything about ufotable's Fate adaptation I'll punch them hard

Just occasionally something becomes popular because it is actually good. And it's not as if fate/zero is mainstream.

I mean, it kinda is.

Not Naruto and SAO level, the stuff that even people who hardly watch any anime at all know about.

You'll be able to dig out flaws in every show if you look for them, and besides, when has a list like that ever been more than a popularity contest, anyway? It's not as though anyone's claiming that Steins;Gate's a flawless masterpiece.

maybe a lot of people had it on 3?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, steins;gate was more commonly 2 or 3 than 1
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the list would be more accurate if you had counted 1) thrice and 2) twice.

That would have been a lot of work though :O
>> ARTICLE
A weighted system, like CFB AP/BCS rankings instead of just a "mentions" poll. 
>> ARTICLE
That's subjective. I enjoyed the show a lot and loved the characters, and imo the pacing was good for me. I liked it more than Madoka, and Mawaru. No one's claiming it's flawless, but that it's a fantastic show (I mean it's #2 on MAL).
>> ARTICLE
That feeling when the top 3 are in you're too 5 (or will be when I see the last few episodes of HxH)

Well from what I put in that top 10 thread the other day only one of my top 10 aren't on this list.  And it's a stand alone movie, so...

Glad to see my favorites (Kino's Journey, Aria the Origination, FLCL, FMA:B, Toradora) all represented, as well as a few of my favorite lesser-known titles (Uchoten Kazoku, Cross Game, Planetes).

And apparently I've seen 79% of the listed titles. Interesting.

Firstly, nice work in compiling the data together (manually, I assume?)

In terms of feedback, I have two things: one, when reporting the results, identically numbered items should be tied in rank with each other. So instead of having the shows with count of 4 being ranked 76-91, they all would be ranked as 76th (or 76th-91st if you want to be technical about it.  
Second, I think that a weighting system would be more ideal for doing tiebreakers if you wanted to bother (but then you would have to list those results to show why they ended up separated in rank).  
So the "sort order" if you will, would be Total Count > 1sts > 2nds > 3rds. Rank by Total Count, if group tie, rank within group by 1sts, and so on. I know it's a quite a bit more work for the all of the inevitable ties, but more transparency ~~will muffle the salty /r/anime users~~ is always awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I started counting by people's first second and third favorites but it took too long and lots people said like "here's my top 3 in no order" so I stopped

>> ARTICLE
People are usually responsive with great fervor when others bring it up but I can't help but ask:

What's so good about Steins;gate? I watched it and it was good; I rated it 8/10. But it really wasn't anything above that for me. 

The drama (character death(s) or separations) did not give me a suspension of disbelief, meaning the writing behind it wasn't the best. I'll explain what I mean: in the best works of fiction, the setting and characters are presented in a way that can get the viewer invested in the events of the series despite being aware it's fiction. Like in Hunter x Hunter, Meruem and Komugi; or in Anohana, most characters. I won't spoil them, and you'll understand what I'm talking about if you've watched. I never felt like I cared about the character(s) dying or being separated from Okabe in Steins;gate.

Speaking of characters in Steins;gate, they are interesting to the point where they are **not** a bore to watch. That's fine if the goal is to be just a decent anime. But they really weren't anything deeper than that. The character development was more about their individual circumstances, and less about how it affected their mentality, as I would have liked. For example, the unfortunate distancing between Feyris and her father. Sure that's kind of sad, but we don't see how it affects her character by having that problem. She's the same with and without the circumstances. Maybe she's good at hiding her sadness via a facade, but at least give the viewer an idea of what ways it affects Feyris's mentality. A great example of such a thing being done correctly is from Hunter Hunter: the childhood flashback of Gyro (the NGL king/druglord) and his alcoholic father. You're clearly shown what kind of devoted child Gyro was, and the events that made him change to who he is. This is just a side character and Togashi gave him such a powerful backstory. Netero's training in the mountains for his change was also superb. An argument against this is, Steins;gate was too short-running to develop its characters much. Then you can compare it to Cowboy Bebop or even Toradora, both of which give a lot of emphasis to why characters became how they are.

I have issues with the plot, although those complaints are more subjective than the above (I was annoyed that Okabe spent the entire "death repeat" arc learning there are consequences messing with time, only to be able to change the past as he pleases in the end with **no** consequence; what was the point of his learning then?!) . Some people may prefer a happy ending at the expense of abandoned development, so I can't criticize the anime on that part.

Overall the show was enjoyable, but I'm very confused how people treat it as a masterpiece. People imply it's a very cerebral show, like western television's The Affair or Mr Robot, but it's really not. It's a show on the level of things like Code Geass or Afro Samurai. It's a fun watch for many people, but none of the plot or characters are anything beyond that. 


>> ARTICLE
I find it odd you mention Feyris. The effects on her mental state are very clear. [spoilers](#s "The change from the loss of her father literally warps Tokyo. She loses herself to the moe because she has no other way to escape the guilt. It is not until her interaction with Okabe that she is ever able to accept it and move on.") Mind you, they don't explicitly spell this out for you. It is what you infer from her actions and the affect on the environment.

What it sounds like is you just don't like the characters. That is the common breaking point when people don't like the show as much. People who love the show are also the ones who adore the characters. This is personal preference more than anything. I watched a lot of Hunter x Hunter and I never got invested in the characters. But I didn't like them much in the first place, so it colors my opinion. Same thing, different show.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really care about Steins;Gate characters at all, I rated it 9/10 for the excellent and original plot. Maybe if you think about Steins;Gate as a pure sci-fi show, it would be much more enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is my top anime, I disagree that the characters need to be deeper than they were in the show. To me I really like smaller scale stores that are about the characters in circumstances, this is what makes the show shine to me. The amount of anime that just scale out of proportion compared to the start, or even from the beginning, cause me to lose interest. Love the characters, well thought out plot, for me it was well paced and held my attention. Further on wanting deeper characters, a lot of people like how they don't all just have some dramatic backstory that shaped who they are but are just friends only just finished school.

I don't know what could be number one that would make everyone happy because no show is perfect, I don't think all the people who have it at number 1 think of it as a masterpiece just their favorite show. What show would you even call a masterpiece and expect people to agree with? Do you expect everyone to like something more than just the enjoyment they have from watching it? 

I think maybe your just expecting the number 1 for most people to be more than just the show they most enjoy, and expect the audience to want more than just enjoyment of a show. A lot of people just enjoyed watching it the most and don't care about appreciating some show because its a classic, or has some deeper level to it.

Is HxH really that good? It's on my plan to watch but ep count kind of makes me put it off every time I check to see what to watch next.

Does it have fillers and meaningless episodes like other long, fighting anime or is it more like FMA where every episode has meaning to it?
>> ARTICLE
HxH doesn't have any filler (except for 2 recap episode, 13 and 26 I believe) and you should skip those. It's praised mostly because it breaks the shounen mold of bullshit powerups and other things.

It's way less about the fights and has a really good story (especially the chimera ant arc), but the fights are still great and well animated anyway.

Just don't go into it with too high of expectations because it'll ruin it (along with literally any other show ever, assumptions ruin things).

We actually already had a [contest for this](http://animebracket.com/results/-r-anime-s-favourite-anime-of-all-time/?group=finals)
>> ARTICLE
The results for that were utterly different from this though.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it also included a larger amount of people which would explain why it was different.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that is how it works. The sample size is large enough to consider it a reasonably accurate.

Brackets operate differently to just straight up voting for your favourite anime, HxH didn't do so well in the brackets, but is no.2 over here. Brackets are more 'do you like anime A or anime B more?', people that may like anime A may REALLY like it, but people that like anime B more may just, *kind of* like it, while this is a straight up, what is your favourite.

A good example is AoT, ranks 33 on this list, but it beat out Toradora in the contest whilst Toradora ranks 20 on this list. Admitedly, results come out simular, but they are taking different types of data here.

edit: Too simplify it, this is taking a tally of how many people consider each anime their favourite anime.

Anime bracket did a vote of how many people liked anime A over anime B, not what was their favourite. 
>> ARTICLE
That's not a good argument, simply because of how the brackets are organized. The way it works is that the entries with the highest seeds go against the entires with the lowest seeds first. Meaning the ones who were voted in more, go against the ones who were voted in the least.

Besides, we can just look at the seeding for each show either way to nullify that argument.

1. Steins;Gate

2. FMA:B

3. Code Geass

4. FMA

5. Gurren Lagann

6. Fate/Zero

7. Toradora 

8. NGE

9. Kill la Kill

10. AoT

Considering the contest had a larger amount of people, rather than just regulars of /r/anime I believe the contest more. The problem with the OP's list is that its literally just people giving their top 3, and a lot of the time it wasn't even just that, they would list their top 10. Shows like Toradora and Hunter x Hunter have proved time and time again that their audience is just a vocal minority, in the contests they always get knocked out and aren't seeded as high as you would believe on /r/anime. However, shows like Steins;Gate, FMA:B and Monogatari have consistently gotten to the top in every type of contest with a large amount of people here. Then you have shows like Attack on Titan or Dragon Ball Z which have fanbases larger than you would imagine, given how poorly /r/anime will talk about them sometimes.

Though keep in mind i'm not saying that contest voting is the best way to gauge what a group of people think is the best, but I believe its more accurate than the way OP tallied up the votes- no offense.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just pointing out this is a different type of Data that has been collected here. 

If you had to answer what was r/anime's favourite anime, then the bracket would probably be your best bet, it is a mash up of everyone's opinion from r/anime.

If you had to answer what is the most common anime people consider their favourite anime on r/anime, this 'tally' would be more accurate. This is a different, there is no better or worse system between the two.
>> ARTICLE
My top two are the exact same as r/anime in the same order, I must have good taste.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad? Wait what? I hear NOTHING but how much people hate that show, but it's top 10?

Also, I really need to get around to watching FMA and the rest of Stein's Gate.  
>> ARTICLE
litteraly no one hates clannad, who the fuck do you listen too?
>> ARTICLE
oh yeah, I remember the first episode was quite the kick in the balls

I have read the first vol before it aired and when I watched the first episode I still cried.

I started Cross Game one night with the intent to watch a few episodes and then go to bed. I finished it sometime the next day with bags in my eyes.

All of it. All of my money. Empty my bank account, liquidate my house, I don't care. Make that happen.
>> ARTICLE
I think a game like *Dishonored,* that succeeds in building a unique setting, and hides a lot of lore within that setting, would translate well to an anime (or film) medium.  There's enough material to work with that the scriptwriters and directors don't have to impose their own ideas to connect the dots.  *Drakengard* would be another VG to anime I'd love to see.Going the other way is much the same.  Series that do an excellent job of worldbuilding could be used as settings for unique gaming experiences.  The best, in my mind, are those that use the video game as a "*Gaiden*" to the series.  A perfect example of this would be *Sword of the Berserk: Guts' Rage* for Dreamcast.  Rather than having the player repeat events of the *Berserk* anime/manga, the developers created a non-canon side story that was very much in keeping with the spirit of the source material. 
>> ARTICLE
In the same vein as *Dishonored*, *BioShock* would be perfect if they followed the stories of normal people trying to survive.  Struggling with having to kill people they know and balancing their splicing.  "How much can I splice to protect my family/friends before I lose my mind and kill them/get killed."

Have them struggle to find new places to live as their beautiful city quickly falls into disrepair and chaos.

Run ins with minor characters (there's a plethora of pre-written characters in the audio logs; most even have unique personalities) and some familiar settings popping up every now and then.

There would be some issues, though.  The biggest would probably be market interest.  I have no idea how popular BioShock was in Japan, but I imagine it wasn't that popular.  Japan isn't too big on FPS games.  This means it'll have to be privately funded or crowd funded.

Another issue would be the ending.  How do you end a story like that?  A soft conclusion is one option, but those tend to be weak.  The obvious endings for our characters in the world of Rapture are either death or turning into an insane Splicer, which leads to death anyway.  All the endings to BS1 and BS2 leave anyone remaining in Rapture high and dry (no pun intended) so a happy ending would be hard to write.

The best ending I can think of would be to have the characters (after solving whatever main issue the show is about be resolved) see wreckage of the plane crash come sinking down in between the buildings of their now ruined city.  That would send chills up my spine.  People might not like it as it would essentially be a cliffhanger ending.  Albeit a well executed one.

Last issue I could think of would be the amount of graphic content.  We've got people being mutating and being surgically altered.  We've got people being shot and stabbed, set on fire and electrocuted.  Lastly, and probably the biggest issue would be the people getting drilled to death.  That's a violent, graphic death, and it happens a lot.  I think there are studios that aren't afraid of that, though, and it could be animated faithfully.

**tl;dr**: BioShock has all the elements in place for a show, but production would be rough as hell.
>> ARTICLE
You definitely have the right idea with why it probably couldn't happen, as Bioshock wasn't a big thing in Japan (or Asia) but I could still see it happening by either a highly regarded studio (Madhouse, Bones, Trigger (if they can get the money, etc.) or an up-and-coming one if 2K were to approach them on it. After all, Borderlands is getting a point click game from Tell Tale, so 2K is definitely interested in expanding into other genres and possibly other mediums. The story basically wrote itself, now it just needs a good push in the right direction. It could surface new popularity and brand familiarity if done right, so who knows what's possible. The idea of a medium of entertainment transcending barriers into other forms has always intrigued me.
>> ARTICLE
Any game with a setting as ripe as Rapture is perfect for branching out into a new medium.  I think one of the biggest reasons it seems so perfect is the fact that it seems so unexplored.  Rapture feels like it has endless stories to tell and as Jack and Delta you only see a limited number of them.

I actually had Madhouse in mind since they wouldn't shy away from the graphic nature of the story.

I think if a show like Baccano can be popular then a show taking place in Rapture could be popular as well.  Speaking of which, Brains Base would also be a great studio for it.

I also think input from Ken Levine would be an absolute requirement for me.  If he's not involved with it, then I can't really trust that the narrative will be well executed.
>> ARTICLE
Do you think that that plays into it; the fact that it's enough of the world that you can project yourself onto your favorite character, but interactive enough that you feel in control rather than sitting back watching something you have no control over? 
>> ARTICLE
Oh absolutely.  Given the alternative of bastardizing the source material (where fans already know the ending and canon progression) to create the illusion of control, I'll take a side story every time.  

>> ARTICLE
Now that brings up a point. Granted it isn't anime, but hear me out. Something like the X-Men or Star Wars franchises, that have these huge universes; multiple video games; multiple expanded universes; and iteration after iteration of stories that either dont belong to the official cannon or are so obscure that the average Joe would never even know they exist. Switch that over to the example of anime to video games; if they start creating video games that act as expansions to an already existing story that has a conclusion, at what point do you think that expanding would start to become a barrier to entry for new comers; simply because there is so much material? 
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like the Fate series to me.
>> ARTICLE
Speaking for *Star Wars,* the *Shadows of the Empire* game for N64, which was directly based on the (now non-canon) expanded universe novel by the same name, and the wholly original BioWare *Kinghts of the Old Republic* titles were great.  Completely non-essential to the story depicted in the films, but utilizing ideas, locations and characters with which both hardcore and casual fans of the series had familiarity.

What is bad is something like the .hack// franchise, where the games became an integral part of the series' canon, and raised the bar for entry into and progression of the non-interactive series.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit I never knew I wanted a Dishonoured anime but now I totally do. It's such a rich, vibrant world that you could do any sort of story. 
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely.  There are *a lot* more ideas in that game than you'd expect, given the actual playtime.  And the player is only shown pieces of one city in that world, to boot.As an aside, I mentioned in a thread a while back that *Dishonored* would make a great crossover if paired with *Hitsugi no Chaika,* and I stand by that statement.
>> ARTICLE
Log Horizon is just *perfect* for a video game adaptation. I'd play the shit out of Elder Tale, IRL obligations be damned!
>> ARTICLE
Well apparently, the creator of Log Horizon was an avid player of Everquest and that's what he based Elder Tale off of.

So technically there is a game for Log Horizon.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention the official Log Horizon tabletop RPG. /tg/'s done a partial translation, but it needs more work. [This](http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/31765407/) was the only thing I could find on sup/tg/. I wouldn't be surprised if there's something more that didn't get archived, but if so, I'm not aware of it.
>> ARTICLE
Right off the bat, that brings up an interesting point. Those anime that are specifically about video games (Log Horizon, SAO, .//hack) Would you say they are uniquely qualified for a video game counterpart? Because, I totally agree. If a real life SAO counterpart came out, I would pay all the money; potential being trapped in a video game, aside. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, games based off light novels like that take a lot of resources, mostly because the worlds are huge and it is difficult to fully replicate that. If its not up to fan expectations, it will not turn out too well. It probably can and will be done in the future, but its no easy task. 
>> ARTICLE
Well... there is a SAO game on Vita.
>> ARTICLE
Can I ask what you mean by the worlds being huge? Do you mean just size or complexity and intricacy?
>> ARTICLE
I believe he means both. Sword Art Online had 100 huge floors, each with its own monsters and settings and dungeons, and was able to support thousands of players simultaneously. Elder Tale was even more complex and was even larger. It used the Half Gaia project, so everything was half the distance that it should have been in the real world, but that's still a *really really big map*, since they recreated the whole planet!
>> ARTICLE
Yep, basically this. It would be very difficult to completely replicate the source games. For SAO, they can just shrink the floors and make them less complex, but for LH there is just no way to try and replicate the intricacies of the world, its too vast. they could cut it down to one huge area like all of Japan, but even then the world is huge. It pretty much out scales most games. Not only would it be difficult to make, but it would need a powerful system to run. 
>> ARTICLE
I have not seen Log horizon but compared to the World Of Warcraft world how big is this? And I would like to add that only a big game company would be able to spend enough money to make a really big world that does look good
>> ARTICLE
Its 1/2 scale of Earth
>> ARTICLE
okay that might be a bit too much to make right?
>> ARTICLE
All we can do is pray that in 20 years gaming technology has advanced far enough to make something like that a reality.
>> ARTICLE
We probably *could* make a half-scale Japan in a game engine, it's just that you'd need a supercomputer to run it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but they could split it in sections or something but then they would not stay true to the source material I guess
>> ARTICLE
Definitely agree with that. Look at games like Fuel and WoW. While not really the most visually amazing games, they are thumb blisteringly massive. They could do that with Japan. 
>> ARTICLE
Fuel still takes only about 2 or 2.5 hours to drive across diagonally. [Japan is a lot bigger than we think](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VpJmsjYgIUQ/UVvfmwWNLYI/AAAAAAAAAbM/TNoGhpq0GyM/s1600/size_comparison_tokyo_stlouis.png). Driving from the north border to south border of Minnesota alone takes 6 or 7 hours with no traffic.
>> ARTICLE
It really depends on the type of game and direction the show goes in. The recent Shingeki no Bahamut Genesis doesn't seem to be based off the game too much besides the basic lore and some characters. Others like Pokemon try to adapt the loose storyline while extending or changing  it to fit timeframes. If the Game has a solid story or at least direction, the anime can often times be good. The show itself can also be very good, but not relate to the game very much. 

If the characters are engaging and the plot progresses, then the anime usually turns out well, even though it has gone from an active to passive role for the viewer. 

An example of game to anime done bad was the recent Blade and Soul. It was repetitive and honestly just became boring so many people dropped it. 
>> ARTICLE
That also brings up an interesting point of how far a anime or game can spread itself from the original to the point where it doesn't feel connected. I never watched nor played Shingeki no Bahamut; but based on what you said it doesnt sound like its completely divorced from its original source material. In regards to something like the Tales of Symphonia games and anime, where they all but rip the dialogue and events verbatim between the two mediums; whatd you think then. Deal breaker? 

My apologies, that last sentence confuses me. How do you mean a show can be good, but not relate to the show?

>> ARTICLE
I think the reason (as suggested in the SnB:G ep.2 discussion) that it's so good is that the game has no storyline, so the writers are completely free to go nuts instead of sticking to a preconceived notion viewers have about the story.
>> ARTICLE
Whoops, last part was a typo, fixed it.

For Shingeki no Bahamut, the anime is action packed, but is based off a card type game. The game graphics and interface leave much to be desired. The anime though has been interesting so far. Haven't seen the tales of Symphonia anime so I can't comment on that. If the anime is exactly the same as the game, some people that played the game might find it boring, or people that watched it may not buy the game. The anime is meant to promote the game, so they will usually change stuff enough that it is still interesting but not exactly the same. Take Pokemon for example. While Ash follows the basic "catch/train Pokemon, beat Gyms" formula as the games, they do have addition characters and side stories to try and keep it interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I will say one thing for sure: Drop and do different story or stick faithfully to original story.



Don't go somewhere between and suck like Blade and Soul did. 
>> ARTICLE
So, do you mean literally no deviation at all? Like, it needs to be 100% the same; dialouge, events, character interactions, locations and all? 
>> ARTICLE
Basically don't change the plot. And DO NOT change the finale.
>> ARTICLE
Of course 100% would be impossible, but it shouldn't touch how the story goes.
>> ARTICLE
Forgot that was a game...
>> ARTICLE
I love video game/anime crossovers but I think far too little thought goes into the process. There are so many factors involved but I believe, though it may not be a fact, that most companies don't look at this issue with much thought and instead view it as easy money. Certain games do well in certain genres and with certain developers, however this almost never happens.

A good example of what would be an amazing match is a Kill La Kill game done by Platinum games. Platinum is a Japanese company so they would understand the cultural intricacies and references of Kill La Kill and they both have use an over-the-top style, I also believe the hack and slash genre fits best with Kill la Kill's content. The same goes with the reverse, the right people for the job should be given the opportunity to animate a series. In all honesty for this scenario I would personally prefer original stories to be used, WIXROSS and Bahamut are some good current examples of this working extremely well.

There's a video on a game review of an Adventure Time game on this topic of consideration being put into an adaptation, and how little it seems that most companies care about doing it right. A good reverse would be Pokemon, as much as I watched it when I was a kid, and granted the quality has gone up lately, a good chunk of Pokemon has been plain terrible, especially in comparison to the games or manga. I can't tell you how many times I've ranted about how great Silver (the rival of Gen 2) is such an amazing character as opposed to the majority of the series. (Talking about the games in this example) To me, if people aren't putting love into projects like these I'd rather they just not exist at all.

I don't wanna keep adding to this post as long as it is but another example I want to point out is Disgaea. The anime is such a mess, when the games story (which it loosely follows) is amazing, not to mention the world in Disgaea is arguably infinite and the characters have such long lifespans yet no effort went into making what would have been an easily crafted original story. You could make an anime in the Disgaea universe without even using main characters and still be good, yet it feels like it was done as an advertisement more than anything.
>> ARTICLE
It will depend on the anime and the game, not all stories will be compatible with a different medium. For example, many people wouldn't enjoy an anime adaptation of a game if it didn't have a story, compelling characters, etc.

Using SAO as an example - it's supposed to be an MMO, but the idea of clearing levels doesn't really fit this genre of games, but it gives this feel of having a greater purpose, which is vital in anime, that's exactly the purpose the hundred floors serve in the story.

Personally I can't really enjoy a story if it doesn't have an ultimate goal whereas games can have no goal at all like Minecraft or most sandbox games and still be extremely enjoyable to play.

Good games can be made from a compelling story alone, but it's very difficult because what most people want out of their games is to play it rather than watch it. And I would also argue that if a game is based on story alone maybe it's worth considering making something else with the story.

Trying to think of an anime that might make a good game now outside from the obvious answers like SAO and LH, I'll update my post if I think of anything.
>> ARTICLE
How important is compelling story in video games, though? Obviously extremely important to have a gripping story, but can it live off of that by itself? Take something like Spice and Wolf. That story had me by the balls after episode 2 of the first season; I honestly don't think that it would make a good game. Its story is too based on slow economics and story arcs, which I dont think would have for an engaging game. 
>> ARTICLE
Depends on the game and the audience. My 2 favourite games recently, The Witcher 2, and Deus Ex Human Revolution have some of the best stories of any media I've ever seen. Its rarely a downside.
>> ARTICLE
Deus Ex HR has a solid story yeah, but the story in The Witcher 2 isn't anything special - the original novels are much better in that department. Still, TW2 is one of my favorite RPGs and damn.. that game is hard as fuck in the higher difficulties.
>> ARTICLE
It's not the norm yeah, games are meant to be played after all. While there are successful games that focus on story like Final Fantasy, Persona they will never be as popular as games like Minecraft, LoL, DotA, Hearthstone, etc.

Now think about anime, how important is compelling story in it? I'd say a lot, which is why I think there is low compatibility between anime and games.


>> ARTICLE
  Since you mentioned FF, i'm pretty surprised there hasn't been an FF anime adaptation yet. Especially VIII, i think it would be amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I think the general consensus is that they already did and just spliced it into the game
>> ARTICLE
That's a fair point, I guess. An anime that doesn't have a story that grips you may as well have placed its head in the guillotine. You bring up Final Fantasy. Whatd you think of the controversy that that game wants to be more of a movie with its cinematics and animation than a video game with its gameplay? 

Also, not ashamed to admit that it took me a solid three minutes to find the correct spelling on the word guillotine. Shout out to having a poor grasp on spelling.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's true that games contain all elements present in other mediums in addition to **interactivity**, which is exclusive to games:

Personally, my favorite form of entertainment is playing games, but I don't think games are superior to other mediums. While games can do everything others can do they probably wont excel at it, which is why games are at their best when they favor gameplay and interactivity over other elements.

Sure you could make a game with a great story and minimal gameplay, but at that point I would start to question "should this really be a game and not something else?".
>> ARTICLE
 To be fair, FF games have pretty solid gameplay. A game like MGS 4 would be a better example of what you're saying.
>> ARTICLE
Magi, that'd be a pretty sick videogame. 
>> ARTICLE
I might sound crazy about this, but I've always thought that Magi would make a really good Fire Emblem type game. Especially because of the fact that there are a lot of royals and lords in the show.
>> ARTICLE
Anime series with complex and we'll setup world's have huge potential as RPG's and games. The characters, the ideas and the mechanics are basically set up for you.

It's just a matter of getting the license, choosing the correct mechanics path, and having a passion for creating games and watching anime.

I also discussed theb [possibly of a Open world One Piece game](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2btokd/what_anime_would_make_the_best_video_game_and_why/cj8ssa0) a while back
>> ARTICLE
That sounds like Fusionfall to me somehow
>> ARTICLE
The world of One Piece is so well crafted that you can have a "make your own adventure game so easily" but no effort goes into these kinds of ideas even though so many One Piece games have been made. I want to blame it on lack of popularity but that isn't even the case in Japan.
>> ARTICLE
Depends on the game genres each side is going for. I have played the crap out of some of the old DBZ fighting games such as budokai 2. Also Naruto UNS3 is probably the best 3D fighter I have ever played other than a few annoying characters (screw you neji players!). 

As for the other way around, the game would have to have a solid story to back up a viewing experience. Would be interested in a God of War anime, just saiyan.
>> ARTICLE
I will forever be annoyed at the fact that they took out the customization from the first UNS. T_T
>> ARTICLE
Dude, it's all about that Neji air combo that takes off, like, a bar and a half of health. With you on that one, though. Screw Neji players and all that they stand for. Madara is not much better, in my experience. 

Naruto is very about fighting, so it translates very easily into a fighting game. Because, if anyone bought that game for its story mode and not its one-on-one fighting, obviously had no idea what they were going into. Naruto obviously has a very solid story to have gone on now for a decade and a half, but that clearly doesn't translate well into video game story. Do you think it plays in well with anime that don't have such (for lack of a better term) restrictive genres?

>> ARTICLE
Maybe I was the only one who enjoyed the story campaign in UNS3 D: 

I really enjoyed the Naruto vs Sasuke and the Itachi/Sasuke vs Kabuto "boss" battles. 

As for genre, I really can't see many genres that work outside of fighting games other than a 3D platformer, or another MOBA ripoff. Really the whole goal is to play as your favorite character. As soon as you move into genres such as first person or RTS you lose that aesthetic and the original characters are just super glued in to add to sales.

The only other thing that really comes to mind is if you consider visual novels a video game type, which in that case can often be done quite well.
>> ARTICLE
You know, I give the Naruto games campaign a lot of grief. I'm a gamer as much as I'm an anime fan; and that campaign is up there with the worst I've ever played. But, if you thought it was good, don't let me tell you otherwise. Games and anime both are entertainment; and nothing defiles the spirit of entertainment more than listening to another's opinion over your own on the quality of whatever that entertainment is. If you enjoyed it, all the power in the world to you.
>> ARTICLE
I will admit that some of it is a bit cheesy and they obviously are just trying to add additional fights to increase the campaign length, but I thought the base was done well enough.

I think I appreciated being able to run through the Leaf Village more than anything and having random battles with Lee, etc. It made the world seem so much more real. 

The rest of the open world was a bit of a snore however and sometimes annoying to travel through. 
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't even that it was a snore, in my opinion. It's about as open world as a glass hallway. You can see outside, but try and go to any of the cool places youre looking at and BAM! Invisible wall. That's just a major pet peeve of mine. If I wanted to look at amazing scenory, I would look outside and not pay 60 bucks to do it. Also, screw that camera. Screw it in all its muggy, "I'm not gonna move from this position no matter where you go on the screen" retardation.

Flip side of that, there are few other 3D fighters that can hold a stick to it and it is fairly faithful to the fighting styles of the person you're playing as. There isn't much overlap with the play styles of seperate characters and overall it feels like you're in the Naruto universe. Smash Bros. Brawl is really the only fighter that I like more than it. 
>> ARTICLE

I think the *Sword of the Berserk* Dreamcast game I mentioned avoids that pitfall because of the developers' knowledge and love of the source material.  It could have been a generic beat-'em-up game with a *Berserk* face, but the presentation went beyond that by retaining the manga's characterizations, creating a game world that was believable as *Berserk,* and incorporating some little touches (not being able to swing the Dragonslayer in narrow areas) that were nods to canon events.

They also utilized Susumu Hirasawa, who composed the music for the 1997 anime, to create a phenomenal and original game soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
If we look at the effectiveness of the adaptations then i feel that really depends on several circumstances. Take Nitro+ syfy trilogy for example. Chaos;Head had a good story and good characters, however limited budget and a limit of 12 episodes resulted in a mess. They simply tried to put to much inside to little and the outcome was terrible. Then we have Steins;Gate, the took the key points and story(VN is full of very detailed scientific information regarding the theory behind the phone wave, and lots of side conversations.) and they had enough episodes to properly space the series. It had a proper beginning, middle, climax, and ending. It then was able to take everything and build out a bit with some comical nonsense and a bit of final closure via OVA and movie. All in all creating a successful series. Robotics;Notes took a more Steins;Gate approach in adapting but fell short mostly because it was held up against Steins;Gate and reality fell short of expectations.

If we look at series like Devil May Cry: The Animation or GunGrave  where a show is created by taking info from a source and creating around it you have a different story. Start with DMC, they took characters and story points from a existing source but they created something completely different. They created a whole new story that fit in between existing tales, took a few minutes here and there to explain characters for those who hadnt played the games, and wrote a story that answered some questions that had been left open for debate. By taking this approach they created a series, IMO that was quite a delightful addition the existing universe. They created an engaging story with strong characters that gave you an insight to the "what happened between point A and B" questions.

In the case of GunGrave, they took a game that had a story but focused mostly on game play. They simply took what existed and elaborated on it in greater detail.

As for taking an anime and swapping it over, i feel like that would have a lot to do with the story of the anime. While they can easily(and frequently do) make battle royale stye game that simply consists of various fights using notable characters from a series. To make a more interactive game i feel like the story would need to fit into one of two categories. 

1. Have plot points that are both interesting and unresolved. There has to be enough interesting story material that fans want answers to create a game. Creating a game where someone can take control of their favorite character and discover answers they really want to know is a great way to catch hold of fan support.

2. Have an expansive enough universe. Its easy to create a game when you have a big enough story universe that you can do something completely new but still manage to tie it into the existing content.

Some of the Tales of games have animated versions of their stories (I believe Abyss' was completed and I'm not sure if symphonia's ever completed, vesperia I don't believe has a full telling though it does have mini movies or something along those lines) that actually work very well. I'd suggest checking them out if you enjoy JRPG's or the tales series in general, though do note that since the show goes through the exact story that the game does watching/playing one is going to give you the entire plot of the other (should be obvious enough but I felt the disclaimer would be good to have anyways).

They are well done though and I personally think the idea that a game can be represented by a show/the other way around can easily work out. It's the same with books to TV, yes there are a lot of scenario's where it falls apart *cough*Eragon*cough*, but there are also fantastic examples such as LoTR and GoT. In the end games, movies, books, they all tell stories despite being different mediums. A good story/characters should shine across all three mediums as long as the material is treated well.
>> ARTICLE
Symphonia , Phantasia , Eternia , Vesperia and Abyss all have anime adaptions. Tales of Vesperia's was an anime original movie which served as a prequel (and was quite good). Ive not seen the adaptions of Eternia or Phantasia but i can say without a doubt that Abyss's adaption was far better then Symphonia's. The pacing was done much better and scenes were done almost 1 : 1 how they appeared in the show (except in anime form).
>> ARTICLE
I've seen phantasia and it comes in close to the end of the story and is only 4 episodes. If you haven't played the game you'd probably be very confused. From what I read eternia doesn't even get half way through the game.

I think Shaft could do it justice
>> ARTICLE
shaft should never make anime with actual plot....kagerou project is the proof....brains base should probably do it...
>> ARTICLE
You can't judge a studio by just one of their adaptations...

Shaft did an incredible job adapting the Monogatari series as well as original stories like Madoka Magica. There's also their adaptation of Nisekoi (Source material aside) and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. Ignoring all of this for their poor adaptation of Mekakucity Actors and saying they should never make anime with a plot is just ignorant.
>> ARTICLE
Does SZS *really* count as having a plot?
>> ARTICLE
Anime and games only really align on a singular aspect: story. They need to meet a compromising middle ground for such transitions to be possible. Games with two little story would make terrible shows, and shows that have too much plot with little focus would make terrible games.

Therefore, to find a game that would fit well as an anime, it needs to already possess a decent story or environment to play with. It doesn't need to be a story taken directly from the game, just as long as a compelling story can be told faithfully to the source material.

An anime becoming a game is a bit harder, because it's a narrower fit. You need to have a coherent story, focused on a specific protagonist or set of protagonists, and gameplay that makes sense with the story and the environment. Gameplay is usually one of the earliest steps in designing a game and the story is then crafted around that, so it's a bit harder when you're working with already-established details.

I think To The Moon would make a great show.

The super robot wars franchise has proven that you can definitely mash together a bunch of different shows and get some really great games.

I actually really like the Naruto Broken Bonds game (and the prequal, I forgot what it was called, Path of Ninja?). The storm games had so much potential with the graphics but the story modes and combo system were so linear and boring. 

If it is an action anime I believe it has a place in a game IF it is done well. 
>> ARTICLE
Well I think it would be good for anime that have games in them or "playable" scenarios like the world god only knows. Which would be a dating sim. 
For games into anime... It would be very specific. Games with a true story above or equal to gameplay would have to be on the table.

I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.

i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.

They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!

KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.

For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

steins gate movie isn't on the list though

Keep in mind these aggregate lists do not necessarily indicate quality, only shows/movies that are widely accepted. People should not treat these lists as "ranks" or anything short of "100 most popular anime."

Eh it's also not popularity, or http://myanimelist.net/anime/5420/Kemono_no_Souja_Erin would not have made it up there.

If you want to be really accurate: it's a list of shows/movies people enjoyed enough to rate highly after they watched them.

Reborn! at 86 is a nice surprise. I think Naruto part 1 deserves to be in this list but it makes sense that it isn't, considering the hate it gets on mal. The top review there complains about its popularity in its first paragraph.

From my quick scan it seems like I only got 30/100.

I don't believe the scores I gave them were that great anyways so I don't feel too bad about missing out on the rest of the top 100.

Well actually they come out to 5.3 which is slightly above my average. Guess they did a lot better than I expected.

Hum, having seen many of them among this list, I would say that they are all interesting to watch, pretty much must watch's. In your place, i would feel pretty bad :/

90/100 that I've at least seen parts of. Two of the ones I'm missing I'm reading the manga of and have no intention of ever picking up the anime, and three of them are Ghibli movies.

I would really like to revisit this chart once Season 2 of Shokugeki no Soma is animated by JC Staff. Autumn Election final 8 is, IMO, the strongest arc of the manga.

Yay for Slam Dunk making in to the top 100. Very first sports anime that I watched and enjoyed. I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, I dodnt even realize that lol

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

Angels Beats is always rated high for some reason :/. I liked it, but there are many others that are definitely better.

So happy to see spice and wolf on this list. I just recently found it and binged it this weekend and its now up with stiens;Gate as my personal best show of all time

You still combined Kenshin TV with the OVAs.  They're really way too different IMO.  We're talking completely different genres here.  Fate Zero and UBW are far more alike than those.

Seriously? I don't want to say it's overrated especially after seeing the thread earlier about calling something overrated but come on. If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people. Maybe I just don't see it but can someone please tell me what is so good about this show cause I rated it a 7(and I think this may be overdoing it)and that is mainly due to the animation. The jokes can only be funny for so long and I didn't even find them that funny in the first place.
>One Punch Man | 9.02 | 12 Eps | 2015

OPM is a really good show. But no way it should ever be above Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people don't agree with you on this as seen by the rank. It's not worth complaining over because you personally dislike it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not blankly complaining. I actually want to know what it is that makes people go nuts over the show and want to have pseudo discussion.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why people like game of thrones but i'm not just going to complain about its imdb rank am i?
>> ARTICLE
So this is clearly going over your head. I said I want to hear what other people are saying as to why it's so good. Do you not want to hear people's reasoning for their differing opinions?
>> ARTICLE
Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol
>> ARTICLE
It bothers me cause I have a friend that during the entire Fall season only talked about OPM and it was starting to piss me off.
>> ARTICLE
Lol, u prob wanted to stay off of /r/anime during the entire fall season then.
>> ARTICLE
the guy probably wanted you to get the same enjoyment he experienced, I dont think he meant any harm. 

I think anyone would be pissed off if they experienced what you did with any show, not just OPM.
>> ARTICLE
I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.
>> ARTICLE
recommend a show of yours he hasnt watched, if he likes something you like, youll solve that problem lol.
>> ARTICLE
It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.
>> ARTICLE
True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.
>> ARTICLE
Why do we need this thread posted every week?
>> ARTICLE
I'm here quite a bit, usually I just see people complain, I think this is only the second time I've seen a consolidated list.

Nice post OP I agree, but I'd also like to throw in Hajime no Ippo and Haikyuu! 


Along with Kuroko no Basket if you're fine with shonen tropes. It's still a great watch though, crazy fun.


I've also heard great things about Slam Dunk, but I haven't gotten around to watching it yet :(

Hajime no Ippo seems to ahve too slow of a start for many fans. might not want to suggest that be one of the starting ones since it gives a bigger chance of being dropped early.

>> ARTICLE
Slam Dunk is really good. Was my first sports anime and I inevitably use it as a benchmark to gauge whether a sports anime is worth watching or not. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm fine with sports anime, Chihayafuru being mybfavorite one. That said, what other sports anime do you recommend that doesn't have shonen tropes?
>> ARTICLE
If Chihayafuru is your favorite, then I recommend [Hikaru no Go!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/135/Hikaru_no_Go)
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd argue Hikaru no Go has a fair few shounen tropes in it. But I definitely still think you should give it a shot if Chihayafuru is your favorite.

[Baby Steps](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21185/Baby_Steps) is another one you could check out. Between tennis being a one-man sport, the MCs personality, and a helping of romance on the side, it shouldn't feel too shounen-y. But again, it *is* a shounen and there is some shounen tropes.

And if you haven't seen [One Outs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5040/One_Outs), there's that too. It's one of the few seinen sports anime out there. A lot psychological mind games going on while a badass MC plays baseball as a means of gambling.


>> ARTICLE
> Hajime no Ippo

Yep. Not only a good show because of its story, but also because it has one of the best and [most varied OSTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V5UH0HoAz8) I've heard in anime. I don't know of any other anime that would be brave enough to include noise tracks into their soundtrack, but damn does it work well in this show.
>> ARTICLE
It's also very technically accurate, which is a selling point to anyone who's already interested in boxing.
>> ARTICLE
Also an accurate "fighting" manga, well more street-fighting but follows similarly, is Holyland, no anime, but it's good af.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend Slam Dunk's manga instead. The art is fantastic and it doesn't suffer from pacing issues. The first game in the anime took something like 7 episodes which is essentially 1/3 of one season of Kuroko. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree. I was kinda surprised because he didn't menton any big sports anime. 

Eyeshield 21 and Major are good ones too.
>> ARTICLE
I would say 2/3 of those are big sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's by chance that OP picked three sports anime where the sport takes a backseat, it's a good way to get into the genre. Cross Game is a baseball anime about coming-of-age, romance etc, and then you have shows like Oofuri which is a baseball anime about baseball. They're both great but one is easier to sell to newcomers.
>> ARTICLE
Not just to sell to new comers, personally I find that the best sports series are those that are blended with other genres rather than being  purely **about** sport.

If you're young try watching a sports anime, you may be inspired to play it for a team.

When I was in grade 7, I started watching Kuroko and by October I was obsessed with basketball. I already played a lot of sports so I decided to pick it up and I loved it. 

Basketball shaped my grade 8 year quite a bit. I got a lot better at basketball and it became odd if I wasn't seen with a basketball near me. I have a bunch of new friends that I made from playing basketball, and they're most of them are great people. It really started to feel surreal when I hit the game winner for our first win of the season (we went on to win 2 games). Being shoved around while "Luna" is being chanted was a feeling of pure bliss.

I also watched Eyeshield 21, and it inspired me to play rugby. I was pretty fast compared to others, and managed to be one of our best try scorers averaging 2-3 a game. If you're not downright terrible and nice, you'll make friends. 

The biggest thing I can thank Kuroko for was winning athlete of the year for boys in grade 8. If any anime is going to shape your life, I think sports anime are the ones that will change it.

I'm heading into grade 9 now, and am playing Rugby 7s for my school. I love every second of it.

Umm eyeshield is about American football, not rugby.

Every time there's a discussion about sports anime I feel obligated to bring attention to the most criminally underwatched one of all: *[Touch](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1065/Touch)*. With less than 10k members on MAL and scored by 3.5k users, *Touch* fits the bill like no other.

"Why the hell would I want to watch a 101-episode anime about high school baseball from 1985?! Surely an anime from that period looks like ass! I don't even like baseball and even if I did, I don't have time for one hundred fucking episodes!" 

These were the thoughts going through my head before I watched it and, if you're reading this, I'm sure you're thinking along the same lines. I realize there seems to be a huge barrier to entry with this anime, but hear me out.

Those of you who watch sports anime may be familiar with the highly regarded *Cross Game*. *Touch* is the predecessor from the same venerable mangaka and, as expected, it has everything that makes *Cross Game* great  perfect mix of drama, slice of life, comedy and romance. It also does everything a bit better (IMO). Its characters are more likeable, its story is more interesting and its music is more memorable. I even prefer the visual style and character designs despite it being two decades older.

Unlike most sports anime where antagonists just happen to be the Opponent of the Day (*Hajime no Ippo, Kuroko no Basket*), *Touch* takes a different approach, one that's less conventionally sports-like and more drama-like. In other words, the drama and tension in *Touch* do not come from sports scenarios  they come from people. (That's why it doesn't matter if you don't give a rat's ass about high school baseball; if you can enjoy a good story, you can enjoy *Touch*.)

One of the main antagonists is the MC's twin brother. The other is the team's coach, you know, the guy who is supposed to help the MC's team win. The amount of drama created by these characters is delicious. There's no bullshit, just pure vanilla storytelling featuring characters that are likeable and incredibly human at the same time. (By the way, if you've seen *Cross Game* and you think you know all about villainous coaches, you ought to see the one in Touch who is a lot more fleshed out.) 

To address the production quality: no, don't expect *Haikyuu*! level of quality, but it is remarkably good for its time. The animation is simple but effective  there's no real lapse in quality compared to its notable contemporaries like the 1988 *Legend of the Galactic Heroes* or the 1986 *Maison Ikkoku*. Hell, it manages to look better than a lot of 90s anime (eg. *Great Teacher Onizuka*). Whereas those shows have noticeable animation issues, *Touch* gets the job done without offending your eyes. It has an old school charm that you not only get used to but may fall in love with like I did. 

I urge everyone to give it a try, doubly so if you are already a fan of sports anime. If you're like me, you'll quickly realize that you're in for the long haul by the end of the first episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I really need to watch Touch, it's on my PTW list, but I'm sticking by the rule of one long show at a time and I'm currently working through *Maison Ikkoku*. I think it might just be the one after that though, I loved *Cross Game* enough to dive in without hesitation.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who deferred my watch of Touch for a very long time I can confidently say after finishing it last week that it is definitely on par with Cross Game.

I would recommend penciling it in as your next big viewing if it's already high on your priorities.
>> ARTICLE
It is very high on my PTW list, but *Maison Ikkoku* takes quite a while to complete. It'll probably be up next after that, though I do need to prepare myself a little emotionally, as I have some major suspicions about the show (nothing spoiled however).
>> ARTICLE
It is Adachi we're talking about here so that suspicion is completely fair.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, I thought as much. I have faith in his writing skills though, so it's not really a deterrent.
>> ARTICLE
Touch is an absolute classic and I like to recommend it whenever I get the chance. Harada is one of my all-time favorite characters. I just wish it was a little easier to find subs for the series online. I found the files, but almost no one is seeding so it took over a week to download the series. It was worth it though. 
>> ARTICLE
This show is a masterpiece and I admittedly avoided watching it for awhile for no reason other than it aired in 1985.

I consider Cross Game to be within the top 5 best anime of the past decade and Adachi a master of writing and after finishing Touch last week I can safely add it to my favourites list and mention that it holds its own among any of Adachi's works.
>> ARTICLE
I will happily second this. 

Touch is my third favourite of Adachi's series (H2, Cross Game, Touch) but it is still a stellar series for all the reasons you outlined.

Personally I'd recommend reading Touch and H2, but the anime of Cross Game is an improvement from the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I get giddy when I see H2 mentioned. And then I feel sympathy back pain. 
>> ARTICLE
H2 is high on my manga priority list! 

It's not everyday I can have a discussion with someone who has seen both Cross Game and Touch so, if you'll indulge me, I'm curious as to why your ranking is the way it is.

I don't generally watch sports anime, but I haven't seen one that wasn't great so I don't know what's keeping me from watching them. Chihayafuru, Hikaru no Go, Baby Steps, Ping Pong the Animation, all awesome.

Ace of the Diamond is also a fantastic recent sports anime, very shounen.
>> ARTICLE
Ace of Diamond is a great series, but even as someone who loves it, it suffers a great deal from glacial pacing at the beginning. 

It's not the fault of the series, the pacing is slow because it's introducing a large cast and their relationships with one another but if I hadn't swapped to the manga so I could burn through it faster the first dozen or so episodes of the show would have turned me off entirely.

I wouldn't call those bad (except Ro-Kyu-Bu cause I've never heard about it). Major is awesome,btw.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm assuming that not only their quality is poor, but sports anime fanbases are extremely rabid. 
>> ARTICLE
meh, all fanbases are rabid.
>> ARTICLE
I can't even remember what differences there are between Air Gear's anime and manga so I doubt it was a trainwreck. But if you give a solid explanation I could accept that.

Hikaru no Go doesn't *really* count as sports, but it's a fucking terrific anime, nothing mediocre about it. It certainly made *me* want to play go.

And Major is the best baseball anime hands down. Even the sections I consider the weakest are still great, IMO.  
>> ARTICLE
They cut *a lot* of content from Air Gear, which isn't really that good a manga in the first place. 

When Major is boring, it's *boring*.
>> ARTICLE
Hikaru no Go was very successful at introducing people to Go. I now go to a Go club because of it and many people in the club have said that they started playing after Hikaru no Go.
>> ARTICLE
And a bunch of people started playing Mahjong because of Saki, which doesn't mean that Saki is good.
>> ARTICLE
Depends on your taste, I guess. I really despise very unrealistic sports anime/manga like Prince of Tennis. It's a fucking trainwreck.
>> ARTICLE
What? You don't like 16ish year olds almost killing each other with a freaking tennis ball!? 
>> ARTICLE
Hey! Great write-up man, I hope more people pick up sports anime, they are amazing and many of them belong to my favorites. *hust* Cross Game *hust*
>> ARTICLE
I think out of most anime, I take the most away from Sports anime. I'm not a very athletic type, but seeing things like Haikyu!! and Kuroko made me pick up sports for fun because I wanted to experience their experience, sadly my schools teams are already pretty bad, so I'm not gonna get any Generation of Miracles or Karasuno team.
>> ARTICLE
I watched 12 episodes of Chihayafuru; didn't like it at all.  I couldn't care about any of the characters, and the plot was very predictable/cliche.

Ping Pong the Animation is fantastic though; all of the characters are amazing and with huge depth & development.
>> ARTICLE
If you don't like Chihayafuru by that point, you'll never like it. I rated it 10/10 and loved it from the first 3~ episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, thanks for confirming. I watched about four episodes and just felt... unimpressed. I'm glad to hear that my decision to drop was rational. 
>> ARTICLE
have the same opinion but i only watched up to 6 episodes of Chihayafuru and called it quits. The plot was super predictable and i didnt like any of the characters, actually they infuriated me especially the male childhood friend of the mc. He was a creepy douche but no one said anything about it, it rubbed me the wrong way
>> ARTICLE
> I couldn't care about any of the characters

[You monster!](https://avvesione.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/chihayafuru_2-08-sumire-kanade-tsutomu-chihaya-taichi-gloom-reaction-surprise-comedy.jpg)

But I felt the same about Ping Pong so I guess we're even.

[](#nosepick)
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru is a different type of sports anime compared to the other two in the post. It's way less of a character work and way more of a sports focused anime. I thought it was immensely fun, but it's not for everyone.

I think with these three picks I have chosen three most likely to get one into sports.
>> ARTICLE
You just triggered a bunch of Rangers fan's.

Fuck the Rangers

Go...go...Islanders q_q (kill me)

Wrong Rangers, dude. He means the Texas Rangers, who just got knocked out of the World Series.

Baseball...like what the title references.

Man, I really wish they did the final arc of the manga in anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Ryo Kyo Bu :)
>> ARTICLE
I think that this is a point you may have overlooked for the *"Why should I watch... first  place?"* is that a sport anime doesn't necessarily need to stay grounded for the sport. They could tweak certain things about a sport or how it is portrayed to spice things up or go full hog & go over the top if they want.


>> ARTICLE
I have always stood for the viability and the entertainment factor and even the character/story depth of sports anime.

It's been big in Japan since the birth of modern anime, and it has surprisingly been having strong influences in Latin America, Middle East and Europe. 

Stuff like Attacker You! is now legendary anime that has been the childhood favorites of those living in places like Spain, France and Italy even resulting in some volleyball superstars who was influenced heavily by the show. Lionel Messi, arguably one of the best soccer players alive right now has been directly influenced by Captain Tsubasa.

Another thing to note is that sports anime is not always about the sports, the end. They always are about the characters, the evolving plot and even the romance between characters. Some of the best romances I have ever seen in an anime is from anime, such as Touch.


>> ARTICLE
Sport anime are the best. 
>> ARTICLE
Kuroko No Basket is basically like Space Jam. I fuckin love it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but now we have to wait for months until chapter seven hits.

The series is too hype to be able to wait that long!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but don't forget that we have a movie confirmation and the likelihood of an Extra Game movie is worthy of the wait, right?
>> ARTICLE
I would love if there was a sport anime for track. You always see these characters in shows, and they are described as "in the track club", but it never really goes deeper than that. I want a track anime that shows how highschool/college track really is, with meets and PRs, as well as constant practices and the like.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, same here. They always mention the track club! Either the track club is going to the nationals or there's one guy who is in the track team but also plays the sport on which the anime is based very well or they are the rivals or something like that 
>> ARTICLE
I've heard Suzuka is partially about track and field, but I don't know for sure, since I'm very hesitant to watch anything based on source material written by Seo Kouji.
>> ARTICLE
I would also recommend against Suzuka. 

It does some interesting things in the last arc, but it's not worth reading the rest of the chapters to get you there.
>> ARTICLE
And then there's everything that happens in the sequel Fuuka that retroactively ruins Suzuka (classic Seo).
>> ARTICLE
I love sports anime, but it is much better when it is binge watched. Try watching a single baseball or basketball game stretched out over 7 weeks (Diya no Ace, Kuroko no Basuke). 
>> ARTICLE
Where's my ice hockey anime? Too bad hockey isn't that big in Japan. IMO it would be more exciting than a lot of sports animes out there, though I guess that really depends on your tastes.
>> ARTICLE
I'm amused that Eyeshield 21 exists, but no hockey. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm tempted to argue that Space Brothers is a sports anime, at least in terms of structure, characters, themes, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently football is pretty big in Japan.  I would love to see another anime about it. 
>> ARTICLE
What about an old school one like Captain Tsubasa? 
>> ARTICLE
I don't care about sports whatsoever. If I watch sport anime, it's for the non-sport stuff, like in Ping Pong. Actual table tennis meant absolutely nothing in Ping Pong, and was mainly just a set piece for amazing characterization and story telling.
>> ARTICLE
The nice thing with sports anime is that they are usually for all ages. I grew up on Captain Tsubasa, Hikari, Kickers, Championes, Attack NO.1 and probably some more and you can watch these as a 5 yo as well as a 25yo. They might also lead you to topics for your senpais and help you grow up.

Surely, the dramaturgy of the old Tsubasa episodes might be as slow as DBZ, but hey, they both grew into huge franchises.
>> ARTICLE
>No one mentions Ippo
>> ARTICLE
I guess because it's a classic and it's pretty old, but yeah, Hajime no Ippo is like top 20 anime of all time definitely.
>> ARTICLE
> I guess because it's a classic 

The manga is still running though! I mean, the original anime is a little dated now I guess. Then the OVA's. Then season 2 wasn't too long ago. But yeah, I guess it can be argued a classic. (I love it no matter how it's classified)
>> ARTICLE
yeah ;P
>> ARTICLE
I was un-sure about the sports genre but after watching Haikyuu! I was immidiatly sold. I didnt know a single thing about volleyball and never was anything of importance to me but that anime made me love the sport and the genre. You are on point with this thread. Im defenetely watching your reccomendations asap !
>> ARTICLE
I've watched some quality anime but sports has always been my favorite and most memorable. Mainly because I played a lot of sports when I was younger and a lot of what the anime portrays is a reflection of what my childhood used to be: the hardwork and dedication to achieving your goals, the brotherhood you form with a bunch of characters on your team (this is why eyeshield 21 was so appealing because of the brotherhood formed with a lot of different personalities), the rivalries you create with the opponents. This is all too reminiscent of my childhood, only difference is that a lot of the animation is exaggerated and characters are a super enthusiastic which make it infectious. Hajime no Ippo actually inspired me to start boxing as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Well executed.

Sports is my favourite genre and while I understand why people shy away from it I am sad that it isn't really given a chance most times. I think sports anime provides an avenue for character development which really cannot be seen in any other anime genre and it's a shame that there seems to be this barrier of entry among a lot of anime watchers.
>> ARTICLE
I got so bored of sports anime, but after seeing the hype for Haikyuu one day, I decided to try it. I was very 'ok whatever sports animu bla bla bla' and now I LOVE it. It's so endearing and I love each and every character. My precious baby crows.
>> ARTICLE
Someone made a good reference as to which kind of sports anime you'd like [here](http://pookpooi.tumblr.com/post/119686062435/my-guide-to-sport-anime)

We also need a badminton / hockey anime :(
>> ARTICLE
One Outs is amazing.   
It's more like a gambling anime though.
>> ARTICLE
That's ok, Kaiji and Akagi are amazing as well and it's like a combination of those + baseball. 
>> ARTICLE
I have a sports manga that I would love to be animated. Pretty much the only sports anime I would give a chance if animated. 

That manga is [Namaikizakari](http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Namaikizakari).
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, this is the first time I've seen someone mention Namaikizakari, such a great manga. It is a bit more romance-focused though. 
>> ARTICLE
Which is why I love it. If you scroll through my manga list on MAL you will find 80%~ is shoujo/romance. I do love the basketball portion as well. My favorite part of the basketball was [when Naruse challenged Hakamada to a 1v1](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5rtAYv-rQbA/VbWqtkSEBrI/AAAAAAAA_NE/PjNE3449U3c/s16000-Ic42/009.jpg), and [my other favorite](/s " was when Naruse "marked" Senpai... HEHEHEHEEHEHE")

I need to finish season 3 of kuroko and start Haikyuu

[] (#chitoge-pissed)
>> ARTICLE
Oh god the 3rd season of Kuroko is the best one. Like its so ridiculous and over the top but is so fun! I also cried a little bit cause I've been following these dudes for 3 years :>    
  
Haikyuu! Is godlike all the freaking time. Once you start you won't be able to let it down. I'm suffering watching the second season weekly now.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first episode and the recaps were... ugh. I just wanted it to start. It's been on the back burner since. I should really get back into it. 
>> ARTICLE
Initial d
>> ARTICLE
DONT STAND SO

DONT STAND SO

DONT STAND SO CLOSE TO ME

God what an amazing soundtrack.

>> ARTICLE
I do not care about cars or racing in the slightest.

I literally stayed for the music. Last season's soundtrack was a disappointment, but my love for cheesy eurobeat is derived from Initial D.
>> ARTICLE
There's a lot of comments and text here already and I've posted at length previously on why I enjoy sports series so much compared to my lack of interest in real sports.

That said this is my short list of series I would recommend if you're keen.

Best of the best series:  
Ping Pong the Animation (anime)  
Baby Steps (anime, then swap to manga)  
Slam Dunk (manga)  
H2 (manga)  
Touch (manga)  
Cross Game (anime)  
Hajime no Ippo (Watch the first season, then movies, then swap to manga)  
Haikyuu!! (anime)  

Good series:  
Kuroko's Basketball (Anime)  
Initial D (anime, I can't overstate how much the music improves it)  
Eyeshield 21 (manga)  
Redline (movie, amazing soundtrack and visuals)  
Giant Killing (anime)
>> ARTICLE
Here I am still waiting for a hockey anime. I just know it would be a fantastic sport to turn into a show but japan has like...no boner for hockey.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I should add basquash to this list: mechs and basketball. Bonus: Nike drinking game. http://myanimelist.net/anime/5675/Basquash!
>> ARTICLE
Fanservice killed it for me, but the soundtrack was first rate.
>> ARTICLE
Most great sports anime exist with the shounen genre, just consider those similar to shounen battle anime because thats what it is. They also usually add special effects to the sports to make it more exciting, almost like adding magic so it's nothing like watching real life sports, it's much more exciting than that. I say this after having watched 4 different sports anime with no interest whatsoever in any kind of sport.
>> ARTICLE
But aren't characters actions in sports anime almost always motivated by the fact they care about the game? 

I, as a viewer, am sitting here giving zero fuck about the sport the show build around. Maybe mildly interested in the characters. And now the game happens. The characters are motivated to win the game. They fight as if they fought for their lives, but i just keep thinking how silly it is. It's just a game. 

At least that's what I think is the reason people who don't watch/care about sports avoid sport anime.

At one time I gave in and *Chihayafuru* and had this exact experience. I just couldn't get myself to give a damn.
>> ARTICLE
Of course they care about the game, but there are also sports anime where the stakes around the game are built up to more than just win or lose.

If you have the time, I'd suggest you try Ping Pong. The motivation of the players in Ping Pong is more than just 'I want to win', you can really see more into their lives and why it's more than just a game to them.
>> ARTICLE
I've finished Ping Pong and it was amazing.  
I've started Chihayafuru and Cross game. All are really good.

Baby Steps, Ace of Diamond, Ippo, Kuroko. All those are nice and hype to watch.

I'd day Gundam Build Fighters is a great sports/shounen anime too.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I expected One Outs to be up there in the post. 

I'm gonna watch Giant Killing soon, I've read that it's pretty good. 
>> ARTICLE
Like I said, I can only make a case for those I've seen. No doubt that that there are many, many other great sports anime out there, but others can make a better case for those.
>> ARTICLE
Check it out, I feel you won't be dissapointed. 
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo is such a classic. It is even listed in MyAnimeList at top 20 anime (there are multiple gintamas so it's actually like 17/16). 

A well deserved spot for such a great show.
>> ARTICLE
I love sports anime, but they all fall under a certain formula that is somewhat... Predictable. It's the Shonen Effect. 
>> ARTICLE
It's highly unrealistic and a tad for kids, but Inazuma Eleven was a pretty fun watch, had some badass moves and characters!
>> ARTICLE
If sports anime are as hype inducing as food wars then I'll see
>> ARTICLE
When OP doesn't even mention Hajime no Ippo zzzz 

Hajime no Ippo is probably the best sports anime of all time IMO. Sure season 1 was released 15 years ago, but the animation still looks better than some of the stuff you see today and the fight scenes are some of the best I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
That's what the bottom line is for. I haven't watched all sports anime, so I won't be the best 'salesman' for those. I think it's better for someone who's watched the show to make a pitch for it, no? :)
>> ARTICLE
cross game is shit
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. It's a great sports series whose slice of life and slight comedy elements complement it extremely well.

It's not so much as after a good anime but after one really good scene.  Voices of a Distant Star's climax makes me cry,  Steins;Gate has it's moment when Skyclad no Kansokusha plays over Kyouma recovers from his Heroic BSOD and it pumps me up, Angel Beats's third episode Solo by Iwasawa with My Song makes me want to change the way I live(I don't but that's beside the point) and Kara no Kyoukai Thantos leaves me in awe every time I watch Shiki jump the buildings.  I think it's just the way that every now and then, someone, somewhere in the studio just had a really good day and it sort of reflects out and creates a lasting effect on the people watching for just that one moment
>> ARTICLE
>recovers from his Heroic BSOD

Er, what's BSOD stand for?
>> ARTICLE
[Heroic Blue Screen of Death](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD)

^ Uh, try not to stay too long on that site. Reddit alone is a sufficient time waster.
>> ARTICLE
You seem to be implying that TVTropes has an exit point...~
>> ARTICLE
I agree! Those moments truly are beautiful, and those moments are a big reason that I watch a lot of animated series or movies.  I haven't seen Steins;Gate yet, but that show is definitely on my "to watch" list.  Thanks for the input!
>> ARTICLE
By on you mean at the top of correct?
>> ARTICLE
For sure!  I'll watch Steins;Gate as soon as I finish the current series I'm watching.
>> ARTICLE
just finished watching steins:gate myself, absolutely astounding, don't know why i've heard sooo little about it. I also recommend ergo proxy and paranoia agent
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, me too.. strange!  I'll definitely watch Ergo Proxy after I watch Steins;Gate, and I remember watching Paranoia Agent when it was on adult swim back in the day... Or was it?  Maybe it was S-Cry-Ed... or maybe it was both?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, unfortunately there is zero anime on genreal TV overe here unless you have sky, so i gotta stream mine so i just look around for something interesting to watch. Ergo proxy will take you a few episodes to get in to, but once your hooked, you'll watch them all in quick succession :P

Oh I see, that is unfortunate :(
I'll definitely keep an eye on Ergo Proxy :D

If you are in need i can direct you to a good torrent, or a good streaming website

Oh, that would be cool, I don't know too many streaming websites

I am familiar with the 'afterglow' and 'awestruck' feeling after watching a good anime. The presence of this feeling is exactly what distinguishes a 9 from 10 on my MAL ratings. 9 means I enjoyed it all the way through, with minor dislikes. 10 is the same as 9, except I was moved/blown away/laughed myself silly at some point.

Here are the animes that have delivered the 'feeling' to me, along with a description of where I felt the 'feeling':

**WARNING SPOILERS**


**Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG**

>[The sacrifice of the Tachikomas. Sato's sniper story deserves honorable mention too.](/spoiler)

**Code Geass: Both Seasons**

>[Every one of Lelouch's plans in R1 was boldly awesome for me. R2 may have been slightly too ambitious, but Lelouch's ultimate sacrifice sealed Code Geass R2's 10 rating for me. I still consider it the best ending I have ever experienced in anime.](/spoiler)

**Nodame Cantabile**

>[I laughed like you wouldn't believe. Even so, they still managed to sneak in some genuinely sad moments. Honorable mention goes to Chiaki under hypnosis, recalling his airplane experience; especially in the live-action drama version. That was the first time I shed a tear since Toradora!.](/spoiler)

**Summer Wars**

>[A highly intense card game for the climax; with the whole world lending their accounts to defeat Love Machine. Everyone screaming Koi Koi. Natsuki's 'transformation sequence'. And then Kenji hacking that password with an ungodly amount of concentration; his nose was bleeding.](/spoiler)

**Kara no Kyoukai 5 and 7**

>[Yuki Kajiura and Ufotable. Shiki VS boss. That is all. Also, honorable mention to a well-presented demonstration of Mage duels in the Nasuverse. Numerous layers of deception despite all that power.](/spoiler)

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood**

>[He punched an Alchemical God to death! And then he traded his 'Gate of Truth' for Alphonse's body! What did 'Truth' say? Something about "That is the right answer"? He discovered the answer to life?](/spoiler)


**Toradora!**

>[Christmas. When Taiga gradually started to tear up, and then sobbed as she futilely chases Ryuji out of her apartment. Also](/spoiler) [this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLr_QIR6PhU&feature=related). [This is the first time I shed a tear since Clannad: Afterstory. Honorable mention goes to Taiga VS that student council president. And Taiga screaming "Ryuji is mine!" after he nearly drowned. Heck, this anime turns the smallest of relationship troubles into something worthy of Clannad. And don't forget it's FUNNY TOO!](/spoiler)


**Clannad: Afterstory**

>[Episode 18. Honorable mention to everything else.](/spoiler)

**Mahou Shoujo Madoka**

>[Homura VS Walpurgis; the fight takes on a different level of meaning, especially after we hear about Homura's 'save and restart' ability. Also, Yuki Kajiura.](/spoiler)

**Ef - a tale of memories**

>[The phone call scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3YlL40Lrlo).

>> ARTICLE
For spoilers write them like this for each paragraph

\[Spoiler text goes here\]\(/spoiler\)
>> ARTICLE
The Tachikomas... Still makes me sad.
>> ARTICLE
couldn't agree more with the GITS, Full metal alchemist and code gaess . Though the ending for code gaess was possible replaced by steins gate in general when i ended up watching it through

>> ARTICLE
Me too!  That feeling definitely differentiates '9's from '10's.  I haven't had the chance to watch Summer Wars or Nodame Cantabile, but all of the shows that you have mentioned are definitely scenes/series that really made me feel that way.  Thanks for your input!
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, that ef scene. Definitely the most affecting scene to me out of any show I've watched, and that's including tons you mentioned like Clannad and Toradora.

I had had to pause the show and just sit there in silence for a few minutes after that scene.
>> ARTICLE
That scene from ef felt like someone punched me in the gut. 
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Ach!  I really have to watch Steins;Gate, too many people have been noting that they have gotten that "astounded" feeling from watching that anime...  Thanks for your input!
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind the first 7-8 episodes are not as awesome as the rest, stay with it till the end.
>> ARTICLE
Sure thing!  I'll be sure to stick it out till the end
>> ARTICLE
I totally agree. In particular, the 'Endless 8' arc of Haruhi Suzimaya. I felt like I'd achieved something akin to zen. After 4 or 5 episodes, I even started enjoying the almost hypontic repetition, and the slowly dawning realization by the characters. 
>> ARTICLE
On that note, I think the community would appreciate it if you removed the re-posts. Minimize clutter, and here is not the place to appropriate the Endless 8.
>> ARTICLE
Did you not find joy in the subtle differences, or in the slow realization of the situation???
>> ARTICLE
Well 'space' on a reddit thread is mutually exclusive; if someone posts a new comment here, others won't be able to see it immediately with all those re-posts.

Just courtesy really. Manners before art.
>> ARTICLE
but now I have to decide which and how many of my children to delete! 
Do you think 3-4 would be enough to get the humour across? 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I thought I was one of the few that actually enjoyed the 'Endless 8' arc.  Everyone that I've talked to felt that those 8 episodes were a waste of time.  Though, I thought that arc was brilliant in its own right.
>> ARTICLE
I liked how everybody wore a different swimsuit every time. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah!  I thought those little variations really made the episode feel like the characters were really struggling to get out of that loop.
>> ARTICLE
...But that doesn't even make sense! The characters most likely bought their swimsuits before the time loop happened, and they can't have *that* many swimsuits in their closet! /end rant

I appreciated the subtle differences for the first three episodes, but I got tired of it and skipped to the last one of Endless 8. I find that Tatami Galaxy did much better by approaching the time loop concept in the complete opposite way; by making each episode start completely differently, and making the *similarities* stand out, instead of the differences. I guess it's personal taste.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, I guess I haven't seen the endless 8 arc in a long time.  Actually, now that I think about it, I think I've only watched that arc about 2 times...  So, my memory about that particular segment of Haruhi is lacking.  So, I can definitely be incorrect!

I haven't seen Tatami Galaxy, but I'll find a copy of it somewhere and watch it.  I think you are on to something about emphasizing the similarities rather than the differences though.  Thanks for your input!
>> ARTICLE
I definitely recommend you watch Tatami Galaxy! But just so you know, even though it's entertaining from the beginning, the show doesn't reach its full impact until the very last episode... Coincidentally, it *is* one of those shows that left me astounded :P
>> ARTICLE
Oh ho!  I'll definitely keep an eye out for it then!  Thanks for the recommendation and your input.  Note: a quick wiki of Tatami Galaxy has definitely gotten me interested in watching it!
>> ARTICLE
Are you really asking that bunch of anime fans? Yes, of course we all do.
>> ARTICLE
Ha ha, maybe I started this post just to talk with fellow redditors/anime fans.  I'm forever alone on Reddit and in real life >.>
>> ARTICLE
It is OK to want just a pleasant conversation, but maybe more thought-provoking question might be better.
>> ARTICLE
I'll keep that in mind the next time I do a post, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
DAE like anime?
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. 
>> ARTICLE
Some but few. The best example is Puella Magi Madoka Magica. That was a combination of the surprise genre and final episodes(Mainly 10).

These are not necessarily my favorite anime they are the ones that are well put to gather. Clannad, my fav anime, made me feel just about every other emotion, but never astounded. 

One that i trying to find the VN for is Steins; Gate which looks like it is right up this ally.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I see.  I think I felt that way after watching Puella Magi as well.  After learning the truth of that series, my mind got blown, and I really appreciated the entire story of that series. Thanks for your input!
>> ARTICLE
After finishing both seasons of Spice and Wolf, I almost died realizing that no third+ seasons had been made. So I think it's safe to say I was really moved by the series.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely.  That realization of knowing that there won't be another season or sequel... Feels bad man.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Ooo, I've been watching katanagatari once a month, but I might have to speed up watching that show in order to really get into it, and perhaps feel the same way you did when you watched the ending.  I haven't watched Steins;Gate yet, but now it seems that I have to obtain that anime as soon as possible.  Thanks for your input!
>> ARTICLE
I've been getting that feeling with most of the episodes of Mawaru Penguindrum. Hopefully the ending will meet my expectations.

The ending of Tatami Galaxy also gave me a "whoa" moment.
>> ARTICLE
Ah!  I keep hearing about Mawaru Penguindrum...  Definitely on my "to watch" list.  And I'm going to watch Tatami Galaxy as soon as I get to Steins;Gate.  Thanks for your input!
>> ARTICLE
No-one said the end of gunbuster?

Shame on you reddit
>> ARTICLE
Oh.  Well now I have to go find that anime >.>
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I do. Redline affected me the same way. 

It happens sometimes with live action movies as well, though not as often.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah!  I definitely get that feeling after watching a great movie, regardless of whether or not its animated.  
>> ARTICLE
If I've just seen something truly amazing, I usually take a day or two break from anime to let it really soak in.
>> ARTICLE
Me too!  After I watched 5 Centimeters per Second, I took a week off from anime just to let that feeling overwhelm me and to really understand what took place in that movie.
>> ARTICLE
I have not watched Redline yet (showing in a local theater next week though!!), but I can totally relate to that feeling. I am still avidly thinking about the last series that I finished watching about a week ago. 

Admittedly, I do get rather emotionally invested in anime series. Finding one that will stick with me for such a long time is an amazing experience and part of why I enjoy anime!

Oh wow, you are in for a treat!  I'm still getting nerd chills over Redline, and I got one of my buddies to watch that movie, and we're gonna rewatch it in the winter together.

Definitely, I also get invested into a series or movie, and when that series or movie ends... That feeling I get afterwards doesn't really relate to anything else.  Maybe that's why I'm addicted to anime.
>> ARTICLE
Finished One Outs yesterday and had that feeling for the first time in a long time.
>> ARTICLE
Nice!  I haven't seen One Outs, but when I finished Redline the other day, I haven't felt that feeling in a while as well.
>> ARTICLE
I both love and hate this feeling.

I love enjoying a show so much that I feel so satisfied, but I hate how it stops me watching anything else afterwards.  I watch an anime every few days, and really enjoy doing so; but after I watch a great show (somehow only just got around to watching both seasons of Code Geass [Holy shit, the feeling I got when Rolo was freezing time over and over to save Lelouch.  Every hair stood up on my body for multiple scenes of that show.  It's too damn good.](/spoiler)), I just feel entirely unmotivated to watch anything else, because I fear it won't be anywhere near as good.  I probably won't watch anything else for 2 weeks now, and that sucks.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely.  But at the same time, I think I'm developing a craving for that feeling...  This doesn't bode well for my academic career. lol

As for that scene in Code Geass.  Your words aptly describe my own feelings: holy shit. :D
>> ARTICLE
I guess that would really depend on what you mean by "after watching" - do you mean per episode, or the entire series?

On an episode to episode basis, I can often feel astounded/in awe after watching an episode. The latest example of this is probably episodes 2 and 3 of Guilty Crown. After watching both of those, I was just like... giddy for more. Not just that though, but I was even messaging my friends who said they were watching it just to see if they saw it, what they thought, etc... which is something I don't typically do with anime. I enjoy watching it, but I've rarely 'geeked out' over it, so to speak. 

If, however, you meant after watching the entire series, I can't say I've ever really feel astounded or in awe after finishing a really good anime... I instead tend feel a sense of loss. It's kinda weird, really. Like, I really enjoyed the show, and it's not like it's going anywhere so I can watch it any time I want... but the fact that it's over and I never get to see any further developments in the characters or story usually ends up making me depressed for a few days. 

I think part of the depression is that, while I know I'll still enjoy it,  I know I'll remember most of the major plot points and just won't be the same as the first time. I do the same thing with games I've really enjoyed playing. It really sucks :/
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm, yeah, I should have clarified a bit further.  I was talking about the end of a series, but a lot of people have been mentioning ends of an episode.  I also get that "astounded" feeling after watching an episode.

As for that sense of loss... Definitely.  I think what I get is some sort of bittersweet (I hate that word...) feeling.  That knowledge of knowing that a series or movie is done for good.  For example, 5 Centimeters per Second.  The end of that movie really left me in "shock" for about a week.  I wasn't able to watch any other anime; instead, I contemplated my own life and the impact that animated film had over me.

I haven't watched that movie again because I think I know that watching that movie for a second time won't have that large of an effect as the first time I watched it.  And perhaps, having that thought is subconsciously making me not want to watch it again, in order to preserve that feeling from when I first watched it.

Thanks for your input!

The Bloodstained Labyrinth episodes of Ghost Hunt just completely freaked me the HELL out. Granted I watched them at like 3 AM, but still. Those episodes just were crazy. It was the first time I felt "scared" from an anime. 

And after finishing Shiki, I just kind of sat there and felt "well...that was intense."

Oh and Bakemonogatari. I first watched that after being on a shoujo binge and it was just amazingly refreshing.

I haven't seen Ghost Hunt or Shiki yet, but I totally understand that feeling.  I'm gonna have to keep an eye out for those two shows! Thanks for your input!

I totally agree. In particular, the "Endless Eight" arc of Haruhi Suzimaya was an adventure. I felt like I'd achieved zen.  I even started enjoying the almost hypontic repetition after 4 or 5 episodes, and the slowly dawning realization by the characters was fascinating.

I totally agree. In particular, the "Endless Eight" arc of Haruhi Suzimaya was certainly an... adventure. It was mentally draining to sit through [8 nearly identical episodes] (/spoiler) and by the end I felt like I'd achieved zen.

It's just not my cup of tea. I was never really into sports anyway.
>> ARTICLE
So the thing about sports anime is most of them tend to be about the sport, not the characters. The problem with this is that there is only so much your can care about a fictional sports team and their ups and downs. It works great for a movie, or for a short series. Animes tend to go on for too long, and end up making the sports ridiculous. Think prince of tennis, and the shenanigans the characters in that can do.

On the other hand you occasionally get sports anime like Ping Pong the animation. This show has themes and messages that are universal. It's not so much about the sport as it is about sports, sportsmanship, and athletes. It's about the people, and most of the conflict and characters would work no matter what sport they were doing. These are the shows that tend to have wider appeal, because it does not matter if you actually care about the sport being played.
>> ARTICLE
I read through this thread thinking "I do understand your point but you really need to watch Ping Pong The Animation" but then I realized, probably unlike the normals sports anime, Ping Pong is about characters who happen to be playing ping pong and not about the sport. The matches are a plot device to characterize and... do stuff you know. 

But then again, I am not deep into this genre, I just love Ping Pong
>> ARTICLE
For me, it's because I really like sports. I typically watch anime FOR the unrealistic, exaggerated characteristics and plots, but seeing it apply to something I am familiar with is kind of immersion-breaking.
>> ARTICLE
Unless the sports anime has this unrealistic value, it will only appeal to those who have actually played the sport. For example Baby steps. They have a niche market.

An exception is Cross Game because Adachi encompasses many aspects into the story.
>> ARTICLE
I'm similar in that I like sports, but generally I only like participating and not watching. I've also never had that "I must be number one!" spirit -- for me sports is about having fun and (when I'm more serious about it) pushing my own boundaries, but I never really care about other people unless they're teammates or something.

My all-time favourite opponent in sports is time when I'm running. For example, 30 minutes is always exactly 30 minutes, no matter whether it's raining, snowing or +35C on a cloudless day, and whether I reach that time on some distance depends only on how fast I run and nothing else. Time is also an opponent that you can never defeat, no matter how good you are, so there is always room for improvement: if you can beat that 30 minutes, then you can go for 29 and after that 28 and so on -- even if you're Usain Bolt and there's no one in the world faster than you, you can never defeat the clock.

To quote zombo.com: "The only limit is yourself."

That being said, I've actually watched some sports anime this season (Ping Pong, Haikyuu!! and Baby Steps) and at least so far I've liked Baby Steps. It may be unrealistic, but that doesn't really bother me because the premise is so interesting.
>> ARTICLE
If you want sport series that tend to be a little unrealistic or over the top, you might want to try:

- [ Prince of Tennis]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/22/Prince_of_Tennis) - Tennis
- [ Eyeshield 21] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/15/Eyeshield_21 ) - Football
- [Captain Tsubasa  ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2116/Captain_Tsubasa ) - Soccer
- [Ring ni Kakero   ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23/Ring_ni_Kakero_1 ) - Boxing
- [Initial D  ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/185/Initial_D_First_Stage ) - Street Racing

There are probably a few more series that might fit that list, but those series listed are a good place to start.
>> ARTICLE
I think what he meant was, he doesn't like watching over the top sports anime because it breaks immersion when it involves something he's actually interested in.
>> ARTICLE
Replace Initial D with Wangan Midnight, Wangan is street racing while Initial D is drifting and tends to have a large focus on the drama between the characters rather than being all about the drift racing. 
>> ARTICLE
Try Ookiku Furikabutte. Very immersive baseball anime.
>> ARTICLE
This is very well put. Those "unrealistic, exaggerated characteristics and plots" are what I think is anime's greatest strength as a medium. 

EDIT: And I respectfully disagree that sports anime are better than the NBA playoffs. Although I may be biased since I'm a Spurs fan and am thoroughly enjoying the playoffs this year. =)

[Cross Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5941/Cross_Game)

[Baby Steps](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21185/)

Cross Game is one of my favorite animes, and Baby Steps is pretty good so far too. So, I do like sports anime but I'm only interested if it's coupled with romance. 
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps is alright, much more realistic than PoT but the author seems to only have a basic understanding of the sport.  I mean the MC plays a reactionary game which literally no one does in Tennis because not only is it stupid but it can also lead to you ripping your muscles apart. 

Really wonder if there's a Tennis anime that does the sport accurate enough to show the intensity and doesn't give the characters special snowflake skills that no one in real life would have so it doesn't resort to muh power levels. 
>> ARTICLE
You might want to try Adachi's other sport series (besides Cross Game), since they tend to have a romance part in it like:

- [Touch  ]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/1065/Touch)
- [H2  ]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/386/H2)

Then there are a couple of other series that have some romance in it, but don't really play a big role in it like [Slam Dunk  ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/170/Slam_Dunk ) and [Hajime no Ippo  ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ).

Find me one that is as mature and realistic as Friday Night Lights and I'll watch it. Otherwise I could be watching people in spaceships shooting lasers instead.
>> ARTICLE
> Friday Night Lights

I have no idea what that is (I looked it up on IMDB, but still can't claim I know). However, have you tried **Ping Pong the Animation**?
>> ARTICLE
Hi, it's the tv series http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night_Lights_%28TV_series%29

Ping pong looked a bit overdone to me at the start of the season, so I didn't pay much attention to it. How's it going?
>> ARTICLE
Ping pong Might actually be considered like a samurai anime. But instead of fighting with swords, they're fighting with table tennis rackets.

It's one of the best shows this season IMO. If not the best. The animation style is unusual, but allows for some really nice parallels. It's not about working your way to be the best simply because you believe. The MC has some true talent, but he doesn't work to get better at ping pong. [Episode 1-2(Maybe) spoilers](/s "Instead, he even loses his games on purpose just to not make his friend sad")
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, that sounds pretty interesting, I'll catch up with it.
>> ARTICLE
The best series that might fit your "mature and realistic" criteria hasn't been made into an anime.   I think [Rookies]( http://myanimelist.net/manga.php?id=915  ) sort of fits that.   Otherwise, seinen manga based anime might work too since they tend to be mature and somewhat realistic, where they tend to be marketed toward adults/older people.     Series like:

- [Ookiku Furikabutte  ] (  http://myanimelist.net/anime/2159/Ookiku_Furikabutte)
- [Giant Killing  ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/7661/Giant_Killing )
- [Initial D  ] (  http://myanimelist.net/anime/185/Initial_D_First_Stage)
- [One Outs  ] (  http://myanimelist.net/anime/5040/One_Outs)
- [Ping Pong  ] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/22135/Ping_Pong_The_Animation )

There are a few more series I am forgetting, but I think you will notice a difference with them, compared toward other sport shonen series that are marketed toward a younger audience.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. I don't mind me some seinen manga, so I'll definitely give Rookies a read. The other animes do look promising, I'll try them in due course. For Initial D, has there been any remakes or should I just start from the original series? Do you know how it compares to the manga?
>> ARTICLE
>For Initial D, has there been any remakes or should I just start from the original series? 

It depends on what version you watch.  Tokyopop, Funimation, or fansub.   When it was licensed by Tokyopop, I believe they did a really poor job on it for the dub.   Where they changed the names (to make them sound American), then I believe they used "street slang" in order to attract an younger audience or something.  I think they even ended up cutting out a few things, changing the music to it too.
    
At the same time, Tokyopop did the same thing to the licensed manga series.  If you buy the series, or read it online, you might notice how bad some of it is in some of the early volumes compared to the scanlators version.   As a result the series did rather badly in the US.  Which I think made Kodansha not want to renew their license agreement with Tokyopop.

Which I believe lead to Funimation getting the license for it, to where they redid everything to where it was more inline with the Japanese version.  From what I remember, they did a pretty good job on it.    

>Do you know how it compares to the manga?

The only noticeable difference (ignoring Tokyopop stuff) between the anime and the manga is in the anime, they re-arranged a few of the races.  Where the last race in the First Stage should have happen a couple of races before hand.  But I think they wanted to end the season with the more exciting race.

Then I believe later on in the later Stages/season, it might cut out some of the race battles that the MC isn't involved in.  So I think the first 3 stages do an okay job at being close the manga, but in the fourth or fifth stage, it might start to leave out some stuff.  Not entirely for sure, its been a while since I read the manga/watched the anime.

>> ARTICLE
Avoid tokyopop? Got it.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no ippo, watch this and it will change your mind about sports anime
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I gave it the 3 episode treatment. I can see why its good, and I did get invested in Ippos character, but its not what Id consider mature or realistic. By that I mean: wimpy smaller kid gets bullied by meaner bigger kids. But their heart is pure and by the power of self-belief they stand up, gain confidence and overcome their problems. #hardwork #dedication.  They dont face severe challenges like institutional privilege, corruption, objectification, exploitation or racial discrimination. They dont make sacrifices (like losing their partners, family, friends, or career prospects) to play sports, and their families and communities aren't forced to make sacrifices for it either. They dont bully anyone because theyre always the good guys. They never fail either; every loss and defeat can be bounced back next time (theres always a next time)  with the right knowledge and attitude. Nobody says sorry kid, you cant play ever again  become a salaryman instead of your dream and leaves them to deal with the finality of being abandoned. Also the clich that they are invariably super-powerful, but never realise their potential before because they didn't believe in themselves, kinda makes it all pointless to me. And if I see that as pointless, and thusly am watching only because I like the characters (and I do like the ones in Hajime), then I feel that I could be watching something like Kill la Kill instead because a fantastical setting is always going to be more entertaining to me than sports. And I like and watch sports! At least cricket, football and the e-sport side of dota.


Finally to me, the variations of the "You have to believe in yourself" message these anime always seem to be breathlessly conveying was done at least as well by Railgun's [episode 14](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/256jve/out_of_all_the_anime_ive_watched_this_scene/) which isnt even a sports show. Anyway, thankyou for the recommendation, I did appreciate it even if my rant makes it appear otherwise :)
>> ARTICLE
The 3 episode rule does not work well for ippo there are 3 seasons with over 100 episodes and most of the things you described in this that you say they do in every sports anime actually don't happen. I have not read the manga yet but I plan to but where the anime currently ends is around 557 and there are currently 1051. From what I have heard even more of the things you said all sports anime do or don't have actually happen in these chapters, and this anime is so popular and the way it was set up when it ended guaranteed future seasons. I will however respect your opinion and decision not to watch them but if you do decide to finish ippo I think it may change your mind and if not I guarantee you will at least like ippo even if you don't like sports anime
>> ARTICLE
Ok that sounds quite fair. It's just that the first episodes gave me an "I've seen this all before" feeling, with how ridiculously gifted Ippo is without him ever realising it before.
>> ARTICLE
He isn't *that* gifted. The show is all about hard work vs. talent. Ippo is talented, of course, but he has to train hard as hell for his fights. He would lose if he didn't train as hard as he does--he isn't so talented that he can win without earning it, unlike a few other characters in the series.

His strength lies in his hard work and dedication, not his talent straight out of the box. It's the main theme of the series.
>> ARTICLE
I get that, and I think the series is pretty good at what it does, but it's not my cup of tea :)
>> ARTICLE
You wont find any of what you're looking for in animoo, Japan doesn't do realistic competition or dah struggle well. 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, live action TV doesn't do this too much either. Even my example of FNL had its bad periods, like the entire second season. Shows like Mad Men, the Sopranos and Breaking Bad are quite the exception really.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't look too much into sports because I was looking for the more eccentric, odd, and out of the ordinary shows. 

I really liked Hajime no Ippo (Boxing) and can definitely recommend it. I got into this series because a friend insisted that I try it.

I normally don't watch sports anime. That said, there are two good sports anime that I do/did watch: [Yowamushi Pedal](http://www.crunchyroll.com/yowapeda) and [Chihayafuru](http://www.crunchyroll.com/chihayafuru). The funny thing is, of all the sports shows for me to get into, I most definitely did not expect to get into those lol!

I love watching and playing sports, mainly the three biggest US sports: Football, Basketball and Baseball, but when it came to anime, I just couldn't get into them. I dunno why, but I enjoyed Chihayafuru and I'm really enjoying Yowamushi Pedal.
>> ARTICLE
Not a huge fan of most sports, but I would love to see some extreme sports-centric anime (skateboarding, bmx, etc) besides Air Gear.
>> ARTICLE
I very rarely watch sports anime, but the Ping Pong show definitely caught me off guard. I might give sports anime a shot in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong isn't really a sports anime like Rush isn't a racing movie.  Ping Pong just moves the plot but isn't at all the focus, its a coming of age story.  

You might be disappointed if you watch a sports anime and expect it to be like Ping Pong 

>> ARTICLE
I hate sports IRL so I thought I would hate it aswell on anime, but I was wrong the first sport anime I watched was Inazuma Eleven which was okay and then I decided to watch Kuroko no basket which was really good since then I've been watching lots of sports anime. 

I recommend Chihayafuru best sport anime that i've watched.
>> ARTICLE
Ookiku got my attention just because Haikyuu is pretty decent atm but I'm expecting it to be slightly generic or nothing to spectacular, Ookiku I mean, could be wrong tho.

Haven't seen Major but Giant Killing was a huge let down, pretty boring to be honest, if you're interested in strategies, mind games and whatnot and still dealing with sports you're better off with One Outs or Akagi.
>> ARTICLE
Oofuri is definitely not generic. 

Well, it's typical in the sense that it does follow sports anime plot conventions, but the protagonist has anxiety. The entire show is partly about the team aiming for the Koushien, and partly about him dealing with his issues. 
>> ARTICLE
Good to hear, but at the same time hearing that the MC has anxiety kinda annoys me, like I can picture him being like Onoda from Yowamushi Pedal right now who is scared of anything, and has to have inner monologues every five minutes to question whether he can do *it* or not and overreacts about the simples of things.

Hope is not like that tho.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoy participating in sports, but watching it in anime just seems pretty boring. Just seems like the "if you truly believe it, you can win" idea is done too often.
>> ARTICLE
Why exactly did you exclude some popular sports anime? Like many other shows there is popular ones in the genre like Kuro/hajime no ippo and Ping Pong and many others that not many will follow.

I personally enjoy sports anime although I've only seen the popular ones(Hajime no ippo, eyeshield,kuro...few others)
>> ARTICLE
They run pretty long. Someday, I'll read Slam Dunk or watch Hajime no Ippo, but that's a lot to catch up on.

Both would be very much worth it. 

Those are pretty much the only sports anime I've actually stuck through
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game is one of the best anime I have seen and it's a sports anime but what makes it great isn't even the "sport" factor. I have seen Giant Killing and other "sport anime" to be honest they are good and I enjoy it but I would rather watch the real thing...
>> ARTICLE
I do.
>> ARTICLE
I don't care too much for most sports, and I have way too many non-sports anime on my backlog. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't like watching sports of any kind, it bores me. I'll play basically any sport, though.

When I play sports, I'm not trying to shut off my mind and enjoy some ridiculous universe where anything can happen. When I watch anime, or other shows, I'm not trying to physically exert myself.
>> ARTICLE
The main thing I dislike about most sports anime is the pacing. Matches take longer and longer as they slow down and focus on introspection to inflate the tension, and the story stops going anywhere.

Assuming the story was going anywhere at all. The big difference between most sports anime/manga and an equivalent movie is that the former are open-ended so they can continue as long as they're popular. Which works well with the open nature of sport itself, but doesn't really lend itself to narrative structure.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I can't stand the glacial pacing in these series. The last I tried was Yowamushi Pedal, and after three episodes, nothing had happened yet. The MC hadn't even joined the club!
>> ARTICLE
I don't normally have as much of an issue with the non-sport parts, especially at the start. This season's Haikyuu! took a few episodes to get to a proper match, but I actually quite liked the training and stuff they were doing worked quite well to develop the characters. But then their practise match took the best part of two episodes, and that was enough for me.

I've heard that in some episodes of Yowamushi Pedal they cover as much as 500m. That's pretty slow for 20 minutes of walking, never mind cycling.
>> ARTICLE
I think, for me, it's a lot of things mixed up together.

First, my favorite setting, for any show/game/anime/movie/whatever is a fantasy setting. I'm just a very big fan of fantasy... the more creatures, wings, swords, magic, demons, etc there are, the more interested I am from the start. Sports anime normally aren't fantasy. (If there's a fantasy sports anime, please hook me up, that sounds hella cool).

Second, I like movement. Exploration and large worlds. Sports anime typically take place in a single room for 80% of it...

Also, I'm not exactly interested in sports themselves. I'm sure that doesn't help my interest.

I also enjoy more serious things. The intensity in sports anime is different. In some random anime with friends and stuff, someone gets stabs and it's like "Holy shit they may die, this is the end of the world". But in a sports anime, the worst thing that could happen is "Oh no, they missed that shot so they're going to lose the game"

It's not that they're less intense or more intense than I like... but the intensity is different. 

Overall, it has a lot to do with the fact that I like fantasy, slice of life, and romance... and sports anime are pretty much the opposite of those 3 things. 


ninjaedit: Funny thing, my anime-friend *absolutely loves* sports anime. She's watched so many... she's watching Ookiku Furikabutte right now.

Because I watch enoigh sports as is

There is no Hockey anime. I would watch the hell out of a shonen style hockey anime.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'd probably watch the hell out of a seinen-style hockey anime. Most shonen-style sports anime I've tried have left me annoyed and not wanting to even admit to myself that I've tried them.
>> ARTICLE
OP, just in case you haven't heard of it, the show One Outs is a baseball sports anime that is *very much full of mind games*, like you say Ookiku Furikabutte is. I'd give it a watch if you haven't yet (and I'm putting Ookiku on my to-watch list right now). :)
>> ARTICLE
But I do watch Sports anime. Kuroko no Basket.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I just don't care about sports. I used to play soccer (football for non-Americans) when I was growing up, but that stopped after a while and I just now don't care about any sports. I'll admit that there are some good sports series that are out there, but I'll also probably never watch them.
>> ARTICLE
I really got into them after rewatching Initial D for the 4th time. It really brought back the feelings I got when I first watched that show. Its the character progression within the sport that I love. There are some that I do not like, but that is very few. 

It might be because of all of these sports, I know I will never play them and its just interesting. 

The more recent ones I have watched/started watching are
It started off with Giant Killing. Its a really good soccer anime that I picked up out of the blue and ended up loving it. I need to rewatch it, but sadly it got taken off CR years ago. I liked it because it focused on the main coach instead of players, so that gave an interesting perspective.

Finally got into Kuroko no Basket and was instantly hooked. I never liked basketball that much and never watched it on TV. This show hooked me because it went into the territory of having a cast of characters that were extremely good at what they do. Its nice seeing how good a series can become when the MC is not starting from complete scratch. 

Diamond no Ace: Got hooked on this in Fall 2013. Never played baseball, and it took a bit to get me in to this series, but I finally did. Have been watching it since day 1 and loving it. The MC can get a tad annoying sometimes with some of his outburts that are seemingly only for comedic effect, but it is fun. The team building done with this show with fantastic, very much like Kuroko.

Haikyu: Never thought I would get into a men's volleyball anime, but hey it worked. This is kinda like Diamond no Ace in that the MC has a passion for the sport, but gets on to a team where they can build him up and make his talent shine. 

All three of those (Kuroko, Diamond, Haikyu), I partly attribute them having fantastic studios that know how to make a series shine. In this case it is Production I.G (Kuroko, Haikyu, Diamond no Ace) and Madhouse (Diamond no Ace). Their use of characters make these shows so fucking enjoyable to watch. Having HunterxHunter as their other cred makes me excited when I see Madhouse doing these shows. It knows how to flesh out the characters well. 

The other thing that makes these shows up top shine well is how they approach the sports differently. Kuroko uses the over the top moves and styles like DBZ has, which makes it actually enjoyable, because they frame it around the sport. The same with Haikyu and Diamond. Hinata in Haikyu has a good jump, which is realistic and Sawamura in Diamond has a really good throwing arm.

Surprisingly I am getting into Baby Steps this season very easily. The MC might not have an aptitude for Tennis, but he makes up for it in other ways. After the horrible show that was Prince of Tennis, I like that its taking a more balanced approach to the sport. 

I am starting to go back and watch a few other sports anime. Baseball in particular with Cross Game and Ookiku Furikabutte.

Another mention is Free! Iwatobi Swim Club, if you can call it sports anime, but it is good.

I am really loving sports anime. I never thought I would get into it as much as I have. I guess its just a good break from the more over the top and moeish shows.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, why don't you consider Kuroko no Basuke to be a sports anime? I've only seen it and Free! so my sports anime knowledge is limited and I'm curious as to how they are different fr other types of sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
yeah kurobasu is a slideshow...
>> ARTICLE
I... outside of Free! and Prince of Tennis, was unaware of many sports anime.

I am now imagining something like Blake Griffin facing off against Russel Westbrook in this complicated battle for control of the ball a la DBZ.
>> ARTICLE
I play a bunch of sports and watch them too, but I feel that the super powers and stuff in an anime like Kuroko no Basket kind of ruins it for me.. My favourite sports manga is Slam Dunk because Sakuragi has a bunch of talent, but he has to work his ass off to get to the top. That struggle that you see in pro sports is really compelling to me
>> ARTICLE
I haven't given sports anime a chance yet. I just think "How good could they really be?" because of my background in playing sports makes me feel like it would be a bit mundane. If anybody wants to recommend a series that'll really answer that question, please do!
>> ARTICLE
What sports have you played or are you heavily invested in, once i know I can recommend a good one
>> ARTICLE
Definitely heavily invested in Soccer
>> ARTICLE
For soccer personally I have seen [Area no Kishi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11697/Area_no_Kishi) and I loved it. I would suggest you give it a shot if you like soccer 
>> ARTICLE
Sports have always bored me to tears, both watching and playing. Never had any real interest in it, so that's why I'm not into sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
For the most part, sports anime isn't interesting to me for the same reason real sports isn't interesting to me. I just don't really care about it and it seems like a waste of the things anime is good at.

I have seen at least one straight-up sports anime (Kenkou Zenrakei Suieibu Umishou, which doubles as a cartoonish ecchi comedy), and I do plan to watch a few others considered to be decent for one reason or another (e.g. Bamboo Blade, Taishou Baseball Girls, Ro-Kyu-Bu). I've also seen and plan to see some animes about gaming or other competitions that aren't really sports (e.g. Angelic Layer, Girls und Panzer, C3-bu, Hikaru no Go, Busou Shinki).
>> ARTICLE
I end up liking most sports manga better than the anime counterpart. Eyeshield 21 is the perfect example of how to ruin an adaptation. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm normally not interested in sports anime, but Cross Game was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Only one I've watched is Free! (if that even counts). The male fanservice was too much for me and I couldn't handle it.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking about this the other day and came to the conclusion that it is only because there aren't any anime about sports that I actually enjoy. For instance hockey, or weight/powerlifting.
>> ARTICLE
What? I do watch sports anime! *[goes on to rewatch* **Love Live!** *again]*
>> ARTICLE
I like sports to some extent but I am really not that big of a sports guy. I know sports anime have psychological stuff and character building but I just prefer something that I like the _topic_ of the show a bit more. I tend to like love stories anyways. I know a lot of sports anime have some romance elements but I just feel like I would rather just watch a romance anime than have to watch all the sports scenes in between. Still, good question.
>> ARTICLE
Wow I thought I was alone in the "no sports" thing. I don't even watch sports IRL but I don't mind playing, I mean going outside and playing. 
>> ARTICLE
Sports shows like Oofuri or Kurobas are more popular among female otaku audiences. I just assume that there are not many female fans here.
>> ARTICLE
At first I felt like sports anime wouldnt be any good, as the anime i had watched before tying it were all exaggerated and unrealistic plots. However when i first tried Prince of Tennis, I ended up finding many other sport anime that i have come to love. Baby Steps, Kuroko no Basket, Major, Diamond no Ace (Not amazing but decent), Area no Kishi, Eyeshield 21 (MC kinda annoyed me), Haikyuu. 

However ones I didnt enjoy so far have been, H2, Slam Dunk(decent but not good enough), Giant Killing(Thought it was awful)

Before watching any sports anime I was very familiar with watching Hockey. I didnt really enjoy watching other sports besides during the Olympics(Curling, Snowboarding, 100m/200m/400m/relay, Soccer, Beach Volleyball).
>> ARTICLE
Tbh I've never heard of anyone recommend a sports anime until now. I do enjoy sports too, I just never thought to look for sports anime to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I don't like sport in real life so I'm instantly turned off the idea sport in anime. It's one of the two genres that will make me judge it before watching it. The one exception is Saki because of the yuri undertones and that it's a sport in the same way chess is.
>> ARTICLE
[Princess Nine](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1846/Princess_Nine) is one of my favourite shows of all time, I loved Free! and Chihayafuru, and Ping Pong is making a *very* strong case for being Anime of the Season for me, but I wouldn't call myself a fan of the sports anime genre.

I'm not sure why I'm so reluctant to give them a shot, but it might be the general impression that they're structurally similar to long-running shonen shows: obstacle, discovery of ability to overcome it, new obstacle, new ability, repeat.

The character relationships seems to be much more nuanced and important in sports shows though, so I should probably give more of them a shot - I'll have to track down some of the recommendations made here.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I haven't been talking about sports anime because I only recently got into anime. But hey, that's just me.

I love my sports anime. Kuroko and Daiya no A are cool because I have played basketball and baseball in the past. I love Haikyuu!! because I am currently playing volleyball and it's by far my favourite sport. I enjoy watching sport as well, and watching sports anime sorta comes under that sports category. I love watching sports anime because it is a massive pump up for my games, and because of the exaggerated aspects of anime, I feel even more pumped (though I don't try to copy whatever anime I watch, after all it is exaggerated). I guess I like sports anime because I can understand what's happening better rather than getting stuck on introductions for a long time and trying to comprehend what is happening within my tiny brain. So I guess that I can get into things I'm already into.

Also, I've played rugby as well. If anyone knows a good anime series based on rugby, I would be really happy if someone could suggest one, I don't mind league either.
>> ARTICLE
I never really liked Sports anime, but somethin about Kuroko's basketball man.. I Play Basketball, and watch it religiously, never thought I would ever watch an animated series for the sport, but I thoroughly enjoy it. 

Besides the fact that highschool players are topping NBA skilled players in terms of showing off... 
>> ARTICLE
I love sports animes, especially baseball animes like Ookiku Furikabutte and Ace of the Diamond, they are exactly as baseball should be. Also, Kuroko no Basket and Initial D are great stories that has some applicable concepts to their sports, especially Initial D.
>> ARTICLE
I love sports anime, but can understand why they may not be other peoples cup of tea.

I don't mind sports being in Anime, like how baseball is in Tora Dora, but if its the main plot/theme, ill pass.

Sports outside of Anime suck, so anime focused on sports is not going to intrest me.

Why would I watch Kuroko no Basket when I can watch LeBron sink 49 points in the playoffs on TNT?

WAY too unrealistic. Also because my favorite sport (football) isn't played in japan so there is no anime involving it.

Not a big fan of sports anime, unless you count Martial Arts Anime like Kenichi the Strongest Disciple. I do read a few sports manga, but I could never get myself to finish them. (Ex. Air Gear)

The only sports anime I liked was Prince of Tennis.

Gotta love prince of tennis and his cyclone shot

I hate sports animes the same way I hate shonen: repetitive, long drawn out battles, unrealistic moves, cliche story, unending train > beat enemy > new enemy > train harder routine and the FILLERZZZHEJHREHRKLHRHELHRSDHDAGD!!
>> ARTICLE
I dont like them
>> ARTICLE
i love Slam Dunk (the manga is probably my all time favourite) but i think the anime deserves a reboot with updated animations, the current slam dunk anime is obviously very old and 'outdated' also it does not cover all of the manga and sort of cuts off about 3/4 of the way that may be a turn off in this case. However for complete anime adaptations i think its actually the unrealistic feel they give to sports which turns people off them and in turn nobody talks about it ( KnB is enjoyable especially for someone who loves basketball like me, but some of the aspects of play in it are just absolutely ridiculous oh and the fact that anyone whos 6'2 in it can dunk as if he's Shawn Kemp or Shaq, or Midorimas 3 point shooting...)
>> ARTICLE
Because when I try playing the sport I end up looking like an idiot trying what they do on the show. Take Eyeshield 21 for example. When I try doing that in football I trip and face plant.

I'll only watch it if its a sport that I'm into. Since I'm only into baseball, I've only watched Major

You should definitely try out [Diamond no Ace](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18689/Diamond_no_Ace) and Ookiku Furikabutte.
>> ARTICLE
Im into motorsports, specifically drifting ,so I love initial D and wangan midnight. The only other person i know IRL who likes anime hates sports anime and likes all that campy magic BS, personally im in it for the action, tits and mind games that western junk fails to deliver nowadays.
although i watched out of obligation Persona 4 and its probably my number 2 favorite anime 
>> ARTICLE
Here's some love. Sports anime have been some of the first anime that I have really watched, and really brought me into the anime world in general. I loved Oofuri so much. I actually liked how it approached the game of baseball, highlighting its intricacies. 

I notice many people seem to be wary of heading into the sports sub-genre solely based on not really liking sports IRL...but that really has nothing to do with how much appreciation can come of a sports anime.

I guess depending on how the particular anime is handled, such as if it's more character-driven, or plot-driven, or even more driven to explore the game itself, can determine whether someone may find enjoyment from it. I think the "sports" tag covers a large variety of anime and definitely wish that people could see it as such moreso than all being the same. Because, from my experience, Ookiku Furikabutte was even super different from Diamond no Ace, another baseball anime, and there is such a wide set of variation between something like Slam Dunk to Air Gear for instance, that it's far too diverse a sub-genre to make over-arching assumptions.

In conclusion. Sports anime. I loved Ookiku Furikabutte. Started Diamond no Ace and love it so far. Not going to discredit a "fanservice" Free! because that isn't half bad (though it falls more on the character-driven side of the sports anime world). Prince of Tennis is a classic. There's just so much!
>> ARTICLE
I'm a man.
>> ARTICLE
Its formulaic and one gets bored after seeing a few , most of them follow a pattern of underdog -> special ability  ->surprise victory . I avoided most sports anime for that reason. I only got back to them with kuroko , mostly because of the ridiculous laser beam shots ( eventhough this again seems to follow the same pattern) 
>> ARTICLE
People who watch anime usually do not like sports. Thus, sports anime doesn't sound like something they would enjoy. Unless it's Ping Pong: The Animation. In which case it is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong isn't a sports anime, just wanna point that out. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't get that. Table tennis is a sport, the anime is about people playing table tennis. Yes it's more focused on the characters, but so are most sports movies that appeal to those that don't like or particularly care for sports.
>> ARTICLE
So tl;dr Ping Pong isn't a sport anime because its not about people playing table tennis, its about as much of that as JoJo is about people going to Egypt or Black Bullet being about a guy shooting stuff.  
>> ARTICLE
Calling Ping Pong a sports anime is like calling Rush a racing movie or Hannibal a horror show.  Table tennis is used to advance the story, its not a core element and you see very little actual Table Tennis.   The show would be the same if Table tennis was replaced with any 1v1 competitive game of any kind.   

In a sports anime you'll get history lessons and rules outlines while characters are driven by the game.  In Ping Pong you get none of that and the Table Tennis is fueled by the players.  You see the characters energy competing against each other with little to no focus on actual Table tennis.  If this was a sports anime you would see entire matches and specific strategies being showcased rather than the matches being glossed over and an entire focus on the character's back and forth's between each other

Not really surprising.  This is just for Gintama': Enchousen (2012).  Gintama (2006) Is rated 46 or something in popularity.  When people add shows to their MAL, they don't always take into consideration that additional seasons in MAL often get added as separate entries.

Really it's just because a lot of people who have watched a ton of Gintama still might not have made it that far. (I haven't yet)

I would think not a lot of anime watchers are into something like boxing. When you count over 100 episodes with all the series combined that adds to it also. Hajime no Ippo definitely one of my favorite series of all time though.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that's sort of the reason but I don't even like boxing and Hajime No Ippo is in my top 3 easily.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. I find myself watching a lot of sports anime when the only ones I follow are Cricket and to a lesser extent Football(Soccer)
>> ARTICLE
Definitely on my top list, but I feel a sort of dissonance when I tried watching an actual boxing match, it just didn't feel the same. The author and artist did something to Ippo to make the series spectacular.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because the manga and anime has to make every match insanely good, as intense as a boxing match can be, it's a battle shonen series afterall. Obviously only one in a thousand real pro matches can get close to it. Same with any sport.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Nodame Cantabile on this list. Just started season 1 and its so much fun.

I guarantee it gets 10000000000x better when you hear the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonic versions of all the mentioned songs

Thanks for the recommendations, I haven't yet seen Kids on the Slope, but I'll definitely watch that soon. As for Shigatsu, I am watching that as it airs, and while the music is great, the writing is a bit too melodramatic for me.

One day, [Sora No Woto](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To) will be on a list like this.  
[Until then...](http://i.imgur.com/bFYqoLb.gif)
>> ARTICLE
It might be too late for our trumpet girl as the anime's been out for quite a long time.
>> ARTICLE
Most likely never going to reach a decent scoring unless MAL somehow resets them (even so, it probably won't affect much of anything).

But for those wondering, Sora no Woto is a spectacular SoL series located in a very interesting post-apocalyptic setting. The show definitely has a very cute cast of characters, but it's not afraid to venture into a more heavy scene as the show progresses. Accompanied by the musical talents of Kalafina & Yuki Kajiura, the show has one of the best OSTs from a SoL. 

It is not at all a K-On clone like many have assumed it to be. The only drawback this show has is the fact that the world it takes place in is left devastatingly unexplored. I would've loved to learn more about the world this anime takes place in.

Give it a chance.

EDIT: A phrase.
>> ARTICLE
Nitpick: Sora no Woto's OST is by the unparalleled Ooshima Michiru (Xam'd, Tatami Galaxy, Zetsuen no Tempest). While I will disagree with you on the worth of the show as a whole, the soundtrack is a work of art. 
>> ARTICLE
Seems I've screwed up a little bit.

Perfectly fine if you don't hold it up as close to the candle as I do. Even if people don't agree with how great of a show it is, it's still a fine military SoL.
>> ARTICLE
Sold, added it to my plan to watch queue. Even though that means I still will probably never get to it but it's closer.

Also the statement about resetting the scores seems odd. Is there some reason that resetting the rates would bring the score up? Like was there a bunch of hatred for this show at one point and was given crap ratings. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not too sold on the idea that resetting the scores would bring up the score by much either (despite mentioning it). That's just the only solution I could see possibly working that would raise it's current rating. Sort of just threw the idea out there since the chances of MAL getting a score reset is unlikely

Then again, I'm not sure what the reason was for the initial dislike the show received when it had aired. I'm just assuming the general consensus now is that it isn't deserving of it's current low-ish score. And I agree with it. 

Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.
>> ARTICLE
>Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.

Pretty much this. haha. I don't know what could be done so that the scoring was meaningful. Just hope someone recommends and speaks out for those diamonds in the rough so you get a chance to experience them.
>> ARTICLE
Scoring will never be a useful tool for reviewing without some form of commentary to go along with it. All my scores on my MAL are only meant to be useful for myself.

Thankfully there are always a few reviews on MAL & other websites that give me a little bit more than just a score.

So mushishi, natsume book of friends, Kara no kyoukai, black butler, saint seiya, JoJo, hanamonogatari belong to "lesser known" list? What the actual fuck

To be fair it's movie 8 of Kara no Kyoukai that's on here, the lesser known 8th movie that wasn't even as good as movie 6 IMO... but yeah, still a little odd.

It's because many of them extra seasons.

To get to Book of Circus you have to watch two seasons (many put off by the second), Hanamonogatari three seasons and Nekomonogatari kuro and for Mushishi Zoku Shou you need to watch the first season.

Mushishi is a set of loosely connected histories. One could easily skip right to season 2

Similar case with monogatari, new seasons and films aren't all released in proper, chronological order

I watched part of it before, but it was too depressing and soul crushing for me that I dropped it.  Lately I've been toying with the idea of rewatching and then finishing it, but before I do, I'd like to ask something.  Does it have a happy/at least semi-happy ending?  If he ends up just being a slave or dying or something it won't feel like the watch was worth it at all for me... so I'd like to know beforehand not to watch it if there's a bad end.  I don't want any in depth spoils, just a yes or no @_@.

Kudos to Cross Game for having the saddest first episode in a children anime.

See: Kotoura-San
>> ARTICLE
Does Cross Game actually deliver instead of pussying out after two or three episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Please, dont think that cross game is anything like Kotoura-san. Its Adachi's most accessible and easy to watch/read series, and easily one of his best.

Adachi is the master of nostalgia high school sports, mixed in with somewhat opaque romance and usually a touch of tragedy. Its a brilliant mix, and hes been doing it for the better part of 30 years

Comparing the two is an insult to Cross Game.

Yes.

> in a children anime.

What. Did you just call an Adachi (possibly his best in many ways) series a kids show?
>> ARTICLE
What would you say is the target then? The anime basically aired during a time slot that was appopriate for a younger audience.
>> ARTICLE
its shounen sports that borders on sienen at times.

But adachi doesn't write your normal shounen sports ala slum dunk style, he has his own unique style
>> ARTICLE
It also frequently opened with a drawing song and displayed pictures submitted by viewers at the end of the episode. That means it is, at least in part, targeted towards kids.

Let me tell you about what happened on Tuesday. I made one of the worst decisions of my life, concerning anime.

So, I had Cross Game on my PTW for a while now. Tuesday night, before I hit the hay sack, I decided to watch the first episode before going to bed, thought, "Might as well start it". 

I think you can guess what happened next...No sleep for me for 2 hours, stayed up watching 6 more episodes...Godammit...

If you don't know them, you're either new to anime or not making an effort to find good anime.

I've got casual anime friends and colleagues who watch a series solely by word of mouth, or on recommendation only. There's no sense in thinking negatively on people just because they've never heard of your favorite series xxx. It's like telling a guy off for not having watched The Sound Of Music and Citizen Kane before watching the the movies now showing in cinema.

Really, there's no other prerequisite to watching anime than watching anime. We're all fans here.
>> ARTICLE
No. Some are fans of what's popular. Others are anime fans and do try to know more about something they like.

I'm pretty sure most "anime fans" say they're fans but only care about watching what's popular, which is only a small fragment of what anime is.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, anime has much more depth than what's popular, but honestly, if people are enjoying themselves, then there's no harm to it. Popular shows are good for socializing and community, anyway. I feel that's a much stronger part of what we are than if we were to view anime as art, and it's where anime cons, doujins and even this sub draws strength from.

So it's only better for us if we were to be excellent to everybody here :)
>> ARTICLE
I can get either Galactic Heores or Redline , but Initial D and Ashita Joe?
woah, you're missing a lot then.

Those are all really popular shows in Japan. For example, in many anime [Ashita no Joe spoilers](/s "when somebody dies or supposedly dies the screen turns black and white with the dead guy sitting there, smiling (see a certain character's death in Gurren Lagann. This is always a reference to a scene from [Ashita no Joe](http://i54.fastpic.ru/big/2013/0224/4b/fce7b32778c4cc79144c7ba4b6ec874b.jpg)").

A lot of sequels, as expected. Since only the ones that liked the first season would pick up the second too.

Seeing a lot of great shows on here, like the Aria series, Gin no Saji and Chihayafuru.

Utena is unpopular, I think I've officially given up on the anime community. 
>> ARTICLE
Granted, its REALLY FUCKING OLD. Then again, so too is Sailor Moon and DBZ...
>> ARTICLE
> ...its REALLY FUCKING OLD.

Utena is from 1996.  That might be old, but not 'REALLY FUCKING OLD'.  Talk to me about 'REALLY FUCKING OLD' when we're discussing shows from the 60s and 70s, you babby.  :P
>> ARTICLE
For me, that's pretty old in terms of Animu. 

Then again, I like things like Rose of Versailles and Candy Candy, so yes, I can talk about REALLY FUCKING OLD if you want :3
>> ARTICLE
Growing up back on the old anime forums and geocities (damn I feel old) all people talked about was Utena and then I finally saw it around 2001-2 and I understood why. It's a shame that classic deconstruction series like this are not well known but everyone knowns Evangelion (It's my favourite series but it really is kind of over rated). 
>> ARTICLE
I think they're both iconic and should be studied, but shoujo, for better or for worse, has always been overlooked in terms of actual influence and interest.
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely agree with that regard but Shoujo has had quite the effect overall on mainstream anime and has also resisted the changes of mainstream anime as well. 
>> ARTICLE
It has, but its also a lot less popular in absolute terms, for better or for worse. 

(I mean my favorite "old time" series are things like Rose of Versailles, so you're preaching to the choir here :P)

But yes, there are a ton of really iconic series.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely, we need to try and raise awareness! At least if only so people can see how much affect shjo has on anime period. 

And I feel like a terrible shjo fan because I never saw rose of versaille, and I've always wanted to. :(
>> ARTICLE
It's on Crunchyroll! Go check it out, FANTASTIC series. 
>> ARTICLE
It's in my queue, I actually found it today. I'll check it out once I'm done with Saint Seiya Omega (I tend to only watch 3-4 series at a time, any more and I lose interest) which should be tomorrow since I'm marathoning the series. . 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Utena was ever on Toonami/Cartoon Network, though. Could very well be wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
First time I saw anything Utena related was the movie back in 2002 on the International Channel, I actually didn't see the anime series until a few years after that when Anime Network aired it. 
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't, but it was one of the first major series imported to the US en masse 
>> ARTICLE
That's probably why it's not all that popular, though. Most people I know who watched anime when they were younger watched it on Toonami, including myself. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe? I know some kids like me were a bit proactive and started searching for imports when we were younger though.
>> ARTICLE
Utena is really old, and quite niche. :(
>> ARTICLE
I mean I know shjo is niche in the west but when it first came out Utena was big over here, I think it's more the culture has changed and we can only remember so many "classics" and they're invariably marketed towards the largest fanbase, boys.

There's some good stuff on this list. Shoutout to Kuuchuu Buranko at the very bottom!

I might've been tempted to strip out sequels entirely. But it's your list, you did the work, so nice one.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I thought about only putting the first entry of a series I'd encounter that fits the criteria at first, but there aren't that many in the end, and I still find it interesting when compared with the attach rate. Major's attach rate is absurdly high compared to Mushishi for instance, despite the latter being in the top 30.
>> ARTICLE
I think it would have been nice to free up space for others in the list by collapsing sequels to one entry. Attach rates for diff seasons could be in a note column or something
>> ARTICLE
I am in the crowd of "Mushishi is great ... I never watched the second or third season".

It's too episodic / "too much of the same" and I never had enough interest to keep watching it after the first series.
>> ARTICLE
I always find it funny how I see people say "Mushishi is great but you should take it slow" while I'm sitting over here marathoning it every time I watch it. I specifically waited until Zoku Shou was finished airing so I could watch it all at once. Now I just have to wait for the movie.

There is no 3rd season by the way.

Oh, I thought I saw 3 entries in MAL on it, shrug.

The second season was split into 2 cours + a movie, iirc.

This sounds very interesting, is it any good? I might give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
I don't have much to add to SSVD's answer, but yeah, while it isn't everyone's cup of tea -- which is fine -- it's a fascinating show which is definitely worth a shot.
>> ARTICLE
One of my personal favorites. It's more psychedelic and trippy than SHAFT shows, but its a show about psychiatry, so it's very fitting. Highly recommended if you like dramas. The show I think it's closest to in initial impressions/structure is The Tatami Galaxy.

It is episodic in nature, but every episode runs concurrently over the same 2 week time period, so they all interweave in subtle ways. Each one is about Irabu helping people with their mental problems, and it's consistently funny and touching.

In terms of production values, Irabu's VA lifts the show up 10 points alone, OP/ED are both great, music's wonderful, the art is excellent, and I hope you like live-action elements in anime, since this goes full Aku no Hana every now and then, (probably to cover up that there's very little animation in the thing).

I'd call it a 9, as it might have benefited a little more from a stronger overarching narrative, but the individual arcs are all fantastic.

Sounds awesome, I'll check it out later, thanks!

Didn't expect to see MSG: The 08th MS Team on this list, but I imagine it fell under the radar due to being a 90's OVA for one reason or another. I for one think of it as a gem. Not to mention, Shiro and Aina had such a sweet romance.
>> ARTICLE
Just counted, and I haven't watched 54 of these. But seriously, we need to let others know [Patema Inverted](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12477). It's an awesome anime to watch.
>> ARTICLE
It is a cruel world that would ignore the majesty of Whisper of the Heart. A very cruel, world. 

Looking over the list it's funny to see how many 'must watch' anime are on it. Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Revolutionary Girl Utena, MSG: 8th Team, Conan, Dennou Coil, and Maison Ikkoku all stand out as being among the most critically lauded shows in anime history. 

None of which I've yet to finish, mind you. Which says an awful lot about me. 
>> ARTICLE
Some of them are pretty daunting, I should've included the number of episodes as well. The only one I've seen that you listed here is Dennou Coil, which was very good. Reminded me of Steins;Gate in its pace.

Lol?

I'm thrashing through LotGH at the moment. It's absolutely enthralling. Really can't stress how little it matters that it was made in 1993. It deals with things I've never seen another anime deal with, and is overwhelmingly compelling to watch one episode to the next. The only anime I can compare it to, in terms of how high a regard it holds its themes, is Monster. They're about completely different things, but the essence of how they deal with the real issues surrounding humanity is similar.
>> ARTICLE
> Revolutionary Girl Utena

What is wrong with you people? This is one of the greatest anime ever made. 


>> ARTICLE
> What is wrong with you people? 

Nothing *wrong* with these people per say... but you forget that the majority of people on /r/anime and MAL are basically the same age as Utena.  If it's 15 years or older, most people haven't seen it unless it's mainstream.

Also, most people here are guys, and won't necessarily get into things ostensibly for girls.
>> ARTICLE
I was being sort of facetious. The thing is anime is way more popular as a whole than when I was getting into the scene. There are way more of us now than there were 15 years ago. 

Anyway thanks for making me feel weird. /s It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.
>> ARTICLE
> It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.

I always found this funny.  Watching anime in general is already a niche that's, at best, looked at strangely by the general population.  The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing.  Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).
>> ARTICLE

Funnily enough even in its home country. 

> The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing. Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).

I think it goes without saying that our society is geared against folks that don't identify with the general norm. I read manga/watch anime for the art, the story and the characters but despite having all of those I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(
>> ARTICLE
> Funnily enough even in its home country.

Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

> I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(

Sure you are, do what you want!  I watch crap for kids and adults; crap for guys and girls, it doesn't matter.  Quality and artistry doesn't know gender.  Let the haters hate.  Besides, this is the anonymity of the internet too, so:

1) Who cares what other people have to say.

2) You'll find a lot more like minded people here than you would have assumed.
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

Oh definitely, tho there is rampant homophobia as well it just manifests differently (like being gay is considered a phase that kids go through in Japanese culture). But the stigma in Japan for anime in general is a lot like the stigma for watching cartoons over here in that its still seen as something primarily for children. 

> Sure you are, do what you want! I watch crap for kids and adults; crap for guys and girls, it doesn't matter. Quality and artistry doesn't know gender. Let the haters hate. Besides, this is the anonymity of the internet too, so:

I wasn't quite saying that I personally would change what I like, I've been watching what I like for damn near over a decade and a half now, just critiquing the dominant view. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm at episode 12 from 39 and to me it seems like the plot is just starting, while Ping Pong, the masterpiece of anime, already finished an episode ago. 

I'm definitely having fun up to this point and it'll probably blow my mind by the time I'm finished, but the show is taking it's time. And shojo's of the 90's look weird. NGE looks way better.
>> ARTICLE
You're almost at one of the best arcs ever made for any anime period, the Black Rose arc, look forward to it. 

Trust me, by the time you finish this, you'll be a believer. Just be glad you didn't get the movie four years before the series like those of us way back when. :p Also shjo, at least in manga, has not really changed since the late 80s except males have become skinnier, it's only in the anime adaptations where utena eschews a more shnen look for keeping the shjo flowery approach. 

NGE is my favourite anime ever, and yes it looks good, but so does Utena in a different way. 
>> ARTICLE
Just stumpled upon this thread and by now I have finished Utena. Still don't relaly know what to think. It definitely well done, but at face value it does so little and I am not all that good with symbolism. It had some really hilarious stuff. That's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck is wrong with you?
>> ARTICLE
Well rheumatism, arthritis, demen-wait what was I talking about again? /s
>> ARTICLE
It can be pretty painful to watch. I mean how many times must I see the stair climbing montage? Only to be outdone by the elevator taking montage. 

Also, plenty of times throughout the show I wanted to scream "What the hell are you trying to tell me?" So it can be a frustrating show for people that are driven by plot as opposed to themes and symbolism.  
>> ARTICLE
Man the stair-climbing/elevator-taking are when things get real in an episode, they serve an important point. Repetition is a huge focus for reinforcing themes. Remember Utena is about growing up, the stair-climbing, elevator-taking are symbolic of going from lower to higher, that is becoming an adult. 
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea how Utena is so low (comparatively) in terms of ranking, both popularity and score-wise. How have more people not watched this show? I've met people who've watched a ton of anime who've never even heard of it. Is it because it's a magical girl series (kinda)? Is it because Utena's a girl? Are most people really that unwilling to watch anime that's more than seven years old? People on here talk about Penguindrum fairly frequently, and obviously a lot of attention is on Ikuhara with Yuri Kuma Arashi. I wish that there'd be more discussion about Utena beyond it being mentioned as a classic because it has so much depth to it, it easily deserves threads on the level of, say, the NGE rewatch. 
>> ARTICLE
I got bored after 14 episodes and quit watching. I can't relate to anyone in the show they are all so backwards.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly there actually were rewatch threads on here for Utena a few months ago. But only like two people posted in them.
>> ARTICLE
It's odd because all throughout the late 90s - early 2000s Utena was hailed as a masterpiece even if half the people watching it didn't understand that it was largely a coming-of-age story. 

But really Utena is to shjo what NGE is to mainstream anime, remembering that shjo while influential on the mainstream is largely resistant to the mainstream as well, an endpoint to a bleak era after the economic downturn of the 80s-90s. It was a clean break between the themes prevalent before and after. I think there are enough of us around to create a decent discussion thread. :p

Is the 'Aria' series worth pursuing? 
>> ARTICLE
it is my second favorite series behind hunter x hunter
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. I watch very little slice of life because I often find the majority of them to be mostly pointless apart from them making you feel comfy. I noticed that the Aria trilogy was quite often referred to as best SOL out there so I decided to give it a shot and it turned out to be one of my favourite shows.

 It is a coming of age story what gets better with each series and ends perfectly in my opinion. What made me love this series so much was how the main character Akari viewed and interpreted the world around her in such a beautiful way that I couldn't help but feel warm and fuzzy inside. 

The OST is also great at making you feel relaxed and comfy, here is one of my favourite songs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1hGtQxHvs 

I can't recommend this series enough, the only negative I can think of is that I found the cat's voice a little annoying initially but like the series he grew on me very quickly.
>> ARTICLE
It's an episodic slice of life anime about rowing gondolas on terraformed Mars. There is an overall linear progression, but it's mostly about the development of its characters. There's no denying it's hard to get into for most people, but it's charming and soothing, and it ends on a conclusive high note.

I would say that a large amount of the sequels could have been taken out, as they typically have viewers that decided to watch based on the first season, giving them unnaturally higher ratings. 

Edit: You may also want to think about removing those with scorers around the 12,000 mark and above, because quite a few of them are well known (At least on reddit (as it seems to me))

Big Windup! is one of my favorite sports anime so I'm glad its getting the recognition it deserves
>> ARTICLE
Dennou Coil is a masterpiece. It really is just about perfect. 

It has an interesting and well thought out world. Characters are likeable and relatable. The story has a well pacing, is interesting and actual works out. The soundtrack, while nothing really special, is used very well, always fits and underlines the atmosphere, but also knows when to be silent.

But I'm sad X, Arjuna or Giant Killing didn't make it. At least X could've managed to get it. Clamp manga animated by Madhouse? It should've been popular. Arjuna has Yoko Kanno's best work, but a weird story. I like it.

**BUT** how in fuck did Inu Yasha get in there? Judging by the 120 episodes I watched before droping it, it isn't a contender for top 100.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen InuYasha, but this is the second season. To get there you must have already went through 167 episodes, and judging by the description, it seems to be much faster paced (covering 21 chapters in 26 episodes compared to 35 in 167, from my understanding), which must contribute a lot to its high rating.

There is quite some stuff on that list that I adore(Cross Game, Chihayafuru, Kaiji, Gin no Saji, ...) but it makes sense.

I got to most of those through checking the Top MAL scores and not because they got recommended or written about.

But there are also a lot of em that seem to sit on my ptw list forever, since there is always something "more important" to watch.

I've seen quite a few of these shows mentioned here but haven't watched them yet, I should really get around to that. The attach rate is interesting, most shows are below .6. It would be interesting if MAL included that stat itself so we could compare shows by what percent of  people dropped/finished it more easily.

How about [Ikoku Meiro no Croise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9938/Ikoku_Meiro_no_Crois%C3%A9e) (went for the lesser known of all, hope you don't mind) for one of the three? You can pick which one I watch...and I can do contracts for all three if you are up for it :)
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't have to be serious, it's just that I'm not in the mood for pure unserious shows I guess, like your typical comedies :)

Never heard of **Ikoku Meiro no Croise**, which makes it perfect, and if I were to pick from the three I'd pick **Hourou Musuko**. Do we have a deal?

Also, I'm open to two more contracts if we're kind on time limit :) Hit me with more shows and we'll take it from there?
>> ARTICLE
Sure! I'll watch Hourou Musuko for Ikoku Meiro no Croise!

About other titles, I can think of [Tsuritama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12883/Tsuritama) which I watched recently and really liked but the others I thought of were more than 13 episodes (or only first season was 13 episodes) , so I'll try to think some more about that.  

Let me know if you want a time limit, I really don't mind any! Also, not sure if you want the contract to show up on the thread, I think we need to PM for that.
>> ARTICLE
Tsuritama for Aoi Hana then?

For the third, I'll be more lenient and say it doesn't have to be serious at all, SoL or moe is great for example, just no pure comedy like Nichijou or Nozaki :)

We could say like one week per contract, so finish all contracts *within* 3 weeks (if we agree on the third of course) or something? I might end up watching all in one week anyway, maybe we don't need a time limit. Unless you plan to spend 6 months or something.

Edit: Kamichu has 4 specials which are kinda cannon, so feel free to suggest a longer show.
>> ARTICLE
I'm up for a week per contract, though I'll probably watch them all quite soon (only watching airing mostly these days so was eager to find something complete to watch :D).

About the third, I'm thinking of [Free!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18507/Free!), since it seems you liked Hibike (which is the most similar title to it) and most KyoAni shows. Or maybe one of my (tons of) favourite shoujo [Natsume Yuujinchou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4081/Natsume_Yuujinchou)? Or would you prefer a moe title after all? I have a couple of those, I could throw at you, too, was just thinking of having you watch something you wouldn't usually pick (from what I could tell from your list, at least). Let me know!
>> ARTICLE
This seems like a good excuse to try Natsume Yuujinchou, I'll accept :)

I will probably watch them all next week anyways, but lets say within 3 weeks just to have a time frame?

So just to be sure, these 3 contracts:

* Hourou Musuko for Ikoku Meiro no Cruise

* Aoi Hana for Tsuritama

* Kamichu! for Natsume Yuujinchou

I don't really care whether the contracts are on the thread or not, but if you want we'll do it. I always make a comment in the [What have you watched--](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3tv6z0/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/) thread every Sunday, if it's okay I'll just page you there when I've finished contracts. If you'd like it done differently let me know (this is only my second time making a contract, so I'm not really familiar with how you'd normally do it).
>> ARTICLE
> I will probably watch them all next week anyways, but lets say within 3 weeks just to have a time frame?

Same here so sounds good!

Also, I usually post on "What have you watched" as well, so that sounds good, too! You can post wherever you feel like or PM or post here, up to you, really. Hope you enjoy them!

Great, a pleasure doing business with you :) 

Have fun and enjoy them :)

I'll offer Rosario+Vampire, Mirai Nikki or Fate/Zero in exchange for 1-2 animes with a combined total of around 26 episodes. A few more episodes is allowed.

>> ARTICLE
I watch both seasons of Rosario if you watch Planetes.
>> ARTICLE
I usually don't watch older anime because I just dislike the art style of older anime.
But for this contract thing, I will make an exception, lets do this :)
>> ARTICLE
I'll offer [Kokoro Connect](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11887/Kokoro_Connect) (with the Michi Random OVA which adds up to a total of 17 episodes) for a 12~26 episode show that includes any of the following genres:

- Slice Of Life
- High School Rom Com
- Mystery [Preferably locked room mystery such as](/s "Rokka no Yuusha or Dangan Ronpa")
- Drama

I'll bite. I'm not sure how you haven't seen [Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka?q=hyouka) yet (22 ep), but it's that or [Gakkou Gurashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24765/Gakkougurashi!?q=gakkou), (12 ep). 
>> ARTICLE
Huh, these both happened to be on my to watch list. I'm down to watch both!
>> ARTICLE
From your ratings, I think you'll enjoy them both. Albeit for somewhat different reasons. Both have mystery and SoL elements. Consider the contract signed.
>> ARTICLE
Finished Gakkou Gurashi.


[](/s "I don't think I've had trust issues like these since Oatmeal Raisin cookies. It went from 0 to 100 in a single episode.")
It was good tho.

>> ARTICLE
Glad you enjoyed it. From your MAL I guessed you liked anime that could hurt your feelings, and to be honest I also enjoy recommending Gakkou Gurashi to people without telling them what to expect.

I'm finishing another contract on Kuroko no Basket right now, but I should be onto Kokoro Connect by Thursday. Plan to finish by Saturday.
>> ARTICLE
Started Kokoro Connect today. I'll admit I went into it knowing two things.

1. Body Switching Drama

2. Inaba Best Girl

I'm liking it so far, but from the first two episodes I'm getting a distinct feeling that the pacing is fucked. It's a bit too random, puns aside. The character interactions are fun, but the art is a little... bland. Great voice work.

The obvious comparison is Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, which also had pacing issues (too hyper) but I found more immediately likeable. Thus far, Inaba's best girl status isn't really in question although Iori interests me more. We've got retarded blonde Romeo, bland wrestling fetishist dude, scared of men barbie, sideponytail cute little fang girl, and grumpy shorthaired tryhard girl.

It seems a bit unpredictable, and I'm guessing the body switching will just be one arc (as it sort of gets old once the ice is actually broken). We've got the lonely Iori drama, the scared of men drama, the unrequited love drama, and the whatever Inaba's attitude drama is.

The show is a little meta, and I'm not sure how self-aware it will be about it, but so far I'm enjoying myself.

Also, the random lesbian rapey scene put me off more than a little.
>> ARTICLE
Aight 10 episodes down. Inaba crushing the best girl race. Just realized she shares a voice actress with Kanbaru from Monogatari, which explains why I'm digging her voice so much.

Uhh I could do with less crying, truth be told. This arc was a lot of shouting, and while some of it was justified a lot of it felt very... similar. I keep thinking Heartseed is gonna off one of them for real, but after pussying out in episode 5 I'm not getting as much of a Bokurano vibe.

I'm enjoying the show so far, largely off of how well presented Inaba's character is. The plot is kind of whatever, and it's not really that *deep* but it's fun. I guess the thing that bothers me most is that all the characters seem to accept the messiah complex of the MC and think it's annoying but nice... which is really not consistent with my experiences with such people.

I just can't tell if the show is trying to break the 4th wall or if it's just knowingly generic that way. Either way, I'm positive I wouldn't be enjoying this nearly as much if Inaba wasn't such a cool character. I basically only like her and sideponytail chick of the main cast.
>> ARTICLE
Annnnd done. Kokoro Connect was nice. The supernatural adolescence metaphor was a touch ham-handed, and I was pretty done with the crying and shit toward the end, but Dereban was worth it.

I'm curious why you rated it much more highly than Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, which I found to be quite similar but more audio-visually appealing. My guess is that you valued the dramatic elements of KC, while I valued the quirky humor of Yamada-kun. Not that there's anything wrong with that, just interesting to me that there was a 2 point difference in scores.

My score: 8/10
>> ARTICLE
Kokoro Connect was one of my firsts, so it's partially the sentimental value that affected the rating. That and Dereban. I understand the connection you make between Yamada and KC in the body switching, and I thoroughly enjoyed both, but I feel like the fact that KC's body switching was uncontrollable made the dynamic between characters more interesting.

I still haven't started Hyouka yet though. I'll begin that after finals week!
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka will be a great decompression anime to relax with. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I'll offer [Katanagatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6594/Katanagatari) or [Death Parade](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade) for pretty much anything of similar length.  

[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/sxypancake)

Will do Katanagatari for [Anohana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9989/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai.?q=Anohana)

Just glad to see Cross Ange being a part of a contract

I want to trade [Shin Sekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) with someone. Willing to watch up to 30 episodes and make it not a slice of life if you can.(Need a break from SoL)

[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/profile/Homugahara)

I'll trade it for Durarara!! if you're interested... just the first season is fine
>> ARTICLE
Sure dude. And i'll watch it all, cuz i'm a huge fan of the dub cast.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to hear it, look forward to hearing what you think... It's one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm, I'm willing to trade Demon Lord Dante for something thats funny but a bit serious on the side. Can up to 50eps, but any higher and I can't watch.

[MAL](http://www.anime-planet.com/users/Darkwings01/anime)
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch any anime if you watch something from the list. Show should be about in equal length but not necessarily.

* [The iDOLM@STER](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10278/The_iDOLM@STER)  
* [Symphogear](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11751/Senki_Zesshou_Symphogear:_Meteoroid-Falling_Burning_and_Disappear_Then...)  
* [Initial D](http://myanimelist.net/anime/185/Initial_D_First_Stage)
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch Symphogear if you watch [Samurai 7](http://myanimelist.net/anime/166/Samurai_7?q=Samu), and to make it more fair I'll even add in watching the sequel Symphogear G. That way it is an even number of episodes between us. 

Deal? 
>> ARTICLE
Sure thing! I don't think I'll manage to finish it in a week or 2 though since my vacation has ended so it will take some time.
>> ARTICLE
That's fine. As it is also likely to take at least a week to finish Symphogear. Looking forward to seeing how you like it.
>> ARTICLE
Historical Mecha Samurais ? Interesting....
>> ARTICLE
I will watch any anime with 1-25 episodes and is dubbed. The anime I wish you to watch is Yuki Yuna is a Hero.
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch Yuki Yuna is a Hero if you watch Fate/Zero (25 episodes and dubbed). Deal?
>> ARTICLE
Do you have a link to which one? I know there are like a billion different ones haha

But sure, sounds like a deal,
>> ARTICLE
This is the one: http://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero. It has a second season with 12 more episodes so that makes 25 in total. Hope you like it as much as I did!
>> ARTICLE
Alright, so we just watch each others anime and then what? I'm not exactly sure what to do other than watching the anime haha

I think that's it, this is the first time I do this tbh. Watch it and let each other know when we finish it.

k will do

>> ARTICLE
Hey everyone, I'm going to be continuing to do **two-way blind contracts** if anyone's interested. This is where we both jump in blind to a single show from either my [MAL PTW](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/State_Fan_007) or a show you suggest to me you think we would both enjoy. Send me a message or reply to this post if you're interested.

~~~

My previous contracts are listed at the bottom of my [MAL Profile](http://myanimelist.net/profile/State_Fan_007). If anyone is curious.

~~~

Side Note for those who already have contracts with me:

 I have been really busy with school and work lately, not to mention Fallout 4 sucking up all my free time. So, I've fallen behind on my current contracts. However, I will be doing everything in my power to complete any uncompleted contracts I have by next weeks thread. (My schedule has cleared up considerably, so I can almost guarantee it)
>> ARTICLE
Hey what's up! Still waiting on that NGNL contract :P

I just finished SAO if you'd be willing to double blind SAO II? Even though Alfheim wasn't as good as Aincrad, I'm the anal type of person that just has to keep going. Plus it wasn't THAT bad (apart from creepy ass Sugou).

Other options include Charlotte, Jitsu wa Watashi wa, or Spice and Wolf!
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I should be done with NGNL today or tomorrow, sorry it took so long. We can do SAO II next if you want. I agree Alfheim wasn't horrible, it was just disappointing because I enjoyed the first half so much.
>> ARTICLE
Haha enjoyment is all relative. I just try to think of them as individual ones on their own. I'll prolly start SAO II tomorrow! No rush on NGNL
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch a 13-26 episode series in exchange for watching Inferno Cop (3 min episodes) and Yamada-kun to 7-nin No Majo
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch those if you're up for watching [White Album 2.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2)
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good to me
>> ARTICLE
Ok awesome! I'm on vacation right now but I will be back tomorrow and will start then. I will probably be able to finish them by next weekend.
>> ARTICLE
I know I'm a bit late but if anyone wants to trade, pick Cowboy Bebop, Neon Genesis Evangelion (original series PLUS End of Evangelion movie), Kara no Kyoukai, Baccano!, Princess Mononoke, or Kill la Kill and give me one of your absolute favorites of equal or shorter length to what you've chosen (for KnK just assume it's ~ as long as a 24 ep series and rounding up from Baccano's 16 eps to 24 is acceptable). My MAL isn't entirely up to date, there are ~10 shows not on there yet and the watching/ptw are all old so there's a small chance you'll hit something I've already seen. 
>> ARTICLE
If you're up to do two seasons I'll take Bebop and pick Kill la Kill back up in addition to watching Mononoke, or Bebop and NGE for Clannad + Afterstory.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good to me. I'm a bit busy of late though so two seasons might take some time. Take on whichever combination you want.
>> ARTICLE
Alright I'll do Bebop+NGE, take as long as you like I'm going to be a little busy too.
>> ARTICLE
Cool. I'll PM to update once I finish the first season if you'd do the same once you complete one.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good to me!
>> ARTICLE
I'm on mob so I can't hit up your MAL, but have you done Gundam Unicorn? Its an OVA series with six one hour episodes and one two hour episode at the end. That puts it in the same league as Kara no Kyoukai, I think? I don't know that I'd be up for binging it all in a week, but I'm certainly up for a watch. 
>> ARTICLE
Someone else already replied. If you'd still be interested I can pm you once I'm done with their contract.
>> ARTICLE
Dang, they got in before my reddit mobile app updated. Ah well! If you're up for doing an episode a week of Gundam Unicorn, I'll do Kara no Kyoukai at the same speed.
>> ARTICLE
I could make that work, sure. KnK is best if you let it sink in a bit regardless. It can be a bit hard to understand if you don't give it some thought and time to breathe really lets you appreciate some aspects more.That's why it went from about a 7 to a 10 for me on the rewatch. I just suddenly had the urge to watch it again and fell in love.
>> ARTICLE
Well how about this - we contract to each watch the first episode of the others' film series, and we'll sign again next week to do episode 2?

So, the contract is: By Saturday 5th December 2015, /u/Fenixius will watch Kara no Kyoukai Episode 1, and /u/7TeenWriters will watch Gundam Unicorn Episode 1.

So, will you sign?

[](#stare)
>> ARTICLE
Deal, I'm on board.
>> ARTICLE
I have messaged the one who manages the thread. It is done! See you next week!
>> ARTICLE
I think I've seen Princess Mononoke once when I was a really little kid but I've been meaning to watch it again for quite a while now but haven't got around to it, so would we trade for like a movie?
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I already have two contracts going, which might end up being a bit difficult with how busy I am as is.
>> ARTICLE
I'm offering [Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/358/Iriya_no_Sora_UFO_no_Natsu), I'll take a movie or 13-or-less series in exchange.

>> ARTICLE
I'm going to get all meta up in here and make a contract for 1 cour of any anime if YOU will watch Madoka Magica. 

  

MAL should be in flair :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh man I was just trying to decide what to watch next and Madoka is on my PTW. So I'll take you up on that offer.

Although from your MAL it seems like you probably wouldn't like most of my recommendations. So I'll give you several options and you choose whichever you want (or none, it's ok if you dont like any).

Noragami, Angel Beats!, Hibike! Euphonium, Seitokai Yakuindomo, or Girls und Panzer.

I must warn you that I'll probably be done with it by like tomorrow though, but you're free to take as long as you want with yours.



>> ARTICLE
Be assertive! Anime contracts are all about ~~expanding your horizons~~ shoving dislikable shit onto your contractee until they get Stockholm'd.
>> ARTICLE
Contract accepted! I love dirty jokes and the only reason I've put off Seitokai Yakuindono is because... Wait, I don't have a good reason... _ 

It'll probably take me a coupla days, but enjoy MM and let me know what you think in the meantime!
>> ARTICLE
Seitokai! 
>> ARTICLE
I'll take any 12 ep or less series, and I'll trade it for Gingitsune or Love Stage!! 
>> ARTICLE
[Here's my MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/saintyoo)

I'm offering a **double blind contract**. If you're interested, post your MAL in a reply.

I'll also contract with multiple people.
>> ARTICLE
So [here](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Nickpressnall) is my MAL. I accept the contract, signed now in the blood of a thousand lolis. Just a heads up, the best way to contact me will probably be through my [steam account](http://steamcommunity.com/id/actuallydio/). Just add me if you want.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! From Your **Planned to Watch** I'd say you should watch **Death Parade**. An alternative would be **Nagi no Asukara**, although it has 26 episodes.

I'm up for anything and will match episode length (sorry I don't have a PTW). I'd say one week would be a good deadline for a ~12 episode show (two weeks for a ~24 episode show).
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, I will give Nagi no Asukara a watch. For you, I recommend either [GATE](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28907/Gate:_Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakaeri) or [Akagami no Shirayuki-hime](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30123/Akagami_no_Shirayuki-hime). Both are very good and both have second seasons coming up in January, so its the perfect time to watch them. Of the two, GATE is probably my favorite, but the way Shirayuki-hime throws off the traditional romance tropes to make a truly unique and captivating story makes it the superior anime by far. GATE is goofy and fun with its unusual plot and pacing, and the characters are very memorable. Plus its got Rory.
>> ARTICLE
My bad, I've already seen those shows. Unfortunately I missed about 50 shows on my list. My MAL should be updated now.

Again, Sorry!
>> ARTICLE
Ok, so that actually makes it easier because I can give you a 24 episode show. The show you will be watching is none other than [Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time), a romance set in a college environment which was, in my opinion, one of my favorite romances I have ever seen. It gets a bit weird at times, but overall it was a great watch. I will begin Nagi no Asukara tonight and let you know when I finish it!
>> ARTICLE
Alright! That sound good. I'll start today as well and will probably be done in a week.
>> ARTICLE
I think I can get my contract partner something he/she can appreciate, if you can convince me to watching something 13-26ish. Or maybe just a movie?

turn offs:
yaoi, WWII, overly sexy, incest, gore. 

....I'm sorry guys I'm quite picky. 

Also very available to discuss the shows, I hardly get to discuss them with anyone. 
>> ARTICLE
> WWII

That certainly is a unique turnoff.  
>> ARTICLE
Haha yeah, growing up I had to learn WWII stuff a silly of times. I actually don't remember the number of semesters because it was so high I stopped caring. It also always made me real sad..killing and torture and stuff, and made for a depressing experience over several years. So I usually avoid it now. 
>> ARTICLE
If you post your MAL it'll help prevent people from suggesting shows you've already watched.

If you're still waiting, I'll throw out [Angel Beats](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!), [ToraDora](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!), and [Trigun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun) for a bit of a spectrum.  My MAL's in my flair.
>> ARTICLE
Haibane Renmai, Hanasaku Iroha, or Eureka 7 sound good? I made it 1/6 the way through Trigun so far today. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll take Hansaku Iroha to match up w/Trigun then.  If you don't mind I'll add it to the contract list. :)
>> ARTICLE
great. 

4 episodes in trigun is nice. seeing a hero/protagonist who doesn't like to hurt people is something I'm fond of.
>> ARTICLE
Do I have to watch everything right away? Pretty busy with things rn but definitely up for it if you don't mind I might take a while 
>> ARTICLE
Nah no rush
>> ARTICLE
I have quite a bit on my plate with all the rewatches going on so let's do something short.

I'll offer [Gunbuster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/949/Top_wo_Nerae!_Gunbuster?q=gunbuster) for two different anime movies.

[My MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/JsaKim)
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good. Looking forward to it. I'll try to finish it by this time next week.
>> ARTICLE
You know what, I'll try. Standard contract: I'll trade [Magic Kaito 1412](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25517/Magic_Kaito_1412) (24 episodes) or [Kyousougiga](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_(TV) (10 episodes) for something 12-24 episodes as well. I prefer something not gritty but will take most anything.
>> ARTICLE
I'll trade [Gatchaman Crowds](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18229/Gatchaman_Crowds) for Kyousougiga. They seem decently similar in tone.
>> ARTICLE
I have a question. I remember trying an episode of Gatchaman Crowds but it seemed fairly over the top is that the case? Despite my love for Kyousougiga, its a rare case and I prefer my shows to be a bit more...grounded(?).
>> ARTICLE
Depends on what you mean by 'over the top'. In terms of characters, a bit, but that's because the characters are more personifications of values systems rather than characters. In terms of story, it's pretty down-to-earth--there aren't really any tokusatsu antics after the first 2 episodes. Looking by your Hummingbird, we have similar tastes(like, really similar tastes), and the show I felt it was most similar to was the pre-Guillotine Guerilla parts of Samumenco(which I also loved).
>> ARTICLE
Alright then I will take you up on the offer then. I will give it another try.
>> ARTICLE
Cool!
>> ARTICLE
It's really frustrating when I would take Kyousougiga, but about 5 shows that I would trade is on your dropped list (SSY, ZnT, Penguindrum, Katanagatari, Magi).

EDIT: I GOT ONE, I'll take Kyou for Shirobako, (how have you not watched this yet?)
>> ARTICLE
I am incredibly lazy with my list, I rarely will put things I only watched a couple episodes of. (actually despite Magic Kaito being one my favorites, I only realized a hour ago that I never put in the completed list) Anyways Shirobako is one of those, I watched a couple episodes when it was airing but eventually other things took its place. I think I will take you up on that, seemed interesting enough.
>> ARTICLE
I'm offering Mawaru Penguindrum. I'll accept anything 25 episodes or shorter, with the exception of ecchi.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Penguindrum and it seems interesting.

Would you be willing to watch season 1 of [Kuroko no Basket?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11771/Kuroko_no_Basket)
>> ARTICLE
Deal. Prepare for a bizarre ride. And some penguins.
>> ARTICLE
Update: I'm 13 episodes in. Enjoying it so far, absurd plot armor and all. Keep getting Shokugeki no Souma flashbacks, and Ping Pong. Maybe I just like sports shounens who knows.
>> ARTICLE
Additional Update: 18/25. Man there just isn't any downtime in this show. Aomine finally broke the plot armor by literally being so overpowered he could 1v5. Sure, you see that from time to time in high school sports but not usually at the regional level. I'm curious where this goes since there are oodles of arcs left and we've already hit an opponent who would be scouted before he graduated high school. I'm guessing this season ends on something of an anticlimax, and next season the Aomine problem gets resolved somehow. 

Anywho, gonna take a break and catch up on currently airing shows. Should be able to finish this season by Wednesday.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, man I'm glad you're enjoying the ride, I haven't gotten a chance to watch Penguindrum yet because I've been at my parents house for Thanksgiving with the horrible wifi, but I'll definitely start watching it tomorrow now that I'm back in my dorm.
>> ARTICLE
No rush. It's one of those shows that can be really hard to get into at first, but then suddenly you are like what the fuck is going on oh my god did I really just watch 8 episodes what happens next i need to know what the fuck.

So I'm saying take it at your own pace.
>> ARTICLE
I'm loving Penguindrum btw I'm 3 episodes in (I'm watching the dub, I don't know if that's "the correct way", but meh it's my preference).

First things first (I'm the realest): but no, Sho>Kanba, real talk, much more relatable and less edgy guy. However Yamashita is best guy.

This fuckin' show man, it's trolled me too many times "SURVIVAL TACTIC!!!!!" I swear, I was already getting emotional and that really came out of left field. Every day should be Himari Day. NO EVERY DAY SHOULD BE CURRY DAY!!! EVERY DAY!!!! The artstyle is very vibrant, I love the use of colors in this anime so much. So many flashbacks bruh. The scene when Shoma was walking around and it was followed by a bunch of white looking bathroom door men, was really well done. Then there's the bear that shoots a pink stairway from it's crotch. "We do what you want with pleasure Ms. Hat", TOP KEK!!!!! Then out of nowhere, RAINBOW SIX PENGUIN EDITION!!!! "We all know how much I love wieners" LMAO!!!! The dialogue is god tier, and did that penguin just go muff diving? Then there's that awkward statue with two guys glued together. Just what is going on with the aesthetics of this show? and this Ringo bitch is CRAZY, certified coocoo for cocoa puffs, Gary Busey crazy. [](/s "Dat Ringo NTR Tho. I cri everytiem").

These fucking Penguins tho.

THESE FUCKIN' PENGUINS THO!!!

So adorably squishy, I want one now. (The one with the bugspray specifically)

JUST WHAT IS THE PENGUINDRUM!!!??? I HAVE TOO MANY QUESTIONS BUT TOO LITTLE TIME!!!
>> ARTICLE
This is everything I could have hoped for from your reactions and more. :D

The show stays pretty confusing. The ending is one of my favorites, but expect to still have questions after your first watch. ;) 
>> ARTICLE
Also, just finished Kuroko no Basket S1. It was good, if a little predictable (called that anticlimax with setup for the Winter Cup). I think the Shounen nature of the show hyped it up through some of the slow points (3 minutes of exposition, 8 seconds of gametime, etc). I'd recommend it to sports lovers, but I don't have any particular desire to watch the sequels. Maybe someday.

Also, their coach is somehow the most attractive thing. I don't even know why, but I found her really sexy somehow. Waifu material. So thanks for that.

I'm interested in starting the **standard contract**! So I'll trade off the glorious [Hamatora The Animation] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/20689/Hamatora_The_Animation) 
or [Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/11843/Danshi_Koukousei_no_Nichijou) for anything 12-24~ episodes or less! Doesn't matter the genre, I'm up for just about anything!

You know, I've heard so many good things about that show and just never gave it any attention.. So I'll gladly take that offer~

Enjoy Hamatora, that show's fantastic if I say so myself!

I'll start Hamatora soon, once I finish Madoka and catch up on OPM!

You got it friend~

I added you, definitely give me your reactions to S;G. It doesn't get good until around 12, but damn it's worth it, still my favorite anime to this day.

You got it! I'll be sure to keep you nice and updated while I watch the series~ 

I'm actually a little excited to start this one, just reading over the initial synopsis is making me already love the show!

Here, I'll give you a little hint then. You're not ready. You think you're ready, but you're not. No matter how much you prepare yourself, you will never be ready.

Oh geez.. I hope it's not like AnoHana or something, I can't handle that much of an emotional rollercoaster..

(Totally lying, I can handle it no problemo~...I think XD)
>> ARTICLE
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

You think AnoHana (which I haven't seen, but I know what it is and how it goes and how it's a sweet story and shit) was bad, huh? You, *sir*, are in for a shit storm.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen it, as I don't like shows with time travel. Still worth it? Never done a contract before.
>> ARTICLE
As a fanboy, so much. It is so worth it. It's a very character based show, though, so if you don't like those type of shows, you may not like it. Of course, I'll still recommend it because it's fucking amazing.

*Also, it may or may not leave you depressed for a month. The PADS is real. Be warned.*

I'm not too sure about being set the the DRRR universe, but it is definitely similar. Both involve gang wars.

I want to make someone else watch the hilariously-average [*Ambition of Oda Nobuna*](http://www.crunchyroll.com/the-ambition-of-oda-nobuna/episode-1-nobuna-and-the-monkey-601565). I watched it because someone else told *me* it was super average, and... well... meh. It's OK. Don't regret watching it. Pretty good last episode, but that's to be expected. I gave it a 6/10 because I chuckled every time something was generic and average.

In exchange, make me watch the most average show you know of! Oh, but not more than around 24 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I'll take it and give you Kakumeiki Valvrave.
>> ARTICLE
Mecha, eh?

Well, I'd usually avoid it, but here goes nothing!
>> ARTICLE
Oh, if you want try a good mecha series try the airing, Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans, or the about to end rewatch of Gundam 00. Both are pretty good.

>> ARTICLE
It's not that... I usually avoid all mecha regardless of quality, because I personally just find the whole idea of giant (fighting) robots to be unappealing.
>> ARTICLE
You must be my evil twin. I watch all mecha regardless of quality cause I can't get enough of the idea of giant robots fighting.
>> ARTICLE
Look forward to it! It's got a hilariously b-grade plot with high end Sunrise production values. It takes itself very seriously, but if you try and view it from a distance, it's really easy to enjoy. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm noticing some bland worldbuilding, and just about everything I've seen having to do with the actual mech seems really cheesy. Also, the whole [](/s "guy's girlfriend seems to die, but oh hey she's not really dead in the second episode") is kinda disappointing but not really *bad* because of what that should do to the show considering the MC's whole motivation (I'm not *too* much further than that)...

Pretty much what I was asking for!
>> ARTICLE
I'm interested in starting a contract. Looking for a 1-4 cour series, either from my PTW or something else good I may not have considered yet. Both sides of the contract should watch about the same length.

Finished Amnesia! The only good thing about this show was the opening, artwork, and Shin. (I've fallen in love with those eyes.) Everything else was just bleh. And that cage scene... that god damn cage scene. Gave it a 4/10.

/u/snowywish 

Finished Joshiraku...didn't like it that much...but I honestly don't think it's my kind of thing (I'm not a cute girls doing cute things kind of fan)...Felt like  I actually knew a lot of the references (From 2001 A Space Odyssey, Dog of Flanders, Madoka, etc.), but didn't really find much funny behind them (kind of just felt like references...) and the comedy just didn't work for me (also according to [MALgraph](http://graph.anime.plus/pittman66/favorites,anime), J.C. Staff and I don't get along...). 4/10...sorry...but Cross Game and Mononoke are staying strong!

Well I gave you two 10s and a 9... and the 9 is dead so hopefully the 10s keep up the good work!

We can write off Joshiraku against Nanoha and everything is daijobu.

/u/flatiron_bonfire I'm sure you're tired of my broken recording on this but finished Planetes; still abhorrent.

/u/keokl Kyousougiga is done. That was actually pretty fresh and exciting. Well, I suppose there's a limit to how much you can like a show if you hate the lead but honestly, I really liked it. 8/10

/u/plasticletters I feel like you never got my message so I'll tl;dr it here. Mousou Dairirin. Haven't had so much fun watching a show since when I first started anime with Madoka. 10/10
>> ARTICLE
Wait, which main didn't you like? Koto or Myoue?
>> ARTICLE
Koto. She annoyed me to bits.

Rest of the cast was really dynamic and likeable, though.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting.. I loved Koto. She's a bit of a brat, but her interactions with the rest of the characters truly added to my enjoyment. In example, [when](/s "she calmed down Yase. After that, Yase realized the kindness around her and slowly begins to mature. Her character changed after that. It may not have been an in your face change, but her aura was definitely different.") However, I can see why you would find her annoying. All in all, I'm glad you enjoyed the show (for the most part anyway)!

Yo /u/berzha101, watched s1 of School Rumble, and I liked it so much, I started s2, currently 18 episodes in. Good shit.

/u/ziztark

Completed Seitokai Yakuindomo last night. It reminded me of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei in that you really get a whole lot more out of it if you can understand Japanese language/culture.

Some of the jokes made me snigger and some I had to rewatch several times to figure out the humour and some I didn't get at all no matter how hard I tried. Also a lot of the funniest bits were already spoiled by reddit... Thanks reddit!

Overall I think it's between a 6.5 and 7 for me after comparing it to other gag anime I've seen, e.g. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun has shown that you can have gag anime which are hilarious while also developing characters much more.

I think I'm still gonna watch the OVAs next though.

edit: Contract complete!

/u/milnivek

I just finished Madoka Magica today. I was actually about to finish it last night but it was like 3 AM and I ended up falling asleep (because I was tired, not bored). 

That was... interesting. Definitely not what I expected going into the show, even though I knew it was not just a "magical girls doing cute stuff" it got darker/deeper than I expected it to get.

I'm just gonna tag the rest of it as spoilers to make it easy for me.

[Madoka Magica ALL](/s "I liked it a lot, the story had really nice pacing, and great plot IMO. Although I did see the "twist" of Homura being from a different timeline coming, maybe not from the beggining but probably around episode 3 or so. What I did not expect was that she was doing it all for Madoka. I was really surprised at how they weren't afraid to kill off characters, and the fact that their death had some meaning and weren't just for shock or whatever. Mami's death had a lot of death flags before it so it wasn't very unexpected, but I really expected Sayaka to be saved by Madoka at some point. ")

[Madoka Magica ALL](/s "It was a really satisfying anime, especially the ending. I liked that it wasn't all fine after Madoka made her wish, after all there had to be some evil in the world. I do wonder though, since Madoka is everywhere anytime, would she talk to Homura every now and then? Like in the after credits scene of the last episode? That's just speculation anyways.")

All in all I'm giving it a 9/10. I wish I knew what it was missing to make it a 10. But to me it feels like there is... *something* missing to make it a 10/10 in my eyes. Also it took me a while to get used to the faces. I dont know why but they seemed weird to me at first. I do have to say, the voice acting was REALLY good, they managed to show a lot of emotion when the characters were crying or angry etc... 

Still, I'm very glad I took the contract and watched this now, because it certainly is an anime no one should miss.

How is Seitokai Yakuindomo for you? Have you started it?
>> ARTICLE
I'm really really glad you enjoyed Madoka! It also took me a while to pick up because damn it the faces, but once I started, it really did go away/grow on me. Still haven't picked up Clannad though... XD

[Madoka spoilers] (/s "That's pretty impressive! I never noticed any death flags except the one just before Mami goes to fight Charlotte, and I certainly did not have any suspicions about Homura's origins till maybe episode 5 or 6! The first time I watched it, around episode 6 or so I started to get the feeling that it was a 9 or a 10 and so I started keeping track of the plot points which I thought would not be resolved or explained well and as I recall they all were. I really love heroic, unappreciated sacrifices, so by the end of episode 12, I was just sat there shell shocked before going off on all the social medias to rave about it to my friends. It's absolutely my favourite series of all time and I love it as much as I hate its sequel.")

I'm on episode 7 or 8 of SYD right now, and hope to be done by today since I'm at home sick. I'll post a comment tagging you once I'm done!

/u/friendlypinetree 

I'm four episodes in now, *and I have no idea what the fuck is going on.*

I'm enjoying it, though. Intrigued as to what will happen.

The MC is actually pretty cute, and the OP is dope.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I wrapped up two contracts this week:

**Crest of the Stars** for /u/durinthal

While I initially believed this series would be big on world building at the expense of character development, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Jinto and Lafiel's relationship was truly the star of the show. Crest of the Stars, which took an interesting idea in putting the focus on the empire rather than the rebellion, feels a bit dated but is still a solid sci-fi show. While I wasn't all that impressed by the battle sequences, I did enjoy the relationship between the two leads. Upon their first meeting, it's clear that Jinto feels useless next to the more knowledgeable Lafiel. However, when the show moves from Abh-controlled space into United Mankind territory, Jinto takes the lead, reinforcing the show's claim that everyone is differently talented. Throughout the series we see Jinto and Lafiel learning from each other- Jinto finds his courage, while Lafiel realizes that doing what's right can be more important than doing what makes sense. On the technical side, the animation hasn't aged the best, but I really enjoyed the soundtrack, and the opening theme was really nice. Overall, I liked this show, and I'll probably start watching Banner of the Stars soon.

Final Score: 7.5/10

**Kyoukai no Kanata** for /u/AmirZ

I didn't think a studio like KyoAni would be able to do a good action show, but Kyoukai no Kanata surprised me. The animation is gorgeous, the cast is funny and likable, and the fight sequences are great, although the plot falters by comparison, and the ending kind of felt like an asspull. The show introduces a lot of interesting ideas, but several of them aren't elaborated upon. For example: What is the Society's beef with the Nase family? Why does Fujima want to [](/s "end the world? Was the Society telling the truth about him being a rogue agent?") And how did [](/s "Mirai come back to life? I'm glad she didn't die, but there should be a good explanation for it.") The show was decent despite its plot issues. I'm planning on watching the movie later on.

Final score: 6/10








>> ARTICLE
> Crest of the Stars

Glad you liked it! The animation is definitely the weakest part of the series to me, though I never minded it all that much. I've also only recently realized how different the [opening theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJEBcXIqNp0) is compared to your average anime pop/rock theme, though I suppose at the time it aired this wouldn't have been that unusual.

Banner of the Stars carries on the relationship Jinto and Lafiel havemy favorite part of the seriesbut shifts focus to cover more of the broader conflict between empires. I was reminded of that aspect when watching Gunbuster last week, which surprised me by [how much I enjoyed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3tv6z0/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cx9hgax) (in case you missed my post about Gunbuster/Diebuster then).

It's pretty cool. The fanservice isn't as much as I thought it would be, which is nice. It's at a decent level. The actual cooking is so hype. I'm liking it a lot.

Just finished Millennium Actress and it's definitely my favorite Kon work (so far)! I just love the premise behind Chiyoko Fujiwara chasing down the painter through all her different movies as the interviewer and camera man follow her. I really connected to it emotionally and found it be just amazing! **9/10** for me. 

Edit: SHIROBAKO is next!
>> ARTICLE
> I really connected to it emotionally and found it be just amazing! 9/10 for me.

I think this is why I couldnt give it higher than 7 for me. The directing is amazing, the switches from timepreiods and perspective was really similar to his other works that I liked the most(Perfect Blue and Paprika) but I just couldnt connect to the story as much as the others.

Always nice knowing that the ones I picked gets good scores.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its interesting watching it back-to-back with Perfect Blue which I think is better but somehow I enjoyed watching Millennium Actress more. I'll be interested to see how Tokyo Godfathers is compared to these two. Kon is just too good so I can't see myself not enjoying it. 

They've all been great and enjoyable so far! 

[](#hyoukawink)
>> ARTICLE
I went into Tokyo Godfathers knowing nothing. [I thought it was like a gangster movie because of the name](/s "its not"), and was genuinly suprised what the movie managed to accomplish. It was emotional while still being primarily a comedy. You're in for an odd chase.

Shirobako next or something was it else iirc?

Ahhh that's awesome! I'm excited to check it out but I want to save it closer to Christmas time!

Yep, started Shirobako so that'll be interesting to see.

Yay:D. I'm so glad. The ending was really great, imo. 

I just finished Bakemonogatari the other night and start Nisemonogatari.

/u/FlyGuy302, sorry! I haven't had enough time yet to watch RahXephon, but I'll try to start it Monday and watch on average about 2 episodes a day. I hope you're enjoying Cross Ange though!

> I hope you're enjoying Cross Ange though!

I just finished it and I was very disappointed... **THAT I HADN'T WATCHED IT EARLIER.**

 [](#excitedyui)

Seriously, thank you for giving me a contract for that series. It's the most fun I've had watching anime in a while :D

I really hope you enjoy RahXephon
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen Baby Steps here. Not surprised to see it here really, absolutely fantastic show that I've seen no one talk about. I only found out about ita month or two ago, and finally watched it this past week. Definitely worth checking out! 

ps. Baby Steps OP is one of the greatest OP's in existence.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu got me into the sports anime fully. Tried Baby Steps for a couple episodes, then went full on binge through. I hope for another season.
>> ARTICLE
The thing I generally dislike about sports anime is that it's a complete sausage fest with the technical aspects of the sport and ocassionally the interpersonal relationships of the teammates being the only themes that are handled, usually over a very stretched out low paced episode list.

Baby Steps has that typical sports aspect, sure, but it also has a romantical aspect (even though it's not as fleshed out as I wanted it to be). Cross Game is the only other sports anime I know to handle those themes.
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps is fantastic. The character growth/development reminds me a bit of the baseball anime Major. 
>> ARTICLE
Check out Cross Game is you want a good baseball show. I'm only on episode 30ish and loving it so far. 
>> ARTICLE
> a good **baseball** show

haha
>> ARTICLE
Its less about baseball and more about relationships. Major is also very good in both the sports and drama department.
>> ARTICLE
cross game is really fucking good. more SoL than sports, but the games are fun to watch and baseball fans will be satisfied. 

due to one major plot device, its kinda similar to AnoHana , but no melodrama. the characters' emotions and traits are realistic to that off a teenager. 

also first episode is one hell of a hook so prepare for binge watch if you plan on watching.
>> ARTICLE
How is it compared to ace of diamond?
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree! It's one of my favorite character driven shows.

Also there might be a rewatch this summer if enough people are interested in picking up the show or just rewatching it for fun.

It's a great Summertime anime and I hope y'all can join us.
>> ARTICLE
Aside from one of the plot devices, the anime doesn't remotely resemble AnoHana. Anyone looking for a similar experience will be disappointed. Not that anyone could be disappointed after watching Cross Game, of course.
>> ARTICLE
yeah i was really cautious about not wanting to spoil said plot device... edited my post so i dont mislead anyone.
>> ARTICLE
Well the issue is finding a good comparison for Cross Game. Because there really is no good comparison. It's such a unique story.

If I had to choose one it would obviously be Touch but that's practically cheating because the same dude wrote it.
>> ARTICLE
It's unique.....until you start reading literally anything Adachi made. This guy takes 'write what you know' to a crazy extreme.
>> ARTICLE
You *know* The Boy and the Beast only makes this list because there's practically no way to watch it outside of Japan yet. Once there is, it'll shoot up the MAL charts.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I should check it out. Apparently it just released here in France, it seems one of the theaters in my city's running it.
>> ARTICLE
Awww man after going through the list that was my number one choice of show to watch next. And now I can't :( 
>> ARTICLE
Has this only been released in theaters so far?
>> ARTICLE
I believe so.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm aware, and it's also the same for The Anthem of the Heart. Popularity takes into account those who have it in their PTW as well though. It might not end up as popular as you make out to be. This list also features 3 Ghibli movies (From Up on Poppy Hill, Princess Kaguya and Marnie) for instance, so you never know.

I'm looking forward to it for sure though.
>> ARTICLE
Judging by The Girl Who Leapt Through Time at popularity spot #108, Summer Wars at #161, and Wolf Children at #210, I can't help but be sure that The Boy and the Beast is going to end up being pretty popular. The more famous Ghibli works are *classics*, but Mamoru Hosoda is pretty modern in comparison.

PS I'm also super excited for The Anthem of the Heart, too!
>> ARTICLE
Anthem of the Heart is really good imo. Saw it a week ago here in Hamburg. I liked it even more than Anohana.
>> ARTICLE
:o
>> ARTICLE
The Beast Player Erin looks like it is going to be a kid's show but don't let the art style fool you. It can be a little slow at times but there are not many characters as well developed as Erin.
>> ARTICLE
I'll ask the same question as recent threads:

How many of these have watched?

And another probably funnier in this occasion:

How many of these have you never heard about?

I'm at a surprising 31 watched and 25 I'd never heard about.
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen 6 of those, and am currently watching Gundam IBO.

I haven't seen a ton of anime, but I've seen a decent amount. I haven't ever heard of a lot of those, so like others have said, when I'm not sure what to watch next, it's good to know there's plenty to check out.
>> ARTICLE
I've only watched 10 of them.

Glad to know that even if I run out of the usual recs to watch, there's an entire new world of good anime to enjoy waiting for me, personally.

Also, is the Dog of Flanders, not God of Flanders.

As to how many I've heard of: I've heard of Chi's Sweet Home exactly once on a MAL recommendation for fans of NGE, citing that both shows' main character is a pussy.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I fixed that.

I've unsurprisingly never seen Chi's Sweet Home mentioned here myself, but I've come across it randomly I think by episode count. At least they're only 3 minutes long.
>> ARTICLE
39/100  Not even half. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Only 5. Looking forward to watching some of these.
>> ARTICLE
16, all of which I'm sad they aren't watched more


>> ARTICLE
Watched 16, all of the mecha shows on the list plus some others.
>> ARTICLE
> How many of these have watched?

I've watched Kuuchuu Buranko

> How many of these have you never heard about?

About slightly more than half
>> ARTICLE
I've watched 4 (Cross game, gunbuster, giant robo, keroro gunsou) and am currently watching 3 (Shouwa genroku rakugo shoujo, Gundam IBO, Gundam 0079)

If you don't count airing shows then I've only watched 5 :(

I've heard of a lot of these and I'll probably watch Kuchuu Buranko and Armoured Trooper Votoms sometime soon.
>> ARTICLE
Sure they count, though they might not be featured on this list by the end of the season.

I don't follow airing shows myself, but I'm absolutely looking forward to watching Shouwa at the end of the season.
>> ARTICLE
The other baseball anime on this list: Big Windup! and Major are also excellent. And the tennis anime Baby Steps. 
>> ARTICLE
Most I haven't heard of, but some I have. 

I have seen: Cross Game, Major, Big Windup!, Baby Steps (not sure how these aren't in the top 1000... doesn't make any sense. They're great. Major should be in the top 20 anime.) 

Also have seen Magic Kaito, Fist of the North Star.. and my gf likes Chi's Sweet Home. Anything cat related and she'll watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
23, though as often with lists of this sort it's reminded me of a bunch of other things I ought to get round to trying.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen 14 of them, mostly just the sports series.

And then there's only 10 I haven't heard of.
>> ARTICLE
0/100 :/
>> ARTICLE
[it's never too late](#nuidideverythingright)
>> ARTICLE
Watched 1: interstellar 5555 just because I love daft punk and heard of 3
>> ARTICLE
That's one entry I was surprised to find on MAL when I stumbled upon it a while ago. I've seen it but never added it for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
yeah i just looked at my list and done have it either for whatever reason, i guess maybe i thought of it just as a music video but not anime.

gonna add it now though.
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen House of Five Leaves. It's definitely in my top 5 all-time favorites
>> ARTICLE
House of Five Leaves is an amazing character study. Its direction, atmosphere, and pacing are so representative of Tomomi Mochizuki's style. It's probably in my top five favorites as well.
>> ARTICLE
> Ashita no Joe

Has ANYBODY else seen this anime? Specifically the sequel, given it finished the story. I can't find anybody to discuss it with given it's decades old. The last half of the second series was fucking heartbreaking in a way I've never seen any other anime do. 
>> ARTICLE
Is it good? I tried watching it and had to drop it after 10 or so episodes because it seemed way too childish of an anime to me. I love sports anime and boxing anime like Hajime no Ippo so I thought I'd love it but it didn't really do anything with the boxing in the episodes I watched.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very slow burner. The first half is very dated. After a certain fight you can move onto Ashita no Joe 2, the last half of 1 is filler. The ending is incredibly iconic for most anime and manga today. 
>> ARTICLE
1,757 people have finished the second season according to MAL. You're gonna have a rough time finding someone else that's seen it.
>> ARTICLE
>it's decades old.

Can't spend to much time in the past always gotta be facing tomorrow, the gloves are in our hands now.
>> ARTICLE
[This](https://theindiantenor.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/wpid-img-20150411-wa00431.jpg) is iconic.

[It](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gurennlagann/images/7/76/Kamina_as_he_dies.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140922030155) gets referenced [everywhere](http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbiudkaFZD1qgio6io1_1280.jpg).

Yet there are so few who know the reference. This show did a lot for the future of anime. After the success the industry started to make more sports anime and continued to grow the industry. Also a lot of great characters were spawned. Guys like Kamina are litterally Ashita no Joe. I'm sad yesterday's Joe is being forgotten but that ending really motivates me to look forward to the future.
>> ARTICLE
you'll probably find people on /a/
>> ARTICLE
I'd suggest anyone who hasn't seen Yamato 2199 to watch it. It's a really good remake of an iconic classic anime and it's one of the best space anime out there. It's also action driven and a lot shorter if you can't sit through LotGH (which is dialogue driven).

Also anyone who's interested in [Kingdom](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12031/Kingdom?q=kingdo) should go read the manga. There is 460 chapters and is one of the best manga out there.
>> ARTICLE
Yamato 2199 is not for everyone.

Space Operas in general are not for everyone. People who love them absolutely love them. However there a lot of people who get bored of them. Same thing with Star Trek. Most people agree that it's a great well executed series however there aren't a lot of diehard fans because people easily get bored of it.

This is why a lot of the Space Opera anime have high scores relative to popularity. Same with LotGH. It's the only anime inside of the top 50 in popularity that is outside of top 500 in popularity. (Sequels don't count.)

And yeah Kingdom anime isn't bad but I also think the manga is just great.
>> ARTICLE
I couldnt stand the art of Kingdom D: , the story might be amazing but if i can barely read through the first 10 chapters...
>> ARTICLE
I felt that way about the anime.  Watched the first episode and dropped it.  Reminded me a lot of Knights of Sidonia - really generic, boring 3D that tries to be too realistic instead of being stylistic.
>> ARTICLE
I think Yamato 2199 is just a terrible shonen that happens to be in space, but to each his own.

The Kingdom manga is truly amazing, though. As much as I like the anime, the technology to adapt an epic of Kingdom's scale simply isn't there yet.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you on Yamato 2199. I forced myself through around 20 episodes after reading about how amazing it was on reddit, but I didn't get attached at all. Couldn't find myself interested in any of the main characters, the antagonists except for that good-looking alien (introduced around half way through) were all one-dimensional "bad guys," and the plot was only pushed forward by melodrama. What I mean is it's just a series of crises that the cast has to respond to for survival. Any mistakes along the way result in their extinction, so obviously they succeed every time. Extinction plot devices work for shows like Battlestar Galactica or Star Trek, but it didn't grip me in this anime because actor/character reactions to stimuli weren't as good. In Yamato 2199, I just felt like "okay they solved this crisis, I hope the next one is more gripping" but I was let down every time. 

Legend of Galactic Heroes is one anime that does it right. Every roadblock a main character encounters gives the viewer a few minutes of how it's affecting them internally, and we hear parts of this internal monologue as the character tries to solve the problem. There are two sides (both of which, or alternatively none of which can be considered "good guys") that have a multitude of characters. For any given conflict you do not know whether or not the character will succeed, because it's not necessary for them to live for the plot to push forward. 

If you put all the main characters in one ship, like in Yamato 2199, the biggest conflicts to explore that don't involve extinction are power struggles. There was one short arc with a power struggle in Yamato 2199, but the instigators of it were so laughably "evil" and incompetent that you know the main character's side wins. If someone has watched Battlestar Galactica, they'll know what I mean by a well done power struggle, and I don't want to spoil anything.

I suppose Yamato 2199 is good for someone who wants a very light space opera in an anime medium. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Yamato is more immature than Star Wars or new Star Trek movies and it doesn't look much worse than them either.
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious as to why this show gets such polarized responses. I watched it and thought it was good but nothing extraordinary, but most people either gush over it or call it overrated and mediocre.
>> ARTICLE
The anime somewhat toned down the manga quite a bit. It took a seinen with shonen elements and made it a full-on shonen.
>> ARTICLE
probably because the manga is so amazing
>> ARTICLE
	

For me, it was very pretty and fun but story-wise left a little to be desired
>> ARTICLE
Surprised no one's mentioned Major. Probably my favorite sports anime. Re-watched all six seasons twice. Would definitely recommend it!
>> ARTICLE
I always try to bring it up on here, but no one seems to have seen it. Its lack of popularity is a bit unfortunate, to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
Polar Bear Cafe is one of my favorite animes of all time.  People laugh at how ridiculous the premise is and don't really take it seriously, as a show.  However, once you accept the overall theme, it's a humorous slice of life that has a lot of heart.
>> ARTICLE
I love it, it's a great relaxing show!
>> ARTICLE
i only saw yamato but its the top of the list so its cool =)
>> ARTICLE
Still a shame "Birdy the Mighty" never makes these lists. It has to be one of the best shows I've seen get ranked so low. 

Second season would've made this list (besides the rule disregarding second seasons) but it's still a heavy recommend from me. 

Shit even the Man of Steel movie borrowed fight scenes from the show almost exactly... It's a good ass show. 
>> ARTICLE
Which Birdy the Mighty? The original or the new one Decode? I assume you mean the latter as the original is generally forgotten (unfortunately).
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, definitely Decode, the actual 26 episode series. 
>> ARTICLE
Tekkon Kinkreet is really good, the manga author also did Ping Pong 
>> ARTICLE
Blue Spring is another movie based on his work, but live-action.
>> ARTICLE
The only one I believe I've seen on the list is Kaiba.  
For those of you who haven't seen it, you really should. You're doing yourself quite a disservice if you don't give it a shot because of how it looks.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, and Kaiba is only here because it was pushed back by new shows this season, sitting proudly at rank 1005. I really like the exploration, kind of slice of life element of the first half of the show.
>> ARTICLE
What is popularity and hows it calced?
>> ARTICLE
It's based on MyAnimeList's popularity statistic. Whenever someone has an anime on their list, whether it be Completed, Dropped or Plan To Watch, they count as a member for the purpose of popularity. To make this list, I went through the top rated anime ignoring the 1000 most popular anime. I should've made this more clear.
>> ARTICLE
Im really surprised though. What about shows like Death note, fma brotherhood, hxh, etc? Those dont have a popularity over 1000?
>> ARTICLE
No, it's the opposite. This list is stripped of the 1000 most popular anime for the purpose of more easily finding good, underwatched anime should you want to.

[Example](http://i.imgur.com/h7JVWBN.png), from [Cross Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5941/Cross_Game), where the popularity is above 1000.
>> ARTICLE
Okay I see now. I think saying popularity above 1000 can be misleading then because people interpret that as the 1000 most popular anime. Or people like me anyway.

But thanks for the clarification! 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree. Despite being a MAL regular, the "popularity over 1000" part got me confused at first, until I saw old anime I had checked before and remembering those were NOT popular in the sense nobody had seen/planned to watch them and thus didn't have them on any part of their MAL list.

Maybe [EnduranceProtocol](https://www.reddit.com/user/EnduranceProtocol) could edit the OP and change it to read as "I am limiting this list to anime that are NOT in the top 1000 most popular ranks" or something. Since we're used to having a high number as a positive, seeing "+1000 popularity" made it sound like it's super popular, when in this case the lower means it's higher ranked in the top... Idk lol.
>> ARTICLE
Only watched 2/100, Kingdom and Nobunaga Concerto which 2 of my favorite series 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks OP, I can add a few more anime to my ptw now
>> ARTICLE
Erin is such a good show (the 4th in this list), it's in my top three ever since I watched it the first time, and no show has been able to top it so far. It's just such a fulfilling story.
>> ARTICLE
Surprisingly, "There She Is" can be viewed on Newgrounds.com, a website hosting many flash videos that went viral before YouTube existed. I stumbled upon the first episode while browsing the website within the past year. The art is very simplistic, and there's no dialogue, but it has a very nice and unique story.
>> ARTICLE
That's becauce that's where it was originally submitted. :P

I remember waiting between each episode at the time haha.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised Maison Ikkoku & Rose of Versailles aren't more known. I thought they were as those were broadcasted on French TV for years during the late 80's - 90's and are really nice anime.

By the way, Interstella5555 isn't a real anime, it's a compilation of all the video clips Albator's author made for Daft Punk (a french electro band).

I'm also surprised that Macross (Robotech in the USA) isn't more well known (o_o)'

City Hunter is another CLASSIC that isn't much voted for simply because it's kinda old. I guess I AM really old though (29). Most 2000's kids don't check those oldies anymore I guess... Same goes for Fist of the North Star (Hokkuto no Ken).

Welp, 90% of the list dates back to 2000 or before so yeah. I'm just an old fart I guess lmao.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know of Interstella5555. [There She Is!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6505/There_She_Is), a Korean fanimation that was submitted to Newgrounds.com back in 2003, and [Furiko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13629/Furiko), a pretty random short animated after a Muse song, are other outliers on the list.

There might be more I'm unaware of, but either way they're still entries on MAL, so I still included them.

As for Maison Ikkoku and Rose of Versailles, they're already quite old for anime. :P I've personally seen and liked neither haha.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, since you're there, you made a small typo about Galaxy Express 999 (you typed Glaxy Express 999).

But yeah, I don't blame you mate! That list is AWESOME. I know MAL includes almost anything anime related ahah. I remember when I stumbled upon that one back in the day, I had forgotten about it in fact. Just wanted to 'warn' other people to net get fooled by it (^ o ^ )

I didn't like Rose of Versailles since it's not my demo target :p But Maison Ikkoku was pretty cool. But it wasn't my fav either and it's kinda outdated compared to today's productions, that's for sure =/
>> ARTICLE
I'm fairly certain it all has to do with the age of the anime. Despite the fact that Macross, Maison Ikkoku, and Rose of Versailles are seminal anime, the age of them generally turns people off even if they've heard of them. It doesn't help that Macross is basically out of print (excluding the Robotech edit) along with Maison Ikkoku. You can get the first set of episodes of Macross in a Robotech DVD set from Amazon, but not the rest of the season. Rose of Versailles is streaming, but I think that's the only one that is out of those three. Fist of the North Star is on Crunchyroll, but City Hunter isn't.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm a total moron for not foreseeing this issue... It is a shame. But yeah it does absolutely make sense. I'm pretty sure most of those were VHS only things (some did get DVD releases though) which makes it even HARDER to just find them in streaming or anywhere really ... Oh well, I'm glad I got to enjoy them while they got a TV broadcast here at least lol. Thanks for the enlightenment mate!
>> ARTICLE
I'm hoping that Maison Ikkoku gets a nice re-release like Ranma 1/2. I think Viz still has the rights to it (they released it on DVD), but it's been out of print for a while. Similarly, Kimagure Orange Road is out of print (I think the manga is as well). At least the Maison Ikkoku manga is still in print.
>> ARTICLE
Maison Ikkoku and City Hunter are some of my favourite anime of all time. Maison Ikkoku has possibly the best ending of any romance anime I've ever seen and City Hunter is just fucking beautifully done from start to finish and Saeba despite being a massive pervert is an absolute legend. 
>> ARTICLE
Ahah glad to see another fan. I never got to see Maison Ikkoku's ending but I'm glad it was a good one. Most of the romance (main genre or sub genre) anime I've seen in the past years are some form of NTR or cukholding MC who never gets the chick (or vice versa) or only have lame open endings with no hints and no conclusions =/

City Hunter was really awesome. I grew up with it, DBZ & Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle (not an anime but it was a french/usa production). Did you read the pseudo "sequel" from same author, "Angel Hearts" I believe it was called? Never got to try it out though but AFAIK it had some similar vibes, heck IIRC the girl was supposed to be an hospital patient who got a heart operation from Ryo Saeba's girlfriend or something along the lines.
>> ARTICLE
I watched a bit of Angel Hearts but I didn't really like it. Everytime some plot progression was achieved, the next episode it would just forget it ever happened and sort of "reset". I don't think I've ever seen a romance anime with NTR so I'm lucky in that regard. 
>> ARTICLE
Interstellar 5555 was really fun to watching, since I like both anime and Daft Punk. Glad to see it high on this list. Hopefully a few more people will watch it now.
>> ARTICLE
I did watch it (I had long forgotten about it since it was released in early 2000's long before I get to register on MAL) if only because I was a HUGE Daft Punk fan and it does blend SO well with the music...

It reminds me of the old Disney Fantasia movie with classic music. I wanna re-watch Interstella5555 now lol ahah
>> ARTICLE
Crest of the Stars and Banner of the Stars unexpectedly good imo.
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't [Shin Mazinger Z](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5485/Shin_Mazinger_Shougeki_Z-Hen) be on there? It's not a sequel or anything and it's got a score of 8.00 but a popularity of under 3000.
>> ARTICLE
Seems to be the case. I'd like to say I might have had it confused as a sequel given its title, but I probably overlooked it. :P

Thanks, I won't knock down the current 100th, but I'll add this one in for sure. :)
>> ARTICLE
[Oofuri](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2159/Ookiku_Furikabutte) is a really sweet baseball anime, though you might end up getting annoyed at the MC who has confidence issues up the wazoo. Really catchy second ED. I gave it a 7/10

[Hybrid Child](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11135/Hybrid_Child), while probably not to the taste of most on here, is a pretty decent shounen ai with some heartfelt moments. While just 4 episodes, it does paint a detailed story.  
It's by Studio Deen, so if you've watched any of their other series in this genre, you'll recognise the character designs instantly, with large stocky man being the seme and smaller pointed chin being the uke. Still, in a genre with so few anime it's worth a watch. 7/10

[Wandering Son](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko) is a very mature look at transgender issues, specifically at the age where kids are not particularly empathetic. While I do give credit to faithfully keeping the series serious and sending a good message, it's a pretty slow paced anime and in the first few episodes it was very difficult to know characters by name. 6/10

I think those are the only 3 I've watched, though to be fair to me I've only watched 40 or so anime in my life, not including sequels.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Tylor is so under rated and watched.
>> ARTICLE
It's on the old side for sure, but that doesn't make it any less great.
>> ARTICLE
Which reminds me that I wanted to up my rating for Princess Kaguya to a 10 and I wanted to watch Romeo and the Black Brothers since a while. And a lot of other stuff on that list.
>> ARTICLE
I've completed or I've come close to completing about 25 or the movies/shorts/series on the list. A few others I started, but dropped at some point. I recognized almost all of them. I feel a strange pride in that, because a year or three ago, that number would be much, much lower.

I'm actually fairly surprised at the quality difference between some of the shows. I've found some to be fantastic and others to be barely above average or even decent. I've never thought the majority of the WMT anime to be particularly good (I feel like their scores are the consequence of nostalgia) and I could barely sit through a few episodes of Hanada Shounen-shi. There's quite a few shows in the list I feel the same about. Others like Conan and Rose or Versailles are totally deserving of their ratings imo, if not deserving of higher.



OP, is there any way could you seperate this into series or series/movies only? All the shorts are kind of misleading.
>> ARTICLE
I've just calculated my average score for the shows on this list. It stands at 6.88 across 25 shows (there are a few I have not rated and one I have dropped) compared to my overall average of 6.37, which is significantly higher. I must say that most of the shows I've watched are pretty recent however, and so might not be as tainted by nostalgia.
>> ARTICLE
Not too surprised with Beast Player Erin.... because I keep raving about it but....

There is a few that I wasn't expecting to be on the list:

**Major** might be a bit more popular in Japan, but didn't expect it up there.

**From Up on Poppy Hill** is a Ghibli Film, I liked it personally, but there are many people that liked other Ghibli films a lot more.

**Saint Seiya: Lost Canvas**.... the whole Saint Seiya series itself is rather unknown to most audiences outside of Japan... if anything, outside of Japan, Brazil is probably the other place where it is popular.

**Big Windup! (AKA Oofuri)** is basically a fangirls dream when it... sorta comes to BL? I watched it though. But really, wouldn't expect it too be up there.

**Gundam**.... well I am quite sure there are the other series in Gundam that is more popular than Fighters... really.

There are some that I heard or glance over.... but have never watched them.
>> ARTICLE
What I think is the [original entry](http://myanimelist.net/anime/80/Mobile_Suit_Gundam) into the Gundam universe is actually also on this list, ranking just out of top 1000 in popularity. I also included Figthers because, after a bit of reading around, it seemed to stand on its own as well.

For Lost Canvas I wasn't sure if it was directly related to the older, original series, which is more popular, but I still included it. I've only watched the first season of Lost Canvas (and not liked it).

I've seen both Major and Oofuri as well, the former being in my top 10 anime, and I must say I'm not really surprised to see a lot of good sports anime on this list. Erin is another of my favourite anime too :)

And surprisingly, I haven't seen From Up on Poppy Hill yet.
>> ARTICLE
Lost Canvas was set 200+ years in the past before the start of the original series. I don't remember if it was canon or not, but it deals with the Hades War during that time period. 

If it isn't canon, it is because it references two of the gold saints (in the current war) who were also alive 200 years ago (this part is canon, as for the specifics I don't like spoiling why they lived 200+ years.)

From Up On Poppy Hill is one of Goro's better Ghibli films, but whether you will like it, I'm not so sure. The guy needs to live in his father's footsteps, that is for sure :p
>> ARTICLE
> Saint Seiya: Lost Canvas.... the whole Saint Seiya series itself is rather unknown to most audiences outside of Japan... if anything, outside of Japan, Brazil is probably the other place where it is popular.

Wow, really? That's shame. Saint Seiya was so huge here in France they even released one (maybe more I don't know of) game on NES directly from Japan (and it was even translated in French, which was a super rare feat back in the day, 95% of the games were English only).

The fact that they made a dub and broadcast it for maybe 10 years certainly helped though lol. Didn't they broadcast this series in USA/Canada/UK/AUS etc? I don't know about the rest of Europe either, since in France we got quite a lot of anime in the 80's thanks to producers participating or simply cause we imported them directly from JP to broadcast on TV in the morning (which caused a ruckus with DBZ & Hokuto no Ken's violence lol).
>> ARTICLE
It did start airing Saint Seiya here in the states as "Knights of the Zodiac" for a brief time in 2003 on Cartoon Network, but for all it was worth, it was basically diluted by other anime shows airing at that time...shows like Inuyasha, DBZ and Yu Yu Hakasho (which most of these aired long before they were dubbed into the US.)

I watched the Asian dubbed of most of these as a kid before they started dubbing it, and besides a few things like Pokemon and the guy I know who was totally into Dragonball, most wouldn't know why I was wearing a forehead protector like Hinata in the first place..... although anime is a lot more prevalent now.
>> ARTICLE
I see thanks. They broadcast it along City Hunter, DBZ, Ranma 1/2 etc mid/early 90s here in France, back when Anime was all the rage... On a side note, Saint Seiya was called "Chevaliers du Zodiaque" which also means "Knights of the Zodiac"... Interesting coincidence.

Ofc by 2003+ anime wasn't so fresh and the market got pretty flooded, between Pokmon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Digimon and whatnot. Oh, yeah, Yu-Yu Hakusho was pretty awesome too. I loved that one. Too bad the ending sucked, hopefully Togashi won't do that for Hiatus X Hiatus... =/


>> ARTICLE
I know like 3 names and havent seen a single one. Am I retarded bc of that or because 'm obviously misinterpretating the title?


Edit: I see now. And I feel even more retarded.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry man, this is basically a top 100 anime for hipsters. :P
>> ARTICLE
This is an even better explanation! Marked your words.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't expect Interstellar (although I've always seen the title as Interstella) 5555 in the list! But still, it feels quite good that a great part of the list consists on oldies / classics.
>> ARTICLE
My mistake, I might have auto-corrected it to Interstellar. I fixed it now. :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh thanks :) I was starting to get confused!
>> ARTICLE
Giant Robo has some incredible animation and good action. The first episode was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
There is an absolute ton of really good shows on this list and it's sort of mind blowing some of them aren't more popular. I mean you have Ghibli movies, a Gainax classic, some of the best sports anime ever made, some classic foundation mecha series, what I would consider to be Takahashi's best work, and to top it off a 26 episode series directed by Miyazaki and Takahata. 

Edit: oh yeah, one of the films listed is nominated for an Oscar as well.
>> ARTICLE
There She Is is a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Watched about 6 but onholded or dropped about 4 ish. Decent list. 
>> ARTICLE
If any of you liked The Tatami Galaxy or Ping Pong The Animation, you guys will love **Mind Game**. Same director, and completely mindblowing. A must-watch imo.
>> ARTICLE
Interstella5555 hype! It was honestly such a fun movie with some surprising feels and of course great music (no dialogue only Daft Punk's 'Discovery' album). It's a fun watch and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a nice movie that's only about an hour long. 
>> ARTICLE
I have so much watch....huheueu
>> ARTICLE
I have said it once and i will say it again, Space Battleship Yamato deserve way more viewers than it currently has. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm amazed Daisy: a Wild into the Hen is listed on MAL. I thought they hated anything strictly non-Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
Well they do make a distinction between manga and manhwa/manhua, so I don't see why not. I've watched 1 other Korean anime and 2 Chinese anime that I remember are listed on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I'm surprised because I read somewhere that a French anime (coproduced by Japanese staff) was unlisted from MAL because it didn't fit their requirements.
>> ARTICLE
Historically, France has coproduced quite a few anime with Japan, like [The Mysterious Cities of Gold](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1279/Taiyou_no_Ko_Esteban) and [Nobody's Boy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2828/Ie_Naki_Ko) that I've watched in French during my childhood (I'm French Canadian), the latter being featured on this list, so that's surprising to hear as well.

edit: these are the Korean and Chinese series in question I've seen: [Winter Sonata](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4189/Winter_Sonata), [Qin's Moon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9806/Qin_Shiming_Yue_Zhi__Bai_Bu_Fei_Jian) and [The Legend of Condor Hero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/959/Shin_Chou_Kyou_Ryo__Condor_Hero)  
edit: how could I forget There She Is!!, which actually appears on this list. It's Korean fanmade animation despite not having any dialogue.
>> ARTICLE
I will watch anything in full, and of the same duration/length, besides harem and ecchi shows, if you watch in full any of these:

[Anime de Wakaru Shinryounaika](http://myanimelist.net/anime/27911/Anime_de_Wakaru_Shinryounaika)

[Binbougami ga!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13535/Binbougami_ga!)

[Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass)

* [Here is my anime list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/ShadowSouls)
>> ARTICLE
How do someone like me can even challenge you guys? I've walked around and seen some MAL's, holy fuck, is there anything good you have not seen yet?
>> ARTICLE
I would offer, since my MAL is nearly empty, but I've got too much stuff going on to take up any more. You might just look through and see which ones you're willing to take up, lots of these people have no objections to doing multiples lol.
>> ARTICLE
>Shared Anime 0.0%

That's a good one. I'll pick one randomly.


Also, you do already have JoJo, BakeMonoGatari, Kill la Kill, "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru", Ookami to Koushinryou on your plan to watch list, so i really can't bother you with anything else.
>> ARTICLE
Haha yeah, hopefully I'll be able to knock some of that off after my finals next week :P
>> ARTICLE
On the bright side, I'd have to say that you are off to a pretty good start there. 
>> ARTICLE
Movie Contract!

Hey guys, I'll watch any movie of your choice if you watch one of:

[Redline](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6675/Redline)  
[Sakasama no Patema](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12477/Sakasama_no_Patema)  
[Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12355/Ookami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki)  
>> ARTICLE
Sennen Joyuu for Patema
>> ARTICLE
Sounds interesting, you have yourself a deal.  Hope you enjoy Patema.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks will do! I'll probably watch it around monday :)
>> ARTICLE
Well this seems like a good time to update as to where I am in the contract with /u/AnthonyDraft.

I finished the first season on Symphogear, and last episode subtitle issues aside it was a fun little romp though a cliche filled show. Not that there is anything wrong with that. I thought for sure Miku was going to get a Symphogear at the end, but being reunited with Hibiki also works out. I also don't buy the commander's story about how he is able to hurt the symphohears with his bare hands, so I hope season 2 or 3 talks about it. I would give this a solid 7 out of 10. Now I've got Season 2 to go through.

Now for another contract, I am looking to finally get into sports shows. I want to form a contract with someone, you pick out a sports show for me, and I'll pick something out either from your mal, or from a list of shows your thinking about watching. Anyone interested?
>> ARTICLE
There is an update comment you should reply to discuss your previous contracts. Wanna watch "Haikyuu!!"? It's a great sport show. I have some contracts pilling up so whatevs you take for me I will probably not make it in one week.
>> ARTICLE
Ah I'm sorry I didn't see the update comment. I remember that for next week. Thank you.

As for the contract, sure, sounds good. And I'll pick Cowboy Bebop from your plan to watch. As I think everyone who watches anime should at least give it a shot. And don't worry about not finishing it in a week, as still have my contract with AnthonyDraft to finish up.
>> ARTICLE
I missed this comment, lol.

For the contract, can't you pick another one? I don't like to watch episodic anime as contracts because I found myself binging it and being episodic, this usually drops my enjoyment of it by half. I was hoping to watch Cowboy Bibop together with Winter 2016 seasonal anime.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, alright. Although I like to keep episode counts the same. So I''l pick two single cour shows, that way we have an even episode count. I'll pick Hataraku Maou-sama! and Kekkai Sensen.

That'll give us two weeks to watch 25 episodes each, fulfill my requirement for a sports anime, and your's for no episodic shows. Sound good? 
>> ARTICLE
Yep! Was planning to watch both sometime anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Glad you liked the first season. It's not the best of 3 seasons, nor the best show out there, I also gave it 7/10, but I'd be lying if I didn't enjoy every single moment of it. It only gets better now.

Well, about Samurai 7. I've been very busy....sort of. Not a lot of time available to me, and my spare time for watching anime is not that big either so I only managed to watch 3 episodes really... I suppose you already read what I had to say about first 2 and that my opinion hasn't changed yet.
>> ARTICLE
ill watch anything ~50epi if u watch clannad and after story..
>> ARTICLE
I'll offer Death Parade for anything of a similar length.  My last contact gave me AnoHana, so you can either pile on the feels or give a reprieven.

[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/sxypancake)
>> ARTICLE
OP its Tegami Bachi not Tegami beach;)
>> ARTICLE
Whoops, I'll change that. Next time use the "Feedback" link though, I usually don't see notifications from this thread.

Oh I am sorry I didnt know that but that is a fantastic thread to be weekly 
>> ARTICLE
No worries :)

Glad you like the thread!
>> ARTICLE
[Here's my list](http://myanimelist.net/profile/DeadBonesBrook).  Like one other person in this thread, I'm looking to watch something that someone feels is the absolute best anime series they've seen.  I'll watch that series (if the "price" is right) in full, but in return that person will have to watch the following in order:

* [My Conquest is the Sea of Stars](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3014/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu:_Waga_Yuku_wa_Hoshi_no_Taikai)
* [Legend of the Galactic Heroes (eps. 1-54)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu)
* [Golden Wings](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3015/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu_Gaiden:_Ougon_no_Tsubasa)
* [Overture to a New War](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3016/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu:_Arata_Naru_Tatakai_no_Overture)
* Legend of the Galactic heroes (eps. 55-110)
* [A Hundred Billion Stars, A Hundred Billion Lights](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3371/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu_Gaiden:_Senoku_no_Hoshi_Senoku_no_Hikari)
* [Spiral Labyrinth](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3665/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu_Gaiden:_Rasen_Meikyuu)

Spiral Labyrinth can be watched after My Conquest is the Sea of Stars, but Spiral Labyrinth must be watched last.

Like any contract, negotiations are a thing.  I would within reason be down to watch a couple of series or more given the massive undertaking this list would require.
>> ARTICLE
I'll take anything 15 episodes or less if you watch [Susei no Gargantia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16524/Suisei_no_Gargantia) plus the OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
I'm up for anything preferably one-cour or two-cour of length. I want you to watch K-On! season 1 with OVAs is 14 episodes. If you've watched that, then watch K-On!! season 2 with OVAs is 27 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Hey bud, I'm actually watching K-On season 2 right now and would love to discuss it. How about we do this, I'll finish the last 8 episodes and watch the movie. And you watch one of these one cour shows:

[Amagi Brilliant Park] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/22147/Amagi_Brilliant_Park): Our MC has to help a struggling theme park meet their 500,000 guest quota before they get shut down. It's Kyoto Animation doing what they do best, both cute and hilarious.

[Kaiba](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3701/Kaiba): Hands down the coolest anime universe I've ever seen, unique artstyle and great sci-fi. It's a series that kept me thinking about it weeks after finishing the show.

[Barakamon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon): A touching Slice of Life about a Calligrapher who gets sent to live on a rural island so he can develop his own calligraphy style. This series was adorable and touching, great feel good series.

Let me know if you are interested in doing the deal. I'd prefer sending PM's back and forth, but if you want to take it over to the update thread just let me know. Either way I'll write something up later to let you know how much I'm liking K-On so far.
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch anything with less than or equal to 24 episodes if you watch the[ Kara no Kyoukai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2593/Kara_no_Kyoukai_1:_Fukan_Fuukei) movies. There's 7 in total.
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch all seven if you watch [Assassination Classroom](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24833/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu_%28TV%29?q=assassinat) It starts off slow but the second arc is fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, you got a deal. Guess I should warn you then that the movies are done out of chronological order for thematic reasons and will be very confusing for a good portion of it. 
>> ARTICLE
Gakkou Gurashi, you plebs.
>> ARTICLE
[**You are the pleb.**Bitch, please.](#barakamonnotcool)
>> ARTICLE
Here's my [List.](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/JamTheMaster)

I just want to watch a show that is somebody's absolute, without a doubt, favorite. Like you live and breathe this show, and are physically upset I haven't seen it yet. (Evangelion would be my first guess)

Could do double blind, would prefer to atleast have some criteria for picking a show though!


Edit: If you enter a contract with me, lemme know if you want me to message you on episode updates. Otherwise I'll just post in the the free talks threads!

>> ARTICLE
Wait, you haven't seen Space Dandy! If you like bebop I think you'll love dandy!

My favorite series is Steins;Gate, but Dandy is in my top 5. I'd watch just about anything, but i'd prefer a 1-2 cour show. Anything on my [list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/ohalright?&order=4) you're offended I haven't seen/dropped?
>> ARTICLE
Dude how have you not seen Darker Than Black? (Original 25 episode season)? I'd swap that for Space Dandy if you're interested, otherwise I have a couple more I'd think you'd be interested in!
>> ARTICLE
Sure thing! I'll boot up a couple episodes later today and let you know what I think! Enjoy Space Dandy! (Oh be sure to watch the dub, Dandy has a fantastic dub.)
>> ARTICLE
Bro, you like REALLY NEED TO WATCH SHIGATSU WA KIMI NO USO! It's a fantastic slice of life, it's beautifully animated, the story is great, the characters are great, and hell, the soundtrack is absolutely killer. Watch it!! You can pick one for me!  [my list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/omfgkevin) (yeah my backlog is huge ;p)
>> ARTICLE
Your Lie In April? Yeah my irl buddy has been bugging me about watching this show, I'm down. Off your "watching" list I say to finish White Album 2. All the characters are terrible people with emotions, it's great! 

Either that, Haikyuu, or Clannad (have to watch After Story for it to count). If you don't have a preference from those 3 I'll pick one for you!
>> ARTICLE
I tried 3 of white album 2 but i dunno, felt a bit disappointed after all the praise from reddit. I'll give Haikyuu a go, since it's from the same people that did koroko, and from the clips I've seen of my sister watching it, looks good. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll do any show that's not a harem or Cute Girls Doing Cute Things show if you watch [Gatchaman Crowds](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18229/Gatchaman_Crowds). It's more or less my favorite thing ever. If you want to do a 2-Cour show, add [Insight](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21039/Gatchaman_Crowds_Insight) as well.

It's a very logical, rational look at super heroes in today's world and does a lot of talk about social media and how the internet has effected how people interact with each other on a daily basis. Also, all the characters are great.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I'll start it tonight. Give me your list and I'll pick one. (Gatchaman Crowds is for sure, if I like it I'll watch Insight)
>> ARTICLE
Ah, right. [Here's my MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Natirasha&show=0&order=4).
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop, my absolute favorite show. If you haven't seen it/dropped it yet, it looks like we have a deal! 
>> ARTICLE
I'll do it. I watched it back on Toonami when I was a teen, but not since and I've forgotten most everything. 
>> ARTICLE
Awesome. I think it's a lot better to watch in order, even though it's episodic. 

You can watch Haikyuu! instead, if you'd prefer a show you truly haven't seen. Otherwise it looks like we have a deal yo
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I'll watch Bebop. It's been one of those on my list that I know I'll never get around to, but need to.
>> ARTICLE
Let's do this

I want you to watch code geass 
>> ARTICLE
What do you want me to watch
>> ARTICLE
Gimme your myanimelist, I'm down for some Code Geass
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen code geass one punch man and gate
>> ARTICLE
I always recommend Death Note to people who haven't seen it yet. Code Geass for Death Note sounds like a deal to me!
>> ARTICLE
Ok sweet
>> ARTICLE
Give me a good 1 cour show and I'll give you [Inou-Battle](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25159/Inou-Battle_wa_Nichijou-kei_no_Naka_de).

If you want me to watch more than that I'll probably do it, but I'll give you more in return >:D
>> ARTICLE
I've already seen Inou-Battle, but I'll watch a different one cour of your choice if you watch [Kyousougiga](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_(TV).

Or, I'll watch a two cour of your choice if you watch [Shirobako](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25835/Shirobako).  Either works for me, your choice ;)

Here's my [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/The_Shaqtus).
>> ARTICLE
I will give you [Kino no Tabi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/486/Kino_no_Tabi:_The_Beautiful_World?q=kino%20no%20tabi) or [Rokka no Yuusha](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28497/Rokka_no_Yuusha), feel free to choose one of them.

I should be finished with Inou-Battle in one week. 

Tell me if you are ok with this contract :>
>> ARTICLE
I'll take you up of Rokka no Yuusha, should be done within a week as well. Sorry for the late replay but I didn't have internet until just now. Do you want to message the contract or shall I? 
>> ARTICLE
I can message the contract. 

Have fun watching Rokka no Yuusha. 
>> ARTICLE
I probably will, tbh it looks like what I've been looking for recently (In terms of type of show)
>> ARTICLE
Okay so I immediately watched through it all. Very good I loved everything in it even though it was pretty easy to figure out who dun it. But that ending was total bullshit. 7.8/10 was gonna give it an 8 until that bullshit ending of bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
Wow man, you're quite fast. I watched only 3 episodes and so far I am not enjoying it so much as I thought I would. I mean, it's fun to watch but it isn't all that different from currently airing battle shounen harems like 35 platoon, gakuen or rakudai. And these whole chuunibyou talks really piss me off but I will soon get used to it, at least that's what I hope for.

About Rokka no Yuusha. The anime only adapted the first volume out of four if I remember correctly. Go read the novels if you liked it.
>> ARTICLE
The show does get better I think. Right now everything seems really meaningless and jumbled but it gets better.
>> ARTICLE
I'll offer a **double blind** contract!

[Here is my MAL](http://myanimelist.net/profile/saintyoo)

Post yours if you're down.

I'll pick a show that I think you would be interested in and you can do the same!
>> ARTICLE
Let's go then. Always wanted to make a contract :D

[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/tel3)
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I kinda had a little trouble picking for you :P

I'll suggest [**Akatsuki no Yona**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25013/Akatsuki_no_Yona)

It's a pretty great adventure series with a strong female lead and good character development. Now if only it could have a season 2 :(

Check out my favorites along with my list. My scores are more objective based rather than enjoyment based so my favorite shows should help you out a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Since you liked Black Lagoon, I think [Canaan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5356/Canaan) should be right up your alley.

Also, because Yona has 24 episodes I also want to offer you one of the most unique shows I've ever seen - [Mononoke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2246/Mononoke) - basically, more artsy and psychological version of Mushishi with outstanding art and the same episodic structure.
>> ARTICLE
Alright that sounds good!

I've had my eye on Mononoke for a while so this is perfect.

>> ARTICLE
Hey lets go!
[Here it is.](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Starry_Pirate&status=7)

>> ARTICLE
You should watch **Shirobako** from your Planned to Watch List!

It's a really cathartic show about struggling with work and pursuing your goals while you also learn a little about the anime industry.

I'll match you with another two cour show (or two one cour shows if you'd prefer).
>> ARTICLE
Hey sorry i'm getting back to you so late (but we all have to sleep sometime!)
I'm probally really biased giving you this recommendation, but try [Ouran Koukou Host Club]
(http://myanimelist.net/anime/853/Ouran_Koukou_Host_Club?q=Oura)

Ouran is a romantic comedy that was the first anime I ever watched. It's about a girl from a poor family who transfers into a rich high school because of a scholarship she got from her grades. She accidentally stumbles into the host club, they mistake her for a guy, and chaos ensues! Ouran is the first anime I ever watched and I love it ro death. Try it out - you (hopefully) won't regret it!
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good!
>> ARTICLE
Let's get some harems up in here, I will trade on of the following anime for any harem show you want me to see that I haven't.

They are:

- [They Are My Noble Masters](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3229/Kimi_ga_Aruji_de_Shitsuji_ga_Ore_de)

- [Student Council's Discretion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5909/Seitokai_no_Ichizon)

- [The Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15225/Hentai_Ouji_to_Warawanai_Neko.)

- [I Don't Have Many Friends](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10719/Boku_wa_Tomodachi_ga_Sukunai)

- [My Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight Too Much](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14749/Ore_no_Kanojo_to_Osananajimi_ga_Shuraba_Sugiru)

I tried to go with harem anime that aren't really talked about much here. [Here's my MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/GenosZ), I hope you lot pick a good harem for me :)
>> ARTICLE
I'll take Seitokai no Ichizon, and give you my favorite harem known as [Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10079/Hoshizora_e_Kakaru_Hashi). By this time next week?
>> ARTICLE
Sounds interesting enough, I'll take it! I'll be sure to finish it by this time next week :)
>> ARTICLE
I will trade: 

* [Kara no Kyoukai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2593/Kara_no_Kyoukai_1:_Fukan_Fuukei) movie series (7 in total) - about 2-cour series length long

* [Cross Ange](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25731/Cross_Ange:_Tenshi_to_Ryuu_no_Rondo) (25 episodes)

[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/profile/tel3)

Any 2-cour show is alright. 2 1-cours is okay too.
>> ARTICLE
Would you be interested in watching [Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate)? It's 24 episodes long and It's one of my favorite Anime of all time. I'll watch Kara no Kyoukai.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, that's the deal. 

I wanted to read the VN first, but since it looks like the series is great too, I think I'll start with anime.
>> ARTICLE
Ok enjoy! I'll get started asap.
>> ARTICLE
I will trade:
[Baccano!](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?q=Baccano) (13 episodes)

[Code Geass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch) (Two seasons, 25 episodes each)

[Chihayafuru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10800/Chihayafuru) (Two seasons, 25 episodes each)

[Monster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster) (74 episodes)

[My MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Starry_Pirate&status=7)

I'll watch really anything anyone offers up! So, who wants to trade? :)
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I'm interested in doing a contract with somebody, but the problem is I don't have a MAL and I've seen quite a lot in my 27 years of watching anime/reading manga. 

If you want to make a contract with me, you'll have to dig deep. Anyway, here's the choices:

A single cour series:

[Hourou Musuko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426)

Or a movie:

[Kaze no Na wa Amnesia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1793)

To clarify, I'm only looking for a single contract.

Offered to spout out random numbers to people who replied. Like the `!roll` bot but not a bot.

I got 116, Space Dandy. You got 276, [Kuuchuu Buuranko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6774/Kuuchuu_Buranko), looks pretty decent. Also, why do you have so much on your ptw.

http://imgur.com/a/0vQeg I realise the first is 153 but whatever
>> ARTICLE
I was going to pick a random number off your completed/PTW list...but I actually already have Kuuchu Buuranko downloaded for what ever reason...But I'll still do a random number:

So out of 101 from your completed, [I got 6 on the first try](http://i.imgur.com/Buolhzg.png), which means I am going to watch [Barakamon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon). Hear it's like Usagi Drop, I liked Usagi Drop, so I think I'll have a good time with it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a good anime, it's just my score is low because I don't like little kids at all, and it was a bit slower than my usual pacing.

Ohh, I got No Game No Life. About time I watched that show....

Sorry about causing you grief!

First Roll, 10: Fairy Tail...no...

Second Roll 29: Ouran Koukou Host Club, been meaning to watch this for a while, I'm fine with doing it. 

But because 3 of you decided to go for it at once, don't expect this to be finished for a while...
>> ARTICLE
Thats fine! School is keeping me running around right now plus i'm watching a lot of series at once, so it might take me a while as well. I'm so glad you got Ouran though. It was the first anime I ever watched and I keep it near and dear to my heart.
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm... Sounds like a fun idea. Let's see what we can see here.

1. 90: Perfect Blue -- seen
2. 45: Hyouka -- seen
3. 29: ef~ A Tale of Memories -- seen
4. 56: Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko -- seen
5. 64: Little Witch Academia -- seen
6. 87: Spice and Wolf 2 -- seen
7. 123: TTGL -- seen
8. 112: Adolescence of Utena Movie -- seen
9. 93: Plastic Neesan -- seen
10. 23: Cowboy Bebop -- seen

Okay. So the Completed list isn't helping me much. Let's try the PTW List.

1. 496: Tiger & Bunny -- seen
2. 399: Redline -- seen
3. 293: Macross Do You Remember Love? -- seen
4. 363: Noir -- seen
5. 165: Hachimitsu to Clover -- seen
6. 49: Barakamon -- seen
7. 38: Armitage III -- seen
8. 286: Lucky Star -- ***NOT SEEN!?!***

You made me work for it, so I guess I'll see Lucky Star. 
>> ARTICLE
[**more do this...?**Why did 3](#fedup)

Alright, first roll: 96, Byston Well Monogatari: Garzey no Tsubasa...J.C. Staff's (studio I already don't like) lowest rated anime on MAL, you rated it a 1, and it looks pretty awful...needless to say I'm skipping...

Second roll: 621 Gunbuster - Seen

Third: 153: Diabolik Lovers Recap, Sequel (Thank god it wasn't one lower...)

Fourth: 378: Koukou Butouden Crows, source doesn't have English subs

Fifth: 472: OnegaiTeacher: FINALLY ONE I CAN DO! I get through a few more contracts...so this will take a while...but will summon when it's started...
>> ARTICLE
Deal. And I'll wait until you get started before I start watching Lucky Star. That way, I'm not sitting here for weeks waiting for someone else to finish off the contract.

But as a couple of side notes: 

* Garzey's Wing is one of those infamous "so bad it's good" titles. Just like Masters of Martial Hearts, the presence of this one title on people's Lists is what separates the men from the boys. 
* Koukou Butouden Crows does indeed have English subs, but they are fairly hard to track down unless you get lucky. So if you're interested, I'll shoot you a link.
>> ARTICLE
I got [58](https://i.imgur.com/Ck1FTCp.png) which was the Black Lagoon OVA's, I was going to redo it but I thought it. I'll just watch Black Lagoon from the start. So that's what I'll go with.

[Here's my MAL.](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/GenosZ), not that you should go with my completed (297), as my plan to watch is really only upcoming anime.
>> ARTICLE
[**more do this...?**Why did 3](#barakamonnotcool)

(Side note, change your flair to your actual list...)

Alright, first roll, I got [127](http://i.imgur.com/p3yKLFQ.png), K-On! Live House...and I'm going to use the skip, I was considering that you got Black Lagoon to watch the second season of K-On!! instead...but I didn't like the first season of K-On!, so I don't feel like going through it...

Second roll: 34: Carnival Phantasm, haven't seen enough of Fate to see it

Third roll: [231](http://i.imgur.com/C8JVm46.png), Shinmai Maou no Testament. I have you seeing Symphogear already, I have yet to see an action ecchi, it looks like dumb fun, and if /u/WingsOfLight's webms say anything about it, then it'll be worth a watch (   ). So I'll take you on with this. 

Although this is on a priority list, I probably won't get to it for a while...

haha yeah I forgot about changing this, I've changed it now :p

Will watch anything that is six episodes or less (6-episode OVA, a movie, whatever) for anybody who hasn't watched [Golden Boy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/268/Golden_Boy) yet.

Deal. How about you watch the movie [Wolf Children](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12355/Ookami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki/)? It's easily my favorite movie (be prepared for feels). For golden boy, is there a show before the OVA I should watch?

No. Just watch Golden Boy.

It's a deal.

Sweet!
>> ARTICLE
Oh. My. Fucking. God.

I just finished Golden Boy.

It feels like I am now missing a piece of my soul. Part of my heart has been ripped out because I finished Golden Boy. I want more so bad.

I cannot thank you enough for the recommendation.
>> ARTICLE
*Golden Boy* is in dire need of three seasons and a movie.

I'll watch Wolf Children tonight.

Yes. This needs to be a thing. Once again, I can't thank you enough for the recommendation. I can't wait to hear your reaction to Wolf Children - prepare for feels!

Finished Wolf Children. Great film. Looks really nice. I'm not really a 'feels' guy, though, so I guess that aspect of it was lost on me.

I've been meaning to watch Golden Boy since forever, so I'll do it. You can pick from [Shamanic Princess](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1182/Shamanic_Princess) or [Please Save My Earth](http://myanimelist.net/anime/526/Boku_no_Chikyuu_wo_Mamotte).

Here I go with another somewhat obscure offering for a standard contract:

[R.O.D. OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/208/R.O.D_OVA)

In exchange for [this slice of glory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks_idCKrshY), I'm asking for any 3-ish episode OVA or a single standalone movie of any genre not already on [my List.](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/OffColfax)

Any takers?

I don't really have anything equivalent to offer so I guess I'll just watch it. Seems interesting.

I've been meaning to watch R.O.D. for ages anyway, so I'll take you up on it in return for watching [Gunnm](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1016/Gunnm). If you've seen it already, let me know and I'll pick something else.

Oooooh... Battle Angel Alita, eh? I haven't heard of that one in a long time.

Deal.

So you haven't seen it? Excellent, that works out then. I'll start digging around for the R.O.D. OVAs.

I normally wouldn't participate in this, especially with finals coming up, but in honor of the rewatch starting on Sunday, I'll trade [*Toradora!*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/WATCH_THIS_SHOW) for any similar-length series.

**Seriously, get in the rewatch if you haven't seen this.** It's a lot of fun, you get a reason to watch anime on Christmas, and also I probably won't have my side done until around that time anyway :P

Edit: [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Geo1088), and obligatory [OP is a faggot](https://i.imgur.com/snjs8Dw.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I'll join the Toradora rewatch if you watch any of these anime, all of which are out of your comfort zone and are not on your PTW list:

* **Cross Ange**, the wildest rollercoaster you'll ever be on and the one of most controversial anime ever
* **Symphogear (season 1 and 2)**, an anime that relies purely on its music and its ridiculous, stupid, and hype plot
* The currently airing **Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans** (also by the director and writer of the Toradora and Anohana anime)
* **Rage of Bahamut: Genesis** and **Sora no Woto**, two different anime, but they have in common that they start pretty lighthearted, but get gradually more serious. Both also have excellent worldbuilding

Sorry for the lack of MAL links, I'm currently on my phone in bed. I'll also only be able to respond after some 8 hours (since I'll be asleep in the mean time hehe)
>> ARTICLE
Hoo boy, here we go. I guess I'll try out [Symphogear](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11751/Senki_Zesshou_Symphogear:_Meteoroid-Falling_Burning_and_Disappear_Then...), what the hell. (That's the right one, right?)

I'll go PM... oh wait.

Hope you like Toradora! I'll be in the rewatch too, so I'll be following your posts, at least after I get on break in a couple weeks.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, well, you chose and replied faster than I thought you would! Anyway, yes, that's it. That, and Symphogear G, the second season. I hope you enjoy it! And if you want, there's also a third season and a semi-announced fourth season (it's announced by a staff member, so not really official yet) that you can watch after!
>> ARTICLE
Ok, sounds good. I'll add them to my PTW and they should be complete around the end of the Christmas watch if all goes well. :)
>> ARTICLE
Alrighty,  
  
I'll be trading each of these for anything with similar length:  
  
- [Jigoku Shoujo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/228/Jigoku_Shoujo) (Horror / Psychological / Mystery, 26 Episodes)  
- [Rokka no Yuusha](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28497/Rokka_no_Yuusha) (Action / Adventure / Mystery, 12 Episodes)

Aye. Should I watch it at some later point though, or completely skip it?

If you really love the series you could go back and watch it. It's a retelling of the OVA which is told in the anime anyway so it isn't necessary  

edit: ONA not OVA but yeah same difference

you could also skip the .5's if you want as they're recaps, but they're pretty fun.

Well, I've been up all night for reasons (totally not related to waiting for the latest Fafner ep to drop and watching Macross) might as well give this a go.

Nah, you can add the contract through the message form in the OP post but that hardly seems necessary for just a single movie, if you want to sign a contract in blood to give me your soul though, I don't mind.

Standard contract; will watch anything one cour-ish in exchange for [Paranoia Agent.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/323/Mousou_Dairinin) Its Japanese name is Mousou Dairinin.

I've finished Inferno Cop and I am finishing Yamada-Kun today (I'm on episode 8). Once I finish Yamada-Kun I will pm you my thoughts. Now, my thoughts on Inferno Cop...  

IT WAS AWESOME! I love the fact that the plot didn't take itself seriously. Inferno Cop as a character was a badass and I love Hellfire Boy (;_; feels!). I also love the unconventional animation. All and all, the Anime was just a badass satire. **8/10**  

How's White Album 2 coming along?

>> ARTICLE
Glad to hear you enjoyed Inferno Cop. It's definitely one of my favorite series for all the same reasons you mentioned. Now moving onto White Album 2...

Oh my god it was so good!! Watched the entire thing in one sitting. Once I started I couldn't stop. I thought the way it played out the love triangle was done to perfection. Unlike most other romance anime series I have seen, it felt like this one was done in a very realistic and natural style. Approached the subject in a very mature way. It didn't pull any punches and allowed its MC to make decisions that felt very human/flawed (Touma best girl.) So good. Loved every part of it. 9/10, tied for my favorite romance show I've seen. 

If you have any other series you would recommend/contract I'd be more than interested in seeing them!

I've finished [Aria the Animation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/477/Aria_The_Animation?q=Aria%20the) and I have to say, I really enjoyed it. The characters were great, my favorites are Alicia and Akira, though I can't decide which one of them is better, but oh well. Also, Aria is really freakin' adorable! The ED theme is really great, mainly because it was made by Round Table. I've also noticed that I started to really like the show more after finishing Speed Grapher, since that anime was just gorey. So now....  
  
**MY SIDE OF THE CONTRACT IS COMPLETED**  
  
I gave the anime a score of **8/10** because it was a really peaceful show, the atmosphere was relaxing, and it's really funny at times, especially Alicia's signature quote "Ara Ara".  
  
Thanks for the contract! I might watch the sequels too in the future.
>> ARTICLE
That's great to hear! I'd definitely recommend the other season, as they actually move toward a goal/ending. It's not just "nothing happens" for 3 season. The ending is just so powerful, it has to be experienced.

I'm actually watching S;G right now, currently at episode 15. Hopefully finishing it today. It's pretty good, and hooked me from episode 1, though it can be frustrating at times. The general lack of just talking to eachother to sort out the unnecessary drama is bugging me quite a bit.

I finished the first season of DRRR! and I must say that i absolutely loved the first half of this show. Izaya and Celty are some of the most interesting characters I have ever seen, and every second they were on screen i was hooked. 2nd Half, while still good, was not as addicting as the first half for me but I still absolutely enjoyed it. If it weren't for the weird pacing it had and the okay 2nd half, this show would be one of my favorites, but because of these flaws it holds it back from being an amazing show. I gotta give it an 8/10. The true definition of a great show. The dub of this show was also one of my personal favorites in terms of the performances of Johnny Yong Bosch, Crispin Freeman, and Kari Wahlgren as some of their best works. I can't wait to watch more!

I'm on episode 20 of **Golden Time**! I'm enjoying the ride so far and hopefully I can finish it this weekend.

How's **Nagi no Asu** coming along?
___

Edit:

I finished it today! It was an enjoyable romance and the college setting with early confessions stood out from other anime. I'll be a little critical in saying the story was melodramatic at times but not enough to fully interrupt my immersion. It also had some random plot developments that were used to progress the story.

I gave it a 5/10 (which isn't a bad score!) for being entertaining while having some interesting strengths and apparent weaknesses.

Oh and screw Ghost Banri.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, there are some definite flaws with the story, but hey. Its a good ride. And yeah. Fuck that guy.

As for Nagi no Asukara, I finished it exactly 2 days after we made our contract. I *might* have a new favorite anime. Fuck the Sea God. Let me just put it this way. I watched the mid-season finale and started episode 13 at 1:30am. I instantly went and made a pot of coffee because I knew I wouldnt be able to walk away until I was done. And even then, I sat there staring at a blank screen for about an hour after I was done. It was amazing. 10/10. Kicks Angel Beats' ass.
>> ARTICLE
That's great!

I really love how the all characters changed and developed in the show!

I'll look forward to making more contracts with you in the future :)

I finished Kyousougiga. Ever had one of those shows you just *know* is good, but can't bring yourself to like? That's my feelings on this show. I liked the style and aesthetic, I liked the story, but it was kind of bogged down in...nothing? 

I don't know, I come from a place where my family was useless but not deadbeat, and had to disavow my emotional ties to them at a young age, so the whole story of rebirth and the importance of family just fell kind of flat to me. I also had this problem--that I've never had with literally any show before--where the colors just, there were too many and I could only watch one episode at a time before I got a really bad migraine. While it doesn't count against the show, it did lessen my enjoyment of it.

Also, I really could feel this show would have been much better paced at a half-cour or something. There were a lot of characters that were way underutilized(the two science geeks, Yase, even Koto1 to an extent). In all, I did enjoy it and can recognize objectively I'm rating it low due to a lack of empathy, but I gave it a 7/10. 
>> ARTICLE
> Ever had one of those shows you just know is good, but can't bring yourself to like?

Yep its called Shinsekai Yori. 


That definitely is a problem with the side characters. If instead they didn't have one or two of those special episodes (5.5, 10.5) and had another episode to expand on some of those characters, I think the show woud've been perfect. Personally I liked all the characters, and I am a sucker for family and friendship shows despite having no real feeling towards actual family. 


If you are wondering about my progress, later the night made this contract thing, I realized I was in the final two weeks of school so it's going to take longer than I initially thought.
>> ARTICLE
Ha, Shinsekai Yori is a little overhyped, to be fair.

And, no worries, take your time. Just update me when you finish.

^_^
>> ARTICLE
/u/MisterFleur. I finished Shokugeki no Souma. Have you started Nanatsu no Taizai yet?
>> ARTICLE
Literally just wrote something and refreshed. But yes.
>> ARTICLE
/u/SmurfRockRune Im currently 14/24 into The Seven Deadly Sins. Not sure if its Hunter x Hunter backlash or something else but I havnt felt impressed at all by this. Maybe 6/10, the action scenes are nice but Im just not into the OP characters(not something I expected from going into it blindly).


/u/ShaKing807

* ~~Shirobako~~
* ~~Golden Time~~
* ~~Perfect Blue~~
* ~~Millennium Actress~~
* Nagi no Asukara
* Parasyte
* Hanasaku Iroha
* Tokyo Godfathers
* Patema Inverted
* Redline
* Wolf Children
* Princess Mononoke

When?
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. I was a fan of the comedy and characters, not necessarily the fights. Although, the action scenes are quite nice to look at. It's definitely not Hunter x Hunter quality.
>> ARTICLE
Comedy can be really hit and miss with me, either it works or it doesnt. This time it just doesnt. Anything the pig says for comedic value or Meliodas groping Elizabeth and follow up reactions doesnt get to me at all.
>> ARTICLE
It was a mistake to dive straight into an action shonen right after HxH.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Binbougami ga!, The Devil is a Part Timer, and Non Non Biyori before I started this so its not right after.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, well that's disappointing. I felt that 7DS' opener was quite strong.
>> ARTICLE
I've finished Space Dandy as contract with /u/keokl (that you didn't included btw). Review, below.

> Came for the show, stayed for the OP. As most episodic anime I watched, Space Dandy just died out, except I didn't really liked it from the start. The technical aspects are amazing tho (specially the ED song) and last 4 episodes were great. 6/10

I've finished Gekkou Shoujo Nozaki-kun and Laputa as contract with /u/snowywish. I've already given my opinions on them some time ago.

What are you two doing? Did you finished them? :P
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I was just about to summon you.

Toki wa Kakeru Shoujo is complete. Well, to be very honest I feel that the story was very rough and unpolished to a degree that seemed amateurish, especially when tackling a complex subject as time travel. 

What I did love about the show was how well the characters were brought to life. Not just the main three but the aunt, the little sister, the crushing kouhai and co. and even the fire hydrant guy were breathed to existence by what I thought was superb vision and understanding of human character. Despite my many gripes with Madhouse productions I've always felt that they excel in this area, and this movie went above and beyond that.

Art was gorgeous. Music was decent as well. And I loved whoever voiced Makoto's sister. Actually I'm going to look up whoever that was because it was pretty sweet.

While I wouldn't call it good by any means, I quite enjoyed the viewing. 6.5/10, if you like scores, but I'm sure that doesn't quite reflect my enjoyment level.

Osomatsu-san, as you know, is still airing. I'm caught up, and rather liking so far.

P.S. I don't think I received your Laputa comment. Where'd you leave it?
>> ARTICLE
I think it was on a recent "What show you watched that isn't a airing show". Look on my comment history and maybe you can find it.
>> ARTICLE
Whoops, I'm not sure how I missed that, but I got your PM and I'll update it. I usually disable inbox replies for these threads though, so in the future you don't even need to mention it here as I won't get it anyway. :P
>> ARTICLE
/u/friendlypinetree, I finished the first season of Gatchaman! Will write about it in the Non-Airing discussion thread. 

Small resume: Loved it, will also watch Crowds soon.
>> ARTICLE
It's great to know you liked it, I'll be sure to check your post about it!
>> ARTICLE
I will, of course, make sure you'll get a notification!
>> ARTICLE
So a couple updates. I've been kind of swamped with school and work so I didn't have as much time for anime as I would have liked. Sorry.

**Akatsuki no Yona** for /u/JsaKim

This seems to be a change of pace from what I usually watch, but it's not altogether unwelcome. I really like the Korean-inspired setting, and the characters seem likable enough so far.  While I usually dislike the "chosen one" trope in fiction, the show's handling it alright. I'll try to finish by next saturday.

**Shinsekai yori** for /u/8BitCarrot

I'm really liking this one so far. The visuals remind me of a Ghibli movie, the setting is equal parts beautiful and creepy, and the central mystery is intriguing. While I had the misfortune of having one major plot point spoiled for me, I'm still excited to see what comes next.

[Here's my MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Nitrosnipe)

Hope to see who gets to be my first contract, and I'll try to pick something good for ya to watch so [be gentle](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/922/821/ae2.gif) with me too!

Unfortunately, you watch, most literally, [shit](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16608/Shitcom), so I won't be able to make a contract with you.

^^^^^^^/s

I've got another contract to get to, but looking at your list, I see a disturbing lack of Katanagatari.

I'll watch anything 26 or less episodes in return.

I'll sign up for that one. The art style always looked interesting to me whenever I see something about it. In exchange, watch Mikakunin de Shinkoukei

I shall do the same for Katanagatari!

It's my favourite Bjrk song.

I saw that it was on the list and was 100% ready to vote for it, then I saw that it was up against Angel which is one of my favourite songs not even just including anime related music. Easily the toughest choice of this bracket for me but in the end Angel is just too good.

Holy shit lol, I didn't even realize that, I just saw that they had two next to each other and assumed. Haven't been following these things as much since I've been busy since summer started.

Ah yes... my absolute favorite OP ever.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I loved it even before I watched Tokyo Ghoul. When I actually began Tokyo Ghoul, I somehow loved it even more :P
>> ARTICLE
I jut saw a gif of Rize ripping Kaneki to pieces and became very interested and I liked it alot.

And then I watched season 2.

I dont like to talk about season 2. Read the manga instead. Its infinitely better.

I'm gonna say it, and there's nothing you can do to stop me.

I liked A. I really liked it. Yes I do have a shit taste. Also I'm gonna buy the manga when it comes out, don't worry.

I didn't like Sirius as much, Ambiguous was a far better OP for KlK
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't too big on either ED, kinda disappointing considering the overall stellar soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
Ambiguous is definitely the better of the two openings, but Sirius grows on you (at least in my opinion).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I don't like Sirius as much as Ambiguous by itself. But I think Sirius makes you feel a little nostalgic when you hear it, especially because of the very ending in the last episode when they play it.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't flip out at that point as much as I did when they started playing Ambiguous, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think Ambiguous was more hype to me, whereas when I heard Sirius I just went, "Aw, it's ending and I don't know how I should feel about this."

Completely in love with Hana no Iro, amazing opening for an amazing show. Give it a listen, it's pretty unique.

Also, Spice and Wolf's opening is fantastic. Absolutely love how it sounds, it gave off such a haunting vibe.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, so the entire Railgun opening suite was nominated. And I can't say they don't deserve to be - they're all definite contenders for top spot, and although I consider it to be the weakest of the bunch, [Eternal Reality](https://youtu.be/VNotN0dDMLc) is no exception.

Fun fact: Eternal Reality is the only one of Railgun's openings where Misaka doesn't fire off her Railgun ability at some point during the OP. Only My Railgun, Level 5, and Sister's Noise all feature it, while Eternal Reality only somewhat teases it.

Minna no Peace? Isn't that the Gurren Lagann ED? Why is it part of this contest?

Also, who put Eternal Reality in there? It's the worst of all the Railgun OPs.
>> ARTICLE
well they let 4 OPs per franchise in and there's only 4 Railgun OPs ....sooooooooo, yeah. It's fairly amusing though that the worst Ops for each season of Railgun were the ones used during the filler eps. I hope /r/anime can control the massive boner they have for Railgun over Index though, since See VisionS blows every other Railgun or Index OP out of the water.
>> ARTICLE
>the worst Ops for each season of Railgun were the ones used during the filler eps

I like Level 5 Judgelight.

>the massive boner they have for Railgun over Index 

Agreed. Both shows are great, and I don't understand why people like one but not the other. Especially because Railgun's quality varies greatly. The manga arcs are all great, but the filler arcs (Big Spider, Poltergeist, and especially Silent Party) are horribly boring. The only boring arcs in Index are Deep Blood and Queen of the Adriatic Seas, and they're both only 3 episodes long.

>See VisionS

I prefer masterpiece or No Buts.
>> ARTICLE
To me it's quite clear why a lot of people dislike Index, or at least like Railgun way more...and the reason is in the name of the anime itself. [Spoilers for both I guess](/s "Index is such an annoying character, all she does is bite Touma. I usually enjoy a well done Tsundere (and any other type of character that's executed well), and Index is a terrible one. She has a couple of moments where she does shit, but when it matters she doesn't do anything really and it's all up to Touma. Misaka, on the other hand, is an incredibly more enjoyable character that gets shit done. She might be a Tsundere as well, but all level 5s have some issues due to the Academy City curriculum so it's not for no reason. Honestly, give me a season 3 of Index with all its focus on Touma, Accelerator, and if possible Misaka and I will enjoy it way more than the previous seasons of Railgun.")
>> ARTICLE
> I hope /r/anime[1] can control the massive boner they have for Railgun over Index though

Why is it such a bad thing for people to prefer the show that's just better? Everything Index did well, Railgun did better, and everything Index did poorly Railgun for the most part managed to avoid.

Also, I can't understand how you think See VisionS is better than Only My Railgun or Sister's Noise. It just sounds boring until the last 30 seconds of the OP, wheras Only My Railgun and Sister's Noise start strong, have calm middle sections, and somehow manage to finish *stronger* than the opened, certainly a feat considering they're both pretty intense from the beginning. Railgun's openings make me want to watch the show without having to rely on the background visuals. The only thing about See VisionS that makes me want to watch further is the fact that I recognize the characters in the background and I know that at least the science-side characters will provide enough entertainment to cover for the fact that magic-side has nothing but one-dimensional bores.
>> ARTICLE
I have no issue with See VisionS but I definitely find some of the Railgun openings much better than it. I also prefer No Buts as my favorite Index opening.

>> ARTICLE
No Buts is a fine replacement. I'd disagree that any of the Railgun OPs are better than See VisionS though but whatever, personal tastes etc.
>> ARTICLE
Ooops, that was one of the last ones I nominated, I probably got tired. That should be kicked then. Though it's a good song.

Everyone better vote on Aoi Shiori! One of the most powerful OPs I've ever heard (and a personal favorite for sure).

* I'd heard the Gosick OP before, but those visuals were not what I was expecting, very nice.

* I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority by preferring the first Birdy:Decode opening over the second. 

* Sure are lot of heavyweights in this group: Tank!, Motteke[!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAtP1j4dhgY): Sailor Fuku, Tabi no Tochuu, Staple Stable...

* Initial D is one of a few shows where the opening themes are not the best pieces of music within the show.

* I'm not a huge fan of Staple Stable.  Even if it's a pleasant opening, the budget shortcuts are a little too stark for me to feel like it's minimalist/stylized by artistic choice.

A question: Departure! is the song used for all of the [openings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEuywJEH4Qk) of the 2011 Hunter x Hunter adaptation; which season/arc is being used for the contest?  Any? Are we hoping it doesn't get far enough to matter?

Aw shit, well w/e I'll just do it this way.
>> ARTICLE
Doing my best to make this spoiler free. 

The entirety of Cross Game is driven by Kitamura's (male protagonist) relationship with his childhood girlfriend Wakaba and her sister Aoba. Wakaba and Kou are in a romantic relationship at the start of the series and she constantly acts as his motivation for baseball, while Aoba is frequently jealous of Kou and wants more time with Wakaba alone. It just so happens that both Kou and Aoba grew up to be great pitchers. 

For me, the romance and relationships between characters are the driving forces behind the show and it does focus heavily on it; baseball is more of an added bonus of sorts. I've probably never watched a full game of baseball in my life on TV and I still enjoyed Cross Game. 
>> ARTICLE
First of all: [ohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh yay to more people watching Cross Game](http://media.giphy.com/media/3Cm8cxtSHqu6Q/giphy.gif)

Secondly, my opinion on your wondering (spoiler free- I can't stress enough how important it is to go into this show without having seen spoilers): one of the major focuses of Cross Game is the relationship between Kou and two sisters in the Tsukishima family, Wakaba and Aoba. The anime functions very well as a story of characters realizing their feelings for each other, but if you want a show that blatantly explains the inner thought processes of exactly how those characters realize those feelings, you might not particularly like Cross Game. It's much more subtle than most romance shows; it doesn't tell you what the characters feel, but instead expects you to understand their emotions from their characterizations, actions, motives, and backgrounds.

The romance aspect is more often than not in the background while the slice-of-life, drama, and sports aspects get attention. But that's not to say that romance and overall relationships within the show are not a major theme; I think the romance in Cross Game is one of its most essential themes, and its character relationships are its strongest suit. Cross Game's romance is one of the most fulfilling ones I've ever witnessed in an anime.

^(I hope this was helpful even just a little)
>> ARTICLE
I would say the romance is very subtle and it's rarely ever said very bluntly by the characters, but it's obviously there. There's a lot of coping of past traumas and feelings of regret and that combines with budding feelings of romance.
>> ARTICLE
I think it wasn't so much as there was as heavy focus on romance, but rather it really just had a lot of time to work with, which alllowed the show to really let the romance develop naturally
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Cross Game was about half romance and half baseball although that being said at times I felt that the baseball aspect of it does take the backseat and focuses on the romance a bit more.

Hmm, there was a DMC anime? I read the manga and watched the live-action movie; is there anything particularly unique about the anime that would still recommend itself for my watching?
>> ARTICLE
From what I've heard, it's pretty faithful to the manga. I've only seen the anime though, so I wouldn't know exactly how it compares.   
It's animated by 4C, which is one of my favorite animation studios. 
>> ARTICLE
DMC is best enjoyed in anime form IMO, the fact that you can actually *hear* the music in the anime makes it much more enjoyable (and the music is very well-done, both in terms of being faithful to the original material and being funny).  The anime had me constantly laughing out loud in a way that the manga never could.  The DMC anime is actually relatively short; it's a 12-episode OVA and each episode is only 12 minutes, so you could easily finish the entire series in less than three hours.
>> ARTICLE
The movie also had music, as well as a guest appearance by Gene Simmons as Jack ill Dark. I read much of the manga after watching the movie and felt that the movie was also fairly faithful to the source material. Have you watched it? Wondering how it compares to the anime (especially considering I wasn't very fond of the artwork in the manga).

I haven't gotten around to watching the movie yet, although I've been meaning to for quite awhile.  I think I might save it for when I can watch it as part of a group, since DMC is best enjoyed with friends from my experience.

Just recommend what ever you like, I never had any specific preferences 
>> ARTICLE
Cool, I find myself in the same boat, I'll watch anything if it's entertaining ;)
>> ARTICLE
Both large lists miss Seitokai Yakuindomo.  I think I am the only one who loved it.
>> ARTICLE
No, you aren't the only one. I absolutely adore it and I am happy there's a second season coming.

The issue stems from the heavy dialogues with sexual tinted conversations that are hard to digest translated. I would watch every episode twice, once raw and then once subbed to try to get the most out of it.

It's really hard to be concentrated for 25 minute blocks and actively try to listen. Same thing happened to me with Bakemonogatari, I had to watch a few times during dialog heavy parts to get the feeling for the scene.
>> ARTICLE
>It's really hard to be concentrated for 25 minute blocks and actively try to listen.

WHAT. No offense, but if your attention span is less than 25 minutes, that's pretty terrible. My attention span would only ever be that low if whatever I was doing was something I considered boring.
>> ARTICLE
No offense taken, my Japanese is not quite good enough to be able to understand it fluently like I can other languages so it takes quite a bit of concentration.

While some sentence structures are easily understood, others I have not had enough listening practice yet to be able to decide on a meaning on the spot (causative, passive, causative passive and potential come to mind as they are close together depending on the verb).

It's not that I find it hard to watch a show, it's more that it's hard for me to concentrate for that amount of time and actively watch it without subtitles.

HIGH SCHOOL OF THE DEAD
>> ARTICLE
I'd watch Spice and Wolf, Eden of the East, and Madoka Magica at a bare minimum.  If you liked Haruhi (or haven't seen it), watch the first season then the first episode of season 2 (bamboo leaf rhapsody) so you can watch the disappearance of Haruhi movie. 
>> ARTICLE
If you skip Endless Eight, the movie will make somewhat less sense.  Subject yourself to it, and you will be enlightened.
>> ARTICLE
Some shows that I haven't seen posted and are also pretty good:
-Gosick(Currently airing)
-Toaru Majutsu no Index
-Toaru Majutsu no Index II
-Toaru Kagaku no Railgun
-Working!!

other shows that have been posted and I would just like to reinforce because I have seen them and agree they are worth watching:

-Bakemonogatari
-Higashi no Eden a.k.a. Eden of the East
-Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica
-Arakawa Under the Bridge
-Deadman Wonderland(currently airing)
-Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (Ano Hana for short)(currently airing)

In order to get each entry of a list to appear on its own line, there are two tactics you can use.

Either you can place an asterisk at the beginning of the line and follow it with a space.  Thus, typing:

>\* List item 1  
\* List item 2  
\* List item 3

gives:

* List item 1
* List item 2
* List item 3

Alternately, you can end each line with not one but *two* spaces:

>List item 1 space space  
List item 2 space space  
List item 3 space space

gives you:

List item 1  
List item 2  
List item 3  

The latter is preferred only for poetry.  Use bullets for unordered lists, and use numbers for unordered lists.

thanks for the tip

Fairy Tail! It's an action anime about wizards and mages, but at a different view. Me and my sister watched it and loved it! It's still ongoing. ^.^

One Piece became the greatest thing ever conceived. So catch up!

Is it really worth it? I stopped watching one piece at like ... 270~? wherever the davy back fight crap was .... i loved it til then but it manged to kill it for me, thinking about restarting it but meehh ... 500+ eps now lol
>> ARTICLE
Davy Back Fight did suck I totally agree. But after that is Thriller Bark. I just thought that was decent but after that, it becomes amazing. Thing I like is that it starts out slow but if you get get through it, it is the greatest thing ever. The most recent arc that's just closing was legendary.
>> ARTICLE
Ill give it a chance i guess, thinking about a complete rewatch minus the davy back crap.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good. Enjoy the masterpiece!
>> ARTICLE
Ah, i was reading an ep guide to see when the davy back fight mini arc ended, it had a few good moments im remembering now that im reading the synopsis :D

Still complete crap and made me stop watching the series for a longtime, but the dodgeball game was pretty funny.

"There are many rules, all contained within a humongous rulebook (that Robin had to use two sets of arms to hold). Among other things, **the rules allow for no weapons except for a giant robot battlesuit Foxy happens to have**. "
>> ARTICLE
Yeah haha there are funny moments, but to be honest that was one of my least favorite parts. Again though, the next 200 episodes are a massive crescendo of epic that make you jizz your pants x1000.
>> ARTICLE
yea, i restarted at ep 225, sitting at 237 atm, going tot he store for some more drinks, then once im done with the gym back up for another 30 or so episodes .... i forgot how easily marathonnable this series is ... and how able it is to elicit tear filled hysterical laughter.

* [Hiroomi Nase](http://myanimelist.net/character/81763/Hiroomi_Nase). I love that idiot so much. His dynamic with Akihito is freaking incredible! I love that his relationship with Akihito feels like a real friendship between two guys. There are no "YOU ARE MY BROTHER!" moments or other overdramatic bullshit. But there is teasing. There are stupid jokes. And there is calm acceptance of each other's shit taste in girls. 

* [Junpei Iori](http://myanimelist.net/character/6205/Junpei_Iori). Right after Garrus, Junpei is my quintessential video game bro. What I really love about Junpei is the amount of character growth that he goes through. He starts out as your typical butt-monkey and comic relief, but we soon find out just how inferior to the MC he feels. That makes Junpei lash out against you and even reject you as team leader, only to regret his decision later and reforge his friendship with you even stronger. By the time The Answer comes around, Junpei becomes THE MOST RATIONAL person in his team, which is mind-blowing.

that ep 1. I got so depressed that I couldn't go on watching.

so I read it instead.
>> ARTICLE
I just made [a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/1s9x14/your_week_in_anime_week_60/cdvipud) about this in the "Your Week in Anime" thread on /r/TrueAnime as I've finished the show thursday.

Beau-ti-ful show. Heartwarming and endearing show that mixes joyful and emotional struggle incredibly well without ever becoming dull, stale or repetitive during its 50 episodes. The show's dialogue is so simplistic that it becomes intelligent writing, constantly hinting without giving anything away untill the very last episodes. 

It's a kids show made for adults.
>> ARTICLE
Are those presents for [](/s "the dead girl")?

I couldn't watch this show. People who have seen the whole thing tell me it's really good and I don't doubt that. But I can't get past what happens at the end of the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
I actually think the first episode is weak compared to the rest of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
You should.  It is a fantastic drama and a great romance.  Plus the baseball scene are intense.
>> ARTICLE
what anime is this from? 
>> ARTICLE
it's from "cross game"

>> ARTICLE
o... i thought it was a ga... forget it thanks!  
>> ARTICLE
Did the entire manga get made to anime? 
>> ARTICLE
I personally consider Cross Game have the best slice of life I've ever seen in anime.  I know there's definitely more than just the SOL to it but it seriously was beautifully paced.  
>> ARTICLE
Really appreciate someone takes the time to do this. You da real mvp /u/kaverik.

[Why thank you!](http://i.imgur.com/8mJTxWQ.gif) It actually takes not much time to make up the post (usually around an hour). Writing recommendations, on the other hand, takes several hours (especially if you're not native speaker like me), so I'll probably slow down a bit and post one recommendation per week (opposing to two recommendations I used to write).

Edit: My second gold on /r/anime, [thank you a lot!](https://i.imgur.com/SkcFOlj.gifv) The first one was for [Anime by the Letter](http://redd.it/2is12b) series, for [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ih8qe/anime_by_the_letter_znonletter/) post. Anyone still remembers them? Haha

**My favorite submissions of this week** (in no order): [Natsume Yuujinchou](http://redd.it/2ycbn8), [Koi Kaze](http://redd.it/2ylbpu), [Kemono no Souja Erin](http://redd.it/2yx8bx).

**Anime that I personally recommend to watch from this week**: [Kuuchuu Buranko](http://redd.it/2yxl54), [Kyousougiga](http://redd.it/2ykye6), [Nagi no Asukara](http://redd.it/2ym14g).

Special thanks to /u/einherjar81, the only redditor who announced that he would write the recommendation and indeed *have done that*.

Also kudos to /u//u/DakotaK_, who listened to the criticism amd managed to improve his threads over time.

On unrelated note, less and less mainstream shows are featured in these threads. I'll be covering one of the remaining next week, so it's interesting to see what direction [WT!] threads are going to take: will people start to repeat older threads,  or continue to promote lesser known anime? Or will the [WT!] threads die eventually? Will see.

Anyway, thanks for stopping in this thread, and don't forget to leave the feedback!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the thanks, haha.I wish I could announce what series I'd like to write a [WT!] for next, but I'm still deciding... Maybe *Kure-nai*?  I haven't checked if someone wrote one yet, but I doubt it.  
>> ARTICLE
It's open indeed. So should I mention you in the table?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, pencil me in.

Thanks for these round-ups, they're neat!

I'm drafting one for [Honneamise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1034/Ouritsu_Uchuugun:_Honneamise_no_Tsubasa) which I'd like to have up in the next week.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone got any criticisms of my writing? Written 3 WT! threads now and honestly I think they're pretty poorly written in some spots.

Here's a link to each one:

[Gunbuster](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2vx766/wt_big_fan_of_nge_andor_gurren_lagann_just/)

[Neo Getter vs. Shin Getter](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2wwkh1/wt_neo_getter_robo_vs_shin_getter_robo_4_episodes/)

[Mazinkaiser SKL](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2z1r7u/wt_mazinkaiser_skl_2010_3_great_episodes_of/)

I notice I repeat the same phrases a lot. I'm like a scratched record at some points in some of these WT!'s. My vocab isn't exactly very colorful either, might need to include some more variation in what I use. There's lots of spelling errors and gramatical errors in there as well. I think my SKL one is the worst of the bunch because it's just something I threw together quickly for a popcorn show I watched the night before. Will definitely try to improve my next one.

Anything you guys want to add? Or are my WT!'s alright for the most part? I'll take any criticism on board.


>> ARTICLE
Is there an official format that needs to be followed for these? I'm debating doing one for Kaze no Stigma and a push in the right direction would be much appreciated.
>> ARTICLE
The only rule we have is that [WT!] posts should have more than 1500 symbols. Formatting, structure, concept - everything else is up to the author. Check up some threads to get some idea how these posts are usually made up.
>> ARTICLE
is there a possibility to make this thread sticky? 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, but I'll try to message the mods if we can do something about it.
>> ARTICLE
These compilation threads you make are so helpful! Thanks a lot!
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap. I was obsessed with Cross Game in my entire undergrad of college. I hope this show gets really big.
>> ARTICLE
It really is one of the best recent shows. Anyone who doesn't watch it is only doing themselves an injustice. It's so beautifully written and paced. It's also great to see Adachi work in HD.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely love this series.  It is a "warm blanket" anime... enchanting and fun.
>> ARTICLE
Such a great series!

One of the few where the anime inspired me to read the manga (even tho the story was the same)
>> ARTICLE
They were extremely faithful to it, which is how it should be with an Adachi story.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know if it's going to be subbed or dubbed?
>> ARTICLE
99.9% sure it will be subbed. It just finished airing in Japan at the end of March.
>> ARTICLE
is it good compare to major ? i love baseball anime but never heard of touch ?
>> ARTICLE
or cross game
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it's much better than Major. While I love Major, the series has a much better story and the pacing, dialogue, and humor are better as well.

Touch was a manga/anime series of the 80s, created by Mitsuru Adachi who did Cross Game. If you end up liking Cross Game, you'll pretty much like any of his other baseball manga/anime.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like the way they finished off the anime compared to the manga. The manga's way of ending had more of an impact compared to the anime. Leaving the last page (train station) as the last page was beautifully done.
>> ARTICLE
I go LALALALALA in my brain and immediately do other things on the internet to distract myself, trying to make myself forget about it.

I feel like I solve a lot of my problems this way.
>> ARTICLE
Keep watching. If a single spoiler ruined the show in its entirety, then the show probably wasn't that good in the first place
>> ARTICLE
I actively search for spoilers regarding the characters that interest me. If a spoiler is enough to stop you watching/liking, the anime isn't doing a very good job.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like too many people get wrapped up in the spoilers themselves that they forget there's more to it than this twist or that couple getting together. The road there is far more important, imo. 

It's like the whole Snape kills Dumbledore fiasco. Knowing the fact pales in comparison to actually experiencing it because a simple spoiler doesn't give the framing, the mood, the buildup, and fallout of the action, which is really the meat and potatoes of storytelling to me.
>> ARTICLE
This happens to me with like 50% of anime that I watch. I SUCK at avoiding spoilers. 

What I do is just keep watching the show, but with more determination to finish it. I watch it more "aggressively" and get more into the story. If I'm lucky, I eventually get the details of the spoiler mixed up, or just outright forget. Most of the time, I'm still surprised by the ending and still greatly enjoy it. Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination.
>> ARTICLE
I don't care. If the show is any good, ultmately it doesn't matter I found out a character is going to die because they kissed another character you apparently shouldn't kiss if you want to survive.

It's the scene itself that matters, not the knowledge of what happens in it.

I fly around the world clockwise at the speed of light to turn back time. But seriously you have no one to blame but yourself for looking up a spoiler. All you can do now is continue to watch it or come back to it way later once its not fresh in your mind
>> ARTICLE
Cry or deny everything, convincing yourself that its some fanmade BS :D. I went in the denial phase when a cunt book reading friend of a friend blurted out some GoT spoilers. Works until you actually see it happen then you cry some more.
>> ARTICLE
Try to find something to take my mind off of it for a few hours and hope I forget 
>> ARTICLE
First off I spend a few seconds reflecting about what I've done. And afterwards if someone tells me that dude's gonna die, I'll wonder about how will he die and will he actually die. For other spoilers I tend to reflect about them. Sometimes I forget, other times I don't. 
In short, I don't really give a flying fuck, although I'd rather not be spoiled.
>> ARTICLE
Stop watching it for awhile, hoping I forget.  Resume the show when I realize it'll never happen.
>> ARTICLE
Keep watching. Unless it was an article/blogpost in reddit format that was designed solely to spoil me then it probably didn't spoil enough for me to consider dropping the show. And even if i was accidentally spoiled i would ignore it because standard accidental spoilers only spoil 1 thing. Not the whole fuckin show.

Example: [JoJo spoilers] (/s "I was spoiled to how the events in part 3 for DIO's world ended browsing one of the episode discussions. However what that spoiler turned out to be was Jotaro nearly being killed by rolla rolla and how they discovered the secret of the world") all in all not really enough to make me mad and drop the show and await the next Arc
>> ARTICLE
Just keep on trucking enjoy the plot. And by plot I mean "plot".
>> ARTICLE
Depends how big of a spoiler it is. I accidentally spoiled the identities of the Colossal and Armored titans. I'm not too happy about that.
>> ARTICLE
Spoilers dont bother me much, so I just keep watching what I'm watching, as long as I like it...
>> ARTICLE
I once read a Madoka spoiler that i thought had given away the whole ending for me. Fortunately, I managed to get it out of my mind enough to enjoy the ending that actually had nothing to do with that spoiler whatsoever.

So I tend to avoid getting overworked about them.
>> ARTICLE
Just forget it, watch another anime, preferablly a good one. Let it amaze u, then u will forget about the spoiler
>> ARTICLE
I shrug and continue watching. That said, it is rare that I am accidentally spoiled as I tend to go out of my way to find and read spoilers for everything that I watch.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching death note AFTER reading about ending and watching the ending on youtube. Still enjoyed the series. The entirety was so good that the ending was meaningless, even more so that it wasn't that unexpected and the most important part of the show. It is the same with CG
>> ARTICLE
I kick a Kitten, then go and watch the entire series.
>> ARTICLE
When the anime is based on manga, I can't resist to sometimes read what's going to happen next. When I do, might as well read the manga to the latest chapter as well, it didn't ruin the anime though
>> ARTICLE
I get super mad for five minutes, then i just accept it. A recent example would be [Trigun.](/s "I was almost finished around episode 22 or 23. I heard about the movie, so i looked it up on IMDB. I went the Q&A section to see if it was a side story, or a sequel. The exact words it used were " This movie is a side story because wolfwood is alive." I was ready to smash my tablet into the wall. ")

>> ARTICLE
I'm so mad for five minutes right now!
>> ARTICLE
If I was planning on watching it, I just forget about it until I come across it again. Then I watch it spoiler-free! (Due note that this may cause you to miss out on awesome anime this way)
>> ARTICLE
Me: Watching opening of anime on YouTube than looks at side bar and sees a clip of the anime and it's "so and so's death"  
Me: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!
>> ARTICLE
Cry.
>> ARTICLE
I can't resist reading spoilers on this sub even for a show I'm about to watch. Then I just avoid watching the shoe until I forget
>> ARTICLE
...stop looking up spoilers. But in cross game in particular the romance is such a small part of the REALLY FUCKING GREAT story it doesn't really ruin much. Seriously one of my favorites and if you would stop it because of this I'd hate you forever.

Ahaha, I'm going to keep going with it for sure. Should be done by the end of the week.

It is mildly amusing to me that A:tLA is  (anime in Japanese), but not an anime (in English).

Because we Americans are picky as Fuck. RWBY is even considered an anime in Japan because they don't give a shit about cartoon vs anime wars over there. If it's animated then it's anime by default

Yes, but anime is the japanese word we use to describe japanese animation only. Its not about cartoon vs anime, its about making clear what is what.

Holy cow Gate

That looks like a grand case of hype-train and airing bias.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Also Haikyuu at 9th, OPM at 3rd, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu at 73, Death Parade at 79, Naruto at 89 and One Piece at 59.

Definitely strong bias towards shows that are currently airing. 
>> ARTICLE
One piece..  Strong bias? Bruh if it finished airing it'd be rated a lot higher
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. I'm not sure about that. The story is great but the pacing for the anime is horseshit.

I love the story. However I can't give a shit about the story if it takes 50 episodes to complete an arc.

At this rate Oda might die before we see the ending of the story.
>> ARTICLE
It's not what you think though, just how it'd be rated. Fk the pacing agreed
>> ARTICLE
lmao Haikyuu is pretty damn good, it's pretty high up even on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
OPM is good as well. Doesn't mean they're not overrated by recency bias.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's cool how Avatar, RWBY, and similar shows are allowed. This and allowing for scores of X/100 are all the only things I've liked about Hummingbird so far.
>> ARTICLE
You must be thinking about another site, I don't think Hummingbird has x/100
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if I'm more happy with Bebop in the top 10 or salty AF that OPM is above Hunter x Hunter...so conflicted.

[](#WRYYY)

It's only natural for the greatest anime of all time to be above a generic battle shounen [](#smuglancer)

Shirobako, not on the list, for shame Hummingbird.

How did Gate and Assassination Classroom jump so much?

I think it's new season bias personally.

Honey and Clover (rank 99 on MAL)

Detective Conan (rank 98 on MAL)

Mononoke (rank 64 on MAL)

Slam Dunk (rank 55 on MAL)

Nana (rank 50 on MAL)

How many have you seen out of the hummingbird list?

I have 50/100. Exactly half.
>> ARTICLE
68 seen or attempted, compared to 53 from the corresponding condensed MAL Top 100. Maybe I should switch over.
>> ARTICLE
only 13/100
>> ARTICLE
38/100
>> ARTICLE
Next we'll get to see an adjusted score combining the MAL and Hummingbird to see where a lot of shows even out.

Seems like Fate/Zero jumped the most & Gintama (instead of multiple shows) went lower.

Why does Hummingbird, an anime website, have series that aren't anime?

I don't care about the random shows that don't belong, but Magi at #71 is just insulting. No way is that show any good at all. What kind of person actually gives that trash a good rating
>> ARTICLE
I liked magi... :(
>> ARTICLE
There's nothing wrong with liking it, but it's a bad show on almost every level. It was like a poor man's Avatar or FMA.
>> ARTICLE
How was it "bad"? It was pretty, had some nice characters, a kinda unique setting and some pretty welldone action scenes. It was a bit childish sure, but I don't think it was bad...
>> ARTICLE
The pacing was really bad, for starters. All the arcs were paced poorly. The earlier episodes were just rushed, and didn't allow you to form any sort of connection to the characters. The later arcs were drawn out and dragged on to unreasonable lengths.

The characters are some of the worst I've seen. Obviously this was to cater towards a young audience, but that's no excuse for having poorly written backstories, and shocking character exposition. Alibaba is probably the character I hate the most (save Kirito). He was written to be juvenile and immature, as were most of the characters, which honestly reflects quite poorly on the writers.

The plot was not well thought out, and was unsatisfying, especially compared to the superior Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Steins;gate, saw like ep 11 or something when it was about to get real.. had to finish and it already like 2am.. and I ahd to finish it and work at 8am.. fuck.

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Makes it worse that I've seen the 2003 series and the movie, so it's just completely over for me.
>> ARTICLE
NHK ni Youkoso simply because it emotionally hit me REALLY hard. Oh, and it lasted for a month.

Gotta be Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. I binged it all in one night and it hit me hard. It makes it even worse when you relate to a character. Every victory of theirs hits so much more, but the same goes for the failures :(

Hello, 

My biggest case of PAD was probably after I finished Shinsekai Yori. It was one of the first "mature" anime that I had watched and I struggled to find some else like it for awhile. 
>> ARTICLE
Seconding SSY. It affected me so much that I couldn't watch anything but light comedy fluff for weeks after I finished binging it.
>> ARTICLE
* Sakuraso no Pet na Kanojo
* Nagi no Asukara

Can't really decide between the two. :/
>> ARTICLE
I second Sakurasou. The ending felt hopeful, but empty enough for me to get depressed.
>> ARTICLE
I was about to say the same, but i'd prefer Sakurasou
>> ARTICLE
It may have been that it was one of the first anime I've watched, but Steins;Gate left me defeated. I thought the relationship between Kurisu and Olabe was so beautiful, and that final shot when they met again made me tear up. I watched the OVA and movie right after, but it just wasn't the same as the series. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed 100%, Steins;Gate hit me pretty damn hard as well, it lasted for maybe a week where it was all I could think about
>> ARTICLE
The three days or so after I finished Steins;Gate are the only time I remember being truly depressed. I didn't find anything fun anymore, I even quit watching anime for a little while. That's why it's my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
If you liked Cross Game, I think you would like "Touch" anime aswell. They are both written by the same author Adachi Mitusuru. They are both about baseball, romance and "growing up". They are similar in both characters and the feeling that the anime gives you. The downside is that it has 101 episodes and a little bit older animation. But if you liked Cross Game you should give it a shot. 
>> ARTICLE
Yup, it's on my list. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann gave me PAD while simultaneously helping me get out of my actual depression, which is why it's characters are forever ingrained into my brain as my favorite cast next to Hajime No Ippo and JoJo Part 4
>> ARTICLE
I think it was K-on!

But that might have been the moe withdrawal, not PAD. It was so bad that it made K-on! the first anime I've ever rewatched.
>> ARTICLE
After being used to watch One Piece for 2 months straight, it feels so wrong that I'm caught up and there's not much to watch besides movies and specials. Re-reading is the best I can do to cope without taking much time.
>> ARTICLE
So you caught up with OP in 2 months... How much did you watch per day? I've been thinking of watching OP but been hesitant since it's soooooo long :I
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty inconsistent how much I watch per day. Sometimes it's 4 hours, 3 hours, 12 hours, 1 episode or none at all. All I know is the last 3 weeks I binged quite a bit per day (at least 4 hours).
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion. I ended up watching the original series and EoE in one day. The feeling was indescribable to say the least. 
>> ARTICLE
CG R2 left me depressed that very few characters realized the greatest plan that Lelouch would ever pull, and there are very few other anime where I get frustrated because the rest of the world doesn't truly know the greatness and depth of talent the MC has. 

The other 2 shows that left me with PAD were Plastic Memories and Anohana. This one was pretty big because I watched both these shows within like 48 hours so I was pretty much void of any emotion afterwards cause it had all come out while watching 
>> ARTICLE
I read theories about the last scene for days after finishing R2...
>> ARTICLE
Hell, WA2 did a good job at this. It left me devasted for two weeks to the point I couldn't watch anything.
>> ARTICLE
The only anime to give me PADS is Aria The Origination. After everything else, I went right back to clearing out my backlog without a hitch. But with The Origination, I just pecked and glanced through a bunch of meaningless shorts and specials until I was able to get my groove back. 

Not LoGH. Not Cowboy Bebop. Not White Album 2. Not Shirobako. Not Clannad. Nothing has done it to me like Aria The Origination. It is the true queen of the genre, and one of the greatest anime of all time.
>> ARTICLE
I know this one isn't as popular as others but recently. 

Ef: a tale of memories and
Ef: a tale of melodies

Completely destroyed me. So good yet so sad.
I even liked it more than Clannad because they were just 24 episodes instead of 24 each.

Also, the addition of changing the OP each episode made it so that the final one actually hit the spot.
>> ARTICLE
Currently Yuru Yuri.
>> ARTICLE
Mirai Nikki
   
I didn't watch the OVA until a week after. It was real depressing during that week though. Definitely not a happy ending. 
>> ARTICLE
Between Toradora, Clannad, and Welcome to the NHK....I couldn't tell you.  Though I  just finished "The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan" and it has me feeling pretty down right now.

Amnesia :(

Plastic Memories
>> ARTICLE
after seeing the love live movie, I really didn't know what to do with my life
>> ARTICLE
Oreimo. I was left in such a funk. That ending was on my mind for days.
>> ARTICLE
Aside from some that have already been mentioned, Ergo Proxy. I seriously considered rewatching it right after it was over.
>> ARTICLE
Jumping in to say I watched this around a month or two ago and loved every second. Will watch it again soon enough, it was a pleasant surprise and I'm glad I found out about it!
>> ARTICLE
I have to say that I really enjoyed this anime, despite its ridiculous premise looking back on it.
>> ARTICLE
ENO-SHIMA-DOOON!!!!!  

Tsuritama may seem rather eccentric at first, especially Haru, but past the first couple of episodes, the series becomes much more enjoyable.  
Once you get to know Yuki and Haru, the series becomes much more sincere and endearing, while keeping a lighthearted atmosphere and never failing to bring a smile to your face. Keep an open mind while watching Tusritama, and you will definitely be rewarded.

One of my favorite anime hands-down. I watched it for the first time last year during my summer break, and am now making it a tradition to watch it each summer. Still listen to the music sometimes just because it's so catchy.

To OP: Really well-written WT, going to read your other ones too since I'm currently searching for more anime to watch.

Tried watching it last year. Felt really dumb, and I couldn't finish it

Hey, just caught a few typos:


>adults who grew up on the **a**forementioned series

Forgot the "a".

>This category exists for two purposes: separating non-violent action comedies (NGNL, Shokugeki) from the rest and **~~shwocasing~~ showcasing** a few "guilty pleasure" series

Just a little mixup with the spelling.

>all the other sports series are bundled together in a **~~subbranch~~ sub**-**branch** of "Action" 

At least I think it's spelled this way (hyphen doesn't show up that well in bold lol)

>So same goes for things like sci-fi, mecha, magical girls, sports. Byproduct of the design choice. 

Maybe just reword this part to seem like a more "normal sentence", was kinda confusing to read at first

>And even though it **~~bacame~~ became** apparent to me some **~~goo d~~** time ago 

Just a minor fix, and I don't think "good" is really necessary.

>Note that my favourite horror (Shinsekai yori) is in the Drama section.

:]

>"Anime as a LN advertisement" is a plague, and **that move** allowed me to build a group that excluded many popular ongoing series.

Maybe reword "that move", was a little unclear at first.

>Drama is designed with **an** adult audience in mind.

You could also make it "audiences" and not put in "an".

>Why isn't romance a separate category? **Mostly because** popular romance

I think you could change the bold part to any one of "Because", "Most", or "Because most" and it would sound less awkward.

>The idea of using thumbnails came to me after **my recommendation charts made in the meantime** went viral on imgur and 9gag.

I think that this part could be reworded a bit for clarity. 


And finally there might be a few words that are a little questionable/weird like "compartmentalization".

Sorry that the things are a bit out of order, it was just the things that caught my eye after skimming it a couple times. Keep up the good work, this looks great!

I guess it's actually easier with the mobile controls, as you can easily adjust the zoom and scroll - on a PC zooming out might be actually more difficult if the scrollwheel moves the picture.

I guess publishing the Imgur link, not the direct link, will fix this issue for the PC crowd.
>> ARTICLE
Nit pick: I'm not sure the comment beside Fate/Zero and F/SN should remain. It has nothing to do with the overall chart, recommending (mostly) new people anime to watch. Perhaps if it was saying a viewing order, but instead it is about a Visual Novel and spoilers of a not-aired show. Also it barely fits in the space neatly. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking about throwing away this whole disclaimer and the UBW box, and using the space to squeeze in Paranoia Agent.

I guess I can add my justification of choosing F/Z start over UBW start to the long description of the whole chart.
>> ARTICLE
As a near-total beginner before I ran across your chart (Cowboy Bebop and FMA, basically), the note about F/Z really helped me actually. The Fate franchise layout is rather bewildering to a newcomer, especially one with zero experience with visual novels. Two different versions of UBW, Zero, the original F/SN, something called Heaven's Feel everyone keeps talking about, VN, various spinoffs, etc. Having an idea for a starting point is very helpful.

that said, if you do toss UBW, you could probably fit the note about starting point in one line under F/Z.



UNRELATED: If you'd be alright with it, I'm considering making a dub-friendly version of your flowchart. I'm primarily a dub watcher (don't shoot me), and looking up every series on MAL to figure out if it had a dub was tedious. I was thinking a simple flag icon on the corner of boxes with a dub, and something else to signify a particularly good dub (Cowboy Bebop, Steins;Gate). thoughts?

edit: obviously full credit would remain with you.

>> ARTICLE
I personally really enjoyed the Fate/Zero dub, I thought the voices were really well chosen.

The Devil is a Part-Timer is such a joy to listen to in English, I love it.

The World God Only Knows was also well done, I think. I never watched all of it dubbed, though.

Also, Toradora and WataMote. I thought both were good dubs, and would recommend them to friends.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately I really haven't watched enough to cover your entire list, so hopefully others will chime in, but here goes. Only series I've actually watched. I've bolded dubs I found particularly good. 

**Starter area:** Basically everything here has a decent or good dub. No real need to mark it beyond a general note. Special recognition to Cowboy Bebop, Steins;Gate and Death Note for their dubs however. (Death Note getting Alessandro Juliani of Battlestar Galactica fame as L was a fantastic surprise.) EDIT: Shingeki no Bahamut does not have a dub yet, and Mushishi is only partially dubbed.

**Action:**

* **FLCL** - Excellent dub, also helps with keeping up on what's happening on screen.
* Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom
* **Cowboy Bebop** - as aforementioned, very good.
* Shakugan no Shana - Dub changes after S1, studio change. S2/S3 are the same company. Nearly every voice is swapped out. Both studios did well though.
* **Baccano!** - Excellent dub. The cast handles the 30s Chicago accents very well.
* FMA Brotherhood
* Sword Art Online
* Log Horizon - S2 dub not out yet.
* Attack on Titan

**Comedy:**
Sorry. I haven't really watched any comedies. I'll get there eventually.

**Slice of Life:**

* Spice & Wolf

^...see ^above, ^haven't ^watched ^much ^here ^either. ^S&W's ^Lawrence ^is ^J. ^Michael ^Tatum ^though, ^also ^Okabe ^of ^Steins;Gate. ^One ^of ^the ^best ^English ^VA.

**Drama:**

* Shinsekai Yori
* Ghost in the Shell: SAC
* Koi Kaze

^^annnnnd ^^not ^^much ^^here ^^either. ^^Only ^^been ^^watching ^^anime ^^for ^^about ^^six ^^months ^^really.

**Thriller/Horror:**

* Another
* **Steins;Gate** - Best dub I've seen, and one I watched both Japanese and English versions for. I think the English version vastly improves on the Japanese, and in particular makes Daru a worthwhile character by actually sounding intelligent, and therefore justifying why they keep him around despite all his perverted humour. Movie dub not out yet.
* Psycho-Pass - Movie dub not out yet.
* Elfen Lied - ^Didn't ^really ^enjoy ^it, ^but ^the ^dub ^was ^good. 
* Tokyo Ghoul - ^Same ^as ^Elfen, ^didn't ^enjoy, ^but ^the ^dub ^was ^good.
* **Fate/Zero** - Good dub, and for people running through the Fate anime franchise, they do keep the same VAs across F/Z and UBW. UBW S2 dub is not out yet though.
* **Neon Genesis Evangelion/End of EVA** - Particular note is Asuka, who I feel did way better than the Japanese. In addition, since the English VA is fluent in German, all German lines from Asuka sound very natural and well done. The Rebuild films also keep mostly the same VAs, as a bonus.
* **Madoka Magica** - This one might be biased from loving the series, but I think they did well at capturing the emotions. Sayaka in particular.
* **Death Note** - See note above.

**Off the chart:** 

* I swear Death Parade was on this chart before? Maybe I missed it. Either way, good dub.
* Jormungand - Not a great series, but a very good dub. Bonuses for various Tarantino references.
* Selector Infected WIXOSS - S2 dub not out yet.

there we go. Hopefully others will chime in for series I haven't watched. I wouldn't want to give a recommendation when I haven't actually watched it.
>> ARTICLE
Do we really need dub indicators in the big chart? How would you mark them?
>> ARTICLE
Well, I don't think you necessarily need them. Given the vitriol thrown around at dub-watchers quite often, you might want to leave them off entirely. I mainly wanted to throw one together for the dub-focused communities like /r/animedubs.

However, your chart is mainly focused on introducing newcomers to anime. I've found that one of the biggest early hurdles for people is getting used to watching heavily subtitled shows. Very few US shows end up with any significant amount of subtitling. Lost is the only major US show I can think of that had episodes with heavy subtitling, and that was only for certain episodes (Korean-heavy Sun and Jin episodes). Some newcomers might find watching in their native language to be an easier transition into anime. I definitely did.

Please note though, I'm not discussing the quality of dubs or dubs vs subs at all here, just the idea that the transition might be easier. That argument is a lot longer and more nuanced and subjective.

For how to mark them, I'd likely just put a little British flag marker in the corner of a box with a decent dub, and possibly some better marker for a particularly good dub. I'm not sure on the better marker, my original thought was just a little green checkmark, but I think that would clash a bit with the style of the rest of the chart. Tiny flag icons are pretty standard for indicating language. British instead of USA because USA technically has no national language, and internet web design standards use British flags for ENG.

[Here's](https://i.gyazo.com/da0d02089b3e51600042b21c549c0d30.png) a possibility I just threw together. 5 minutes work, though.

edit: another thought, for a series with only a partial dub, a half flag, cut diagonally. If that one looks good, I can throw another sample together.
>> ARTICLE
No way. I'm even less convinced now that I've seen these flags. They are too distracting.

To a non-native English speaker, English dubs are completely irrelevant. Aside from few cases when they're better than the Japanese one (FMAB, Bebop, Panty and Stocking) there's next to no demand for them, as we watch series subbed anyway, and usually it's easier to follow English subs than an English dub without subs in out language.

I'd like to invite you to collaborate with me in the creation of the version with English indicators - PM me and I'll give you access to the file. The flags will just be a separate layer. I'll put a link to the dub indicators in the description.

Yeah, I don't really have much graphic design experience. That was just something I threw together quickly. I'm mostly hoping someone much better than me at this sees the conversation and swoops in to rescue this. Until then though, I'm definitely willing to put together a rough one. PM sent.

I realize it's been there since the the beginning, so saying it now probably means less, but personally I really dislike the Hunger Games tag leading to Fate/Zero. Battle Royal is a better, more general tag.  
Whether you keep the UBW box or not, I think the "Outstanding animation" comment should go. Not because I disagree, but because it's just unnecessary hyping.

People new to anime are too young to know Battle Royale rather than Hunger Games.

>The Kokoro Connect box has now "(literally)" added because that's what the series is after all. I could add a "BEST GIRL WINS" disclaimer under it, would it help? If you're still against "Forced drama", please suggest alternatives.
  
  
I don't know if I like the (literally) and I really wouldn't like "BEST GIRL WINS". For one, it could be considered a spoiler and for another, who best girl is debatable for some people (Those people are *wrong*, but different strokes for different folks).   
  
As for a recommendation for something else, would you consider putting it under the DRAMA genre instead of COMEDY? I feel it fits better there, and then it can go DRAMA -> Genre? -> Romance -> Theme? -> Learning to love (and then underneath that, "Others... and yourself")  
   
I think, more than forced drama, that is the overarching theme of Kokoro Connect, and if someone's going to get into it/enjoy it, that will be the reason why.

Under the Slice of Life box is the following description :

>When you want to explore what emotions can anime appeal to.

That 'can' seems very oddly placed to me. I suggest putting it after the word 'anime'. You will then have:

>When you want to explore what emotions anime can appeal to. 

That makes more sense to me and is more appealing, too.

A couple of questions:

* Is the word "feat" under "How stupid can it get?" supposed to be something else?

* Would it be possible to add a way to search for anime title? An alphabetized list on a separate slide, perhaps? It may also make it feasible to cross-reference shows that fall under multiple categories like "Pretty Cure".

"feat." is short for "featuring". Mind the dot.

>> ARTICLE
I like it :) You're doing a grand job! I quite like the change from "Are you ready to turn critical thinking off?" but I don't know why you've said "with obvious flaws" prior to that - everything has flaws.

In my honest opinion this doesn't do those shows justice. I think the best way to go about this would be have in the blue box something a long the lines of "What kind of theme?" then in green have things like:
&nbsp;

"Power giving clothes" -> KLK
&nbsp;

"Craziness - Watch it twice" -> FLCL
&nbsp;

"Foodgasm" -> Shokugeki no Souma
&nbsp;

So a bit more description. Some of the things you've said already work with that idea, like with Shokugeki and Highschool of the Dead.

On another note, under SoL -> Setting, could we also get *Hibike! Euphonium*? I may be bias, because I love it. But I love it because I was in band, and it portrays band politics and life so well. So I believe many other people who were in a school concert band who may not have seen anime would love it too!

&nbsp;
Please consider these ideas :3

Thanks for your hard work!

I'll think about that note, but I want to put a clear disclaimer that the guilty pleasure section is just some dumb fun. Also I'll stay with the current caption for KlK - not only is it impossible to accurately describe what KlK is in such short manner, but also it's important for the "Not entirely" caption below.

Hibike - there is hardly any way to expand the "cute girls doing cute things" branch, so the only way is to mention it in a footnote below Beck. Nice to know it reflects the band life appropriately, my musician sisters (solists) are a bit skeptical about the way Japanese schools handle music.
>> ARTICLE
I have to second a vote for Euphonium. It's got to be the finest show that Kyoto Animation has ever produced, and despite its leisurely pace, it's a very intricately told and executed character story. It could go on the Drama-y end of SoL, or on the SoL-y end of Drama, though it's really low-stakes compared to people putting their hearts (or more) on the line.

**Actual Novels**

Full novel adaptations are the rarest of the possibilities I'll be covering here, but they really, really, really shouldn't be.

Actual full-length novels are possibly the medium best-suited to anime adaptation, and in fact I'd argue that no medium is more suited to successfully recreating a novel than anime is. They just match up on so many critical variables: they're both long-form narratives that are generally separated into smaller subsections, they both involve a creator having absolute creative control (unlike the sitcom, or even film, where your ability to manipulate the frame and conjure the unreal is significant, but never infinite), and they both have a critical emphasis on and ability to manipulate mood and tone. Most novels are extended, character-focused narratives that successfully create a strong voice (either through a character or the narrator's own voice) and contain several distinct plot strands that reflect off each other and ultimately present a number of consistent and well-explored themes. A novelist can conjure literally any scenario he wishes, and have the reader take it for granted as the truth of that world (as long as he doesn't betray his own truth through inconsistent characterization or world-building). The mood and feeling a book evokes in the reader is the result of both conscious narrative choices and the collective impact of the language chosen and the style of writing used. *All of these things* translate *absolutely naturally* into anime, and reflect the extraordinarily similar strengths of that very distinct medium. Frankly, it's crazy to me that more novels aren't adapted into anime  although considering the sales numbers of Shinsekai Yori, perhaps those producers aren't so crazy after all.

I did not know that Hyouka was based on a novel.

It actually makes a lot of sense to me now. I wondered how the story managed to stay so coherent even with there being so many subplots, but that's perfectly logical if based on an actual novel instead of a series of light novels.
>> ARTICLE
_Hyouka_ is actually 5 novels. Though having watched the anime, I can't imagine they're very thick novels or much different from light novels.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, unless they did a lot of cutting when writing the script for the anime.

They're different from light novels, though, in that the stories are not that connected to each other. Sure, there's some referencing to the other stories chronologically, but not nearly as much as in light novels. To put it in an only slightly incorrect way: 5 light novels in a series tell 1 story, 5 novels in a series tell 5 stories.

Sorry, I got mad right there. Nitpick: [Visual Novels](http://vndb.org/g145?fil=tagspoil-0.tag_inc-145;m=0;o=d;s=rating) are not [essentially branching stories.](http://vndb.org/g709?fil=tagspoil-0.tag_inc-709;m=0;o=d;s=rating)

Now I'll continue reading now. The post is good so far but I feel you are a bit unfamiliar with the VN scene.

EDIT: I agree with what you wrote under Visual Novels. But you should specify that you are talking about gal-game VNs, which are a subgenre of the VN medium. Many of the top rated VNs have linear narratives with no branches (or accessory ones to create game over situations).

From what I heard, Robotics;Notes did that.

Which are also known as Kinetic Novels.
>> ARTICLE
Excellent comment, and I want to respond to several points here. Unfortunately I'm at a concert atm, so I'm just placeholding this for the moment. This should hopefully be substantive in the next couple hours.

-edit-

Yeah, I'm definitely not very experienced with the specifics of the VN scene, and it's actually surprising to me that a lot of the most popular ones have no branches. But obviously this makes telling a single coherent story much more feasible, and I guess the medium is just as distinctive for its pacing, general story length, and conversation focus as it is for allowing player agency. And yeah, my points about VN adaptations clearly don't apply to non-branching stories - those would obviously have far fewer issues of adaptation than the subgenres I'm actually talking about.

Would Fate/Stay Night count in this category? I'm curious because I'm actually starting to play through that one, and frankly don't want to screw up in some way that will result in an "incorrect" narrative - if I know my choices are more about single scenes or dialogues than full paths or storylines, it'll be a lot less stressful.

Regarding Robotics;Notes, they *sort of* do that, but they don't go quite far enough. The digressions into individual character stories are still too obviously diversions from the main narrative - for example, they do a decent job of making Frau's storyline plot-relevant, but her character's emotional journey very obviously takes center stage for exactly 3-4 episodes, then is sidelined again. And you could entirely remove Junna without affecting the story in any significant way, which is never a good sign.
>> ARTICLE
>The fit all arcs into one narrative approach to VN adaptation not only results in a wandering and unfocused narrative, but it also generally results in an unrelatable superman of a main character, unless the character's wanderings are somehow related to the main themes and point of the show

This is exactly what the omnibus format (e.g. Yosuga no Sora) is trying to eliminate. There is certainly some disconnect (woah, when did this arc end?) while going from one branch to the next, but I believe that's an inherent problem with the VN as well if you have multiple playthroughs that overlap one another.
>> ARTICLE
Amagami SS had a pure omnibus format. Each arc started the story from 0.

But **Yosuga no Sora had an "hybrid" omnibus format**, a clever and more complex version of the one Amagami used. 

There were "common route" episodes at first, and then "route episodes". When a route was concluded, the story picked up when the last "common" episode left off. Those common route episodes were cannon to the later routes and all of them were canon to the final route. 

The splash cut at the start of each EP with the name and number of the EP had a mark (a letter iirc) to indicate which route that episode belonged to.

Just found on wikipedia:

>**Episode list**

>(In brackets are the episode numbers for each arc, e.g. (A3) is the third episode in Akira's arc. Legend: A-Akira, K-Kazuha, N-Nao, S-Sora.)

>The arcs' episodes presented in order are: 

>K:1-4; A:1-2,5-6; N:1,7-9; S:1,7,10-12

Why is this great?

Kazuha route: 4 episodes

Akira route: 4 episodes

Nao route: 4 episodes

Sora route: 5 episodes

**They managed to fit 17 EPs in a 12 EP anime**.
>> ARTICLE
>They managed to fit 17 EPs in a 12 EP anime.

That's a very interesting way of looking at it and I think it's actually correct. At first, I was jarred by the fact that the show backtracked to Episode 2 after the first arc(I didn't know it was a VN adaptation), but when it was all over, I definitely noticed that the arcs felt longer than 3 episodes per person, except for Akira. Her arc felt a little shorter than the others, but that seems to be because of how it was split differently than the other routes.


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, if you want to adapt each route of a VN and remain faithful to their original storylines, this just seems like the obviously best solution.
>> ARTICLE
Certain VNs do make for a good story when it isn't put into a linear narrative in anime. I haven't watched all of Higurashi so I don't know if it eventually does have some sort of overarching plotline, but from what I saw it was a collection of different scenarios - when I first learned what a VN was, I instantly thought Higurashi. However I think that might tie in with what you were talking about manga, what good comes from adapting it into an anime if it's essentially the same, all that'd change would be the variety of viewers because plenty of people watch anime but won't read manga/VNs.
>> ARTICLE
Higurashi is a kinetic visual novel, meaning that there are no choices to be made - it's essentially like reading a book, but with sprites acting the described events out in the background. As a single coherent narrative it obviously lends itself well to an anime adaptation (the Higurashi adaptation does have its own problems, but they aren't inherent to the medium so I won't talk about them here), but then, it doesn't have to deal with the issues inherent in adapting most visual novels. The vast majority, such as the cited example of Clannad, don't have any repeating arcs or Weird Time Shit going on that allow them to make the transition from VN to anime so easily - they're just stories with multiple (and often equally valid) paths to take branching from a single starting point, and this is what causes problems. Clannad (I'm running with this, because it's probably the most well-known example) isn't just the story of Tomoya and Nagisa - Kyou and Tomoyo and Fuuko and Kotomi and Yukine and Misae and everyone else in there as well, the whole collection of individual branching stories brought together, makes up the Clannad Experience, and the real question when adapting a VN (which Higurashi sidesteps due to its kinetic structure) is "How do you capture all of that in one storyline?".
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I understand. I myself have never played a VN before so I wouldn't know (I was citing the Higurashi because I was led to believe Higurashi was like the others where it has different branching paths), but that does make much more sense to me. Thankyou for explaining to me how it works out so well. It does make me wonder, how does the plot of a VN >> anime adaptation work? Do they ever just focus on one single path, or try to clash it together some how while focusing on Nagisa like I imagine Clannad did?

I should probably just start playing a VN and get it over with so I learn more about the medium instead of reading about it, but I'm always intimidated when I hear the amount of time you have to put into it.
>> ARTICLE
Probably the main unique aspect of VNs is that *typically* (but not always), characters and motivations stay the same, and the only difference is how the main characters' choices affect the story.  Tsukihime does this *really* well, where repeated playthroughs give you a deeper and wider understanding of what was really going on during even the first playthrough.  So rather than branching paths, it's more like quantum paths, where everything that you learn is true, only your own position in the plot changes.

EDIT: For a very different example, if you've played Dragon Age, remember how you can choose different origins?  All of those characters exist in any game, the only change is which character Duncan is in place to rescue and take in as a warden.  If you choose city elf origin there's still a nobleman's son who gets his castle sacked, but since Duncan saved you instead, the nobleman simply dies in the attack.  That's the kind of plotting that VNs can do constantly and almost no other form of storytelling can.
>> ARTICLE
That seems like a fantastic trick - making the player's role as a catalyst only visible across multiple playthroughs is brilliant. And that's another thing that makes adaptation so tricky - when art uses the specific strengths of its medium so well and in such a fundamental way, successful adaptation becomes almost impossible.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't aware Higurashi was a kinetic novel, but I agree with all of this stuff. Visual novels are an interesting case study in how narrative is supposed to work, and what makes something a game. I have very limited experience with them (basically just Katawa Shoujo and Narcissu), but even between those two there were a lot of interesting questions about how stories are told. With Katawa Shoujo, it seemed like once you chose your route, any remaining questions were basically asking, "Do you understand the underlying theme of this story?" And you wouldn't think questions like that would result in a strong personal attachment to the stories (as in, answering that question doesn't make it *your* story), but somehow I felt that tiny amount of agency resulted in a disproportionate connection to the text. It's a really interesting way to establish a connection with the audience, and I assume a lot of visual novels play with the fact that even as simple a choice as choosing one story out of five possible stories can create a more personal experience for the audience, despite them not having any real agency *within* that story.
>> ARTICLE
You make an interesting point about the nature of choices in a VN. It looks like I've played a few more than you, and you do a fantastic job of boiling down the elements of almost any romance VN.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, what you're saying about the player's connection to the story is certainly true. To take the example of Katawa Shoujo, when I played it I viewed it as though I were in place of Hisao, and when I was given a decision, I responded to it in the way that I would in reality (I don't know if everyone plays visual novels like this, but I try to). That connected me to the story because, in a way, whether I saw the Good End, whether I 'passed the test', was in itself a test of whether I was good enough to have succeeded in that same situation in real life. When I made a decision, I put myself and my entire worldview on the line, and when I ended up with Hanako and Lilly's Bad Ends, I lost them for real. That risk, that constant possibility of failure and sense of personal achievement it brings with success, is lost in an anime adaptation. You're not trying to win someone's heart or obtain the Holy Grail or whatever any more, you're watching someone else do it in a way you can't influence. There's no danger of them screwing up and failing halfway through. Everything that goes wrong for them is required to by the plot, and you know deep down that they're guaranteed to make it to the end of the story because they have to in order for you, the viewer, to experience it. There's no personal stake in their success or failure, because you can't influence what they do or the decisions they make and therefore their actions and decisions aren't *yours*. Even though ultimately your role in a visual novel is tiny, you still decide how it all pans out. That's something that anime, as a non-interactive medium, simply can't replicate, and a critical aspect of visual novels that's inevitably lost on adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
>I don't know if everyone plays visual novels like this, but I try to

Hisao doesn't such a defined personality and that's one of the reasons why Katawa Shoujo gets criticized by more experienced "players/readers". Self-insertion (putting yourself as the MC) is acceptable for the erotic eroges or the fluff "feel-good" moeges, with MCs so hollow that they don't even have a face. Vets prefer more defined characters and little agency from the reader, good example is Saya no Uta.

PD: I know this is not the technical definition of self-insertion but that's what people call it in the VN scene.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you're giving KS quite enough credit here - Hisao's personality is actually the focus of the Rin and Hanako routes, for example, and most branches offer a vastly different personality for whatever's best-suited to the themes of that route. They even play with agency as narrative tool a bit there, in that the only way to get Rin's route is to pretty much burn all other bridges, and the kind of Hisao who would do that is the kind of person that route is about.

But I agree his personality is not intended to overwhelm the player's own investment in their decisions - things like the Hanako good/bad end are clearly aimed at the audience directly, not just Hisao as a character. It's a weird balancing act, and they definitely avoid making him *too* distinctive for a reason.

Plus I just need to play more VNs in general to actually have truly informed opinions about this stuff.
>> ARTICLE
If you want to venture into VNs I would like to give you a recommendation, Chaos;Head. There's a couple reasons for this, It features a very well defined character(Who you might be able to identify yourself with depending on how much of an anime-freak you are.), It features only two routes with the true route being the one you get railroaded to unless you pick very specific choices and it's an example of a terrible adaption. 
>> ARTICLE
I think you're getting at something really fundamental here about the general storytelling power of interactive media. That "risk" is the key - you are not "safe" within the story, and your own decisions and personality are being laid bare and judged to a lesser or greater extent within any art that involves audience agency. I feel there's an interesting push-pull here, where increasing the amount of player agency allowed increases the immersion and strength of that "risk", but decreasing it allows for greater narrative control... and then there's possibly a risk of having the audience be paralyzed by too much choice, or be given too much rope and thus lose their connection with the core themes and emotions the work is trying to create.

I think the game Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a great example of another way these tricks can be used - the game gives the player all the classic "tools" of a horror movie (slowly opening or barricading doors, leaning around corners, turning on lights), and forces them to perform the actions of a classic horror movie, increasing the intensity through the absence of that distancing, directed "safety".

Player agency as a vehicle for thematic storytelling or emotional/visceral resonance could easily be the topic of another egregiously long write-up.
>> ARTICLE
I think do that the "judging" of one's personality through the decisions they make can certainly be a very powerful tool when handled correctly. The issue is that it's often hampered by gimmicks or aids for the player such as, say, Mass Effect's binary morality system, where in the event of any serious moral quandary the player can just pick the 'good' option (although Mass Effect actually had a golden opportunity to challenge this convention by having Renegade decisions lead ultimately to better long-term outcomes, but, in my opinion, wasted it). If the goal is to immerse the player by encouraging them to reflect themselves in the decisions they make, their options have to be ambiguously-phrased enough not to scare them away from an unpleasant choice they might otherwise have opted for or, conversely, to stop them just playing hero. Very few games, visual novels or other works manage to accomplish this successfully, though Dragon Age: Origins, which has already been mentioned, is particularly good in this regard - picking the passive or chivalrous conversation options can often end up with situations going ways you don't want very quickly, and sometimes hard decisions have to be made. Catherine made a decent effort of this as well, but was, in my opinion, a little too obvious about which response lead to which outcome to be an effective judge of the player's personality.

I feel like I got a little away from the topic of visual novels there, but anyway. I for one would like to see such an "egregiously long write-up", I'm very impressed by both this and your previous post on fanservice in Nisemonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
>If the goal is to immerse the player by encouraging them to reflect themselves in the decisions they make, their options have to be ambiguously-phrased enough not to scare them away from an unpleasant choice they might otherwise have opted for or, conversely, to stop them just playing hero.

I'm playing Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together (PSP). It accomplishes this very well. I'm constantly doubting my decisions and often ended up in situations I never expected to be. My character was many times betrayed by the world for following ideals that came from my agency as a player.

Amazing experience so far and I have yet to finish my first "story" with it.

But, with this we are really getting far from the topic: Anime Adaptations.
>> ARTICLE
Here's the thing about how I view anime adaptations: I generally don't read manga or LNs, or play VNs. I'm sure there are tons of brilliant stories out there, but if they don't get adapted into anime, I'll probably never experience them. I already follow around 12 anime series a season, and I'm not going to add manga reading on top of that (or rather, I shouldn't, or else I'd never get any work done!).

All things considered, I get more enjoyment out of watching anime than I do in the other media. It's a more relaxing experience for me. Anime takes less mental effort than other media, since the scenes are just spoon-fed to me. I know that can be seen as a shortcoming, depending on what it is you want to get out of the experience, but, for me, it's an upside. Anime is my "break time" hobby, when I can just relax and shut off the creative parts of my mind for a while and enjoy someone else's creation the way they want to tell it.

So, yeah, maybe an anime adaptation will be missing some piece of what made the source material brilliant. But I still find it enjoyable, and it's an experience I'd never have without the adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
> Another approach to VN adaptation, and one I think has a great deal more potential, is to simply drop the ruse of a single narrative and actually adapt your VN as a collection of separate short stories. 

I remember _Amagami_ using this strategy. It didn't bother me nearly as much as I expected it to.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka Magica isn't an adaptation of anything. It is anime original and has a 12 episode series (with a fairly conclusive ending), 2 movies which recap the series and a third movie which is a sequel, but it's kinda open ended, as in, it's a story in itself, but leaves room for another sequel.

If you *really* don't want a sequel-setup ending, you can watch only the 12 episode series and be fine with it.

I have a problem with old anime, all the ones I tried made me cringe badly =/
And this one is from 88 (my birth year xD) so Its too old for me sadly. If its a good enough series, sometime in the future there will be a remake, like with Yamato 2199

there is a remake planned so hopefully you'll give it a shot once its out.

Goody!

Kill la Kill and gurren laggan are originals Im pretty sure

Watched season one till the end, and when the cuteness wore off, I saw there was nothing else.
Not a big fan of shows with no real story.
Thanks for the suggestion though!

* Suisei No Gargantia

* Almost every Gundam series (though some may have incomplete/untranslated spin offs)

* Katanagatari

* Darker than Black

* Barakamon

* Psychopass 

* Fate (One of the routes will probably not be animated and another hasn't started yet but the source material is complete and UBW is complete) 
>> ARTICLE
Almost everything here I have already seen or on my download list.
Also Barakamon and Suisei No Gargantia are listed as on-going (manga) in the wiki (I've been waiting for both to finish).
Also, by fate you mean fate stay night and fate zero?
>> ARTICLE
Gargantia and barakamon are both anime originals so the Manga is actually just an adaption of the anime. By Fate I mean the whole series. You can watch ubw now as it's a standalone anime while heavens feel (not out yet) is a different route /alternative story. Fate/zero is a prequel. Both are complete in the source material. 
>> ARTICLE
Ty, I'll watch them both.
>> ARTICLE
Like "Yurikuma Arashi" Gargantia is an original anime, therefore completed, and the manga is only advertisement.

In general, if an anime is based on a manga, you can assume the manga must have started more than one year (usually it's more) before the anime due to necessity that there need to be enough chapters to animate and because it takes at least half a year to get from the anime kickoff meetings to completed episodes (even if not all are completed when broadcasting starts).
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the info! I'll download those then.
>> ARTICLE
Inuyasha? It seemed like it would go unfinished for a while after dragging on to 167 episodes with some being irrelevant to the overarching plot lines (basically a sort of filler), but then five years later they went and did a great final 26-episode season that was all relevant episodes and wrapped it all up nicely.

Midori Days should also be right up *everyone's* alley.

I see My Hime on there, but where's My Otome?
>> ARTICLE
I've seen Inuyasha, and both midori days and mai otome is in my download list.
Thanks for the suggestion tho!
>> ARTICLE
Initial D, if you like car racing in some way, though 5th and 6th seasons may not have the same pop. It is adapted fully from the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Tried to see it, finished the first season, but its just not for me. Maybe its the super dated CGI, but I think its mostly the downhill racing thing isn't exiting for me.
Thanks for the suggestion though!
>> ARTICLE
The animation does get better in future seasons, but I respect your opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, here's some slightly more out-of-the-way stuff I rate reasonably highly which you might like, if you haven't seen it already.

* I go on about [Flag](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1299/Flag) all the time but it's worth at least trying -- it's a deliberately-paced war drama about a photographer who's embedded with a peacekeeping unit. Every shot in the anime pretends to be footage from a camera of some kind.
* [The Tatami Galazy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei) is a bizarre Groundhog Day comedy(?) about a hapless university student.
* [Roujin Z](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2000/Roujin_Z) is a neat satire about technology and attitudes towards old people. Pretty funny in places, and it has a couple of nice action scenes too.
* [Kamichu!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/489/Kamichu!) is a comedy about a middle-school girl who becomes a Shinto deity. Notably has a couple of oddly politicised episodes.
* If you liked how Geass and Death Note touched on society's mores and structures, and you haven't tried [Infinite Ryvius](http://myanimelist.net/anime/593/Mugen_no_Ryvius), you definitely should -- it's about a group of teenagers trapped on a spaceship and trying to hold together a functioning mini-society to survive.
* [Simoun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/879/Simoun) is set in a world where everyone's born female, so yeah, it's a yuri show of sorts. But it's also a striking war drama and quiet sf story. Downside is that while the designs and art can be pretty good the animation isn't.
* [Memories](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1462/Memories) is a neat anthology piece containing three shorts.
* Have you tried [Turn A Gundam](http://myanimelist.net/anime/95/Turn_A_Gundam)? If not, well, you don't need to be familiar with any other Gundam to watch it, and it's pretty unlike most of the rest of the franchise. It's a bit mad, but people who like it tend to *really* like it.
* I have to recommend [Touch](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1065/Touch) to anyone who likes Cross Game. It's a rule.
* I hesitate to recommend this, but it's definitely not well-known -- outside Japan -- and I rather like it, so: [Heartcatch Precure](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7645/Heartcatch_Precure!) is a delightful magical girl show with a lot of heart and surprisingly decent fights. You do have to come to terms with the fact that you're watching something made for little girls, though; I wouldn't blame you for not watching it.
* If you haven't tried it, [Kaiji](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3002/Gyakkyou_Burai_Kaiji:_Ultimate_Survivor) is a disgustingly gripping gambling show.
>> ARTICLE
Upvote for Kamichu!.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man you hit the Nail on the head with Touch. Cross Game is by a pretty significant margin my favorite show of all time, and I've been looking for Touch everywhere! This was a couple of years ago however and after I gave up I found a few more sources (I prefer torrenting for quality). I had forgotten about the series but I will now of course being searching again. I will definitely check out the rest of your list as well, I haven't seen or even heard of most of those titles. Exciting!
>> ARTICLE
You definitely need to check out **Haibane Renmei** if you haven't already.
>> ARTICLE
I was so glad I gave haibane a chance, that show ended up being one of my all time favorites. There was something so ethereal about and calming about it, a bit Aria-esque. It reminded me a lot of Serial Experiments Lain for some weird reason, something about a young female protagonist's coming of age story in a way.
>> ARTICLE
Since Higurashi is one of your favorites than you would probably like Shiki. Its a horror thriller type that isn't like too many anime out there. It's not too obscure of a title, but it is very unique. Bear through the first 2 episodes though. I thought about dropping it then but powered through and it was great. It's just that some of the characters early aren't very likeable in my opinion, but they change for the better.
>> ARTICLE
Unique is good. That's the very reason why I liked Higurashi actually, so I will for sure check out Shiki too. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Beware the hair.
>> ARTICLE
**Texhnolyze** : a cyberpunk anime with a very strange pacing. For exemple if I remember well there isn't a word spoken during the first episode. The setting is very dark and I really like the evolution of the main character.

**Kuuchuu Buranko** : strange art style, crazy characters, story oriented on different mental disorder.
Serial 

**Experiment Lain** : my favourite anime ever. The pacing is very slow, the story pretty interesting and there a lot of very trippy moment.

**EF - a tale of memory** : favourite romantic anime. As for the monogatari serie, the direction is pretty special, with very eerie colors and scene. It alternates between two story arcs which make the pacing very enjoyable.

**Paranoia Agent** : one again a very trippy anime, about japanese society.

**Kokoro connect** : a story about high school friends who will experience some strange events. Without spoiling, it's totally oriented toward the interaction between characters.

You could just look at [my anime list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Obakami&show=0&order=4) I guess we have pretty similar tastes.

Edit : bad formating.
>> ARTICLE
Sweet recs. I've been meaning to get into EF and Paranoia Agent, I've heard they rock. I haven't heard about the other 3 except in passing, but I'll check them out for sure. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
If you end up enjoying Paranoia Agent, check out Satoshi Kon's other works such as Perfect Blue and Paprika. They are *awesome*.
>> ARTICLE
The last spoken line in Perfect Blue is probably one of the creepiest in any anime ever. That was a great movie.
>> ARTICLE
Love me some Paprika. I have not see perfect blue however.
>> ARTICLE
They rock; watch them.
>> ARTICLE
Kokoro Connect is really good. I also recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching Mushishi right now and its very good. There's no overarching plot, every episode tells how the MC (Ginko) helps others afflicted with problems that are the result of his specialty, Mushi. A lot of the different episodes end happy, sad, tragic - it's very dramatic and very ominous. It's great if you're looking for a good show outside the norm.
>> ARTICLE
Such a great show. I took my sweet time with this series and enjoyed every last drop of it. I watched the first episode almost 3 years ago and the last one just last week, actually! A perfect 10 all the way. My favorite episode was Ginko as a child and his master. Loved finding out how he lost his eye.
>> ARTICLE
Kaze no Stigma is fairly unknown, but its a pretty good 24 episode shonen. Too bad it wont ever finish due to the death of the writer, but its certainly not a waste of your time.

Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai is a pretty decent 13-episode VN adaptation with some [stupidly hilarious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VipB4Z3HVLM) moments, although if you want a serious story it falls kinda flat, since its trying to force an EXTREMELY (around 160 hours i hear) long so-far untranslated VN into 13 episodes.

Also it cannot be stated enough that if youre a fan of Code Geass and havent checked out the first Akito the Exiled movie, youre doing it wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, Akito the Exiled... I've already decided that I'm waiting until they're all released until I dive down that rabbit hole.
>> ARTICLE
Noted. I do love Geass, but have not seen that movie. 
>> ARTICLE
[Please Save my earth](http://myanimelist.net/anime/526/Boku_no_Chikyuu_wo_Mamotte) has adult themes and very complex relationships. Students are having some fun with some shared dreams they had, but as they realize this dreams are from their past life, mistakes and problems from this past life (that were some alien scientists that got stuck into a base in the moon) start affecting them. The anime didn't cover the complete story but it's worth watching and then getting the manga.

[Real Drive](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3363/RD_Sennou_Chousashitsu) I think it's interesting the MC suffered and accident and got into a coma, and when he woke up he was already an old man and the world had evolved a lot while he slept, and he has to make a new life. It could be very depressing but it's light hearted.

[Michiko e Hatchin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4087/Michiko_to_Hatchin) Story is about a mom that escapes prison to help her daughter, but things are not easy when you mom is a prison escapee. (I can't remember another one that focus in mom x daughter realationship)

[Saikano](http://myanimelist.net/anime/529/Saikano) - Cute couple got together, stories usually stop there but not on this one, because a war is happening and the girl is actually a deadly weapon.

[Jin-roh](http://myanimelist.net/anime/570/Jin-Roh:_The_Wolf_Brigade) An officer can't forget a terrorist girl that exploded herself in from of him and gets increasingly involved with the sister of the girl that died. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow Michiko to Hatchin. Such a great show, it was truly like nothing I'd seen before in anime. It was exciting to see a show not about Japanese people! They took a risk with it and it payed off. I haven't heard of the other titles, but based on that rec it's safe to say I'll be writing them all down!
>> ARTICLE
You might try [Kaiba](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=9178), it's definitely non-standard fare. The art can be a little off-putting to some people, but it grows on you.
>> ARTICLE
If you're looking for something outside the norm, [Nazo no Kanojo X](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12467/Nazo_no_Kanojo_X) (Mysterious Girlfriend X) is definitely out there. It's about a guy who one day decides to 'taste' some girls drool of a table on a random impulse and the consequences that follow his actions.

Nevertheless, once you get use to what it involves it's; funny, cute and sweet. And the art isn't too bad either :)
>> ARTICLE
Sweet! That sounds disgustingly awesome. I'm always up for some good rom-com in my life.

[Wolf's Rain](http://myanimelist.net/anime/202/Wolfs_Rain)

[Kamisama no Memochou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10568/Kamisama_no_Memochou) is a pretty good one. Its essentially a mystery about NEET Detectives.

Heh sorry. I really don't reddit very often and I didn't bother seeing if I was breaking a rule. I figured this was the right place for my post, if it's not i apologize and will feed on your downvotes.
>> ARTICLE
Don't think of it as "breaking a rule" think of it as lack of common sense/ forum culture - to avoid having the same questions every day ( so, to keep producing quality content) there is some sort of faq for every community you will ever come across - if not just use google and you'll be fine in 99% of all cases. If you can think of a decent, specific thing you're looking for ( for example Mecha shows that are similar to Neon Genesis Evangelion, as in a deconstruction of the mecha genre) people will gladly answer you.
>> ARTICLE
Totally valid point. I definitely wasn't trying to produce entertaining content with my post. I just like hearing people's opinions, but I'll try to find a better place to do it. Luckily, this thread turned out great for me!

On a side note, NGE was the only mecha I ever liked. Robots are just too impersonal for me. I didn't like chobits at All for the same reason.

Oops I forgot about Gurren Lagan. Ok two mechas I ever liked :P

Wait do eureka seven and full metal panic count? I really need to stop editing this post...

I found Eureka Seven to be the show I hated the most (EVER) and I still have to watch Full Metal Panic, but if there is one that does personal robots correctly its "eve no jikan".

Eureka is convoluted and childish at times. Looking back I can't even remember why I liked it all that much, I don't think I'll re-watch anytime soon. Downloading Eve now, I can't wait.

sora no otoshimono has a nice story and a lot of humor i actually just opened the limited edition boxset for season 2 before seeing this
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the rec, I'll add it to the list!
>> ARTICLE
im curious why do you like higurashi and are u excited for kaku:outbreak?
>> ARTICLE
I think I liked Higurashi because I watched it a time when I had just finished a bunch of cute, innocent shows, and it totally threw me. I didn't have any expectations going into it and that first scene, holy crap... I was hooked. The show is so clearly a labor of love, And it's fascinating to see the town it was based off of. I can't wait to go there one day. Like many others, I was disappointed with the whole fanservice arc in the anime, but I certainly won't let that dissuade me from more sequels. Hell yes I'm excited!
>> ARTICLE
Is this before or after it violently assaults its heroine, or she accidentally falls on a dude's cock, or is molested by a violent crazy-lesbian stereotype? But that's okay, cuz she's a Strong Independent Woman Who Don't Need No Man(Except when she does).

Never has [this](http://i.imgur.com/dmSr9W8.jpg) been more appropriate.


>> ARTICLE
I actually wanted a response like this so I could address this aspect of the show.

Sure Ange assaults Tusk and falls on his crouch. This may be a ploy from Sunrise in order to use the anime stereotypes of women(and sexuality in general) to keep the viewer hooked on the story. But these events can also be used through a feminist lens in order to emphasize the weak nature of humans. Ange overreacts to a lot of things, something that may be linked to her mental trauma experienced after her expulsion from the Mitsurugi Empire. And while this isn't the main focus of Cross Ange while looking through it from a feminist perspective, it is important to realize that Ange isn't perfect and still has many weaknesses(many including Tusk, the man she loves). Going onto the lesbian stereotypes. In the Norma-only island-prison there were no males, leading to something that was not only lonely to be in(evidenced by Salia's degrading mental condition) but also unsatisfying romantically and sexually. This need for contact with other people led to rampant lesbianism(or so we are led to believe with Hilda and crew). And sure all of these can just be said to be "put in there for the lols" in order to make more profits through BD sales via sexuality, I think it is important to make the connection between female power and how it is presented in Cross Ange.
>> ARTICLE
I think we just fundamentally disagree on the subtext of Cross Ange. And also the definition of "Strong Female Character". And also the entirety of feminist theory. And so do [most actual women](https://twitter.com/JesuOtaku/status/574683809033142272) I know who've seen the show, in my experience. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a bad example unfortunately.  Ersha made that statement due to the shear disgust for her behavior.  She turned her back on her friends, people she's known as an infant and killed them to follow the devil to raise the children from the dead.  The promise Embryo said was he'd give the children a better world, he lied he didn't bring the kids back.  She said one of the worse things she could about herself.  Lastly Crunchyroll.com decided to put whore in place of woman that the Japanese language version said.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, ever since JesuOtaku talked shit about Evangelion I don't trust her opinion any more.
>> ARTICLE
Ange is the most super strongest of all female characters!
["Please fuck me,](http://i.imgur.com/kUNcDhX.jpg)[Tusk!"](http://i.imgur.com/Qt38X3C.jpg) (2 pictures)
>> ARTICLE
The counterpoint is that when they actually had sex Ange initiated it and she was in charge basically using Tusk.
>> ARTICLE
Here's the thing about this show, which I think is absolutely masterful in regards to it--it can be enjoyed for two completely opposite things by different people:

It can be enjoyed as a serious anime. Hilda, Ange, Salako, and Tusk all have very positive character developments over time. Rosalie gets a little bit of positive character development. On the other end, Jill, Salia, and Chris also have very negative character development. Ersha, Momoka, and Vivian, as far as I'm concerned, don't really change throughout the anime at all, because they don't need to--they're already very kind, friendly, and mentally put together individuals. Furthermore, there is a coherent, if fast-paced, plot. Things happen and follow a logical train of thought. There's often plenty of foreshadowing as well such that there aren't too many things that come out of left field, and things that may seem to do so are often explained or revisited later. So it's an anime that can clearly be enjoyed on possessing the merits of a good, solid, serious anime.

Then, there are those that prefer to enjoy Cross Ange because they think it embraces itself as a hot mess. EG the absurd flight suits, the questionable mecha designs (open cockpit?! Really?!), the awkward falling (aka crotch) gags, which have gone both ways, all of the various references to other anime (the hotel that makes the impossible possible, Ange and Sala's playtime date was crammed with them--EG Haro bowling balls, all the dolls from other anime, the UC mobile suit twister pad, etc.), and so on.

Same deal on the feminist interpretation IMO...for one, this anime was recommended to me by a lady, and the leading female characters aren't these perfect little princesses, they're unapologetic about who they are and what they do, have their imperfections, and are cooler for that. They're also competent warriors, in Ange's, Hilda's, and Salako's case.

At the same time, there's the obvious fanservice, and some could say there's an element of exploitation in the anime as well.

At the end of the day, I feel that different people can see different things and where one group likes the anime for certain reasons, another group can like this same anime despite those same reasons, and vice versa!

Good in serious terms? Sure. Hot mess? Also a valid interpretation. Pro-feminist? Certainly has those elements. Misogynist? I'm sure there are some stick-up-their-ass social justice warriors that can present a convoluted argument as to why this anime is exactly that.
>> ARTICLE
Feminism go pls, I just wanna watch my anime.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry forgot to preface this by saying that I'm not a feminist. This thought just sprung up after today's episode(and the anti-feminist reaction after the first episode) so I thought I might look at Cross Ange from a pro-woman's lens.
>> ARTICLE
I never meant to claim you are a Feminist, I'd just rather things like that stay away from things I like.

It tends to make a huge mess of things and that is annoying.
>> ARTICLE
>Feminism should stay away from things I like

Yes just because a certain viewpoint is used with something you like entirely ruins it. Whether you agree with feminism or not, I don't think it's fair to completely disregard it based off of that.
>> ARTICLE
It is. Entertainment is always ruined when politics enters it, and feminism has become a radical political movement now.
>> ARTICLE
Wow the necro is fucking real.

>feminism has become a radical political movement now

What the literal fuck? Moderate and "regular" feminists are everywhere. The only reason why we hear about radical feminists so often is because that's what sells and gets people's attention.
>> ARTICLE
> Cross Ange is a story about strong women... But Embryo is a person who thrives on control

So much for strong women.

> Ange, for the majority of the series, has represented the spirit of rebellion. Rebellion against one's superiors, duties, even social norms and society in general.

Sounds like every shonen protagonist in every shonen ever made. Just because she is a woman, doesn't change the norm of all that.

>> ARTICLE
> So much for strong women.

I used that as a way to introduce Embryo and what he represents in the story.

>Sounds like every shonen protagonist in every shonen ever made.

Most battle shounen protags stand for the determination to protect what is dear to you. However, Ange for the majority of the show, acts for herself in acts of selfishness that are uncharacteristic of the Japanese identity. This selfishness is the complete opposite of the typical shounen MC who is usual selfless and is willing to sacrifice him/herself for their loved ones/things that are dear to them.

I've never watched a show as heartwarming as k-on!. When i watched it i was going through some rough times and it made me warm.

Feel better man.

1. [I Cant Understand What My Husband Is Saying (wow thats long)]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/26349/Danna_ga_Nani_wo_Itteiru_ka_Wakaranai_Ken) is a romantic comedy anime about the daily lives of an office lady and her otaku husband. Its short and sweet. Yup. Also, it would be wise to watch this anime once youre familiar with anime, the anime community, and its culture.

1. [K-On!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On!) is a slice of life, comedy anime featuring a cast of adorable female characters doing adorable things. This show is the epitome of relaxation. Theres no major conflict, no stress, and no worries. You can simply relax and watch this anime for fun. The story follows Yui and her new friends in the Light Music Club as they do their best to form a proper band while engaging in mundane activities that are surprisingly fun to watch. A reminder to those who are unaware: playing music is not that heavily focused in this show.

1. [My Little Monster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14227/Tonari_no_Kaibutsu-kun) is a romantic comedy anime series that provides a refreshing start with its story when compared to other romantic comedy stories within the anime medium. Although this animes art style borrows characteristics from a shoujo anime, it manages to look fairly unique because of its coloring. Haru and Shizukus relationship and interactions are a major highlight of this anime. Its also worth mentioning that Natsumes general peculiarity offers plenty of hilarious moments throughout the animes narrative.

1. [Yuru Yuri](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10495/Yuru_Yuri) is a comedy series that mostly consists of middle school girls doing random things. Featuring a fair bit of Yuri and "slice-of-life" writing elements, Yuru Yuri provides surprising entertainment despite appearing as a "generic" anime series. Toshinou Kyouko and her antics are a major highlight of this show.

One-Week-Friends is my ultimate feel-good anime. I smiled for the majority of the anime- and its so sweet it almost gave me diabetes.


It's not just a happy pointless 24/7 cute sweet story. There's struggles, hardships, and frustrations in the show too. I definitely think its something you should check out.

Give Ping Pong: the Animation a shot - it's an amazing coming-of-age story about a group of high school ping pong players, with a life-affirming message about effort and competition and a thoroughly satisfying happy ending.

I heard good things about Tatami Galaxy and Kaiba, although is that something I should watch right now?

First of all, just want to say what a beautiful animal, and I'm sorry for your loss. It's incredibly sad to hear, and while I may not have any personal experience of losing something that important, I can empathise with your situation.  
Thinking about it a little, I feel like [Bakuman](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7674/Bakuman.) may be worth your while. The story of 2 young teens, growing up and attempting to become successful mangakas. You follow them through the years as they struggle to make their dreams a reality. To some extent, I think it covers all of what you're looking for . It's one of my favourite shows, and if you decide to give it a try, I hope you'll like it. Otherwise, hope you enjoy whatever show you decide to go with.

No, thank you for mentioning it. It sounds like something I would definitely enjoy now, and its a reasonable size too. Bakuman is on the list.

Here's a [Aria The Avvenire](https://youtu.be/TNI7hRPT2z8)(the upcoming OVA) trailer.

And I just love Akari's(the pink haired girl from Aria) outlook on life, it makes me all happy inside.  
And I'd say it's not an overstatement that she might change how you view the world a little bit.

Yes

2 anime that I binged.

Watched KLK because of the Cosplays, stayed for the awesomeness.

Watched Cross Ange for the Mecha Yuri, [stayed for the](/s "Cafe Ange.")
>> ARTICLE
Here are a few:

* Code Geass  
* Ano Hana
* Girls und Panzer
* Penguindrum
* Psycho-Pass
* Shirobako
* TTGL


>> ARTICLE
Girls und Panzer had a few manga series before the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Garupan was a multi-media project, and was advertised as such, with its first manga volume releasing in *Comic Flapper* in June of 2012. The first episode of the series came out in early October 2012 and both the 4-volume manga and the 12-episode series ended in March of 2013. The series was announced well before the publication of the manga's first volume, with PVs out as early as May 2012
>> ARTICLE
Ano Hana is not original though
>> ARTICLE
[This](http://i.imgur.com/5klzpMc.png) is what I find when I look for Ano Hana on [Someanithing](http://www.someanithing.com/)

But if you refer to the [novel](http://myanimelist.net/manga/47957/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai.) they pretty much released in the same month, so it's arguable.
>> ARTICLE
It's not arguable. The novel came out one month before the show. That is not enough time to develop an adaptation of it, even if for some reason the author or studio felt that the book was going to be a major hit before it was finished and decided they should start to adapt it, again, before it was finished. That's a ludicrous idea.

People seem to get this twisted a lot, and I'm not sure why. Has anyone heard of movie novelizations? Or video games? Those often come out before the movie does, as ads for the movie. It's no different here. Most (I think) original shows get adaptations preceding their air date. It builds up hype, and creates more cash flow.

More common with manga, but a lot of people really do need to get that concept into their head

You just did in your original comment...
>> ARTICLE
Baseball anime is about the character growth, not the actual game. And Koushien is the final end-all. Win or lose there's no growth there. There's nothing afterwards, it's like winning the Super Bowl. Yay we did it. Go home. 

By not showing the Super Bowl/Koushien you're able to feel a sense of wonder that hard work and guts just might be able to take that rag-tag group to the top since you've spent all that time watching them grow.

The same can be seen with romance anime. Where you don't see them get married and the anime usually end with one of them just finally confessing to the other and accepting. The journey of falling in love is more important than the final outcome of love.
>> ARTICLE
After thinking about it, I think this answer is a really good one. I first felt that I enjoyed baseball anime because I'm a baseball fan, but looking back at it, on Cross Game for example, that isn't the case. What I remember now about Cross Game isn't the baseball, but the wonderful slice of life and the characters/ their interaction. I've now realized that the drama compliments the baseball and just makes it better. Thank you for this answer that has not only helped to answer my question, but helped to change my view on baseball anime.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of times this is because most anime is made to advertise its source material, and never actually completely adapts it. So you're supposed to get hooked and then have to read about what happens to see if they get there.
>> ARTICLE
[Cross Game](/s "In the case of Cross Game, I don't think the manga shows them playing in the Koushien.") And my problem isn't that I don't know whether or not they get to the Koushien, it's not knowing what happens when the anime makes it clear they made it to the Koushien.
>> ARTICLE
Koushien is a huge event with many teams which means the author would have to introduce a bunch of characters that may not be relevant to the story at all. Typically sports anime have a large cast and it's not worth it to add more to that pool to confuse the readers.

Really liked cross game because of its good mix of the different genres and elements

Have you seen [Major](http://myanimelist.net/anime/627/Major_S1) (Has 6 seasons) ?

I definitely have seen Major and I enjoyed it. However, I think I enjoyed Adachi's works more as he puts the drama before the baseball and that only compliments the baseball.

Major is one of my all time favourite Anime. I just love how much the characters grow and develop through each season. Season 6 I felt was weak towards the beginning but overall it was an amazing watch. I would recommend this to any baseball fans out there.

> One outs(baseball)

Should be watched by every fan of psychological or gambling anime!
>> ARTICLE
I know this is an old thread, but I binged through S1 of Chihayafuru yesterday, and I desperately wanted to talk to someone about it, only to realize it's not a popular anime at all. How is it not popular!?

Anyway, I got curious, and looked up an actual Queen vs Competitor match on Youtube. It actually *is* very realistically portrayed in the anime (the game, anyway), just sped up. The real life competition moves waaaaaaaaaay slower, and instead of a bunch of cute high school girls, they're all middle-aged (or older) ladies.
>> ARTICLE
Hey man, glad you liked it.  I watched a real-life game of it recently too.  It's pretty cool that the anime covered Karuta well enough that I knew what was going on in the game(card guarding, lines with no cards, and tactics).  It definitely deserves to be talked about more, but people dismiss it because it's listed as a sports anime and because it's centered on such a niche game.
>> ARTICLE
Heh, I wouldn't call it a sports anime at all, but the competitive spirit of karuta definitely require sportsmanship! I feel like if it was sold as a slice-of-life high school romance, people would be more accepting of it?

Either ways, I'm really glad you recommended it, and I happened upon your thread! It feels good to know that there's at least one other Chihayafuru fan out there XD
>> ARTICLE
You might wanna post this in the recommendation megathread instead since it'll end up getting removed for breaking the rules.

YowaPeda and Diamond no Ace are pretty good sports anime too.
>> ARTICLE
One Outs is the sports anime that isn't really about sports. And that's why it's great.
>> ARTICLE
I agree completely, but man did it get repetitive towards the end. I was really hoping for more character development on Tokuchi.
>> ARTICLE
Giant Killing. Soccer anime about a fictional Tokyo club team. Great art (mileage may vary), probably the most realistic sports anime I've seen (no magic powers, unexplainable skill, etc.). Fantastic story and sympathetic characters.

Weakness - Incredibly slow pacing towards the end.
>> ARTICLE
For the longest time, I had never watched a sports anime, never given it a shot, and never planned too.


Then I watched Kuroko.
I loved it so much that I then watched Major, Haikyuu!, Diamond no Ace, Baby Steps and Yowamushi Pedal.


Never looked back, definetely Top 3 genres for me. All it took was a little push.

Hajime no Ippo is my favorite anime of all time, but I've never been into sports or sports anime, I do like Rocky and Punch Out so I guess boxing is the exception. Maybe I should try more sports anime, Ippo really inspired me, but I wasn't into other sports anime like Prince of Tennis or Eyeshield 21 when I tried them. 
>> ARTICLE
The simplest argument for sports anime is this. 

Every

Single

Stupid 

Shonen

Trope 

Is usually explained or logical in sports anime because of how their structured. Sports animes are basically shonens in disguise. The ones that aren't shonens are really solid as well because there basically sols with action.

> (card game?)

It's called "karuta." While it's nice to see people recommending anime more than asking for them, if you're going to recommend it, I suggest getting things right. That'll get people more serious about what you're writing about.

And we all know there are things such as men's volleyball. You don't need to unnecessarily pull out the homosexual card.

Also, Baby Steps, Prince of Tennis, Ookiku Furikabutte, Ace of Diamonds, One Outs, Giant Killing, Ginga e Kickoff, Bamboo Blade, Yawara are all solid sports anime as well.

EDIT: I saw you edited in Baby Steps. I *will* warn that the art quality isn't that great. It's not an anime with the best budget, but the story is nicely done and it's one where hard work pays off with practice. While Prince of Tennis is the superhuman-tennis type, Baby Steps is the slow-and-steady-wins-the-race type.

I thought a while ago that I had watched all the "good shows", like you. It just turned out I just needed to broaden my views and watch other genres.

For example, you haven't watched any sports on your list and/or watched romance. Also there are plenty of dramas you haven't seen either.
>> ARTICLE
> here are all the shows I've enjoyed the most and why they stuck out to me (I have watched more than is listed here but don't have a list or anything

I have watched a fair amount of sports anime, but they aren't for me. Gekkan Shoujo was fun as far as romance/humor, but generally romance *anything* bores me :/. I am willing to try other genres, though

"Hey, can I have some music recommendations based on these handful of songs/artists I really like?"

"That's dumb, you should tell me every single song you ever listened to and every artist you've ever listened to first so we don't tell you something you already know!"

Amazing how Pandora is able to work without this information...
>> ARTICLE
You analogy is pretty shit. 

Listening to a song again is not the same as watching an entire anime again. A song is a few minutes long, while an anime takes multiple hours. It's not even in the same order of magnitude.

I meant that you should link your list so I don't have to recommend something you've already seen. Unless you were willing to rewatch shows that fit what you wanted, of course, which you seem to not be.


>> ARTICLE
But like...it's not a big deal to rec something I have already seen. And you can replace songs with musical artists, or books, and the analogy still stands.

And like, maybe I have my own system on my comp that I like better than MAL. Or maybe I have a MAL and don't want to link it. Or a whole other list of other reasons why I don't want to post my whole list?

I really just don't get why you have such an issue with providing a recommendation with only a snapshot of what someone likes. Maybe give only one rec, then shrug and move on if the person has watched it. Maybe give a host of them. Maybe don't bother at all. Lots of other people in this thread seem quite capable of this.

Or make yourself feel better by insulting someone because you're a perfectionist so afraid of the repercussions of giving someone a recommendation for something they may have already heard of. Whatever floats your boat, bro.

I can't believe that no one has recommended the Monogatari Series to you yet, especially on /r/anime. You should watch it. Also, you should watch KonoSuba (currently airing) as well as the Oregairu series.

I'm gonna be the odd one out here because I recently just tried this and found it 10x more helpful than trying to find that next masterpiece because as you already probably know, once you've seen a lot, you have less tolerance for the adequate. 

I'll stop being vague and just say what I want to say: **rewatch**. Now I'm not that guy who majored in art studies and tells you that "REAL ART IS BETTER WHEN ITS EXPERIENCED AGAIN" but I'm gonna do exactly that. Goods shows are better the second time around. Having rewatched FLCL, Ping Pong, Evangelion, etc... I almost always improve my opinion of a show on the second rewatch. You might try to say that you've already seen the show and you are wasting your time rewatching the same old plot sequence but you are wrong. So wrong. An anime is 12-24 episodes of ~20 minutes each with a ton of frames. And inside those frames, there are background information, symbols, music, dialogue, interactions, facial expressions, etc... that there is no way you can entirely absorb on the first watch. You'd also be surprised at how much plot you forgot and how suspense can still exist despite old sequences. 

As somebody who's done nothing but drop and drop shows recently, having dropped 4-5 new shows because I simply have no motivation to find a show that I'll absolutely love atm, watching old shows that you 100% KNOW are good, is the easiest solution. 

Now I'm not saying that you necessarily NEED to rewatch every show, but whatever your favorite show is, give it a retry. 
>> ARTICLE
It seems like you're a fan of stories with a slightly more serious tone (+ a good music soundtrack). How about [Mushishi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/457/Mushishi)? It's pretty different from what you have watched so far (supernatural, episodic), but worth a watch nevertheless!

I'm not really understanding these "wow I'm so offended you didn't include x show on your list" replies. I *think* I have watched all the good shows. But obviously I know I haven't, or I wouldn't be asking for show recs.

But, uh, thanks, I guess.

I am not offended, I was just laughing about it.

Clannad has been recommended but I haven't started because...the characters' eyes weird me out (I know, it's dumb)

Thanks, I'll give it a shot!

I really, REALLLY liked cross game, may have to give this a shot. although it being 6 seasons is really daunting. 
>> ARTICLE
I knew nothing about baseball when I first picked up this series numerous years ago and god damn it was super fun to watch. Some super sad moments, super happy moments, and super hype moments!


Highly recommend this one if you are looking to get into the sports genre or if you are already a fan and looking for something exciting to watch that can also keep it's realism and have it's sad moments.

I was just starting season 3 as you posted this.

Time to watch this.

Currently rewatching season 3 for probably the 5th time.  Among my all-time favorites.

tried to marathon it before and got as far as  to when he go overseas to join some club . I then had a really strong feeling that I saw this before I know whats going to happen . few episodes later i totally lost interest . might give it another  try sometime soon .

How much Baseball is there in this show? Essentially what I liked about Touch is that it balanced the school life drama and baseball so the show wouldn't be saturated with baseball games.
>> ARTICLE
It's mostly baseball to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest, there's a reason why Major! is "underwatched", its mainly because it really sucks.

Like you say its more than just baseball, its also stupid melodrama and DBZ powers. 

The show has almost no sense of realism after one point, with the main character becoming the Goku equivalent of Baseball, always powering up when needed even when it makes no freaking sense.

I rated the seasons at around 3-5, it was something I watched when I had a lot of spare time but for the life of me I wouldn't recommend to anyone who likes sports.

If you're watching this for the Baseball aspect, DON'T! Its terrible, makes the sport look like a joke. If you want a good Baseball anime watch Ookiku Furikabutte.

Edit: Also in comparison to Cross Game, I found Cross Game to be FAR superior, it had FAR more interesting characters (the characters in Major are walking cliches that have little to no personality out of their 1 trait), and even the baseball aspect was more enjoyable to watch because it didn't go full retard mode. So yeah, while Cross Game was interesting and had characters with some personality and depth to it which was a nice addition to the sports aspect, all Major has is literally 1 dimensional characters who do not change or learn throughout the show and I ended up hating pretty much all of them except the guy with the purple hair.

The main character's girlfriend especially is one dumb character, can't stress it enough but the characters lack any kind of personality, they literally all have 1 character trait (Baseball freaks for the most part, the girlfriend's trait is how dumb she is) and they do not grow or change throughout 6 freaking seasons.
>> ARTICLE
You really can't say cross game had realistic baseball though..
>> ARTICLE
Which is exactly why I didn't mention it.

The baseball in Cross Game is really more for the flavor there, the main attraction is the characters and the story revolving them.

Sadly in Major, both baseball aspects and characters are horrible.
>> ARTICLE
It's a sport about passion and emotion, but that doesn't make it DBZ. It's entirely possible to pitch at 160 km/hr and it's even more possible if it's a baseball freak with nothing but baseball in his mind. And about the Melodrama, Cross Game had it's fair share as well. There are some dramatic scenes and they aren't done too well, i'll give you that, but it's not the worst I've seen. I mean, the characters grow up as people using Baseball. Honda himself is a baseball idiot throughout but the people around him are influenced by him and they're the ones to change. Ookiku was pretty good but I wouldn't call it better than major. First of all, besides the MC and catcher, there's little to no development for any other characters. And the MC's shy and introverted to an annoying level and that remains the same until the end. The mechanics of the game in the show are more realistic than Major's, I'll give you that.

> It's entirely possible to pitch at 160 km/hr and it's even more possible if it's a baseball freak with nothing but baseball in his mind.

I don't wanna go into spoilers here, but half of the shit they do on the show is impossible. The other half makes them better than any MLB player around.

>And about the Melodrama, Cross Game had it's fair share as well.

Cross Game had characters.

>Honda himself is a baseball idiot throughout but the people around him are influenced by him and they're the ones to change. 

Yeah, in stupid and unmeaningful or reasonable ways. the character of his girlfriend is so dumb I wanted to slap the living hell out of her.

>First of all, besides the MC and catcher, there's little to no development for any other characters. 

Except about all of them, the show (first season at least) takes place over a very small portion of time overall, heck they only have 1 tournament game in it, yet almost all of the characters showed more development in that short time span than the characters in Major have for 6 seasons. You can literally watch a random episode in season 1, then a random episode in season 6 and the characters ARE THE SAME. you cannot possibly say that about ookiku, while not all characters get the same development, almost all of them do get something which is far more than can be said for Major.

>And the MC's shy and introverted to an annoying level and that remains the same until the end.

This is a matter of opinion, and fine if you don't like it I can honestly understand it, even I got annoyed by the MC at times, but in the second season he DOES get his development and changes, and like I said the first season actually is on a very short time span overall, unlike Major in which the 6 seasons span over years and years.

There are 49 more episodes full of story, new characters, and various subplots...and you're stopping at 1?

Wow, okay.

If you are watching Cross Game for the same level of romance as Baby Steps you will be very disappointed. It is a very, very minor part of the story even if it is present. That said, I think Cross Game is absolutely fantastic, one of the best anime period, not just sports anime, and tells a great story. I don't really enjoy baseball much either but fell in love with this show, it is one of the few I really wish would get a western release so I could own it. 

Like I said, if you are only into shows for romance then this is not really for you, yea its there but it is never really a major part of the show, at least in the way it is in baby steps. But if you are looking for just an overall good anime, with a good story and characters then you really can't pass it up. 
>> ARTICLE
You need to keep watching. It has a happy ending.  You should know most if not all works by mitsuri adachi end well. 
>> ARTICLE
If you dont finish this series i guarantee that you missed out on the best baseball anime.
>> ARTICLE
this is honestly such an odd choice to me
Mizushima is the director of loads of rather action heavy more serious shows like Concrete Revolutio, the original Fullmetal Alchemist and Gundam 00 so it feels kind of weird to have him work on this kind of show....
well that said don't judge a book by it's cover I guess?

Licensing nightmare, probably. Disney owns like 70%, Squeenix another large chunk, and any attempt to broadcast on TV is gonna be a clusterfuck. 

Edit: it also occurs to me that the animation for each of the Disney worlds would also be a nightmare. 
>> ARTICLE
The animation could all be handled by one company adapting them into a style similar to the manga.  But knowing that they have a lot of hands in the pot, why not just do it under a joint Disney and SE ownership like how Sony and Disney are working together to let Spider-Man into the Avengers?  Just seems like a missed opportunity to me.  :/

And... I don't want to play the games, but have been so invested in them it's like a drug.  It has gotten so convoluted that I think only making a show could sort it out.
>> ARTICLE
Probably a licensing/creative restriction nightmare with little payoff. 
>> ARTICLE
This. Elaborating on the latter, I can't give an exact source, but I remember reading that the reason a lot of the Disney characters had little impact on the overall story was because Disney tended to stamp down on any actions that strayed from their desired portrayal of a character (not sure if the same is true for Squeenix). As a result, original characters were used to drive the story and most Disney characters and worlds mostly stuck to the (tweaked) adaptations of existing movies.
>> ARTICLE
Then why not keep them to their script?  I mean, they'd be transitioning the story from the manga which is already published.  The Disney characters wouldn't have to be altered.
>> ARTICLE
While I'd watch the fuck out of it...I absolutely don't want it to ever happen. I just can't see it being any good.

Aqua, Kairi, Namine, Olette, Selphie, all the Disney princesses, and Axel.  I'd say it's not a bad amount.

I feel like this is the real reason.  It's like what Neil Gaiman says about writing his sequels.  "I have all these ideas of sequels everybody wants to see, but I also have all these other ideas that nobody's asked for.  And they're shiny."  Summarised, but you get the point.

Roxas and Sora fight would be emotional as fuck if they keep the re-orchestrated version of The Other Promise playing during it.

Because the Gods hate us.

You said it yourself, because they already have a manga.

No anime is going to reach more viewers than a manga already would.

Kingdom Hearts is one of Square Enix's most popular games. I'm sure people around the entire world who love the games would like an anime based on the series. It would be too sick.
