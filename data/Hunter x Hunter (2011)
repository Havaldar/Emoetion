Everyone bow before Satotz. Watch as he runs like a majestic gazelle.

I wish I could run like that.

* I felt really sorry for the guy who ran 99.99 km but got locked out of the second phase by a nose, but then seeing how brutally some people died in Swindler's Swamp it seemed like he got really lucky.

* There aren't many moments in tv that challenge my willing suspension of disbelief, but a chubby kid running 40 km while browsing the internet? Child please.

* I'd really like to know more about Hisoka just like anyone else, but even more about the Hunters Association. Why does he need to get a Hunters' license if he's already so talented he could be successful on his own? Is he working as a mole to help identify qualified applicants?
>> ARTICLE
Hunters Association, like any organization, comes with a lot of perks.
>> ARTICLE
> Why does he need to get a Hunters' license if he's already so talented he could be successful on his own?

On his own doing what? you get more freedom as a hunter
>> ARTICLE
Having a hunter license is a major privilege. As a hunter, you can do all sorts of things and sometimes without any restrictions.
>> ARTICLE
The Hunter Association never gets fully explained, but you'll gradually learn more about it. Next week you'll have a better grasp on Hisoka.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, the manga is barely starting to go in depth with it.
>> ARTICLE
 > the manga is barely starting
>> ARTICLE
He would've had to continue running, so he probably wouldn't of made it. Probably better than getting eaten by a monster in the swamp :-P
>> ARTICLE
> Why does he need to get a Hunters' license if he's already so talented he could be successful on his own?

Because having an official Hunters' License gives you access to many, many different areas, and also serves as a sort of "immunity" to very many laws. It's a massive boon to anyone strong enough to actually get it, because it opens up practically the entire world that the show exists in.

I think Leorio or Kurapika mentions this in episode 2 or 3, when they are arguing amongst themselves which kind of hunter is more noble.
>> ARTICLE
As long as it doesn't spoil a plot twist or some upcoming events. I thought it was some vital context that was missing.
>> ARTICLE
No.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing they don't cover in passing, IIRC. I know they cover it in depth (much deeper than what I mentioned) at one point during the Exam Arc, and I believe it lies in the middle.
>> ARTICLE
This is exactly correct.

Imagine having diplomatic immunity in every country you visit and a passport good enough for everywhere except one tiny, ultra-insular, dictatorship (no, I didn't name names NK). 

That is what I always viewed a Hunter licence as getting you. 
>> ARTICLE
We have the same thoughts on Hisoka. :D

It's also possible that he's using the hunter association to allow him information and funds like blondie is doing, but I like the other way more.
>> ARTICLE
Kilua is slowly becoming my favourite
>> ARTICLE
You're in for a treat.
>> ARTICLE
Killua is just mad swag
>> ARTICLE
Killua is the best. 
>> ARTICLE
Killua is one of the most well written characters in all of anime in my opinion. You guys will se why very soon.
>> ARTICLE
Killua is best boy.

He is both badass and adorable.
>> ARTICLE
Totally adorable. Most of the time.

But you know what they say. Never stick your dick in crazy.

I think your comment works pretty well for Gon as well.

Meh. I'm a sucker for white hair

Killua best Onii-chan

But she's gotta do the "pew!" lol

That's the scene I was thinking of.

It's seriously one of the cutest senes in the entire show
>> ARTICLE
Great development for Killua's character too.
>> ARTICLE
you don't even know bro. He's the coolest
>> ARTICLE
Nah bro. Hisoka. Hisoka Hisoka Hisoka. Did I mention Hisoka?
>> ARTICLE
Hes got mad swag riding his skateboard
>> ARTICLE
Shame he doesn't use it as much...
>> ARTICLE
Same with the gon's fishing pole. I thought that would be his weapon throughout the series. 
>> ARTICLE
Killua ends up being one of, if not my favorite character by the end of the show. He's got a perfect mix of lovable and badass, and Togashi does a spectacular job with his development - in fact, I'd argue that he exhibits the best development in the show.
>> ARTICLE
I would argue for Meruem in that regard
>> ARTICLE
Only worse to me because it's towards one person that he really changes drastically, and he only changes towards others after the rose event. But yeah he was great.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair he's a bit of a special case.
>> ARTICLE
He's a special case. He undergoes the most dramatic development for sure, but in terms of screentime and overall viewer investment, I'd argue that Killua sits at the top.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
The city arc with kurapika was so tension filled and I loved his development. I would have liked him to slowly picked off each one if the spiders. And I think gyro was suppose to be used as a future villain in a different arc. The Hunter world is so vast that focusing on other characters would be cool. 
>> ARTICLE
HxH is really interesting because the main 4 aren't special. You can focus on any of the characters and the story would be just as good.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I defiantly agree, it's just such a compelling world it does not matter who's on the screen. Althou leorio can be hardly considered a main character. It was always weird when he would never make a difference in the story later on. 
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching the series and had no idea this was happening. Nice timing! I was hesitating to start because of the intimidating length, but 5 episodes in it's become dangerously addicting.
>> ARTICLE
That's the idea. I tried to make a schedule that was slow enough to get people addicted, but fast enough so it wouldn't take 3+ years to finish
>> ARTICLE
I would have liked if you included the first three episodes of the 1999 version. These three episodes have the same content as the first episode of the 2011 version, but it's super rushed in the latter (obviously, they tried to condense three episodes in just one).
>> ARTICLE
You need to go faster :(
>> ARTICLE
May I recommend adding short summary on where the current rewatch episodes reached?

I'm sure there are many existing HxH fans who wishes to participate the discussion but unsure about where the latest rewatch plot's at. :)
>> ARTICLE
That's a great idea! I'll definitely add that to next week's thread.
>> ARTICLE
What is the schedule anyway? I can't find it anywhere.

EDIT: NVM, I found it two seconds after posting this! xD Thanks for starting this and giving me the opportunity to watch this show! It's been on my PTW for a while now. :)
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad you're happy! Hope to see you in next week's thread
>> ARTICLE
Let me tell you now that that scary length isn't nearly long enough.
>> ARTICLE
at one point i wanted to stop watching so i could still say i had more episodes left to watch
>> ARTICLE
3 days. That's all it took
>> ARTICLE
I blinked and I'm a quarter of the way through ^help ^^me
>> ARTICLE
I can't help you. Suffer in happiness 
>> ARTICLE
aw man, how am I going to finish 148 episodes... oh wait it's over
>> ARTICLE
"Ah well, I'm sure the manga kept going long after they wrapped this up!" - People who finish the anime without knowing of Togashi and his penchant for running off to play RPGs and live off his wife's Sailor Moon money.
>> ARTICLE
10 god damn chapters.  That's all we have, and it pains me that I enjoy them so much even in spite of the dialogue.
>> ARTICLE
*So* interested to see new-watchers' thoughts on this! I just finished this behemoth last week and it's definitely become one of my favourite stories.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a first time watcher, sorry for being a bit late catching up to this (re)watch. Regardless the first five episodes were wholly disappointing. There were painfully cheesy, cliche and childish. None of the main characters seem remotely likeable and the setting is so poorly realized that it's damaging my ability to suspend disbelief. Regardless of how the show turns out (which might be quite well judging from all the reactions I've seen) it's shameful that it has such a painfully weak start.
>> ARTICLE
The cheesiness and childishness definitely stays throughout the whole show. Sorry. Something about the high quality animation as well as the cheesy background music make the show seem to have a *lot* less serious feel to it (other than the second final arc, which is so good). But that's beside the point.

What makes the show so damn good is it's different (in respect to the Long-Running Shounen genre). The characters' archetypes seem cookie-cutter at first but they're well deconstructed in later arcs. The very diverse array of villains are also that way. The setting later on definitely has a more clear tie to a specific plot point - Gon trying to find his father. Setting definitely shows it's significance and has legitimacy there.
>> ARTICLE
Gotcha, regardless of how it turns I plan to keep watching until about episode 30.
>> ARTICLE
I've rewatched it 6 times. This is my 7th. I'm so happy to see others seeing it for the first time 
>> ARTICLE
I think with this rewatch going I'm going to get some friends on board, because I haven't watched any since the show ended some time ago. I feel like I'm in a perfect spot for a rewatch right now.
>> ARTICLE
I literally can't wait for them to watch later episodes.
>> ARTICLE
There's a reason I set certain episodes as stopping points >:)
>> ARTICLE
HAHAHAHA Oh god, that would be very frustrating. I commend those who can control themselves.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, I just looked.  There is literally no way first-timers are going to control themselves.
>> ARTICLE
I can't control myself after 6 times. Jesus :/
>> ARTICLE
That's why I'm not even participating in this rewatch.  I have finals this week and I know if I start watching the first 5 episodes suddenly it'll be Tuesday and I'll have done all 148.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, too true.
>> ARTICLE
So the journey begins anew...To all who are new to this series: This is literally just the start as it will be a lot better. The Hunter exam arc is generally regarded as one of the weaker arcs.
>> ARTICLE
It's one of the weaker arcs? I'm quite impressed!

I dislike shounen in general and yet it managed to grab my attention from episode 2 or 3. It's been a challenge not to binge watch past the rewatch schedule :)

 It reminds me of the start of Dragonball, where everything was light hearted and friendly!
>> ARTICLE
i love the hunter exam arc, its one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
The hunter exam arc is actually one of my favorites. 
>> ARTICLE
Why is it considered weak? I'm enjoying it.
>> ARTICLE
It's just that the show hasn't really gotten rolling with what is arguable its biggest mechanic, and that it's just establishing a baseline for the characters instead of actively developing them, which is one of the show's strongest points.
>> ARTICLE
Brace yourself for the next arcs. Prepare to be amazed.
>> ARTICLE
It's weaker, not weak. I think it's solid, but pretty much every arc after the second one blows it out of the water.
>> ARTICLE
Only Yorknew is better than the Hunters Exam lol. Heavens Arena is the worst
>> ARTICLE
Heaven's Arena actually got me addicted. Once they got that Nen shit I was hooked
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed it a lot, too. It is just weak compared to all the other arcs.
>> ARTICLE
I've finished it but I will still visit these threads for discussion. 

Commenting to make it a bit more lively here.
>> ARTICLE
Damn didn't even know there was a rewatch going on. Will probably visit daily to see reactions hehe.
>> ARTICLE
A friendly warning for all you first time watchers. Hunter x Hunter does have a subreddit, but it's loaded with spoilers, so I strongly recommend you all stay away until you finish the series.
>> ARTICLE
Was not expecting a HxH rewatch but whatever.

Anyway I have always felt like the first episode that really hooks people in is #3 with the introduction of Killua and Hisoka.
>> ARTICLE
That was what definitely hooked me my first time. I LOVE Hisoka
>> ARTICLE
Hunter X Hunter is available on Netflix USA. Can't speak for any other region. But it only contains ~10 episodes of the 5th arc. So you have to pick up the rest of it on crunchyroll. 
>> ARTICLE
Only has up to episode 100 and is missing the last 48 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Greatest. Anime. Ever.
>> ARTICLE
U guys are about to witness the greatest anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Guys remember this is a discussion of episodes 1-5. I'm reading names of future characters, I would refrain from discussing anything other than episodes 1,2,3,4 or 5...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah this thread is a littered with not-spoilers, but vague hints at what's coming. Is this how all rewatch threads are?  Most the posts that don't cover the first five episodes are being pretty vague, but I still dislike it. I mean, it's hard to say what's happening, but there are even gifs of Killua posted that certainly don't take place in these episodes.

I don't know, it is a REwatch thread, so people who've seen the whole thing are expected. I'd just rather it focused on the specific episodes listed.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is the anime is so long that people who have already watched the series struggle with letting go of future events. Also many of the commentors have already watched the series, and while they contribute to the discussin not everyone actually watched the eps, sometimes only going from memeory.. 

I agree that its a problem tho, vague spoilers and obvious hints like "looking forwarf to your reaction to x event in y episodes" and hyping up things the firt time viewer would otherwise have no idea is coming
>> ARTICLE
Just posting so more people might visit the thread/watch it, best show out there.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter is so much more than the typical Shounen. For those watching it for the first time, your in for a ride.  
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't expecting to like this show, but then I finished all 5 episodes in the first day of the rewatch and it was really hard to not go ahead.

So this white haired kid (Killua?), I found it interesting how he felt compelled to walk since Gon, a similar aged kid was, like his pride was pushing him, I imagine this will be a recurring theme and I like it.

This Hisoka guy, what's his deal? I'm a little confused at the end there it seemed to imply that he was a part of the exam? Or was he just feeling generous and didn't kill them? (If I'm not supposed to know, don't spoil, I think I may have just missed something)
>> ARTICLE
Hisoka ends up being one of the most fascinating and unpredictable characters in the show. After his first few appearances you start to get excited for the next one because you never know what will happen when he shows up.
>> ARTICLE
And that theme music.
>> ARTICLE
you start to "understand" Hisoka more later.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm hype, seems like an interesting character, and I don't usually care for "clown" characters.
>> ARTICLE
He is more of a jojo character.
>> ARTICLE
as a jojo fan, I approve this.

Hisoka knows how to strike poses, skillful, cunning, fabulous, more than the look... Other than the drawing style, I definitely wouldn't find seeing Hisoka and Jojo crossover doujin
>> ARTICLE
He's a magician I'm sure. Not a clown, but they're both similar regardless. I love how he changes outfits for every different arc he appears in.
>> ARTICLE
You seriously don't want to dismiss hisoka as a "clown" character, trust me on this.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I just meant in terms of makeup and eccentric-ness but I get what you're saying.
>> ARTICLE
Bitch he's fabulous
>> ARTICLE
I cannot argue with that.
>> ARTICLE
You understand one very obvious motivation that he has, but I'd be lying if I said I understood Hisoka by the end of it. He's pretty much the biggest enigma of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Hisoka is just a psychopath. He is calculating, charming, and murderous. He is essentially the archetypal serial killer. As we know from psychological research, serial killers are a combination of nature and nurture, so it would be interesting to see what beliefs or circumstances led him to indulge in any murderous tendencies.
>> ARTICLE
I pretty much ended up with the impression that Hisoka just likes doing Hisoka stuff and his existence is a natural outcome for someone of his personality in the world as it exists for them.  The dude just has strength enough to be his own creepy self.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, what are they going to do?  Tell him to stop?
>> ARTICLE
exactly why I put understand in quotation marks. He starts to not be completely mysterious like he is in the first arc, but he's still confusing as fuck later.
>> ARTICLE
This starting getting good when all the rookies were introduced. Looking forward to more Hisoka.
>> ARTICLE
[Oh you will](http://i.imgur.com/ZB2PMlY.jpg?1)

>> ARTICLE
It's in the ED 
>> ARTICLE
2 of my most favorite scenes happen in the first 5 episodes - Hisoka removing that guy's arms and Hisoka killing the fake examiner.

I just really love Hisoka.
>> ARTICLE
Something I've wondered since my second time re-watching, in episode 2, when Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio met the two-choice-quiz lady. If Killua was there, would he have failed that part with his answer? [Mild spoiler](/s "Being as cold as he is, I'd imagine his reply would prioritize family over a lover or he'd simply say that he'd save neither.")
>> ARTICLE
Idk. He's  way smarter than Gon so he might have been able to figure it out.
>> ARTICLE
Man, i've missed it all. The ost, the characters and the interesting world. I'm glad I decided to join in on this rewatch. 

>> ARTICLE
I was tearing up when the OP started playing. Such good memories
>> ARTICLE
You are in for a ride guys. One of the most enjoyable shounen I've seen. And thought-inducing too. Just hearing the awesome pieces of soundtrack and this freaking OP makes me shiver! I didn't know it could turn nostalgic even after a few years. Anyway, be sure to stick with it, you won't regret it!
>> ARTICLE
Just finished the show like 2 weeks ago so I'll jump in!

The show definitely started off slow, first 5 episodes were weak, but it constantly improved bit by bit, by the 20th~ or so episode it was far better.

So yeah, anyone just starting it, don't let the first few weak episodes turn you off.
>> ARTICLE
Man, this series has a slow start. It's really fucking good, but it's super slow at the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
Is this your second time watching? Most people really enjoy the Hunter Exam arc the first time around.
>> ARTICLE
I really didn't like it my first time around. It seemed really slow and that one piece of music that plays every time Tonpa talks gets really annoying.

That being said, it's got some super cool moments. It just pales super hard in comparison to any other arc.
>> ARTICLE
Well i liked it a lot, but a friend of mine said naruto starts pretty much the same way (?) Havent watched naruto but a lot of people who have seen naruto when they were younger might find it boring. However i think this part of the hxh manga was written a long time before naruto so its kinda weird. Personally i think the arc after this one is the worst one overall, but oh well. Yorknew easily makes up for it
>> ARTICLE
Naruto's first arc is actually the best arc of the entire series. I'd recommend that arc to absolutely anyone. (It's the first 19 episodes.)

But yeah, Naruto kinda goes downhill after that. Again, still got it's moments.

And by arc after this one do you mean the Zoldyck arc or the Heaven's Arena arc?
>> ARTICLE
I mean heavens arena. Zoldyck arc is to short to be classified as a standalone arc. But its not particularly fantastic either. My personal favourite is yorknew
>> ARTICLE
I rewatched it up to the Chimera Ant arc recently, so good.
>> ARTICLE
Damn this rewatch. I have to wait even longer for you guys to catch up to when I started rewatching last week :(
>> ARTICLE
I was planning to watch this series again but the thought of rewatching 148 episodes was just too tiring. I think a discussion-based rewatch would be the perfect solution. I haven't started yet, but I'll catch up with you guys soon!
>> ARTICLE
This is going to be a long rewatch, I started watching the series and finished it last year so I won't be taking part, too fresh in my mind.

Cool to see this.. I'm fairly new to anime and reddit, and I'm most of the way through hunter x hunter right now and loving it.  Had no idea I could enjoy anime so much.  (And I didn't think it started out slow, I thought the hunter exam arc was great!)

I just realized that http://i.imgur.com/Ke9lvCL.jpg [Spoiler](/s "  this screen in the opening has 3 people that aren't introduced till much later.")

When I first started the anime I wasn't really hooked until a few episodes in. This rewatch made me appreciate the show right from the start and made me pretty emotional watching the main characters' beginnings. Well done, this is in amazing piece of art.

Glad to know you're enjoying it! I'm looking forward to see everyone's reactions in some of the later threads.

Ging's basically telling us to go watch other anime while we wait for the day we can watch HunterxHunter again, which is what we really want.

It's been a captivating ride, Hunter x Hunter. One that I will never forget. I'm seriously considering watching HxH on infinite loop, because I don't think I'll ever find another show that can be everything that HxH was. Man, what a show. MadHouse really knocked it out of the park. 
>> ARTICLE
Togashi is so wise, He sees our pain
>> ARTICLE
Our pain sustains him
>> ARTICLE
Plot twist, Togashi based Feitan on HIMSELF! WOOOOOOOOOAH!
>> ARTICLE
I found it rather interesting how they chose to adapt chapter 339. In the manga, the entire chapter is the sequence shown at the end, with zero dialogue, with the last shot being Meruem and Komugi holding hands. It's a very somber and silent chapter to close out the arc.

Instead, they set the sequence to Departure, and gave it a more uplifting feel. I absolutely loved it. Very well done, HxH staff.

By the way, for those who don't remember, it was Spinner (the pink haired girl)'s personal goal that the Small-Billed Swan continued to thrive in a certain mining town, so she bought the town with Kite's assistance. The birds at the end are of course a giant flock of Small-Billed Swans. Beautiful.

Alright.. after reading this, I formulated a plan.. we all become fantastic video game developers while learning everything about the Japanese language.. We all go start working for Square Enix (publishers of Dragon Quest) Some of us get rather high up in the company.. From there we with-hold All dragon Quest titles until Togashi finishes HxH.. If anyone has a better plan, speak up now.

The only negative i can see with that plan is that it might lead him to do a half ass job of finishing Hunter X Hunter, just so he can get Dragon Quest back.

Did anyone else get trolled by the credits when it showed Gotoh alive in front of his grave? ;(
>> ARTICLE
After a couple seconds I thought it was Illumi just being a dick. I immediately got an annoyed facial expression and thought "I've had enough of your shit."
>> ARTICLE
They didnt even have to show that part, One giant troll.
>> ARTICLE
It is part of the main story. It was in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Completely forgot what happened and got happy then.... ears.
>> ARTICLE
I was like HOW DID HE SURVIVE
>> ARTICLE
It's an interesting choice they make not to tell Killua that Gotoh was killed. I'm guessing they don't want Killua to go nuts on Illumi, since he would know that Illumi was at least indirectly responsible for Gotoh's death. And Killua holds a certain dangerous weapon at the moment.
>> ARTICLE
thank you, that makes perfect sense, I was so confused at that part, I'm really bad at picking up silent cues.  I was like what are they sayin about killua, why did she shush her like its a secret, whats goin on.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure that's what Gotoh would've wanted as well, but it still hurts as the viewer to know that only a select few will know of his selfless sacrifice.  I was wondering how they were going to address his death. 

RIP
>> ARTICLE
wow I was hoping that Gotoh was actually that rabbbit thing and he was in disguise the entire time...pls let me dream
>> ARTICLE
I actually thought the exact same thing! And that during the Hunter exam Gotoh was the Kiriko (rabbit thing) that told those who qualified where the exam was. I just assumed that Gotoh was watching over Killua from the very beginning disguised (his original appearance) as a Kiriko.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, so did the butlers. That bunny thing is such an asshole. 
>> ARTICLE
I would presume Canary (or Canaria, however you want to spell it) was at least one of the people, if not THE person, who came up with the idea. After all, she presumably knows him best out of the butlers. She was the one who gestured "no" regarding whether to tell Killua. Also, if you watch again, she wasn't surprised at all when fake-Gotoh showed up, and when the truth was revealed, she shushed Amane. 
>> ARTICLE
Wouldn't Killua know instantly though?  Gon figured them out when he wasn't even a hunter yet that it wasn't a real person.  
>> ARTICLE
I just went and rewatched the Hunter Exam arc in memorandum of the final episode, and Gon did *not* in fact realise that they weren't human. He was only able to tell the two apart.
>> ARTICLE
Point made. Maybe they just want Killua to remain in the dark as long as he's traveling with Alluka. Maybe they can't fool him in person but he probably video chats/checks in every once in a while. Maybe having "Gotoh" walking around is enough to keep him from asking questions and not get suspicious either.
>> ARTICLE
Watching this episode made me feel like I had just lost a friend I had known for a very long time. 
>> ARTICLE
Now I want a memory wipe and experience everything again from the start!

'Kay.

It seems like only a few days ago, when the whole [journey began](http://m.imgur.com/aLQ4XXR.jpg)

This show was awesome in nearly every aspect, we've met lobster ants, clowny battle thirsting perverts, assassins, and so much more.

But my personal favorite part was how I just couldn't bring myself to hate any antagonists. From the Phantom Troupe, to Chimera Ants, they all felt human and weren't just evil for the sake of evil. 

It's been one hell of a ride and this temporary goodbye is [going to leave me sad](http://m.imgur.com/A1eb74M.jpg)

I think this last episode really caught the feel of the whole show. It's never been about the goal, it has always been about the journey. I feel like this was what the characters learned just as we did. In the end the "little detours" are what we laugh about talking about it with friends. It's what made the goal a goal in the frist place. Just getting an A is not satisfying. Getting an A after learning a lot is satisfying.

I have to say this whole show was a journey for me. I think I marathoned the show up to episode 143 and then watched the rest weekly together with you guys, and I have to say I wish I was able to watch the whole show every week together with this community. Discussing the events, what they mean and what you learned from the show just feel amazing. I feel like I would miss so much if it wasn't for you guys. I also went for the episode discussion of some memorable episodes which i thought were brilliant, for example episode 135 where I cried like a baby.

This show will always hold a special place in my heart, or at least so I want to believe. We can only hope the journey will go on, some day. It has truly been a great experience. I am sitting here smiling with such a big grin on my face that I would be embarrased if someone were to see me since the moment Gon was finally able to talk about his journey with his father. I can't believe how they managed to not only make me accept that such a great show has to end, but even feel good about. This has truly been the most fitting end the series could have gotten, as far as I can imagine. The show doesn't need a big giant battle as a final. After all this show has never been about fighting people.

At last I just want to thank you all again, and Togashi and the creators of the anime for this wonderful experience. Thank you.

I know right? It really bugs me that, when given the chance to find out about his mother, Gon's like "she wasn't there for me, Mito's the only mother I need!", yet for whatever reason, he still considers Ging his father despite him having as much involvement in his life as his mother did. I hope they resolve that plot thread someday. 
>> ARTICLE
Gon doesn't really consider Ging his father. At the end of Greed Island, he starts referring to him by "Ging" (instead of any variation of the word "father") because after learning more about his personality, it made more sense. Apart from sheer curiosity, he's not interested in further emotional attachment (which suits Ging just fine, I'm sure).
>> ARTICLE
>  Apart from sheer curiosity

So why doesn't he have any curiousity for his mother? If he doesn't want an emotional attachment to Ging, it makes it even weirder that he'd delete the message about his mother.
>> ARTICLE
Well there was no father figure he would be betraying, he feels like if he were to accept someone else as his mother it would be disrespectful to Mito who raised him.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know Ging did bring him to the island for safe keeping =/. 

Seriously though it might have something to do with that Gon has no idea who his mother is nor where she is. He was raised by Ging's sister so that probably softened his image of him. Most of his life he believed his father had died so he apparently didn't really have abandonment issues. Combine that with the fact that he had a mother figure but no father figure it makes sense that he'd latch onto a romantic idea of Ging when he learns he's alive. Especially the way he learned he was alive via Kite. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't know Ging did bring him to the island for safe keeping =/. 

For all we know, Gon's mother could have died keeping him alive. All Ging did that we know of was not immediately abandon him in the wilderness.

> Seriously though it might have something to do with that Gon has no idea who his mother is nor where she is. 

But he could have found out. He explicitly rejects the opportunity to find out a single detail about his mother, apparently because he considers Mito his mother. It just bugs me that he has all this respect for his deadbeat dad, but not even the slightest bit of curiosity about his mother, who might be searching for Gon right now for all we know. 

Gon has every right to think of Mito as his "real mother". I just don't get why he gives a shit about Ging. 
>> ARTICLE
>  I just don't get why he gives a shit about Ging. 

the anime didn't show that, but Gon meet Kaito when he was younger and he spoke about Ging to him
>> ARTICLE
I knew that. But all Kite really says is "You're dad's alive. He's a hunter." 

Why does finding out that his Dad's alive give Gon a life-long mission to meet him, but he refuses the opportunity to even find out *if* his mother's alive?
>> ARTICLE
I think you didn't watch old hunter X hunter version, if you watch then you will know why gon didn't tried to find his mother(mito sister's)..
>> ARTICLE
Unless they changed it in the 90's version of HxH, Gon's mother isn't Mito's sister. Mito is Ging's cousin.
>> ARTICLE
Well the first part was a joke (hence why I later said seriously.

What I meant by Gon having no idea who his mother is/where she is I meant something a bit different. Gon grew up on tales about his father. He was romanticized to Gon since birth whereas he didn't hear any tales about his mother. Through happenstance he later learns that his father, who has already been romanticized to him, is alive and waiting for him by a guy who basically saved his life. What kid wouldn't latch onto that? 
>> ARTICLE
I think it has to do with having a father figure. He already has the mother figure in Mito but never the father.
>> ARTICLE
I dont know how to tag for spoilers on mobile but...

In the new arc of the manga, Gon actually talks to Mito about how he liked to meet Ging and he was an ok guy but he does not see him as a father figure at all.
>> ARTICLE
But if he doesn't want to meet Ging because he's father, and just because he was curious, why isn't he at all curious about his mother?
>> ARTICLE
Well, Gon is a super simple guy and doesn't want to be concerned with things that do not interest him, and Ging only caught his interest because of all the stories they told him about Ging being a super awesome hunter since he was 12
>> ARTICLE
His reaction to his one and only opportunity to learn *anything* about his more seemed a lot stronger than just "eh, I don't really care". He refuses to even listen to the message. 

And if his interest in Ging is *just* because he thinks he's a cool hunter, why doesn't he have any interest in any of the other amazing hunters he's met? He climbs the World Tree, and beat Greed Island just for the chance to talk to Ging, but doesn't even try to talk to Ging's boss?
>> ARTICLE
>but doesn't even try to talk to Ging's boss?


He was great friends with the chairman?

The difference is, Gon's a hunter. His lifelong goal was to track down and meet his father. He wanted to hunt him and Gin sort of egged him on. It makes since why he wanted to search for Gin and not for any other hunters.

Yeah, he was friends. He didn't base his entire life on talking to him though. 

> His lifelong goal was to track down and meet his father. 

That's what I'm questioning. Why is meeting his father his life-long goal, but he doesn't give a single shit about meeting his mother? He says it's because he considers Mito his mother because she raised him, but then why does he consider a person he never met his father?
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't consider him his father. He just wanted to talk to him, probably in part because of Ging's relationship with Mito and how his father was a notable part of the island where Gon grew up. On the other hand, no one knew or even talked about his mother, so there would be no build-up or curiosity for him. Mito always fulfilled that role.
>> ARTICLE
> He just wanted to talk to him, probably in part because of Ging's relationship with Mito 

Mito didn't like Ging though. Isn't the fact that his "mother" wanted to keep Ging away from him a reason *not* to go looking for him? 


>> ARTICLE
Why are you being so obtuse? 




He wants to meet and find Gin, not be raised by him.

>but then why does he consider a person he never met his father?

 He wanted to meet GIN, not his father. Are you happy now? 


Inb4 your inevitable stupid "BUT WHY!!"


Because Gins a cool ass hunter who's had the same dreams as Gon. Because Gon's a kid and he'd rather meet a practical celebrity than some woman who he probably has nothing in common with and might have another family. It also makes for a shit story.


There's a million reasons why he would want to search for his father and not his mother (another being so that he could parallel Gin better). 
>> ARTICLE
> Because Gins a cool ass hunter who's had the same dreams as Gon. Because Gon's a kid and he'd rather meet a practical celebrity than some woman who he probably has nothing in common with and might have another family.

Which brings us back to the Chairman. Gon's met lots of cool hunters, including one the Ging looked to as a mentor. Yet he cares about meeting none of them as much as he cares about meeting Ging. If it's not because Ging's his father, then what makes Ging so special? If it *is* because Ging's his father, why is Ging more worthy of curiosity than his mother? 

> It also makes for a shit story.

Why does meeting his mother make for a shit story? We don't know who she is, she might be cooler than Ging for all we know. 

You keep bringing up manga spoilers I haven't read, by the way. It'd be cool if you'd spoiler warn them. 
>> ARTICLE
I figured that Gon doesn't really see him as father because he never calls him "dad" not even once, but "Ging", even when he talks to him.

In one of the early episodes, he tells Mito he doesn't want to call him Dad, and that "Ging" feels more natural.

>> ARTICLE
I recommend One Piece. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok, serious question.  Why One Piece?  I've tried many many times to like it, and I really do want to like it.  But the story and art really rubs me the wrong way.  Granted, I only made it to the Alabasta arc, but I think that the tone of the show should be somewhat established by 60 or 70 episodes.

Can you tell me what it is about OP that everyone seems to like so much?  If I bear through the Alabasta arc, will it become suddenly amazing and addictive as HxH, Naruto, and Bleach were?
>> ARTICLE
I also recommend One Piece. It's worlds apart compared to Bleach or Naruto. It's consistently amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, you're gonna like what you're gonna like. The part of One Piece that got me "addicted" was around Skypiea. 

After Alabasta, there begins this bigggggggg "widening" of the One Piece world. Within just a few episodes you're introduced to a few of the "Seven Warlords" that are Marine sanctioned pirates. These are characters that are established but may not get screen time until far down the line. One of them, Donquixote Doflamingo, is only being dealt with in the current arc of the series. It creates this big world in which I find really interesting. There's so much going on that it gets you wanting more of this crazy universe in which there's a Sea in the Sky, and many other crazy happenings occur just around this whole experience of going to Skypiea. 

Most would agree that the arc after Skypiea, the Water 7 and Enies Lobby arcs, considered as one large arc, is where it takes it's biggest step up. I can't really say much without spoiling anything, but it's really the greatest challenge the crew has faced probably in the whole series to date. 

OVERALL I like One Piece more for: it's sense of adventure, it's music, it's comedy, it's incredible worldbuilding, and it's emotional moments. However, considering you got to Alabasta (albeit I have no idea how far into it) and didn't like it, I don't know what to say to you about that personally. 
>> ARTICLE
Time to start up one of the Big Three, I suppose.
>> ARTICLE
Stop reading Naruto after chapter 449 (after that it's just "He is not the end-boss, I AM!" again and again) and jump to next weeks chapter 693 for the (hopefully) final fight.

Bleach starts really (!) good, becomes an OK battle shonen and should have ended with 423 (end of soul society arc - also a fitting end to the series). The arcs after that are unfortunately quite bad. Just ignore them.

On the other hand I expect at least another 10 years of the same One Piece quality, but I dislike how the mangaka is using the same formula for every friggin arc (constant running, lots of fodder characters and the extremely lengthy struggle till Luffy encounters the boss - to name a few things).
>> ARTICLE
The Bleach and Naruto anime are okay adaptations of the manga, but I'd stay away from the One Piece anime if I were you. The manga is great, but the anime has an almost perfect 1:1 chapter to episode ratio (usually, about 1/4 of an episode is opening/flashback to previous episode, 2/4 is filler, and about 1/4 is actual content). The anime is really, really slow.

I recommend One Piece or Magi. Though, I'm a fan of Bleach and Naruto as well, the former have been consistently enjoyable as opposed to the speed bumps of the latter.

I don't get One Piece.  I dropped it several times, but after reading review after review on how amazing it is, I gave it one last shot.  I got to the Alabasta arc and dropped it again.  

Doesn't Luffy's idiocy get to anyone else?  Why does it seem like I'm the only one who loses it when he does something stupid to compromise the teams mission?  FACK!  I'm going to start HxH again.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's why One Piece is the definition of shonen. A shonen wouldn't be a shonen without an immortal idiot as the protagonist. I don't really consider HxH a real shonen because it so often subverts the tropes of the genre (please, no comments about the technical definition of shonen, you know what I mean). One Piece is arguably the best executed example of that formula, though, and it does get better. In like 300 episodes. If you're going to watch OP and place any value on your time, use a filler guide to skip the garbage.

The biggest issue I have is that the story is so repetitive. Get to island, split up, everyone gets into their own trouble, luffy miraculously beats super strong bad guy, regroup, next island. That's the order of things in most arcs. And character development of the crew is no longer existent. 

Seriously why the fuck do the straw hats always split up on each island. It's never worked in their favor. 
>> ARTICLE
Get to an Island, they split up because the bad guys aren't in one spot for them to mow the lawn, the bad guys are out doing stuff like killing people, Luffy aint got time to run around find every mini boss to beat. Luffy is reserved for the strongest guy

Then after you hit pretty much Impel Down arc do you realize that luffy hasn't gotten much stronger (they actually get torned to pieces almost litteraly) and thus(INSERT TONS OF CRAZY STUFF HAPPENING) the time skip arc happens and we're eventually going to see the full strength of each crew member (we're going to get there EVENTUALLY) 

again have to split because bad guys are everywhere (Bad guy for Main boss is normally not just standing around being body guard acting like a target, he has to go do stuff)

Exactly. For most Jump shonen series, I only follow their manga exclusively. The anime of One Piece, for example, has too many filler episodes that ruin the experience for me. Plus the animation quality is nowhere comparable to HxH reboot.
>> ARTICLE
>luffy miraculously beats super strong bad guy

I wouldn't ever call any of Luffy's victories "miraculous". He always manages to either find the enemy's weakness or find a way to make himself stronger through some logical extension of his own power. I don't really recall ever seeing any ass-pull victories from his end.

>Seriously why the fuck do the straw hats always split up on each island

This one actually is Luffy's fault. When Luffy picks comrades, he tends to pick leaders. The problem with leaders is that they have their own goals and methods for achieving them, which means they also like to go off and do their own thing and rarely follow orders in a constructive, organized fashion. The real plus side to it is that each one is capable of holding their own in a situation without backup, and if need be, capable of organizing a fairly good strategy with groups they encounter all on their own.

That's the thing that gets me every time about people saying Hunter x Hunter is the best. Shounen are looked down upon mainly because they have terrible anime adaptations.

I mean, I'm not sure you can even quantify the mangas on the same scale.

Hunter x Hunter and One Piece are incomparable, because they're both really good at different things.  One Piece has cool characters and amazing art.  Hunter x Hunter has incredible story and dialogue.  Both of them have amazing worlds and fight scenes.  Both make you laugh and cry and cringe and look surprised at the screen for 20 minutes straight.  I don't think I have to put one over the other because I can't rank them in the same scale.

God, what a fan-fucking-tastic show this was. Such an amazing piece of work so hats off to madhouse and Togashi for providing it. It really was a pleasure. 

This was one of those shows that I didn't look forward to watching every week. No, that's not a typo, I really wasn't looking forward to it every week. I don't feel this show relied on suspense like so many others do to get people to come back every week. Instead they relied a lot on their story telling and their animation to bring people back. Personally, I felt attached to the story rather than the characters for the entirety of this series. So I wasn't waiting week to week waiting to see characters reactions or shounen power-ups. Instead, I was left content because they told a story in each episode. Every episode left me feeling full rather than empty, begging for more. I may be alone in this but I'm alright with that. This is far more than I can say about any other anime I have ever watched. 

The way they ended this was fantastic because it not only gave closure to most everything that needed it (sorry kurapika but teenage angst doesn't bring back the dead), but it also left it completely open for any story line to be followed within this world. The whole show starts off on a small island and by the end you realize the world is so much bigger than anyone could imagine. That this whole time, you have only been told a half truth to what the world really is. It's just a fantastic way to end a series as it allows you to completely start off fresh. I feel like this whole time we were just being set up for the story yet to come. The last 143 episode were only just explaining this new world to us. They only showed us a taste of what this world has to offer and that is something no other show has done. Those ants? Yeah, those are just one creature among millions whom you know nothing (john snu) about. The world you've seen, the continents and cities you've visited? Yeah, you basically haven't even left your home town. Finally, that last lesson, the *it's not the goal but the journey* thing. God it would be great if more anime focused on that journey. ~~Speaking of which, is One Piece (the treasure) really just journey to get there, is there really no treasure, the treasure lies in the relationships and experience you gained getting there? Oh shit!~~ 

Anyways, this was a fantastic show, I am glad I has the chance to watch it. If it continues, fantastic, if it doesn't, then that was definitely a great ride.

~~**TL;DR** The treasure in One Piece is really the just detours you took to get there.~~
>> ARTICLE
Oda said One Piece is an actual treasure. It'll probably have something to do with the Void Century and the Ancient Weapons. 
>> ARTICLE
Nope. Oda said the treasure won't be something intangible like the "journey". Especially when One Piece is something The World Gov't is trying to keep hidden (i.e. Void Century) and Whitebeard said it would rock the foundations of the world as they know it.

i'm sad to see this end, it's been a great journey guys
>> ARTICLE
Great episode, really going to miss this show.

Well I'm gonna go dig a hole in the ground like Illumi and try to plan what to do for the next chapter of my life :'(

I held back and saved 147 for today as well and I'm glad I did, this pair is an amazing end to an amazing series.  I updated MAL and it asked if I wanted to set as completed and...wow, I just can't believe it's over.  I didn't start it in 2011 but I've been watching it week by week for over a year and I just can't believe this is it.  The idea of not seeing it there in my queue anymore is just mindboggling.

It was an amazing ride, hat's off to Madhouse and to Togashi.  Time to enjoy a new detour :)
>> ARTICLE
...You can *Sob* smile again...
>> ARTICLE
Since 02-OCT-2011 until today 24-AUG-2014, i went through a lot.

I was a young boy who just finished highschool with a lot to go through in front of him, in this period, i lived in different countries and I've met different people, saw the highest of being happy and the deep despair, learnt a lot walked and slept a lot too, I've seen and enjoyed new great things.

But one thing didn't change, one thing was always my favorite and i'm really thankful for my life for i was able to live with it and enjoy it, hunter x hunter that is.

I guess what Ging said is actually very realistic;
>"You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest, Because that's where you'll find the things that are more important than what you want"

Indeed, the things that I've planed to do and the places I've planed to visit were never about the final result, because most of the time it was granted, It was more about the journey to there and the unexpected Awesome things that can happen, Those are the things the i cherish most.

until now i'm still struggling to get somewhere, to change and do good to this world, do good to me myself and the people important to me, so I'm always looking for something, never satisfied, always hungry for more knowledge, more experience.

>"What is the thing that you want?

>it is the thing that i can't see now."

Thank you Togashi, Thank you Madhouse.
Eternally Grateful.

I'm both completely satisfied with this episode as a finale and crushed that HunterxHunter is ending...

I really liked the background music during the episode as it really added to the scenes. Great stuff and a really satisfying end to Hunter x Hunter; hopefully not for too long.

Getting ready for Hunter x Hunter: [Next Arc](/s "Dark Continent") (2054).

Well, this anime has been an amazing experience from start to end, this may be the first anime where I have enoyed every single second of the show, this will go down as one of the best anime ever. Now, onto reading the manga!
>> ARTICLE
Brilliant final episode, and an amazing closure to what has been a joyful ride, and I'm really happy, yet upset. 

This, was just simply amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm so happy and sad at the same time, I don't know what to do. I was able to hold back my tears until Mereum and Komugi's hands appeared. That was the last straw. I cried so hard I started coughing. I really love this show and it made my Tuesdays every time. I never got tired of it after I caught up. Goodbye Hunter x Hunter!

It's over! NOOOOOO!!!!

All good things must come to an end.........

Can't believe this is over, just like that. Feels so out of nowhere when you get used to long anime :P  

Ging in normal clothes looks so weird. And those huge birds were actually cute :D  

Whole point of his adventure was to find his father and now it ends with that, so I guess it was actually a nice place to stop, even though it feels like it's not nearly over. I will miss it...  
>> ARTICLE
This ending made me want to cry more than every sad bit from every anime I've ever seen, but it was worth it.
>> ARTICLE
That is how you end an anime. Absolutely satisfying ending with a great message. From start to finish Hunter x Hunter 2011 has been my personal pinnacle of anime. I doubt that anything will ever threaten it's position as my personal #1.

There's nothing left to say, only hope that Togashi awakens from his slumber and delivers more.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, this is my favorite shounen. Incredible characters, world building and no shitty otaku-pandering tropes (aside from moe this last arc). I'm sure we won't have something as good for a loooong while.

What a fantastic journey it's been, absolutely the greatest anime I've ever watched. Time to catch up on the manga. still kinda bummed that we didn't see Hisoka at the end.

I said I was waiting for JoJo.

I even decided to wait for Tokyo Ghoul.

but  ***FUCK*** waiting for Hunter x Hunter, I'm jumping in that shit right now.

I don't think you'll regret it. The art in the new arc is incredible.

That was a beautiful final episode.  I waited 10 years since the 99 HxH version for this remake to see the Chimera Ant and Chairman Election arcs and I'll gladly wait another 10 for more.  Hope to see you all there!

Wonderful final episode. Thanks Togashi for this masterpiece, 10/10. Unfortunately I'm not too optimistic about him being able to complete the manga. He's always sick and he's getting old.

Anyone know if this is getting a blu-ray/dvd release? I know it's on netflix (up to 100?) but I wouldn't mind buying the complete series.

Goodbye my one true love.

When Ging said that he wanted that which he could not see in front of him, did anyone else briefly entertain the thought that he meant the birds behind him?

AND ALL THE "YOU CAN SMILE"
LIKE DUDE THAT IS SO SAD TO THINK ABOUT
AMAZING THINGS SHOULDN'T END
LET'S GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING,
remember?
Kurapika was a boy who wanted revenge,
Leorio was a money-grubbing weirdo,
Killua was a mischievous assassin kid,
Gon was a determined, happy-go-lucky protagonist,
and Hisoka was a clown pervert with a fighting fetish
And now they're all so much more...
Kurapika, a powerful hunter who exacted revenge,
Leorio, now so much wiser,
Killua, now knows what he wants and has broken free of his past,
Gon, he has found his dad, and has gained so much on the journey,
and Hisoka is a clown pervert with a fetish for fighting.
 And it's over...
Even if it's just for now...
I CAN'T HANDLE IT!!!!!

Wow, what an amazing anime.

God damnit, right in the feels.

Hahaha that "Gotoh" scene had me genuinely surprised.

Also, turns out Kurapika wasn't taking a very long crap after all.
>> ARTICLE
I have successfully got 2 of my friends to watch this great series, and they both liked it a lot. So I'm going to keep trying for more, cause people really should watch it.

I don't know what to say after a last episode, I'm always speechless but I guess a "Good-bye for now HxH, hope to see you again, someday" is a pretty good start. 

I will miss these discussions, and I hope ya'll have a great day.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. The tears started rolling the second the flashbacks started while Gon was still walking on the path up the World Tree, and they continued up to the last second. I was so happy that we got to see Kurapika, Leorio and Killua one last time, and that they were the ones Gon thought of when Ging was talking about the bonds he'd made. 

Sad that it's over, but I fully enjoyed the ride. Definitely will be tough to top this as a shonen show, at least for me. Thanks HxH.

Anybody else hesitant to finally take it off there MAL
So sad.

i don't want to watch it yet because if i do, it really will be the last episode for me. :'(

I'm really surprised [Manga Spoiler](/s "They didn't end the show with any hints about the next arc. I was fully expecting some mention of it, even as a post-credit's scene or something (maybe the Hunter Assoc getting together for a meeting, or a silhouette of Beyond Netero). But I guess it doesn't matter given the arc just started in the manga and there's not remotely any where near enough material for some OVAs any time soon.")
>> ARTICLE
Well Ging does mention the thing that he desires is something he can't see in front of him.

>> ARTICLE
That was a great ride was very awesome experience being able to follow the series week by week with only a few breaks in between. It was also awesome seeing all my favorite parts animated. Thank you madhouse for such a great anime adaptation.

Man, I will never be able to unhear Fives voice from Gon now. Both are voiced by Megumi Han.

Other than that, I love HxH so much. Thanks Madhouse and Togashi. A full 10 for me.

Question here. What is wrong with Togashi? I tried a quick Google search and couldn't figure out his ailment. 
>> ARTICLE
That was too much... I guess I'll have to read the manga now... But that's on a hiatus so I won't get much further, crap....
>> ARTICLE
What a month. I absolutely marathoned this show, like I have never marathon'd before and somehow caught up to you guys just in time for the last episode. This was such a fulfilling journey, I may just take a break from anime in general just because of how perfectly done this series was as a whole, everything else seems flat by comparison. 

As I went through my marathon, I kept checking back in on these discussion threads, so it was a pleasure everyone! See you all back here again sooner or later!
>> ARTICLE
More tears. Get better Togashi so we can have more of your amazing creation. 
>> ARTICLE
Not really much to say, I'm just glad Madhouse went with the ending I and some other manga readers hope for. It was indeed satisfying. It's always great to see a show ending on a good note. Liked the added moments with Kurapika, Killua, and Leorio at the end btw as well as the new protagonist Ging's words of advice.

A very well deserved 10/10.

I loved how uplifting this last ep felt. Did anyone else do a slow clap at the very end?

I'm amazed how Madhouse maintained such excellent art quality throughout the show, which is insanely hard to do for a long-running series. Manga adaptations just don't get much better than this.
>> ARTICLE
This is the first shonen anime I've been able to watch from start to finish. I just want to say that I am so happy that this sub suggested it to me. This show got me into simulcasting, and, even though I'm sad it's done for now, I know that it will be back sometime. And, even if it isn't, the ending here was just so stellar. It feels as though Hunter x Hunter could well and truly be conclusive with just these 148 episodes and no others.

Hopefully Togashi will be able to continue working eventually. It would be amazing if he could somehow work it out to get a chapter published every other week, or even once a month if possible, if that'd help him keep to a schedule rather than taking such long hiatuses, but, even with that, the story he's created here is well and truly a genre defining classic even now.

Thank you, Togashi.

Thank you, Mad House.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck.

Lets begin to read the manga now!!
>> ARTICLE
See you guys in the next 10+ years or so. 
>> ARTICLE
T____T

Amazing. Thank you Madhouse (and Togashi), for the wonderful adaptation, and for the beautiful message at the end.

We got to visit everyone again, and there were many connections back to the beginning of the series. Not only because of the flashbacks, but the tone shifted once again to one of adventure (as someone pointed out in last week's thread). Gon completes his original goal of finding Ging, and learns of an entire new world to explore.

[Ah, it's the circle of life.](http://i.imgur.com/NTMtIAR.jpg)

Edit - When Ging started talking about the world tree, I thought the twist was going to be that the root is 10 times deeper or something, and his new goal is to find where those roots go. Also, when he said 'outside this world' I thought he was talking about space.  But an expansive flat earth is awesome too.

Edit 2 - Since I didn't post this last week... anyone notice [there's a fan of the Peanuts](http://i.imgur.com/5Uu55rK.jpg) ~~working~~ who worked on HxH?
>> ARTICLE
It's been a pleasure everyone.

It's highly unlikely that there will be an anime continuation for at least several years, so this is the best time to jump into the manga. While as a purist, I would suggest starting from the beginning, even though I'm sure everyone has heard of the warnings about art quality dropping (hint: read the published volumes rather than the scanlations for less of a quality disparity).

For those who would like to read the 10 anime-unadapted chapters which are currently out, start at 340. These chapters are actually of quite amazing and gorgeous quality, both in art and storytelling, so don't let the rumors dissuade you.
>> ARTICLE
yay..
>> ARTICLE
rip
>> ARTICLE
I've never felt so darned happy watching a final episode of an anime. It was the perfect ending for Hunter x Hunter; the joy shared between Gon and Ging while talking about all their adventures was tangible. From the moment the episode started to the final lines spoken by Ging I had a huge smile on my face and I know this story will always be with me.

Thank you, Madhouse and Togashi-san.

Quick question for anyone: I missed when [Late show spoiler](/s "Kite was reannounced as a little girl") and when it was address later I was terribly confused.  When did this happen?
>> ARTICLE
Last 2 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
From what I was told when I asked this a couple weeks ago.  There was an unborn fetus pulled from the Queen.  It grew up rapidly into a little girl.  She then proclaimed her name was Kite.  Said to be around episode 100.  I remember it slightly but I do plan to go back and re-watch the entire series for the very reason of catching things I might have missed like that.
>> ARTICLE
Ging also said there was a weird effect of Kite's nen that might have been involved. 

(This was quickly mentioned during Gon and Ging's first meeting)
>> ARTICLE
that's how they announced it
>> ARTICLE
:((((((((((((((((((((((((((((

Loved that they showed Komugi and Meruem at the end.

This is definitely one of my all-time favourite animes, I think it's my number 1 Shonen.

It was so good seeing Ging and Gon get along and tell each other their adventures :')

I feel bad for Kurapica tho, he looks fucked up in the head...

Goodbye HxH, I wanna be optimistic but I don't think we'll ever see each other again :(
>> ARTICLE
Wouldn't it be cool if the staff made a spin-off anime on Ging's journeys?

Will one piece finish before this manga xD

Oda is a beast and Togashi is the laziest mangaka there is.

If possible, I really hope madhouse could redo Yu Yu Hakusho. That way we have something to watch while waiting for hunter x hunter continuation/another remake
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching Hunter X Hunter (2011). I'm currently in the Chimaera Ant arc (if that's what it is called). Where can I learn more about the series? Like information on the main storyline, the different arcs. Also, is the original series worth a watch or is (2011) a complete remake? I've fallen in love with this show. Gon and Killua's relationship is amazing and I've enjoyed watching the two of them grow. I can't stop watching. Also, please tell me there is more of Hisoka. An image of him his what got me interested in the show in the first place. 
>> ARTICLE
Go and watch episode 18-20 of the old adaptation of HxH, these episodes were filler but can be considered a must watch, they're really great and gave you a better look at all the side characters in the Exam Arc. If you liked this filler you'll also probably like the rest of the old version.  
The Yorknew City Arc was also arguably done better at certain points in the old adaptation.  

[**Here's a comparison video**](http://youtu.be/uw8Io09FeL4)  
All in all the old version is less streamlined, has more chit chat and interactions between characters (especially between Gon and Killua) and also some (good) side storylines, it also focuses more on comedic relief. 
>> ARTICLE
[Kurapika](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140730174622/hunterxhunter/images/8/83/Kurapika_2_-_140.png) why are you so hardcore? Answer the phone dammit!!

This has been very enjoable for the short time I have watched it. It was all about the journey not the destination. So fitting. A pleasent end.
>> ARTICLE
Should I watch Hunter x Hunter?

Yes/No

I figure this is a great place to ask.
>> ARTICLE
Pick your poison:  
1) Watch it and suffer from withdrawal symptoms as you have to wait probably another 4-5 years until there are enough chapters for a new adaptation.  
2) Don't watch and and keep on living your life in ignorance and total darkness.  

You may want to finish up other animes though before watching this, especially if they're typical shounen as you might get spoiled by HxH.
>> ARTICLE
Is the anime ended forever or will they continue later if manga gets more chapters?
>> ARTICLE
I got so hyped, about the next arc... I had a good time
>> ARTICLE
omg manga why you so slow!!!I want another anime in a few years pretty plz...?
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I never thought I would outlast a second Hunter x Hunter anime adaptation and still not see it being truly completed.

I first started following the manga when I was in high school, and when the first anime by Pierrot started airing, I was in university.

By the time Togashi gets his ass moving to have enough material for a third adaptation, I foresee my own kids will be in high school by then. I hope I will not need to wait until my grandchildren are born for Togashi to finish his story. lol
>> ARTICLE
What a great anime, I followed this way back in 1999 (I was a kid when the Hunter Exam blew me on how dark it was) but I dropped out during the York New arc and never followed up on it, but when I heard that they were gonna reboot it in 2011, I was stoked to follow it again...I can safely say these last 4 years with Hunter X Hunter wasn't a waste of time and it's probably one of the best shounen anime ever and that I was glad to follow it each week, no episode was a waste of time. So long, Hunter X Hunter!  
    
**Until X Next X Time!**

Chimera Ant Arc

Yorknew Arc

Heavens Arena Arc

Hunter Exam Arc

13th Chairman Arc

Greed Island Arc

Zoldyk Family Arc

First 3 are my top 3, reason being all of these arcs were on whole another level of greatness. Every arc below them are EQUAL in my eyes and without a doubt freaking awesome. The order though is just the impact it had on me. The first two arcs need no explaination. Heavens Arena though was our tutorial arc to nen which opened the way some of the best and most intelligent fights I've ever seen in a shounen show. Gonna miss HxH T_T from 1999 to 2011. 

TOOOOGAAAAASHIIII ya gotta finish the series!! HxH forever!!
>> ARTICLE
So that was the last episode of this brilliant anime -  what a feels ride but man -  am I happy to have watched and read this series.
This episode just made me realize again how awesome this series is -  the characters, the storytelling, pacing, the not-just-friendship-gives-you-power-you-gotta-sacrifice-things-fights and so on and on. I gotta say they made an excellent last episode - made you relive all the awesome moments of the past and gives a little hint to where its headed without taking the closure.
Thanks HunterXHunter there is a reason that you are one of my all time favourites and this episode reminded me of that!
Hope to see you soon again!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Continue with the manga
>> ARTICLE
I'm confused.  I don't really follow the behind the scenes stuff closely, but I really like Hunter X Hunter.  Is the show done or something?  It certainly doesn't feel finished...  The show really stops because the author is sick?  Not really used to anime production times so that seems unusual to me :/

I really like hunter x hunter so I hope it keeps going... Can't imagine why it wouldnt
>> ARTICLE
I just happen to pass by..and saw all this comments! Its overwhelming.. I've just finished watching the last episode of HxH today and, I... I don't know exactly what I should feel.

I just finished the show today. I decided to hop on the train shortly after seeing the front page being flooded with with posts and links in the days following the show ending. Holy hell, it was an amazing ride, and it will be missed dearly. Here's hoping Togashi decides to write the next chapters ASAP, so we can get more anime!
>> ARTICLE
I just finished it, what a great run that was.
>> ARTICLE
So just to clarify. I know that this is the last episode of the anime for a while because it has caught up with the manga. But once the manga gets ahead of it with enough distance, is the anime going to come back? or is it officially over? 
>> ARTICLE
Also if this is the actual end. What the fuck do I do now. 
>> ARTICLE
There's no official yes or no if the show will be continued if there's another arc. Even if they do continue the anime it's going to be years and years before there's enough material to continue the show. Togashi is famous for taking long hiatuses. He stopped for 2 years and just came back to do a few chapters and has now been on hiatus again for the last 5 months. My guess is that by the time this current arc gets finished (if it ever does) they'll most likely just start hxh over again since by that point it'll have been years maybe decades since the show has ended. 
>> ARTICLE
WHY IS EVERYONE SAYING STUFF LIKE "THAT WAS SUCH A GREAT ENDING" AND "WHAT A FINALE"
GUYS ITS NOT OVER YET....
IT CAN'T BE OVER YET...
someone tell me this isn't over...
this is like a repeat of the suspense of black butler 3, except A BILLION TIMES WORSE.

I hope the author get well soon, mostly for selfish reasons, this is the only one of the super long shonen anime I enjoy. One piece, naruto, bleach .. I just can't enjoy them they don't feel any where near as interesting. This was a masterpiece imo it has a consistent standard of quality on par with FMA:B imho.

I really hope it continues if not I feel it will be the end of one of the greatest series in anime. Either way it was a brilliant 148 episodes

Sooo Ging left Gon for.... Friendship meh guess that's alright (Its a Shounen alright and I love it)

Just going to call Timeskip Hunter X Hunter (2021) If author doesn't die

E: Feel X Feel (2011)

This fucking episode. I thought Madhouse couldn't top episode 116 but they did it. Amazing direction, god tier animation, fitting OST and also that twist. Seeing Meruem's frightened face as Netero is dying was amazing. Also that end card. ;_;7 http://i.imgur.com/xKXIlfW.jpg
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it definitely was amazing. It's also the first time I've seen it as the most popular show on crunchyroll. I've only ever seen Naruto, Attack on Titan, and maybe Sword Art Online at number 1 before.  Why hasn't this show been licensed?
>> ARTICLE
I would buy the hell out of it. No hesitation.
>> ARTICLE
The fight was truly amazing.
>> ARTICLE
i can't help but think they timed the announcement for HxH manga with the release of this episode
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the greatest HxH episode (definitely in the top 5, at least) alongside the manga coming back? I could see that.
>> ARTICLE
Netero is coming back... He has to come back... He's OK... Right? *sob* Guys?

Anyways...

That battle really cost him

An arm and a leg.

Tis just a flesh wound
>> ARTICLE
all class ahah.

I feel like this is a very important episode in the shows development, Though I cant  believe it will end meruem im really interested to see how this will develop further. The only anime that im not reading ahead in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
It would feel so cheap if he did, and Togashi doesn't seem to be into cheap.

So no, sadly, I think we've seen the last of him.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he's known for not bringing back dead old martial arts masters.. [Oh wait.](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130622010332/yuyuhakusho/images/1/1f/Genkai.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
At least he went how we all want to go. Saving humanity in a giant fiery explosion shaped like a rose.
>> ARTICLE
But did he really save the planet? I have seen too many anime villains to believe, that the King went down "just" like that.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly can't figure out if getting a fight with a real, unmatched opponent or saving humanity was Netero's goal. Why not both, I guess? Either way, goodbye to a great character.
>> ARTICLE
And how appropriate for it to be a rose, a flower which is beautiful, fragile and dangerous...just like humanity.
>> ARTICLE
I get fragile and dangerous, but I've been to a Walmart before. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit.... Words can not describe how bad ass that episode was. After seeing this it just makes me a million times happier that Togashi is returning finally and we are going to get even more amazing content.
>> ARTICLE
This is probably how the ["king"](http://imgur.com/gallery/qZYus) felt.
>> ARTICLE
The king probably survived that. I mean since when have explosions from normal bombs been effective here?
>> ARTICLE
Dude, it's a nuke. Not just a regular bomb.
>> ARTICLE
I still think he's alive...
>> ARTICLE
Me too. The whole deal seems too out of nowhere to destroy the King.
>> ARTICLE
it did not come out of nowhere, since the beginning* of the invasion the ants have been showing to be more and more human than the heroes, and the humans are been showing up to be more and more monstrous than the villains. 
this is just the dot in the end showing that maybe there is no difference at all.

*actually even before that, if they could nuke the heck of the ants since the beginning... why let all this happen? 
all the people who have died... just because Netero wanted his last fight?
>> ARTICLE
Out of no where? Netero is like the strongest person alive in the world, sacrificing himself? 

At least to me it seems like The King has to die after all that.

I can't imagine anyone else going up against him.

It just seems like Deus Ex Machina is all. "He's dead BUT OH WAIT A BOMB" it's not a cop out per say"
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, in retrospect using a nuclear type weapon is probably your best bet against a seemingly unstoppable enemy. 
>> ARTICLE
Just gotta hope that cockroaches weren't on the ant's menu in a previous generation...
>> ARTICLE
It's not really deus ex machina. The underlying theme this whole time is that humanity is just as if not more evil than the ants more atomic bomb is a perfect example of that. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't imagine anyone else going up against him.

I can think of two. I know it is unlikely but Gon's father could take him. Natero has said himself that he is not the strongest nen user. Another one is Gon himself. The episode before this Pitou stated that she needs to kill Gon because he is a threat to the King. 
>> ARTICLE
Gon's father, yes maybe.

I would think Gon is a danger.. a long term one. He is at his strongest when fighting for the loved ones.

Though it would be kind of unfair for Gon to get two battles.

Also when the King says "You had me checked-mated from the beginning" tells something about his health status.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I don't think Gon is a danger in the physical sense, but rather he tends to change peoples emotions. And so far the king seems very vunreable to empathy, pitou knows that and wants to stop him before he makes the king all goody two shoes. Gon doesent discriminate on race like Netero does, and honestly i truly think the King is far to strong to be beaten by anyone in combat alone.
>> ARTICLE
I think he'll be seriously hurt, possibly debilitated. May have to temporarily retreat to recuperate; at least that's how I see this going. Meruem dying when his character is just getting started would just be boring.
>> ARTICLE
I think gons father may be stronger than netero ... no real reason I just think thats how itll end up, netero even stated hes no longer the strongest in the world due to to his age, if netero were 50 years younger or maybe more ( I believe hes about 150 ... or was ) he probably wouldve defeated the king. 
>> ARTICLE
>Netero is like the strongest person alive in the world

He said in an earlier episode that he hasn't been the strongest for a while do to his advanced age.
>> ARTICLE
and why couldn't they have gotten one of those guys instead?
>> ARTICLE
He's the leader of the Hunter organization, and the bigshots intended to pin the blame of exterminating a rare species on the Hunters, even though they needed it to be done it was still going to look bad to some people.
>> ARTICLE
He orchestrated the whole thing because HE wanted to fight the King - to test himself against someone with the strength to beat him.
>> ARTICLE
He was being modest. He never was one for proclaiming how strong he is. Morel and Knov knew that he was in a different league from them, despite Netero saying he was even with them.
>> ARTICLE
Could have sworn he said, or someone said something to the extent of "Despite my advanced age, I'm still the strongest." Perhaps I misunderstood?
>> ARTICLE
He definitely said he is no longer the strongest when talking to the 2 other hunters. Although they believe he was being modest when he said that and also that was before he spent all that time meditating and gathering power. Considering the power he just displayed, it would be hard to imagine anyone but the king overcoming that buddah.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I missed that.
>> ARTICLE
I remember them mentioning that Gon's Dad is one of the top Hunters in the world.  Also it's traditional in most Shonen's that the strongest people, are never part of the system's hierarchy.  Manly because a position in the Hunter's Administration requires strength, leadership, charisma, time, patience, etc.  And there's gotta be a few people out there that just focus on strength and they are just pure Rogue Hunters that don't care about the Administration.
>> ARTICLE
Now if only Netero's original seiyuu could've made it here...

RIP Ichirou Nagai.
>> ARTICLE
It's really sad because I have the feeling that we have seen Netero for the last time... Seems to be too big of an explosion for him to survive and he was just worn out in the end/ his final scenes felt like a finish.
Too sad that he died. And that it was a few months before his character makes it even worse.

 Would be some Naruto styled shit if Netero survived that. And I guess noone wants that.
>> ARTICLE
Finally the episode this whole arc has been building up to, and boy was it worth it. 10/10. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about that, I'm really excited for Gon's story. That's what I've been waiting for, but this episode was pretty freaking awesome. And to think I really hated this story arc at the beginning, but damn if it isn't the best.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, Gon's fight is gonna be bonkers. We're not done yet.
>> ARTICLE
You're forgetting a really angry man sitting in front of the operating table mate.

That will be interesting but nowhere near as amazing as the King and Netero. Their power is leaps and bounds ahead of Gon and Pitou.

It will be amasing. Trust me.

Doesn't matter. There can still be an amazing fight out of those two.

I wouldn't make any assumptions with HxH, you never know what could happen.

Just a note, when Netero says "Humanities infinite potential for evolution" I heard that it's actually supposed to be "Humanities infinite potential for **Malice**" but was translated as evolution. 

Completely changes the scene for me.
>> ARTICLE
That's in the manga (they have both kanjis in the manga side by side for some reason. Maybe it's a play on konyomi VS onyomi)/u/hakuhatsuchun shows the page and the kanji [in this comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/23p9u2/spoilershunter_x_hunter_episode_126_discussion/cgza1xp)

In the anime he specifically says the word for "evolution," that being "shinka," or 
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Yeah evolution makes no sense, considering the ANTs evolve about 100's of 1000's of years worth of human evolution... in a week.
>> ARTICLE
Well since our science/technology is an extension of our evolved intellect it still fits what he was saying.
>> ARTICLE
Makes more sense to me as malice. The whole vibe netero was giving off was not one of evolution. His aura during that speech was one of malice.
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't mistranslated. He says evolution.
>> ARTICLE
yeah... and when the king says " you had me on checkmate from the start", it was actually "you had forfeited since the beginning". 

those were some major changes right there but they are forgiven because of the animation of the zero fist and miniature rose.
 
>> ARTICLE
It's not a "major change", this looks more like a language issue. Japanese conversations rely heavily on previously established context - once they establish what they are talking about (the subject), they just skip it for the rest of the conversation. When he said that line, the King did not mention who was the subject of the checkmate, so it wasn't really clear to me in the Japanese wording either.
>> ARTICLE
i find " checkmate from the start " a lot better , also the "potentiel of evolution" , even tho Malice sound more awessome "evolution" sounds more accurate and appropriate since the king was talking about it and saying how the chimaera ants are better than humans and how chimaera ants are the next stage of evolution and that humans must accept the end of their "top of every other creature" Era and let that place to the King and his chimaera ants 
>> ARTICLE
I know the translated manga used malice, but from what Netero actually said in the anime, it sounded like evolution was the right translation. Was the script changed, or was the manga translated wrong, or did I just mishear?
>> ARTICLE
[Here is the original manga](http://i.imgur.com/AP6l3t6.jpg). You can see both "**/malice**" and "**/evolution**" on it. Yes, neither is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
> /malice

The kanji makes sense.

As for pronunciation in the anime, he specifically said "shinka," which means "evolution." The kanji you have for "malice" is "akui" which can mean malice, but I think it's closer to evil.
>> ARTICLE
He looks like a alien farmer..
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the translation. Been a while since i read hunter x hunter. There are so many things i want to say to those of you that have not read yet. There are twists and turns yet to come. 
>> ARTICLE
That's terrifying because of how true either one is.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but the use of malice is supposed to show that humanity can just as easily show the level of evil the ants have shown, if not even more so. It paints a dark image of humanity, and then immediately 'Rose' comes up, showing one of humanities most evil creations.

I think it fits the scene better personally
>> ARTICLE
Evolution makes more sense for the chimera ants, since they have been evolving throughout the show.
>> ARTICLE
Well the king's whole shpeel is about how ants have evolved to this point where he could take over right? So Netero is saying that humans too can evolve quickly through things like technology and the bomb to become just as powerful as the ants
>> ARTICLE
It does fit the specific scene better, but it's inconsistent with the rest of the dialogue. Meruem kept talking about evolution, and how the difference between him and Netero was that he was the culmination of his species while Netero was just an individual. Netero refuted that statement by saying "Humanity has infinite potential for evolution," throwing Meruem's argument out the window, revealing a nuke as proof, symbolizing the culmination of humanity, but doubling as a symbol of nonpareil malice.
>> ARTICLE
The original manga page says both words. It's something you can only do in writing, so when they had to read it out loud they had to pick one. Personally I found the choice they made to be refreshing, as it caused an initial disconnect between what was happening and what was being said. I mean, think about it, Netero boasts about "evolution" right before blowing up himself along with the King. The scene shows malice even if you don't voice it out loud, and the disconnect between the two only emphasizes the metaphor more... at least I found the scene to be more powerful this way. But to each his own...
>> ARTICLE
It does fit the scene better, but either is true.

And the two translations perhaps even more represent Netero's point. The ants cannot, with all their collective strength, surpass a single aspect of humanity. Not humanity's capacity for evolution, not humanity's capacity for evil, not humanity's capacity for love.

It is both the great tragedy and the great celebration of the absolute truth of what it means to human.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I could not agree more.
>> ARTICLE
What a beautiful episode, and an amazing climax to the fight.

I want to point out just how complex the fight was. The bomb may have seemed like a deus ex machina, but there was actually no guarantee that it would work. Netero entered the battle with a series of deceptions at the ready. First he would make Meruem think he had to use both hands to pray, and then he would pretend to be defeated before activating the bomb. However, a sufficiently composed Meruem would have been quite likely to escape the Zero Hand, as well as the bomb. In a contest of pure strength and ability, Meruem had a clear advantage.

So Netero needed one more deception to get Meruem to play by his terms, but he wasn't sure what that would be at the beginning of their faceoff. However, from Meruem's telling monologue, he realized the one flaw in the otherwise perfect fighting machine was the ant king's budding compassion and curiosity.

And thus the final deception was set before the battle even really started. *The checkmate that Meruem saw at the end was the moment when Netero said he would reveal his name.* That was how Netero would get him to lower his defenses and make him think he had the upper hand by feeding in to his ego.

Basically, the king lost when he said he will only be convinced by words. Ironically, he spoke too much. If you go back a few episodes you can watch the moment when Netero's plans materialize. From that point on it was a matter of Netero making a mistake, or Meruem realizing he was being drawn into a trap.

For such an action packed fight, the outcome was determined by a delicate art of war - the wisdom of years just barely overcoming pure strength. Man am I glad I picked up this show.

**tl;dr - The crucial moment in this fight was four episodes ago, when the fateful combination of Meruem's humanity and ego got the better of him**
>> ARTICLE
It's kind of sad that the only weakness the inhuman monster had was a twinkly of humanity. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the manga, so I'm not %100 certain; was the bomb itself actually in his body? It was implied heavily that it was compact enough to fit in his body, but Netero led the way to the weapon testing area, so it occurred to me that maybe just the trigger was implanted and the bomb was hidden there in advance. 

Rambling:

It also strikes me that the detonation being in a confined space should have made it more destructive *within that space*, but it would also shape the blast somewhat vertically, possibly allowing Meruem to avoid a fair bit of it if he got out in time. There hasn't appeared to be much point to the underground area so far, so maybe there's a fortified bunker or something too, that he may have noticed during his concrete inspection duties?

I'd honestly have preferred that the arc results in him just being pacified and not killed, but his comment about zoning humanity and reconsidering their livestock status doesn't bode well for that. Unless a nuke changed his mind. They can be persuasive. 
>> ARTICLE
>Unless a nuke changed his mind. They can be persuasive. 

Haha, "Maybe...maybe I shouldn't try to turn humans into livestock. They might nuke me again..."
>> ARTICLE
It was most definitely in his body.

See the X-scar on his abdomen. And that very image was pretty much taken from the manga.

Yes, the bomb was implanted in Netero's body, and set to activate when his heart stopped beating. That was the purpose of the brief flashback with the doctor.

HOLY FUCKING SHIT! This my friends, is what we've all been waiting for since 2011. The quality of animation was so amazing that it will put the big 3(onepiece,naruto,bleach) to shame. I still cannot believe that a show about a fucking kid that loves to fish turned into this next generation political war.
>> ARTICLE
>  The quality of animation was so amazing that it will put the big 3 to shame.

The big 3 all have shitty animation for the most part, some more than others because people will keep watching them regardless of the animation, I'm just saying, this isn't news and HxH has had great animation for the most part.
>> ARTICLE
The Big 3 all have shit animation studios behind them too, with HxH we have fucking MADHOUSE.
>> ARTICLE
Surpassing the "big three" in terms of animation is no feat at all.
>> ARTICLE
I especially love seeing the anime as the ant arc was really badly drawn in the manga.  It's just so beautiful now and has always had a bad-ass story.
>> ARTICLE
I mean it's Madhouse. Did you really expect something subpar?
>> ARTICLE
The quality of animation in Hunter x Hunter has far surpassed the big 3 for a long time now.
>> ARTICLE
Naruto's animation has been particularly horrible lately (by lately I mean a long ass time), or perhaps it's just showing its age.
>> ARTICLE
I've not watched the last like... 8 episodes or something, are they still on fillers?
>> ARTICLE
If you mean the flashback arc, yes that's still going on. It's not a filler though, not technically, although they're always filling in time in every episode somehow.
>> ARTICLE
Man, getting tired of Naruto now =/ 
>> ARTICLE
Which is a bit sad. Since I'm a fan of One Piece too, I'd love to see its animation quality consistently amazing like in HxH, rather than mostly mediocre, sometimes bad and a few times great. I've been a huge fan of One Piece for a long time, and the manga is still amazing, but when it comes to anime it just can't hold a candle to HxH.
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact, Toei gives more budget to Precure than to One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
.. What's Precure?
>> ARTICLE
Pretty Cure, the most popular mahou shoujo series currently running in Japan now.
>> ARTICLE
Oooh. Well.. why would a show like that even need a huge budget? What are they even using this money on?
>> ARTICLE
Most likely the fighting animations. Precure is a mahou shoujo with shonen-esque battles after all.
>> ARTICLE
Aaah, I see... Well, I wish they'd put more of it into One Piece. I hope they realize that they're working with the best-selling manga in the history of ever? Why not aim to make the anime outstanding too? Do they hate profit?
>> ARTICLE
I think that's because Precure is their own original creation and they get all the profit they got (including the toy sales) while One Piece is still an adaptation.

And One Piece being a best-selling manga just gives them an easy time adapting it because, hey, it's already popular. Who cares if the adaptation is sloppy? People would still watch it.

But they can't afford the same thing with Precure. They're the one who must do all the work keeping it popular. And they ain't gotta let the franchise go after ten years of popularity after all.


>> ARTICLE
If One Piece had Madhouse to animate it WOULD sadly their under the iron fist of fucking Toei.
>> ARTICLE
That's honestly upsetting. The manga is really, really good. It's so disappointing to see the anime fuck it up so often. Hah, I wish Madhouse had started it right now, like they did with HxH. They'd have so much manga to go on that they could go filler-less for years. Maybe Oda would even finish before they caught up, and we could get to see One Piece with great animation and no pacing issues.

Damn it, it's sad that such a thing won't happen.
>> ARTICLE
Toei man, they don't even try.
>> ARTICLE
I love One Piece to death and have seen all but the last 20ish episodes (I read ahead in the manga), but it just doesn't even compare.  The story, artwork, pacing, characters, etc is just so great with HxH.  It really deserves to be in one of those top spots.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I would like to echo this. One Piece, along with Jojo, is in my personal top 3 shounen. But, HxH is imo in a league of it's own.

Now i NEED to make my friends watch all of HunterxHunter just so they can watch this one episode and cry with me!

>> ARTICLE
People talk about great series a lot, but this was an example of the greatest single episode of anime i have ever seen. The animation was flawless, every single frame of the fight between Netero and The King was full of fluidity and brutality. 

My heart was in my throat from the get go. Netero loses his leg while the King only feels the faintest echoes of pain. Netero then loses his arm and attacks the King with all he has. Even through all this he grins like a madman and doesn't waver for a fraction of a second. And after his attack, when he is left, frail and drained, he still holds that determination. The shot of Netero's eyes as he glares at the King will haunt me for a very long time.

From the preview of the next episode it looks like Pouf was caught in the blast and that Gon's fight with Pitou is going to be soon. I hope it is just as amazing as this one... Now pardon me as i watch that again
>> ARTICLE
Holy fucking shit. This episode is one of the best, if not the best, in the entire damn series. That was absolutely amazing. Netero is one of the most badass persons ever. When he was all shriveled up and old looking I felt bad for him, then he pulled that shit at the end. So damn good. I honestly don't know whether the king is alive or not. He better not be. I don't care about tough you are, you don't survive a nuclear bomb. And honestly, no one else can kill him unless there's been some other insanely powerful person hiding. Which would be lame.

Of the people currently involved in this arc, I'd say Gon is next most powerful person of the good guys. We haven't seen him fight yet with how he is now, but I seriously doubt he'd be remotely anywhere near Netero's level. And talk about a badass way to go for Netero. I'm guessing he had it installed after he knew he was going to fight the king. It's crazy just how powerful the king was in comparison to Netero, who was insanely powerful himself. The zero hands attack battered him a bit, but he wasn't in too bad of shape. If that bomb didn't kill him, I don't know how they're going to deal with the king. The people left can't even handle the royal guard, except for maybe Gon who I imagine will end up defeating Pitou.

And on the topic of power levels, this makes me wonder if there's anyone who is stronger than Netero. The only other character that we know about that I think has any potential in that regard is Gon's father. But we know pretty much nothing about him, so who knows. I know they won't, but I hope they tell us what the hell happened after that fight next episode. I want to know if the king is alive or dead! More than likely they'll switch off to another POV. That's another thing that was amazing about this episode. They focused on one POV. No constant switching between characters that kills any built up suspense. It always irritates me when they think it's a good idea to switch between 3 - 4 different groups in an episode. 2 at most. Anymore than that and it just feels like there's no episode progression most of the time. This time they actually focused on this one fight for an entire episode and it was spectacular.

That was incredible. That entire episode was just perfect. All that build up, absolutely worth it.

I had chills throughout the entire episode.

I'm just going to casually plant a weapon of mass destruction into my body as the final ace up my sleeve.  I've been waiting almost a year for the anime to reach this point and I am beyond happy with it.  Bravo, Madhouse, bravo.

I have to say, when [this](http://i19.mangareader.net/hunter-x-hunter/298/hunter-x-hunter-1219687.jpg) Netero's face showed up, I was genuinely horrified.

Ok, anime can just stop now. Never gonna beat that. Holy fuck.

I especially liked the Gungi references. Komugi made Meruem a lot stronger.

Don't jinx it!

[I...I don't even..](https://i.imgur.com/Ujw9MVI.gif)

But seriously, that fight was beyond majestic. I honestly don't think this anime will ever leave my top ~~five~~ 1 of my all time anime watched list, even after It's long done airing or no more manga chapters being processed.
>> ARTICLE
If Netero really died there, then it stings even more that his voice actor died. The new voice actor is definitely good, but I feel like Netero should've gone out with the voice we all knew and loved.
>> ARTICLE
In the same month [Bleach Spoilers](/s "Yamamoto's voice actor died right after his death in the manga")

Edit: also I feel that his new voice actor added to the situation at hand with the malice and gruffness of his voice. Though I will forever miss the original.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the new one is definitely good. His voice doesn't bother me at all. I was bothered by the death of the original voice actor, though. It was a real shame, honestly. Not only because he couldn't finish his role, but because it was a real loss for the industry.

A few days ago I started watching HxH and I finally caught up with it. And you can bet I don't regret it at all. 

I stared at the ceiling for some time after finishing the episode. [I'm at loss for words.](http://i.imgur.com/1mk2XDf.gif)

That must be intense.  I first binged it up to end of Greed Island, and I've been stuck on episode per week since.  I'm almost jealous.
>> ARTICLE
In all honesty, this might be one of the single greatest episodes of all anime I have ever seen.  The intensity, the animation, the action, the dialogue, the narration, THE ARTWORK, the soundtrack, it honestly could not have been more perfect.  This director is a genius.  10/10

I am been looking animes that can compare to HxH, but i cant find anything its impossible. Or maybe someone can prove me wrong?

Yuu Yuu Hakusho, its an anime that was done before Hunter x Hunter by the same guy if I recall correctly.

Berserk.

Yuu Yuu Hakusho, as alreasy daid, is Togashi's earlier work, though much shorter but nevertheless as interesting.

I think Magi is a pretty good contender, though not as dark as HxH.

I love how the reishi in YYH can be compared (as almost any other ability in a shonen series) to Nen. Also I agree on Magi. It was #2 on top manga sales last year in Japan. That series is going places. And doesn't have a lazy bastard for a writer >->'
>> ARTICLE
FMA brotherhood is kinda similar, have you seen it?
>> ARTICLE
FMA brotherhood is a great anime, but definitely far from being similar to HxH.
>> ARTICLE
This was an excellent episode. Really love how this particular [scene](http://i.imgur.com/PkqBsTq.jpg) was drawn. Can't help but wonder though, if Netero was at his prime, would he have won? 
>> ARTICLE
My favorite thing about this ep/fight is that Netero never got wide-eyed shakey-eyes. He knew what to expect and never took his power for granted. Wish more anime/mangas did this. Its always annoying when a main/powerful character does a sweet ability then gets "oh shit" shakey eyes when the enemy survives.


Regardless epic as fuck and my second favorite fight so far! Kurapica vs Uvogin in ep. 47 is going to be hard to beat for me haha.

And oh god, im getting scared of Gon...

I'm so happy that even after 126 episodes hunterxhunter still has one of the best animations in any anime. The ending to that fight was both satisfying and phenomenal.

Good god Madhouse... I can say this is one of the best single episodes I have ever seen in anime. Up there with TTGL, Clannad AS, and anything else I can think of. These past few episodes have kind of been a bit slow, so I was worried that we would only get to see part of this fight. I was actually surprised that they continued the fight after the halfway point! That decision made this episode all the more special in my opinion. The music, art, animation, direction, everything was firing on all cylinders. Will definitely have its spot of my favorite anime episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Ive gotten so much of what I wanted this arc, neteros fight was the best of the series so far. Got to see killuas true ability. Knuckle and shoot had epic parts though fruitless ( fingers crossed for youpi to become an ally somehow ). Ikalgo got some great scenes, and palm is back. All I need is knov to grow his hair back and gon to defeat pitou!

That was the best episode of any anime ive ever seen. I love that even if the King survives, he's been put in his place and will come to realize that humanity may not submit as easily as he thinks.

One of the best episodes I have seen of anime PERIOD!

This episode is hands down the best episode of the series so far, and one of the best episodes of anything I've ever watched. Not just anime. When this episode becomes available to buy I will buy it and I recommend others do so as well.
This singular episode, which is so great, has changed my opinion about my favorite series now. Before it was One Piece, which literally saved my life.  I was suicidal and it cheered me the fuck right up watching all the episodes of it, laughing, crying, etc.
Just this episode made this my favorite series so far to be made and possibly that will ever be made. I don't care if you think that's going a bit overboard.
Also, woo on Togashi returning this June!

Where the f are Kurapika and Leorio in all this doe? amirite?

Damn good epi, but the King looks like a turtle to me. Da feels tell me he caved into his shell cap, but still got raped in the bum with debilitating injury. You know what I'm trying to relay up in this mofo? Like, the fact that he had not shown any of his skills 'til now tells me this mofo is chalking up some nuclear air up in dat ass. Namsayin'? Word fo shizzle.
>> ARTICLE
Hi I came from /r/all

Anyway, I ve been reading the manga all this while and it's been on a hiatus but you guys are just talking about this series now.

Where in the story line has the anime progressed to?  
>> ARTICLE
The anime just finished with Netero's fight against Meruem. Chapter 297.

We're currently at episode 126, and the Chimera Ant arc is expected to end by episode 135. And we expect that the anime will reach the manga somewhere between episode 140 and 150 depending on the pacing.

Just in case you haven't heard: THE MANGA IS RESUMING IN JUNE!!!
>> ARTICLE
Haha, this was awesome. Now I know why Knuckle and the other Hunters seemed so confident after losing to Youpi. Thinking about it, why would they not have some sort of counter measure? I mean, Netero went into the fight knowing there was no way in hell he would win. It only makes sense he would have an ace in the hole if you will. Also, this must have been another reason why he took the fight to such an out of the way area.

I don't want to think this actually killed Meruem, but the narrator describing it as a "suprisingly lethal" explosion doesn't give me much hope. I hope he lives long enough to see Komugi one more time....

Netero was just fucking badass here, btw. He was terrifying in his final moments even before I realized he had a bomb.
>> ARTICLE
WHAT AN EPIC EPISODE!!! That is all I want to say.
>> ARTICLE
This episode + the announce of the author continiung the manga next june...i'm happy....
>> ARTICLE
Gon and Mereum never actually met on the series (except that the former only saw the latter from a distance, but that's just about it).

and each of them respectively got their own fights (Mereum vs Netero; Gon vs Pitou)

yet, it seems as if those separate fights somehow made the two main antagonist & protagonist (Mereum & Gon) faced each other.
and the author leaves us reader with our own imagination of who will win if they had actually fought.

such mastery/skill the writer has.
the first time I saw a story where the hero and the villain never made contact yet felt like they already dueled.
amazing artwork!
>> ARTICLE
Epic episode. The end card being "cheap" kinda took away from it for me though :/ 
>> ARTICLE
The bomb was the best way for it to end in my opinion.
The King is truly without equal but no matter how strong one individual is, they stand no chance against a nuclear explosion. The King was the apex being and the legacy of the Ant race's evolution. When Netero remarked about humanities infinite potential for evolution (or malice depending on the translation but likely both), this drew a parallel to the malice of the ant's and their evolutionary strength. The creation of the nuclear bomb is both the incarnation of the depth of human malice and the pinnacle of weapon engineering. That is to say, the fruits of the intellectual advancement of the human race, our evolution. It's a beautiful metaphor. 

I hope that un-cheapens it a little for you :). 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying the fact they used a bomb made it cheap. It was that fact the bomb was cheap to make, but i guess that just adds to your point. lol
>> ARTICLE
Cheap to make? I'm confused...

>> ARTICLE
If you go back to the end of the episode the 3rd person voice says the bomb was inexpensive and can easily be mass produced. That kind of cheap.
>> ARTICLE
By countries
>> ARTICLE
No the point is that humanity is the onyl one to have evolved the idea of self sacrifice. All the other ants had preservation in mind. Either preservations to support the queen( all the preking ants) and the ones to preserve the king (the king and royal guard). But there are a few that can break out of it (the big royal guard and the squid). The king learns all he can from the girl but never learns the tactic of self sacrifice. Maybe sacrificing a pawn or another but never himself.
>> ARTICLE
I'm liking that. Nice insight (Y)
>> ARTICLE
How is this not one of the best shounen again let alone the most talked about? I offer this as the time for anyone to bring that up.  
  
Fuck, everything in this episode had me in an intense lock and this is coming from someone who knows that this happens!
>> ARTICLE
There are only a handful of fights this well thought-out animated. It's a shame the series itself is going to go downhill from here on out, coupled w/ the fact that the manga is essentially on hiatus. 
>> ARTICLE
> coupled w/ the fact that the manga is essentially on hiatus. 

Not anymore but you probably know that by now.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I heard, but when it comes down to it there's just the climax w/ Gon & then a whole lot of filler. It'll be months before there's something even remotely similar to the Netero fight (which, while awesome) still feels like sort of a side-story/fight. 

I know the anime is stopping after this arc, but that doesn't mean I'm not still looking forward to seeing where the manga leads. 
>> ARTICLE
I bet the fillers will be pretty badass. I don't think the author would let the animators put shit into his masterful masterpiece. And I would enjoy anything that is half this exiting.
>> ARTICLE
That's even if they allow any filler. In all likelihood it will end before
[Spoiler](/s "http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/13th_Hunter_Chairman_Election_arc")

This is what's after the Chimera Ant arc, and ^ was -not- fun to read. It lasted 20 chapters, then the author went on hiatus (til now). So forgive me, but I'm not all that excited about Hunter x Hunter past this point.

Could you let me know about the fight similar to Netero's in a spoiler tag? I've read the manga, but apart from the Gon thing coming up soon, I can't remember anything else exciting.

LEORIO DOING FUCKING WORK THIS EPISODE!!!!

Seriously, his whole attitude this episode was so great and refreshing to see.  It's awesome to see that he has also grown in the time that he has been away.  Ging probably has his reasons for acting like he did, but MAN was it satisfying seeing Leorio punch him out!


>> ARTICLE
Ging is acting like that because he doesn't want to meet his son (atleast that's what he said before :o)
>> ARTICLE
I imagine it has something to do like with Gon's pride in his quest to find his father. There would be no sense of accomplishment if Ging went to see him. Gon and Killua have been working hard to find him. I doubt either of them would want it handed to them. Possible why Ging asked if Gon asked Leorio is Gon had asked if he wanted to visit. Gon's answer would probably be no. 
>> ARTICLE
Even if you are right, that doesn't excuse Gin. He was being an asshole about it.
I get why the rest of the  zodiacs hate him. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, and how is anyone going to believe that Ging would fulfill his obligations as the head of the Hunter Organization if he can't even fulfill his obligations to his son.

Such a good comeback for Leorio

That makes him an emitter right? I thought he would have some healing powers because hes striving to become a doctor.
>> ARTICLE
Yup! It actually does line up with him being doctor, but it won't make sense until the next arc when it's explained how he developed it. [Really minor spoiler for the next arc](/s "He actually uses his nen to send a sort of sonar to detect any tumors, blood clots, abnormalities, etc. and then sends a small blast of his aura to whatever needs to be destroyed, creating a portal that he can reach through.") It's a very versatile technique that lets him adapt to many situations like in combat or medicine, like Gon's jajanken. 
>> ARTICLE
[Minor spoiler too](/s "That's not really confirmed tho, it's just an intuition of Ging. We could use that as a sort of confirmation but i'd prefer to hear it from Leorio himself.")

No offense, but his intuition is basically the gospel, as far as I am concerned. He's that good.
>> ARTICLE
>We could use that as a sort of confirmation but i'd prefer to hear it from Leorio himself

I trust Ging too, but again, i would prefer to hear it from Leorio
>> ARTICLE
I would say it is more Ging realizing the potential of Leorio's power than Leorio actually realizing it himself.

I feel as if his power has a similar concept to Law's from one piece and how it has it's surgical applications.

jajanken has medical application?

No but its adaptable

Shit, that's awesome.
>> ARTICLE
What a doctor.  "Have a blood clot?  Time for me to PUNCH IT OUT."
>> ARTICLE
Are you saying that this power could not be used for medicine?

He could emit the blade of a scalpel directly above where he needs to cut, inside a person's body when it would otherwise be impossible.
>> ARTICLE
It's been theorised that Leorio could perform complex operations on a realistic dummy and then project that operation to the patient and let it happen without ever having to cut the patient open and also be sure the operation goes well since he could correct mistakes by starting again.
>> ARTICLE
Depends on how strongly the Manton effect is a thing. It's a common restriction in many powers in many fictional universes that superpowers can't normally do stuff inside other people's bodies directly, so Jedi can't just smush each others' brains, etc. Nen/chi/force interference or whatever.
>> ARTICLE
Naw, I think the Hunter x Hunter universe is different.

We've seen some interesting powers capable of doing that.
>> ARTICLE
Well if you put it that way it can be used for medicine. But I feel it is more combat oriented. We just have to wait and see if they reveal more of his powers.
>> ARTICLE

Okay, so why is finger nail ripping the equivalent compensation for Killua getting a kiss on the cheek? Whereas the compensation for the computer was just playing games? Seems unequal to me. Does Killua get special treatment?
>> ARTICLE
They explain this later, I can't go into it without revealing a pretty big spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
[It's not:](/s "What she's actually paying for is the computer. If you watch the previous episode VERY carefully you'll see that Nanika never made a single request of Killua. Alluka made 4 of them, but that has nothing to do with her power. As is explained in that episode Nanika's requests are always explicitly of the form '<YOUR NAME> <DO THIS>' to the point she can't make requests of someone she doesn't know the name of. The requests were of the form 'Onii-chan, <DO THIS>'. That's not Nanika.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that's right. Remember milluki rejoiced something along the lines of see a computer was nothing. After seeing the level of request asked of killua. Alluka makes the requests and the requests she made to killua were for the computer. The fingernail was in response to killua's wish. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch the previous episode again. Milluki definitely rejoiced, but that's because he's an idiot.

Don't forget that when non-narrator characters are used for exposition they are implicitly unreliable.

Killua knows better which is why he explicitly makes the comment that he always knows when "something" is making the request, because "something" only calls him "Killua" while Alluka only calls him "Nii-san".

He literally spells it out for the audience.

=\

[So how did Killua make a wish when the computer hadn't been paid for?](/s "This is a MUCH better question and one we're still finding out the answer too though the last couple of manga issues have given HUGE hints about it. Without crossing into some pretty major spoilers I'll just say that the most likely theory is that when Killua was much younger he fulfilled requests of Nanika (For a description of just how subtle all this shit is, you've already seen why this is suspected! Remember the offhand statement Killua makes that he can ALWAYS tell when Nanika is making a request of him because Nanika calls him Killua? **How would he know that if Nanika had never made a set of requests of him!?** 'Always' implies this happened more than once!) and either refused a wish or made a wish that Nanika could not fulfill so it still owes him (at least) one. This would imply that the Alluka requests were all a red herring to fool the family and that Killua could simply ask to speak to Nanika and get a wish any time he wanted. If you've watched today's episode you also know that Killua has explicitly stated that he can do this regardless of Nanika's 'state' with regards to anyone else. (That is, the fact that Nanika has requests outstanding to the big oji-sama is irrelevant, if Killua commands Nanika to heal Gon, Gon WILL be healed.) ")
>> ARTICLE
Maybe but dont the flashbacks show alluka granting wishes for killua, healing that bird etc. Shows he probably just experimented with her power when she was younger.
>> ARTICLE
I think the bird corroborates it to, but technically it only shows that Killua has received wishes (which we know has happened at least twice: "Heal this bird", and "make me go high"). What we have no direct confirmation of but is strongly implied is that Killua has himself performed requests (this is a bigger detail than it seems as no other Zoldyk has ever performed a request for Nanika).

[Spoilers from current manga arc that will likely not show up in the anime](/s "If you've read the manga and are wondering what the hell the hints are from that, well... they aren't obvious. Basically if you look at the words the Zoldyk's use to describe Nanika/Alluka and you look at the words used to describe the 'survivors' retrieved from the Dark Continent they're the exact same words...and we know that the Zoldyk's went to the Dark Continent. One possibility is that these are unrelated: Alluka IS a male Zoldyk with gender identity issues who was never granted a single request prior to the age of 6, that then created a nen power based on developing an alternate personality that grants wishes. An alternative possibility is that Nanika is a thing that they brought back from the Dark Continent that grants wishes and Alluka is the result of Killua wishing Nanika was his real little sister! It's an odd interpretation I'll grant you, but it actually makes something incredibly weird coming up soon make a lot more sense... Everyone else sees Nanika as this very scary thing and Alluka essentially as something to be ignored and left alone (makes sense if they think Alluka is just a trick created by Nanika) Killua, however, explicitly thinks that NANIKA is the best person in the world, NOT Alluka. This makes sense if Nanika came first and Killua's childhood was spent predominantly not with Alluka, but with Nanika! It would also explain why Killua seems to have infinite wishes but loathes cashing them in: If Killua spent loads of time with Nanika when it was very young as the only one willing to spend any time with it he likely fulfilled loads of very simple requests for it (stuff like, get me a glass of water or whatever) just as you see him do with Alluka now--at the same time he would be loathe to MAKE his best friend do something for him just because of all the nice things he'd done for the friend in the past. Think commanding your little brother to do something or whatever.")
>> ARTICLE
Except he asked Nanika to go away for the benefit of Alluka. To me this shows that he values Alluka somewhat higher, but it still doesn't detract from the fact that he cares for Nanika very much as well.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, but if you're right, why was killua able to wish sth? I mean when no request of narnika got fulfilled, she shouldn't turn "black", or?

And can u explain the die command? What exactly happend there?
>> ARTICLE
All of these are answered in questions below. TL;DR he asked Nanika to come out so she did.

As is stated explicitly in the show Killua doesn't have to "ask for wishes" he can straight up command them. This bypasses the state of Nanika with regards to anyone else and doesn't require payment.

There are a lot of theories as to why this is that are talked about below but the fact is, Killua can make commands and that's what that was. Even if it wasn't though, turns out you only have to pay for what you get and a wish like "give me a kiss" (what that one turned into) would be met with requests like "give me a hug" or whatever.
>> ARTICLE
How big of a spoiler is it? I hate spoilers usually, but this really brings me to my limits. Will we get to know the answer later in the show?
>> ARTICLE
Kind of? Technically everything in this particular spoiler has already been covered in the show it's just somewhat subtle. In all honesty I probably could have gotten away with not tagging it but I like to be careful since I've been temp-banned before for "spoiling something" that was explicitly in the OP.
>> ARTICLE
If that's the case then why did Nanika appear at the end when Killua made the two wishes?
>> ARTICLE
"Because Killua asked her to" basically. You can read post below spoilered as "So how did Killua make a wish when the computer hadn't been paid for?" as to what I believe the current accepted theory is on it.

Or, if you want a non-spoiler reason, for the same reason Killua said to himself in this episode something like: "I won't be able to ask for a wish, but I can still issue a command for one.
>> ARTICLE
So it's like a genie, where it's all in the phrasing? Because so far all of the wishes granted by Nanika have been phrased as requests. But when Killua was making his escape, he commanded Nanika. Am I following this correctly so far?
>> ARTICLE
The phrasing is how we know that particular wish was a command rather than a request and also how we know that Killua was fulfilling requests for Alluka rather than Nanika.

Beyond that, most of it is speculation.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm interested to see how it plays out, that's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Alright. Then did Killua's wish and Milluki's wish combine into one, and that's why it's turned into difficult wishes like removing one of your nails? Or once you fulfill the requests for Milluki's, you then fulfill the requests for Killua's, in a sort of waiting line for wishes?
>> ARTICLE
This is actually a really good question!

It's definitely NOT a waiting line, and I strongly suspect it's not the combined thing either.

Based on everything that's been in the manga and anime so far I personally believe that Killua "prepaid" for multiple wishes a long time ago so he can use "commands" to cash in one of those wishes.

Whether this is true or not though seems to be moot as far as the manga/anime is concerned: Killua can straight up demand wishes without fulfilling requests regardless of the "state" of Nanika with regards to the wishes of others.
>> ARTICLE
So basically in a nutshell, Killua is a special case. Gotchya.
>> ARTICLE
Wow! I'm a manga reader and I only realized the real reason for this part because of you.. Thank you.
>> ARTICLE
My guess is that it has something to do with the fact Killua gave her a choice. On one hand a kiss on the cheek is nothing, but on the other killing his mom would be a big task. So then Alluka's next request will be somewhere in between the two ? totally speculation and it's the only thing that kinda makes sense, that or she just loves Killua more ~~don't blame her.~~

I want the show renamed Everybody Hates Ging.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't Ging suppose to be a famous hunter that discovered so and so that everyone respected? I got that impression from the beginning of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Im sure everyone respects him and stuff just that the Zodiac doesn't because they're just as good (if not even better) so they're on the same level which makes it more of a competition
>> ARTICLE
Well since Pariston was making fun of Ging in front of the crowd, and they were pretty unmerciful when Leorio started yelling at him and then punched him, I assumed there was a reason most hunters hated him, even though it kind of contradicts the mystique from the beginning during the Hunter exam when they said he was a great hunter that discovered so and so insects or pyramids or whatever and the examiners respected him or at least seemed to.
>> ARTICLE
What I want to know is why everyone seems to hate Ging. I freaking love him.
>> ARTICLE
I believe that they respected his potential and talent, remember Aunt Mito doesn't hate Ging simply because he left Gon with her. I guess after he became a Hunter he achieved those feats but not without breaking a few rules and pissing off some people.

Leorio got a punch in on Ging? THE GING?! Man it seemed like Ging saw it coming but just decided to take the punch like a man...maybe he wanted a wake up call and got it.

LEORIO!!!....and OH SHIT! Is that Kurapika in a black suit looking like a boss? God I love this show, never fails to excite.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Spoiler tags, please.
>> ARTICLE
A wake up call? Ging? I'm not sure you understand he doesn't think like a normal guy, I mean, he's the father of Gon, the weirdest kid ever.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose there is Leorio's perspective, I believe most people would think this way, like, "Man that's your son, when's the last time you saw him? when's the last time you spoken to him? He could die tomorrow, do you want an ending like that?" OR there is Ging's perspective, this is only a guess, but maybe BECAUSE IT IS his son, and hes so sure that Gon will pull through and survive, which is why hes not worried. That's my 2 cents on that.
>> ARTICLE
nah, Ging is just socially awkward. remember how he cheated Gon out of his meting with him just because he dint wanted to meet Gon's friends?
>> ARTICLE
I know this is an old comment, but I *just* binged my way through the series and this episode was so damn satisfying I had to look at the discussion. When they were going over Ging's setting up of the magnetic force and accompany cards effects, it sounded more to me like he just really didn't think it all the way through, which was then emphasized by the fact that Gon and Killua were giving him more credit than he deserved for everything they're going through as if he's a full-on psychic.

And ya know, if Ging happens to know about Alluka then that's really the only way he could be redeemed here. There's no excuse for leaving your kid on his deathbed with no foreseeable means of recovery, no matter how confident you are that he's special, unless you know about the freaking magic-beyond-magic that nobody outside of the Zoldycks is supposed to be aware of.

[This moment](http://i.imgur.com/n5f9JF7.jpg) made me laugh harder than it should have

to me it looked like ging let himself get hit so that leorio would become popular and maybe run for chairman? man that would be awesome
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about the chairman thing, but it definitely looked like Ging let himself get hit. 
>> ARTICLE
Ging got hit by Leorio [so](/s "He could use his ability") 
>> ARTICLE
That's definitely not true. 
>> ARTICLE
Read the manga mate.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "Unclear.  Ging looks like he can copy any technique he sees, not just gets hit by.  Either way, the attack wasn't strong enough to do him any real damage and it's likely he took it just to let Leorio vent a bit, not because he was planning to copy it or anything.")
>> ARTICLE
[Maybe...](/s "I actually think he can copy almost any ability he can think of. Sure he copied the ground traveling fist but then he's like 'yeah leorio would probably use his ability to do this... and this... and this...' all to make Pariston think his nen ability is to copy the talents of those he is hit by. I think his real ability is simply that he NEVER specialized or developed an ability of his own AT ALL and simply trained himself to become the most versatile person alive at manipulating nen. I'm sure we'll find out for sure 'soon'(tm).")
>> ARTICLE
I do, and that's not true. [Manga Spoilers](/s "Ging NEVER states he gets hit so he can use Leorio's power. He knows how to recreate it, as shown when he's being attacked with Pariston, but he never says that he got hit to use it.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "It is heavily implied that one of the conditions is that Ging needs to get hit or affected by and ability to copy it.") 
>> ARTICLE
First of all, that's a spoiler, please tag it.

Second, [Manga Spoiler](/s "It's true that he might need to do that to copy it, but you stated that he got hit by him so he could copy his ability. Which is absolutely not true. He never said that he wanted Leorio's ability. He let himself get hit for other purposes (entertaining the crowd, setting up Leorio's run at Chairman, etc)")
>> ARTICLE
Fixed the spoiler.
 
Well until now it all theory, we'll just have to wait til they explain more in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
one can only hope
>> ARTICLE
There's no way a veteran like him couldn't dodge an attack from a nen newbie.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Putting aside the unexpected aspect of the attack, every single one of the Zodiacs would have seen the black hole below them (just like Ging did), seen the fist coming out of it (just like Ging did), and would have had more than ample time to dodge/block the punch.

The ability itself is actually quite impressive, and in the hands of a more experienced hunter like Morel or Hisoka it could easily become ridiculously OP.

But, with Leorio being the puncher here, any punchee with more than a mild amount of combat experience would be able to dodge it.
>> ARTICLE
there was already a boxer in greed island that seemed to do something very similar
>> ARTICLE
That is the fist thing I thought of too.  However, the boxer was pretty weak (relatively speaking), the ring had a special symbol that helped him somehow, and the punches seemed pretty limited how far they could go.   I suspect this does a lot more.
>> ARTICLE
It was glorious.  Leorio has a balling nen ability.
>> ARTICLE
Except it sure took a while to whined up.

Nah, your time just got compressed.

Yknow I thought that for a brief second and dismissed it on the basis of Leorios lack of ability.

But after that one punch to one of the most hated members of the Zodiac was seen by or will be seen by ever Hunter eligible to vote, I'm calling it.
>> ARTICLE
Totally seems like the video of the meeting will go viral, and people will start voting for him. I'm hoping to see some episodes of Leorio thrown into some political madness, haha.

That's what I htought straight away after he hit Ging. I sense collusion afoot. Leorio would be a ... great chairman?

Ripping away that pinky nail like it ain't no thang.

I looked away anyway. That sound...

They showed her touching it...and the sound...oh god the sound.

I cringed so hard.

I love Leorio, glad to see him call Ging out on his shit and asking the important questions that we're all want answers to.

Aaa... That's too bad, would have been more awesome.

I saw that Knuckle was giving Youpi the finger in the Chimera Ant arc to, but they speed it up so it's really hard to see.

What an absolutely amazing episode!

To me, it was almost as great as 131. 

1) Seeing Gon like that made me realize just how lucky he is to still be alive. He's probably not much more than a bunch of meat at this point.

2) FUCKING LEORIO. I almost forgot how awesome he is. 

3) I cringed so hard at the nail scene. But the lady took it like a boss.

4) Holy shit, Kurapika. That guy does *not* look happy. Really looking forward to what he was up to.

5) Ging really, *really* deserved that punch. But he expected it. Of course he did.

I really missed leorio!
his entire character is flawless.

Correction, his flaws make him flawless.. XDD

Seems like Leorio wasn't sitting idle that whole time.

Leorio yelling and stuffing his phone in his mouth is one of the best character "come-backs" of any anime I have seen so far. It's about time!

Just him screaming his name at gotoh would have been good enough but they really went the extra mile

Uppercutting Ging in front of everyone topped it off

Man, I love Leorio. Best character in the show IMO.

Leorio's back and awesome. His nen debut was perfect in every way =). Wonder if he's an emitter, conjurer or specialist given his attack. Wasn't exactly clear if he was sending his arm through a portal or conjuring a new one at a distance.

It's been confirmed that he's an emitter
Source: the 2nd ~~opening~~ ending of the anime, in the manga Killua guessed he is either an Emitter or Enhancer basing on Hisoka's personality test.

Leorio's [punch](http://gfycat.com/WhiteTerribleBlackandtancoonhound) is a perfect way to shut someone up from a distance. You learn something new everyday.

Anywho, that episode was amazing, Leorio's enthusiasm to save Gon, is brilliant.

That enthusiasm stems from the very reason he wanted to be a Doctor. He already lost a friend remember?

Leorio, good job.

I missed Kurapika and Leorio so much.

I don't get why Gon suddenly got worse, in episode 132 or 133 we saw him on Killuas back, unconsious but still looked normal. Now hes radiating the dark Nen and covered in bloody bandages wtf?

He's probably steadily deteriorating until he dies, or something.

Weeeell Tsubone is huge.   
An old person tend to be shorter than they were in their youth, so Tsubone was roughly 10m when she was younger.

Let's not try to bring real world logic into anime, shall we?

This is a show where a boy temporarily became a man because he was pissed off to the point of wanting to murder someone.

And where a man can punch through a portal.

And where a guy did the same punch for decades without moving.

And where etc etc.

Watching Ging get hit by Leorio was so satisfying. 

I know that Ging is probably doing what he feels is best for Gon, but it still hurts to watch it.

he is just such an asshole about it.

I'm really surprised that they showed how his power works. That wasn't explained in the manga until like two weeks ago.

They do show it, I think: http://i37.mangapanda.com/hunter-x-hunter/325/hunter-x-hunter-2811405.jpg       

Especially the 2nd last panel on the left

It's true that it wasn't explained till much later.

GAAH! Stop teasing us with Kurapika! Damn it, when is it going to be next week already?

Also, the debut for Leorio's Nen ability has got to be one of the best in the series.

That was a pretty awesome return. I still want to learn what's the big deal with this glittery guy though. 

Also, this arc seems to be moving rather quickly

We should find out in a couple of episodes, at the rate the anime is going.
>> ARTICLE
Leorio for president?

Any finally I can say this:

Leorio was imply spoiled to be an emitter in ED 2.

Love how the "line" that follows Leorio's punch resembles a double helix like the structure of DNA.

Leorio, you da real MVP

Kind of a shame that they didn't show [Kurapika] (/s "and his collection").

That's not until the very end of this arc.

My god Leorio is a badass now :O When he punched Ging i was like "WTF....!!"  Really great episode. But now I start wondering what Kurapika is doing.

I really missed Gotou -- he's among my favorite characters in the show and Killua really [brings out his charm](http://imgur.com/a/A57ki).

>> ARTICLE
Leorio one of my best anime characters of all time. I really like his style and the sudden Nen usage on this episode totally freaked me out. He doesn't even know what Nen was, a few episodes back. But now to see him delivering a punch to Ging using a power similar to Knov, made me go completely mad. Leorio is da the real MVP. 
>> ARTICLE
does anyone remeber that gon couldt see hes father when tp too him, instead hes friend was what he tped too, becus he had friends with him !!!!!!!!?`what i say, only explation must be dat its a continue too quest for hes father and yes ofc now 100 episodes further we confirmed dat.

but maby its a hunt from the writer that leorio is like acting like we wanted it too. yet gind is strong in plenty too take that hit and play a fool great job with that, yet Ging is acting wierd i must say, there is much too be answered yet he only does hes job and dont care about anything else. they need to make people more intresting what i think though.

[I think I just saw a Aquarion and Phoenix Wright reference](http://gfycat.com/MerryBogusAardwolf)

That episode!!!

Everyone hating on Ging was great. Gon's response to the election was perfect (I kept saying the same thing, but let my desire to see Pariston lose cloud my judgment), and Pariston's response to being elected was fantastic.

But the ending just blew it all out of the water. Nanika is even cuter than Alluka. I felt so bad when she said 'kay while crying to Killua's order. I was so happy when Alluka stood up for her. A fantastic scene. A fanatic episode. A fantastic show.
>> ARTICLE
I've been really busy and only just not got the chance to watch it and color me impressed. I wasn't sure this show could get better, but it impresses every time. 

This episode is "Emmy" worthy!

For real. I think this anime has surpassed even shows like Breaking Bad for me. GIVE GON ALL THE EMMYS
>> ARTICLE
Nanika's eyes when she started tearing up floored me completely.
>> ARTICLE
[Hunter x Feels](http://i.imgur.com/zKVKmaj.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
The eyes are the (nearly always) hidden doorway to the soul.   When we enter a room, our souls dance from eye to eye in less than the blink of a second, at least I've perceived that in rare high-experience mode.  We "read" the face of the soul by that eye contact of a mere fraction of second, for each person in that room whose pupils are in a line of sight.  That fleeting eye-to-eye sensing colors our subconscious impression of each person from there onward.    

Likewise do the other fellow humans subconsciously gauge us.   I am not talking micro-facial expressions, I'm talking pupil to pupil contact at the first first fraction of a second.  Has anyone else experienced this?

In any case, to bring this back to Togashi's work -- the black cloud eyes of Nanika suggest a being that cannot so be gauged, and yet their hugeness suggests a great depth of that unknown.  Inhuman, even.   Her soul completely not knowable to humans.   Very scary.   

This makes the protests of Alluka defending her alter-ego's soul much stronger, like light-and-shadow in artwork.

My father left when I was 2 years old and the first time I saw him again was at my first day in school which was also my 7th birthday. That was exactly his face :D 
He looked like "Yeah, nice to see him and stuff but what should I do with this thing now?"

It's disapointed how Madhouse make him look not that sad because in the manga he look really sad :/ http://imgur.com/GJWQr2o

Not needed, the voice actor did a good job.
>> ARTICLE
He didn't look as sad, but that quick motion of him wiping his eyes hit really hard. 
>> ARTICLE
Pariston is the epitome of a chaotic neutral character. The type of character that just does stuff for the heck of it. These are normally very boring characters because they often have/need very weak motivations to do stuff. 

Pariston is one of my favorite characters in any anime though. His ending was amazing. We get a real honest emotion. Something he cared about. Having fun with the chairman who he respected deeply as a adversary.

That threat to Cheadle was also amazing. Danger beyond your comprehension little dog.
>> ARTICLE
> We get a real honest emotion. Something he cared about. Having fun with the chairman who he respected deeply as a adversary.

[maybe spoiler](/s "or do we? i mean he haven't been telling the truth about anything so far")

>> ARTICLE
Well he hasn't been lying at all either, everyone assumes hes a jerk, it just sounds like he wants to mess around according to HIS dialogue, everyone in the anime (almost everyone) has assumed that he's done something EVIL and CAN'T BE UP TO ANY GOOD, yet NO ONE has found any reason to suspect, they just do suspect that he's a bad guy
>> ARTICLE
This has been bugging me for a while. I never even once had a reason to hate Paristo and everyone was shitting on him. I mean there was no reason to judge him. Even if he is evil beyond belief, there still was no reason to hate him so far. Why people did, I have no idea. 
>> ARTICLE
Ging is really Chaotic Neutral too. I mean, he did abandon his kid so he could go have fun basically. Plus the way he cheated to create rules for the election was just like Pariston. 
>> ARTICLE
That's one supporting fact for them being brothers, or at least cousins. 
>> ARTICLE
The arguing between Ging and the crowd was hilarious. Also that scene with Killua and Something almost made me shed some manly tears. Only 2 more episodes to go :(
>> ARTICLE
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

Hell, it made me cry. Such a sweet scene between the two of them. Although I may have been a little bit more effected because I have a little sister and all. This show has made me cry quite a bit so far, and I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Let's hope they continue with Hunter x Hunter again, since the manga is on-going!
>> ARTICLE
It will be quite a while for that. I'm estimating a total of 6 years hiatus until there is enough source material to start the anime again. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah I'd say 4 at most, if they were going to start the anime up again. Most manga arcs take about a year. Extremely long ones coughcoughNarutocoughcough have take about 4 years. I think the Chimera Ant one was 3 years in total. Though this is counting the fact that he comes out of and stays out of hiatus. (which is what happened for the Chimera Ant arc)
>> ARTICLE
Pssh. He'll be in and out of hiatus so much it will make your head spin.
>> ARTICLE
Or he'll just stay on hiatus and disappoint you to no end.
>> ARTICLE
Yep :/
>> ARTICLE
Hiatus x Hiatus might be on-going but any anime continuation for it in the near future is impossible. The author has already took 3 weeks hiatus and now his hiatus is indefinite until a later announcement. I don't want to be a downer, but don't get your hopes up at all.
>> ARTICLE
People can say what the will about it just being a joke, but two new Dragon Quest games got announced and Hiatus x Hiatus is back. Where's your god now?
>> ARTICLE
Did he take back his hiatus? Just yesterday or the day before they announced that it was off indefinitely again.

It's sad really, they could've done a lot more in this universe.

Something (also called Nanika) is one of the most adorable things in anime IMHO at least.
>> ARTICLE
Except for the times Nanika crushes people to death for not granting her wishes, and indiscriminately killing people related to that person. 
>> ARTICLE
I find that side of her cute actually.
>> ARTICLE
To each his own, I guess. (   )
>> ARTICLE
But it's been stated several times that Nanika is actually a kind person(?) - there have never been any extreme requests after she heals someone/something, she accepts commands and asks nothing in return, so on and so forth. There's two conditions - if she is (1) complied with on her requests, and, (2) not asked to do any harm or do something that results in someone's personal gain (i.e. the butler's request to be a millionaire), the consequences are minimal.
>> ARTICLE
She's the extreme incarnation of "don't be greedy person, or other people will suffer."
>> ARTICLE
She is like the personification of "the button" 
>> ARTICLE
I cried during that scene with Killua and Something, and then I kept tearing up because I realized we only have 2 more episodes left and the preview said "A new journey". I don't know what I'm going to do without any more HxH in my life. :(

I am so glad that at least we got to see Gon and Ging meet before the anime ended though. I would have been incredibly upset if we didn't at least get that much. 
>> ARTICLE
It shouldn't be completely out of your life. There is still the manga to get caught up on! That being said there's only going to be 10 chapters between the end of the anime and where the manga is currently at, and this mangaka is extremely notorious for long and frequent hiatuses...
>> ARTICLE
WAIT WAIT WAIT! Its ending!? Like for good!? Or a break for a new season? I dont want this anime to end so soon
>> ARTICLE
It's ending.  The anime's pretty much caught up with the manga which has a bleak future itself.  I'm much more comfortable with it ending on a high note than degrading it with filler.

2 episodes left, oh well maybe hunter x hunter (2023) will have another arc if togashi will acctually make chapters

He's a great hunter but bad father.  His personality makes him good as a hunter, but not very personable with children I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Completely fumbles over his son crying, but when the answer is to give advice like you would a younger hunter? He's got that shit in the bag.
>> ARTICLE
Well said. He's an enigma as to why he is this way other than simply caring so much that for once he can't distance himself from the responsibility of taking care of someone he actually cares deeply for (his son). I mean, it's true, he made all of Greed Island for his son and the hunters knew that Gon cleared it, so even before the ants Gon must have become somewhat of a legend.

coughcoughMedakaBoxcoughcough That anime literally ends with a new character being introduced that obviously has a lot to do with the plot. Luckily I read the manga.

In other words, cliffhangers don't mean shit.
>> ARTICLE
You mean like the end of the Greed Island Final OVA?
>> ARTICLE
I had to start reading all the Manga when that happened, because I needed to know what happened next.  I started watching the first Hunter X Hunter series when it was at episode 10.
>> ARTICLE
Nanikas reaction reminded me of that sweet Ant girl that was reunited with her mother at the end of the Chimera-Ant arc. Such a sad and intimate moment between siblings, i coudnt help but cry. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah that was one of the saddest and cutest things Ive ever seen in an Anime. I really like Nanika now and its great how on first glimpse you think its a soulless demon and now its obvious that it has emotions on its own and should be treated likewise. Hunter X Hunter never ceases to amaze me.
>> ARTICLE
Nanika sad face: Hay.

Heartbreaking stuff right there.

These guys are amazing. In 5 minutes they made me like Alluka and Nanika more then any character Akame ga Kill ever came up with in the entire manga.
>> ARTICLE
You should remember that they've also had more than 100 episodes and chapters to build up in comparison to akame ga kiru

100 episodes is easier to grow with than what 10 episodes so far now?, same goes for manga,

349 chapters to akame ga kiru's 50 chapters

that's really not a fair comparison you're throwing out there 
>> ARTICLE
Akame is not a weekly manga. Its chapters are usually large(30-40 pages). 


>> ARTICLE
What is the point of bringing up Akame ga Kill? What does that have to do with this at all? Sure the scene was pretty good, but it doesn't even compare with the scene between Meruem and Komugi.
>> ARTICLE
It's a comparison. I see people crying over dead characters in Akame all the time. "We knew him for X episodes." "He was the best character and now he's dead." I never cared for a single character in that show/manga. But in a mere 5 minutes I went from not caring about Alluka and seeing Nanika as a tool to loving and caring for both of them.
>> ARTICLE
The comparison you're making is completely absurd and the two things are utterly unrelated.  What does a character being killed off even have anything to do with liking that character?? For the record, the scene between Alluka and Killua felt pretty gimmicky and superficial to me.  For me, two of the deaths later on in Akame ga Kill had way more emotional impact than this scene.  But again, I don't understand how that has anything to do with this scene.  Just don't make shitty unrelated comparisons for no reason, they're not helpful and they make no sense.
>> ARTICLE
Sigh, am I reall gonna do this......

No.

*Smiles and backs away slowly from the child.*

If you don't understand why making comparisons like that is extremely stupid, then you have the brain of a child.  At least attempt to defend your bullshit like a normal person instead of resorting to acting like an infantile prick.
>> ARTICLE
No. You don't deserve it. I was expressing my opinion and making a comparison that honestly still makes sense to me. And because you decided that you didn't understand/agree you became hostile for no apparent reason. but since you want my opinion so much, here is what I thought about most of the things you've told me.

> The comparison you're making is completely absurd and the two things are utterly unrelated

This is opinion, not fact

> What does a character being killed off even have anything to do with liking that character??

Missing the point

> For the record, the scene between Alluka and Killua **felt** pretty gimmicky and superficial **to me**.

I don't care. I've never cared.

> For me, two of the deaths later on in Akame ga Kill had way more emotional impact than this scene.

Don't agree at all, but that's just my shitty opinion. Fact is that this is just your opinion and for what I think of that, see above.

> But again, **I don't understand** how that has anything to do with this scene.

First fact you've yet stated.

> Just don't make ~~shitty~~ *seemingly* unrelated comparisons for no reason, they're not helpful *to me* and they make no sense *to me*.

Corrected above.

> If you don't understand why making comparisons like that is extremely stupid

Making a comparison is never stupid. A comparison can be far fetched, maybe even wrong, but there is no harm in *making* a comparison.

> At least attempt to defend your bullshit

I'm in no way obligated to do anything I don't care for.

> like a normal person

There is no such thing as a normal person. If there is, he doesn't like anime.

> infantile prick

Wow, calm down. Did I steal your lunch money? Did I call you a bitch? What did I do to deserve this? You should check yourself a bit. Next time you write or say something, think "Am I being overly hostile for no real reason? Does being aggressive help me in trying to accomplish what I'm trying to do?" If the answers are yes, no respectively, you should work on that.

My overall opinion of you is that you're honestly not worth the time I'm taking writing this. I may be wrong, but that is simply the impression you've left in me. So, no, I'm not going to "defend" myself just because you want me to, I'm not going to get upset or touched by anything you say and I'm not replying to you anymore.

I hope this helps you in some way, but if it doesn't (it probably won't), whatever. I've watched the second season of SAO so it's not like I'm above wasting my time.

Ofcourse I do. This is starting to get fun though.

Wut? Autism does speak? It's not a sentient thing child. It actually doesn't speak.

I feel that Alluka not having any downside to using her power makes her too overpowered and a terrible plot tool in a way. I mean i kept thinking she has a down side, but in this episode it revealed that she had none. So basically she can grant anything Killua asks, which is pretty stupid plot wise if you ask me.

[spoiler](/s "togashi better tie it in.") 

[i mean, you don't leave an unlimited wish genie in there without any explanation. could solve any problem that came up then."](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
I was under the impression that any commands made still have a price, it's just that Killua doesn't have to pay them. Instad, they're shifted over to the next person who "uses" him/her (that's why Kil paid basically no price for the computer, but then Tsubone did).

I'm not a manga reader so either this was already mentioned or I'm making this up without realizing it.
>> ARTICLE
Wishes are what entail a price to be paid.  "Commands" such as the ones Killua issued do not have a price.  It depends upon the wording.  And I'm assuming that Killua is the only one allowed to make "commands" (hence Illumi's desire to control him).

Although I'm a manga reader and I'm still a little confused as to whether a "wish" to heal someone doesn't actually entail a price, or it's just that Killua commanded her to do it.  I'd have to go back and see how he worded his request to heal Gon.


My best advice would be to just go back and watch Illumi's deductions from this episode until it makes some kind of sense.
>> ARTICLE
>little confused as to whether a "wish" to heal someone doesn't actually entail a price

Killua specifically mentioned that hte price is never cruel after healing. So there'll be a price, but no one's gonna be dying.

I guess I was mostly right then, and it's just that only Killua can issue commands.
>> ARTICLE
Since Killua doesn't want her to take his commands he'd only use it in extreme emergencies so although it could be overpowered, Killua still avoids it however possible. If things go well she'll never use her powers again.
>> ARTICLE
So basically it's a bullshit restraint 
>> ARTICLE
Still. There has to be catch. If not, every time we see one of the mains get hurt/die we'll be like "Meh, nanika". The show will get boring.

I'm guessing there's either a downside, or someone is going to lock her nen like they did with the spider's boss, and the new arc is going to be them trying to unlock it or some shit.
>> ARTICLE
Sorta like the dragonballs in DBZ
>> ARTICLE
They mentioned you can't bring the dead back to life no matter what.
>> ARTICLE
There are some theories as to the full nature of Nanika's power based off of some little info we've gotten since the manga's continuation, but for now this is what we have.

It's not completely terrible since it still falls in lines with Nen's basic rules: any wish made to Nanika results in corresponding payment to someone else and Nanika can do basically anything but only via a command from a single person. Since Killua is the only one who can make use of commanding Nanika, there is still an (arguably) appropriate restriction applied to the power (I can do literally anything if and only if one specific person commands me to do it. No one else can issue the command. I cannot do it of my own free will.)
>> ARTICLE
There is probably just one guy somewhere whose life is garbage because of Nanika's karmic blowoff.

One could say that someone might me Alluka/Nanika herself, perhaps? Just a thought.

Nanika is not Alluka backwards.

Not in english, but in japanese. It's the japanese Kanji pronounced backwards.
>> ARTICLE
It has been speculated due to the current manga arc that Nanika's usefulness and existence will be further explored as we go on... I won't elaborate due to spoilers. While she is sort of a deus ex machina character inherently, I feel that the author will properly balance her.
>> ARTICLE
I would like to take spoilers for 500 please
>> ARTICLE
At your own risk then:

[HxH manga spoilers beyond anime](/s "The next arc involves different organizations and people wanting to explore the Dark Continent that is outside of their normal lands. It's a huge risk because there are several extremely dangerous entities there, including one species called the Ai, a gas-like species that desires co-dependence. Because Nanika says 'ai' which is usually seen as a truncated "hai", many people are speculated that an Ai has in fact co-inhabited Alluka's body, and that this Ai is Nanika.")
>> ARTICLE
Knowing Togashi, he'll balance that shit out no problem. Plus Killua stated that he won't be having any wishes himself. What good is a wish granting machine if nobody is granting any wishes.

Maybe Something will start granting its own wishes.

I wish she wouldn't!

It's weird because even tho Killua is always talking about killing Illumi he keeps calling her "aniki" or even "Illu".

That's a weird fucking family.

That was cute as hell.

Cheadle is one of my favourite characters, seeing her get made a fool of by Pariston and Ging even tho she's very smart is awesome. Pariston is so damn great, when you think it's all over and he finally had what he wanted he goes all "I quit my role as a president" and fucks with you a last time.

Oh btw, Goto please? Has everybody forgotten about him? That's just rude as fuck.


GODDAMNN I LOVE THIS SHOW, it's so much better than the so called "big 3".
>> ARTICLE
What are the "big 3"? 

I always thought HxH was the best anime that I have watched yet and none have come anywhere close to its epic quality.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece, Naruto and Bleach are called "Big 3" for their popularity. I don't think they're even close to the quality of Hunter x Hunter though.
>> ARTICLE
the big 3 (one piece, bleach and naruto) is a title from the past when the 3 is at their highest glory, now it just not true anymore (except for one piece  and HxH was a candidate to be included into the big in the past but fall short because the manga went hiatus for a long time.

edit:the title is  also because of manga sale rather than anime
>> ARTICLE
The big 3 are Naruto, One Piece, and 
Bleach. I have watched all three, and i like HxH more, i feel like they are worth watching, but it seems like a lot of people on this subreddit hate them. Well, i have only watched 15 anime, so they probably have more experience than i do. 
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is good although entirely formulaic. Bleach overpowered the fuck out of its main character to the point where none of the other characters matter. I have never read/watched Naruto so I have no idea. I've been with One Piece for seven years so I'll probably ride it out to the end (in like 15 fucking years . . .) The manga is loads better than the anime. HXH benefits from having all the source material out at the time of production and no fanfictiony filler arcs. Although, beyond that, its conflict resolution and character development are second to none, in the sense that its actually original. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it was One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach

The conversation between Gon and his father was great even though it made me sad that Gon apologized to him for Kite. I absolutely loved Ging vs crowd.

>> ARTICLE
No, we didn't need that. Him not smiling for the first time was all we needed.
>> ARTICLE
Even though this episode was fantastic, I'm not sure how I feel about the fact that Killua is going to have an infinite wish granting machine with him from now on. 

Also, why didn't Killua command Nanika to teleport him to Gon in the first place? Was it just because he was afraid of Illumi needling him again?
>> ARTICLE
Killua specifically said that he didn't want to issue commands to Alluka/something so I don't think he'll be getting any wishes, the thing with healing Gon is that it was the only option to make him better.
>> ARTICLE
Sure he doesn't *want* to, but he clearly will if he has to (e.g. the two-choice wish, teleporting Illumi). If Alluka had been in the Ant arc, there would have been zero tension because he *could* use her even if he didn't. Deus ex machina are destructive to suspension of disbelief and drama just by being around. Of course, this is Togashi we're talking about, which makes me think she won't be around much longer...
>> ARTICLE
Do you not remember the rules?

If Killua starts making commands that Something should kill someone, or make him stronger somehow.  Then he's gonna get crushed the next time she starts making requests.

He is able to command Something because he has a good relationship with her.  No other reason than that.  If he were to start breaking promises and commanding her again, after he promised that he wouldn't, she'll most likely flip her shit and take it out on Killua.
>> ARTICLE
Well there were a few things Killua wanted. First of all he didn't want to abuse Nanika. He views her as family and just constantly commanding her for things isn't what he wants their relationship to be like.

Second, and possibly more important, he was trying to hide the fact that he *could* issue commands to Nanika from the rest of his family, because if they knew, they'd for sure try to control him, Illumi would probably stick more needles into him.

See by making the overpowered wish granting device a *character*, specifically one that is close to Killua, one who Killua wants to live a free life, they avoid having to go back to it later. Nanika/Alluka's freedom is more important to Kil.

I think we should take a look at Killua's behavior throughout this entire arc. He's been saving Gon, but he definitely hasn't enjoyed it. He knows it has to be done, but he certainly doesn't like what he's doing. He tries at every corner to not use Alluka/Nanika like the others have, tries to treat her as a person rather than just a machine for endless desire. He's been very determined, but has he seemed like a hero? If he has, when is it he has been most heroic? Was it when he was saving Gon? Or was it when he was saving Alluka?

This episode when he told Nanika she couldn't 'come out any more' was the first time he truly deviated from that ideal. He tried to control Nanika, in the opposite way to which Illumi would control her, but control her all the same. He realized quickly the mistake he had made with the help of Alluka who would reasonably be upset with her brother hurting Nanika.

Question though.  I feel as though I missed something.  Gon said Kite was turned into a little girl?  When did this happen?  Did this happen in the anime and I somehow missed it?  Or is this something that will be explained in the future?  As far as I saw or remember, Kite was dead and that's why Gon went nuts.

[This scene when Pariston was talking with Cheadle](http://i.imgur.com/4JPyhXX.jpg)

I expected Pariston to take off his face to reveal he was Hisoka all along using his texture surprise and bungygum nen. I got chills for a second, the way he refereed to everyone as toys and saying he only wanted to be close to Nereto to play with him. for a split second it made sense that he was. it was like it was Hisokas long game. Like he doesn't just want to fight skill but wits too. Fight Ging and Nereto The Zodiacs and everyone, and when gon and lehario handed him the win, it took it as a loss and went off to fight them or find something else to do.


Please tell me I'm not the only one, his nose, his tone his manner its too similar.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so, bro. Both have similarities, but they play different leagues ^^

But they would make a game of chess terribly interesting to see who could outwit who in a total mind game.
>> ARTICLE
Hisoka uses his Texture Surprise to disguise a piece when no one's looking.
>> ARTICLE
Brothers maybe??? 
>> ARTICLE
The greatest clue that Hisoka wasn't Pariston is that at the very beginning of the arc Illumi mentions that if Hisoka wasn't fucking around he could have fought the chairman and Hisoka was disappointed. If Hisoka wanted to fight the chairman and he was Pariston he would have gone and fought him during CA.
>> ARTICLE
This is assuming Illumi knows wtf Hisoka wants or does, and considering he debates killing kulia and Ilumi half the time I doubt he does.
>> ARTICLE
If I had to argue that anyone "knows" Hisoka I would put all of my money on Illumi. Yes, Hisoka isn't trust worth in the fact that he prioritizes his goals first at all times, however Illumi considers him a friend. So much so that he was willing to bail him out of the Phantom Troupe. So yeah I would think, Illumi knows what Hisoka wants.

> Illumi mentions that if Hisoka wasn't fucking around he could have fought the chairman 

Not to mention I just said this.

Shit this episode was sooo good like seriously I thought "Something(Nanika?)" was like some super evil part of Alluka and Killua wanted it gone because it was evil and stuff but Something was just as much his sister as Alluka (Like some Schizophreni syndrome thingy) and loved him too so sad Something needed to go so noone could abuse her power made me tear up... Great job and soon Hiatus.

And seriously Alluka and Killua's sibling relationship is probably the healthiest one i've seen in anime


And that ending left me teary


And I didn't even say anything about Pariston like seriously I take back everything bad I've said about that guy he should be respected as the smart individual he is, I know that todays society isn't built for smart people so I can kinda feel empathy with him (Not that im genius level but I can put myself in his situation) when you're that smart you're going to have bad time because people don't understand you and you will become arrogant and alienated and that's why he likes to play with people and Netero was his equal that's why he was so happy being vice-chairman and shit that some deep shit if you think about, smart people want challenges (Equals)

I finally caught up on the one of the best anime shows I've seen. Ging and Gon's argument was amazing. It fit Gon's personality so well. And I can't believe they made me feel as bad for Something as I did for Alluka. I thought I'd just find it creepy but that scene was emotional.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty great episode! They're really good at making their audience actually feel for the character. The next episode kinda feels like a new arc because of the tittle hopefully it isn't because there's at least one more thing that needs to be wrapped up, sucks that the anime is end for another 11 years (maybe more since there's a new dragons quest coming out) :(

Jeez.
Ging and Gon meet and talk and Ging acts like a father: feels.

Pariston wins, immediately hads everything over to Cheadle and then has a real heart-to-heart (sorta): feels.

Nanika crying: so many feels :( "Killua...I love you." I am dead. RIP in pieces, my heart.

That sketchy sorta look for her emotions is amazing. It's interesting how it's sorta similar to the Anti-Spirals from TTGL and yet it feels cute in this instance.

All in all an amazing episode. This is the kinda stuff you don't expect from most shonen, I think. Emotional investment in the characters and their growth throughout the series. I am going to miss this show in two weeks when it ends.

Totally agree with you!

Gon being reunited with Ging and Killua reaching an understanding with Alluka/Nanika. Too many feels. The sibling bond between them has just gotten stronger, I imagine. Also, Alluka/Nanika is just about the cutest character in anime ever.

I'm with you. Let these clowns dick-ride the series because of how good the past episodes were. But this arc is too stupid. "derr I know! instead of letting kurapika avenge his klan letz just add a Zoldick family member that can.... grant wishes! herr''

You're getting down-voted because the episode had pretty good animation. Scenes when the show gets a more "watercolory" look are there for artistic value and are actually more expensive to animate than what we usually see from the show.

Am I the only one who thinks the Chimera Ant arc sort of sucked, and whatever this arc is now is just horrible? Also, the Greed Island arc wasn't too great either..

This is awesome, I love how Hunter x Hunter powers are so unique and creative.... and pretty fucking creepy like this one. I was thinking "Well that girl is super adorable and you only have to concede her stupid wishes, what could possibly go wrong!?" then she goes "Give me your liver"... "... oh". It felt like a horror movie.

Awesome episode as usual.

By the way, kinda offtopic: what's up with anime (it's not only HxH) purposingly having "male" characters that look completely like a woman? Is there a reason for this? Seems like a weird clich.
>> ARTICLE
In this case it's different because Alluka is actually a transgender girl, she identifies as a woman and therefore probably dresses and styles accordingly. 
>> ARTICLE
Togashi doesn't seem to care very much about gender at all.  So he draws characters of either body type.  Also, it's not like males never wore what Kalluto does.

Alluka is very different from traditional 'male' characters that look like women in that the only one who refers to Alluka as a female is Killua, who is the closest to her, meaning that Alluka while is biologically male identifies with being a girl.  None of the other family members care much about Alluka's identity, so they refer to Alluka as the biological gender, if they even consider Alluka human at all.  This was very consistent in the manga and it seems the anime adapts it as well, so it hardly seems unintentional.

I totally agree with you. The only time I skipped the OP was when I was marathoning the show in order to catch up which was around episode 85. 

I don't think they'll ever change the actual song, but I will be sad if they do.

Gotta say, I don't like the second verse of the ED as much though.

I like both, but as a standalone I think I prefer the current one more. But the first verse is way more emotional because Chimera Ant arc.

If they do change the OP song, I hope it's just to use this version:

Remember when this was about Gon the "happy go lucky" kid that played with a fishing rod and just wanted to meet his dad? A "couple" of episodes later and we have something different... It's absolutely amazing!

Here we go with some more stories about Killua and his family, one of my favorite characters in the Hunter x Hunter Universe! When we are on favorite characters, looks like we will get some more Hisoka next episode! Holy shit this anime is amazing!

Honestly, that might be a flaw with this show. 

The first few episodes aren't the best opening to an incredible series.

Whatever happened to his fishing rod anyways?

He loosed it.

Yeah I remember starting this anime expecting typical shonen hero. Boy.... was I wrong.

Good episode. Pariston looked fabulous in his new suit. And there are many more to come! Also Ging hiding like usual. And finally we get Alluka! She has one of the greatest powers, but also has huge consequences. [Who can say no to this?](http://i.imgur.com/xdGtVU1.jpg) [Also that Sailor Moon reference.](http://i.imgur.com/xXpuKnL.jpg)

Also for anyone wondering, Alluka is physically a boy but she thinks of herself as a girl. Killua is the only person that refers to her as a girl because he's the only one who has a close bond with her. 
>> ARTICLE
Around how many chapters does each episode cover? I'm worried that the anime will catch up too quickly to the manga.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is past this arc so no need to worry about that.  The arc after literally just started in the manga so either the anime will have to have fillers, go on haitus or be cancelled for the time being. 

That doesn't include the risk of the Togashi disappearing again.
>> ARTICLE
Two things I've heard:
Madhouse detest filler;
and Togashi apparently said that he won't let the anime catch up (not sure how he'd manage but apparently that's what he said)
>> ARTICLE
That is simply not possible. Unless he works double or even triple and shows his manuscripts to Madhouse immediately (which is very unlikely. There were only so much occurrences when mangaka spoiled the ending to the director and it was near the end of a series anyways.)there is no way for the anime not to catch up with the manga. The episodes are aired several weeks after they are done by the studio.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I don't see any way that the show can't take a break.

Anime is ending in September, when Madhouse is releasing their new series Parasyte that is replacing HxH.

No fear. Parasyte is amazingly good.

Thanks for that, I was kind of confused about Alluka's gender.

Random Trivia Fact:

The author of HxH is married to the author of Sailor Moon
>> ARTICLE
Another piece of Trivia: In the series "Bakuman" the mangakas are inspired by real life ones "Kazuya Hiramaru" is one half inspired by Togashi's laziness and simple drawings and [by the end of the series](/s "he ends up marrying a Aoki a female mangaka") and people think this is a parallel to his relation with his wife.

Can someone explain to me Alluka's gender?  Killua's dad refers to Alluka as a him during one of the flashbacks, but then Killua references Alluka as a her...

For these of you who don't remember enough info about the gates, the first gate weight 4 tons and each door after it doubles.

What would happen if Meruem denied 4 of Alluka's requests in a row? I'm not too sure but I think the manga people said Meruem is still one of the strongest canon characters. Is Alluka like all-powerful or would he not be able to kill someone stronger than him?

If someone knows the answer but is a manga spoiler I'd appreciate a spoiler tag :)
>> ARTICLE
So if any more OP humans/creatures appear all the Zoldycks need to do is wish for something massive and then crate her up and send her as a gift to the enemy
>> ARTICLE
i think (and hope) that powers like this work on everyone but are relatively easy to avoid (kill alluka before she makes the fourth request) or else they would be meaningless
>> ARTICLE
Since you got a light one, I'd add my own input based on what is likely not going to be adapted into anime for a very long while, if at all, which would be horrid.

[EXTREMELY HEAVY MANGA SPOILERS](/s "It seems that Alluka has an Ai in her, which given is one of the great calamities, if it's a B+ or A rank creature, then perhaps the nothingness of Ai is far less limited than even Mereum.  So Ai could still crush Mereum as well as it could crush any bug, although as a wish for humanity, who knows, millions or more could die.")
>> ARTICLE
When do they reveal "that" ^. I think I probably missed that in my read through.
>> ARTICLE
[Manga spoilers](/s "They didn't ever say that specifically, it's just a theory.  However, they did say that the 'thing' inside Alluka was from the outside world, so it's possible it's one of the calamities...")
>> ARTICLE
They don't. It's just a popular theory.
>> ARTICLE
Meruem would just eat her and take her powers and be even more unstoppable
>> ARTICLE
1) We don't even know if Alluka is using a nen ability

2) We don't even know if Meruem can gain nen abilities from non-ants
>> ARTICLE
They actually introduced his ability to gain nen abilities by eating others when he ate a human nen user who was originally guarding the palace before Meruem took over. 
>> ARTICLE
the HxH world is so unstable, two people meeting could spell the end of life.
>> ARTICLE
I suspect Meruem would just kill her off the moment she started talking. Physically, she is just a child.
>> ARTICLE
Depends which Meruem we're talking about here. Near birth Meruem, or near death Meruem?
>> ARTICLE
[Extremely light manga spoilers](/s "There's nothing to suggest that even Meruem would be able to live through it. We aren't given a ton of examples of people dying, because her family is afraid of her powers and locks her up. However considering her near infinite wish granting power, it's unlikely anyone would live through it.")
>> ARTICLE
maybe in maruem's case, she would just take an arm or something depending on the gravity of the previous wish.

I haven't read your comment yet, but how light are these spoilers? Will the anime catch up to it soon?

Good point, edited.
>> ARTICLE
Ok thanks!
>> ARTICLE
So We know that Killua is going to try and heal Gon with Alluka's power, but I wonder what her requests are going to be.
>> ARTICLE
Probably nothing too bad, as they mention in the show that last person to get their wish granted was Milluki and that he wished for newest computer "at the time".

The requests might get a bit more serious after saving Gon (or whatever Killua's first wish will be), though.
>> ARTICLE
Dunno, but looking back at similair experiences in HxH and my guess would be that the newest computer was a bigger request than anyone would expect
>> ARTICLE
Following on to this, becoming a millionaire made the next demands be the person's liver, duodenum, spine and brain. If the computer costs more than a million pounds, the requests could be even worse. Or because Alluka and Killua like each other so much (at least Killua does anyway) the requests could be simple (e.g. play with my toys with me).
>> ARTICLE
i don't think alluka can choose her requests. that would ruin the whole thing
>> ARTICLE
I think that sort of dehumanizes her. If she can't control what she requests or when she requests, and the size of requests is determined by what was last asked of her, what is left of her free will? At that point she's just a wish exchanging ATM, a conduit through which exchanges are made.

I wonder if this is why the father refers to her as an It, and her mother doesn't think she's human? 

I'm not disagreeing, by the way. Just exploring the hypothesis.
>> ARTICLE
That's why her dad says she's not human and calls her a thing. 
>> ARTICLE
It was also 444 Million Dollars she got... So.... Computers arn't usually worth that...
>> ARTICLE
"The best available" Can imply a lot... prolly not your standard desktop PC, but if you start looking into the price of supercomputers they can be way higher than that.
>> ARTICLE
The supercomputer Titan cost $945 million.
>> ARTICLE
Thankfully, the flashback/thoughtbubble implied that the computer was a standard desktop. Probably a pretty bitchin /r/pcmasterrace level Desktop, but still.
>> ARTICLE
Na, the rest of the computer is in the mountain their house is on
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if Alluka has any control over her requests.
>> ARTICLE
They did say that  she doesn't make any requests to her parent's and siblings. So I'm guessing yes.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking, since the Zoldyck family is so heartless, why not just throw in a random person after you make a big wish, so that you can reset the request difficulty. Seems like Illumi did it with that random lady who had to pay for the millionaire wish with her body, and after that the Zoldycks seem to have made requests as usual.  
>> ARTICLE
They may be heartless, but they clearly have their limits. Otherwise they wouldn't go through the trouble of locking her up. 
>> ARTICLE
Problem is they might be caught in the collateral of deaths like the Millionaire person was. It could very easily be them that would be part of the 67 deaths.
>> ARTICLE
They aren't heartless, they only kill for the money. One of their major rules is to avoid killing innocent bystanders during a job, so they do care for the lives of people, just not the ones they are ordered to kill.

And also that probably wasn't some random lady. I assume Illumi had a request to kill her and her lover but hadn't accepted it yet, so he decided to blackmail her that if she followed his instructions he would deny the assassination request.
>> ARTICLE
I just figured that the Zoldycks had already realized that the person closest to the victim will also die. So by fulfilling the requests asked, the lady and her lover(the assumed close person) would be fine. 

What they probably hadn't expected was the fact that the next three requests are proportionate to the last wish granted. They learned that rule after the lady and 67 other people died.
>> ARTICLE
> I assume Illumi had a request to kill her and her lover but hadn't accepted it yet

The Zoldycks don't allow their butlers to take lovers while in their service. She and her lover were both butlers, and that was why Illumi was threatening to kill them. This was explained in the manga, but they skipped over it in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Killua playing in the sandbox was so cute, I hope that Killua is able to grant her requests.

>> ARTICLE
Damn, Pariston trying to manipulate votes already. They almost didn't catch that too, if it wasn't for Cheadle. Guy's just constantly scheming.
>> ARTICLE
Everytime something like that happens I remember that one I saw the first episode of HxH (2011) I thought "Aw jeez, another kids anime".

But seriously that was a great episode!
The introduction of Alluka was perfectly executed, when you first see her you think "why is she a monster?" and then she turns into a horror film panda.
So how you avoid it? you refuse her requests. Oh wait nvm you'll explode if you do that lol.
Seeing how she is I wonder if she actually has a personality because all we've seen from her this episode is her making requests and fulfilling other's requests.
I'm really curious to see what will she ask killua to do, considering that when someone asked to be a millioner she asked someone's organs.

I'm also wondering who were the chairmen before Netero.

Speaking of Netero I think there's another reason he is hiding for why he chose Pastrama (lel) to be his second-in-command.
There is no way he would choose someone as shady as him to have so much power just because he can't stand him.

I'm also wondering about how Alluka got her power, I'm not quite sure if she had it since birth and it's most likely not nen related.
>> ARTICLE
Alluka's power is interesting in the fact that it bases itself on human nature. It's harmless as long as you make a harmless request like young Killua did. And, it's also harmless to the person who makes a large request. The damage is put onto the next person who makes a wish. 

Thinks there's a few comments on human nature going on here. Maybe similar to the ones being made in the Chimera ant arc. 
>> ARTICLE
You know now that you say it like that, it really is a philosophical power.

The transition to the ending song this time freaked me out more than the episode itself. It sounded so awkwardly placed.

>> ARTICLE
Guys, I think I found a loophole: basically you delay the requests, such as if she ask you for your brain you promise to give it to her after you're dead.
>> ARTICLE
[tiny tiny manga spoiler](/s "Yes you can delay it.. One of the Butlers was asked to give a fingernail, she willingly gave a fingernail then hid from Alluka.. With the Butler hidden Alluka couldn't give her any requests")
>> ARTICLE
She asks Yes or No questions with immediate effects.
>> ARTICLE
One question. 

Why was Beans looking at the box with the votes? I knew he had to count them, but they kinda made it dramatic(?). I feel like I didn't understand something.
>> ARTICLE
Assuming he was finishing counting the votes while monologue
>> ARTICLE
My assumption is Pariston went through the votes, as the top is ripped off and the contents spilled on the floor. Seems Rat-like to me.
>> ARTICLE
That's the most likely. The kinda scared look on Beans face, the flashback of Netero saying he wanted the Vice-Chairman to be someone he hates and the votes on the floor and Pariston being the Rat Zodiac. Your assumption makes the most sense.
>> ARTICLE
Alluka's power just baffles me, it has to be one of the least explainable powers.
>> ARTICLE
Its actually pretty simple. If u want a wish u need to fulfill 3 requests. Then the next person has to fulfill even harder requests and if they fail 4 they die and their loved ones too. Then it resets. 

Now there is deepeer stuff than that but thats all u need to know for now. They will explain the rest in the coming eps.
>> ARTICLE
its just nen. the condition is extremely potent, so the ability is that much more powerful. 


>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
The one flaw I see in this is that she could basically go around yelling requests that cant be fulfilled and kill off an entire population. She doesn't need a big prior wish as they showed, a couple requests for a lift and a piggyback ride were enough to kill two. Just how does her power impose any limitations on herself? 

Doesnt seem like a valid trade-off, thinking about the Full Metal Alchemist rules for Alchemy, equivalent exchange.
>> ARTICLE
Well thats why they have her locked up. So she doesnt go around murdering hundreds of ppl with her requests.

As for "equivalent exchange" no such concept even exists in nen so that doesnt really matter. All that matters is that a power is not omnipotent and hers isnt bcuz requests need to be fulfilled, she cant use it herself, and a bunch of other things that havent been explained yet so its ok.
>> ARTICLE
She probably can't fulfill her own wishes, she can't control the requests she makes or who gets hurt if they are denied.
>> ARTICLE
Of course she can control who gets hurt. The condition clearly says, the target of the request dies, and that person's loved ones. At a minimum of 1 other person, at a maximum of infinitum. 

She'd make the perfect assassin thinking of it. Make minor requests but undoable ones to spouses or family members, and watch the true target go POP. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
[Manga Spoiler](/s "Later on its shown that instead of making "requests/wishes" to Alluka, Killua can issue "commands", which is basically the same as a wish without the gigantic fallout that follows it.. Also Killua can make multiple commands in a row, making it completely OP.. Its the biggest reason why Ilummi wanted to control Killua. Equivalent Exchange or anything of the sort doesn't really apply to Alluka's power")
>> ARTICLE
I dont think Kurapika's power was all that paltry at all, considering the starting point of his power. He effectively went from average nen user to absolute power over the spiders. Had his starting power been higher, the sacrifice might not necessarily have been that big.
>> ARTICLE
you do realise that "absolute powers over the spiders" means that he risks his one life to possibly delete many lifes which means it is no equivalent trade
>> ARTICLE
The first point you make is I assume the reason they have her locked up. She is dangerous even though she doesn't seem to have any malice. She is almost like a wish granting and requesting robot.  

And are you saying the equivalent exchange is not at all in the wishers favor if you think about how each wish implies tougher requests after it? 1 million dollars for a liver, spine, and duodenum aka death isn't a very good trade.
>> ARTICLE
Okay let me explain this in a different example.

"Normal" Nen user - Has to expend aura to manifest his/her power. More Nen used, the stronger the power. A 1 on 1 relation. Conditional power requires a sacrifice or situational condition in order to increase it. For example, you have more power versus a Zodiac, at the cost of having no power versus anyone else. Again, a 1 on 1 relation.

Alluka's power - She gets to kill ANYone, by making bullshit requests. All the power, none of the cost.
In addition, imagine the following situation; She hasn't used her power yet nor granted any wishes. Because she hasn't granted any wishes yet, the value of any requests she needs fulfilled is effectively 0. BUT at the cost of 0, anyone can get an infinitely big wish granted.

So neither Alluka nor the wisher paid any cost. Now the next person will be met with requests according to the size of the wish. But there is no guarantee she'll ever get to request anything again, but even if she did, that wont be at the cost of anything of hers or the wisher.

It wouldnt even make sense if her power was to somehow transfer her ability onto the target. The target could pay 0 in requests the first time and get anything he/she wants, or the target could pay an infinite amount and could comparatively get nothing.

But the point is, Alluka doesn't follow the laws of Nen carefully explained by the series.
>> ARTICLE
Well sure alluka can kill anyone with requests but if they fulfill them they get any wish granted. And what if they wish for alluka to die? You dont see the trade off there? The main point of her ability anyway is that it is easiest to get your wish when the level is at zero. Nothing about nen says there needs to be a cost for anything. Only that an ability cant be omnipotent. Allukas ability is not but its infinite in possibility good or bad. It fits perfectly with the rules of nen as explained by togashi and his manga. Idk where you are getting your rules from but its not the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I think you misunderstand her or I do.  

> She gets to kill ANYone, by making bullshit requests.  

I don't think she wants to kill anyone, that is just what her power does. Quite a cost if you ask me, you are compelled to make requests of people and if they don't comply you have to kill them. I doubt she could not kill them if she wanted.

Also it seems like her ability is similar to the Ant who could give others nen powers. I assume there was a similar trade off of requests there, in that they had to pay something to get their ability.  

Alluka is essentially an version of the red button that you get 1 million dollars but somebody will die. The trade is made even if it doesn't affect you.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, but think of this. If the cost of your power doesn't need to be paid by yourself, the rules of Nen just don't apply. Imagine Gon going super saiyan again but this time he developed it to sap power off everyone else. Cue the all-powerful dude at no cost of his own. Why would someone like Kurapika put the sacrfice of potentially his own life on the line, when he could put everyone else's at risk.
>> ARTICLE
if you want to have a profit of your power yourself you have to pay the price yourself. if someone else profits of your power anyone else can pay the price.  
at least that's how i understood it
>> ARTICLE
Because that power of Gon's and Kurapika's powers would benefit themselves. What benefit is Alluka getting? I guess it depend on how you view Alluka, I imagine she is more trapped in her circumstances while you view it as her exploiting her circumstances.
>> ARTICLE
But then you defeat your own point :p. Nen has no morality.

Haha lets just wait and see what happens in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I have a feeling my viewpoint is mainly because of what we have seen so far. As soon as she asks to be set free my view will change, and I even expect this to happen, but in my head I imagine judging an episode that hasn't happened yet almost like thought crimes lol.

>> ARTICLE
The exchange doesnt need to benefit her though. Pitou's power was to heal others. Still cost her though. It's about the requirement of manifesting the power. So Alluka's power comes out of NOWHERE at first, costs nothing to maintain and then effectively puts a debt on the next target of the requests, if there even is a next target.

Perhaps it would be safer to say she puts a curse on someone. That curse is met with some heavy conditions, which explains its power, and explains why someone not all-powerful could cast it. If that person fulfills the requests they have complete power over her, but they never use it that way. Which would be a weakness on her part that's just not exploited. BUT that still doesn't cover why one person covers the cost of the previous wish. I wouldnt call that "fair" according to the power exchange principles.
>> ARTICLE
pitou could also heal herself
>> ARTICLE
Think of it this way. Kurapika put a limit on himself where he gains extra strength. because he can only kill people of the Phantom Troupe. She gains extra power and her rule is. If you grant someones wish, the next person must pay the consequences. The other people aren't using nen, but she/he is so they get power that way.

The other people are just considered outside forces.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
As Killua's father said he is not normal, he is something else.

It is very likely that her power doesn't involve nen at all.
>> ARTICLE
Every power in this series involves nen. Alluka is simply a specialist and her powers came out of nowhere like most other speialists.
>> ARTICLE
lol it should be noted that, as consistent as Hunter x Hunter usually is with its rules, "specialist" basically just means, "This shit doesn't fit anywhere else, and doesn't adhere to any pre-designated rules."

It's essentially the writer's way of getting to make up whatever bullshit power he wants.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm you have a point, it might not involve nen at all. But that's sort of a catch 22. If there is another path to power than Nen, the rules of Nen need not apply at all, to still get Nen power. Alternatively why would someone die when they run out of Nen, when it isnt the absolute power.
>> ARTICLE
It's all up to speculation but i believe that the nature of his power may be revealed in the upcoming manga arcs.
>> ARTICLE
It's speculation indeed, and perhaps I'm taking it a bit too far. But for an anime/manga that goes into great detail on why something is like it is (love the narration), it seems.. inconsistent. Hope it gets explained further!

[Manga Spoilers](/s "It's more than just "nen", at least to the extent that the show has portrayed nen for the viewers. People who are paying attention to the current manga arc will realize Alluka is connected to the new continent...")

[Manga Spoilers](/s ""Loose" evidence? Togashi could hardly spell it out for us any more than he already has")

[Manga Spoilers](/s "Perhaps I portrayed myself as more confident than I am when I said "is connected" rather than "likely connected". As far as evidence I can think of, we've got all the information we know about Ai, one of the five calamities, from the most recent few chapters: It's known as "codependence of desire" in the official Viz translations. Codependence makes me think of the Alluka/Nanika pairing. Desire makes me think of how her power works off of essentially greed. Plus, Nanika says "Ai" every time it/he/she grants a wish. On top of this, we are told shown that Zzigg Zoldyck went with Netero on his undocumented expedition to the Dark Continent. It's possible that Ai came back with him and eventually found its way to Alluka. Yes, this is a lot of conjecture, but I like the theory and haven't seen much against it. Regardless, my real point in my original post was that we as readers should not believe that what we know so far is ALL there is to know about nen. ")

Right. Lol I was gonna mention but I guess I forgot.

Good to hear.

Confirmed alluka is a girl!!!
Killua said imouto.

Actually he's a boy, but Alluka refers to himself as a girl, and Killua and him are close, so he refers to her as girl

I always just assumed he/she was gender neutral.

You can never know with Togashi.  The amount of gender-ambiguous characters in Hunter x Hunter is...well, not many other animes do this with actual serious characters (yes, you get a hideyoshi or a trap occasionally, but never an actual serious character like Pitou and Alluka).
>> ARTICLE
Really good episode, I like how alluka is 100x creepier in the anime than the books. The flashback was really well done too, much clearer than the manga which makes me think that the current manga will be very clear too, which is a great thing considering how dense the material is right now.

Can't they just sacrifice one person to make the wish of 'I wish I can have more wishes'? Something along the lines of "Can you grant my wishes without me having to grant yours?" 

I'm sorry if I'm nitpicking the loophole, I'm just curious if there's any explanation to this in the manga? As this is a pretty common loophole for any wish-granting story tropes.
>> ARTICLE
you could theoretically ask for more wishes, and pray she doesn't make some monstrous request of you immediately following you saying that. I would assume the second one wouldn't work simply because it directly contradicts how the power functions.
>> ARTICLE
i wish you didnt have your ability forever.

Alluka is love.
>> ARTICLE
well, I think they're on the right track to get 95 percent but it seems rather simple.  They clearly have a registry of who is currently a hunter regardless of whether or not they have the card.  So, to get 95 percent turnout give fair notice that in say, 4 months time there will be a vote in which you will also be issued a new hunter card. Only the new Hunter card is valid and if you don't make it to get it you are no longer a Hunter member.    
>> ARTICLE
acording to Ging's rule they should have a voting everyday, don't think they can just change that

Ahhh true.   Then my point is just how it could be done fairly but going just wants to mess with rat, hopefully till he reaches a breaking point

Watching this after reading the manga, I suddenly realized something:

How did Killua know what happens when you reject Alluka's requests without their parents knowing? Did Black-Eyed Alluka tell him this when he asked how to return her to normal? Or what. Cause there's really no way that someone around her suddenly dies leaving a puddle of blood and nobody raises an eyebrow. Yeah they're weird, but not *that* weird. Or did Killua cover it up, saying somethnig like "Whoops, I did this, sorry Dad"?

Well said.
>> ARTICLE
despite of the creepy face that she makes, Alluka is too damn cute
>> ARTICLE
isn't it bullshit how she's superpowerful with 0 trainning? Ignoring the risk/reward type system completely.
>> ARTICLE
I actually feel the same way. HxH always made it a point that power can't come from nothing, a certain pre-set condition has to be fulfilled. 

The way I see it, Alluka has incredible (possibly infinite) destructive *and* constructive power without any negative effect on him/her. I really hope the next episodes clear this up, because otherwise this feels like an inconsistency and cop-out.
>> ARTICLE
I know right?! They better have a convincing explanation to this
>> ARTICLE
Alluka's ability is almost certainly not nen. It's something from elsewhere. 
>> ARTICLE
the chick that can predict to future with the ghostwriter in the phantom arc had an OP ability but with no training

The father did say she's not family she's a monster so maybe it will be explained in the future.
And it's not like she 0 training have you forgotten what family raised her?

Someone also said that about Gon at one point though, didn't they?

Said what?
>> ARTICLE
That he was a monster. He was the guy that taught them about Nen, I think, the guy with the glasses and the kid... Can't remember their names though. :-\
>> ARTICLE
That what's his face that Bisky taught?
That's a different story, the power to learn quickly about nen and the power to explode people if they don't answer your 4 requests is completely different.

the special kind of nen users do have strange powers without them having to train for them but they often aren't useful or even a curse to the wielder

shes is not physical powerful, in fact she is rather weak. simply born with an ability which at this point we speculate to be based in nen. she also does not ignore the risk/reward system, she simply is not the one bearing the risk or reward.

im pretty sure the recaps on every episode include 100% of everything relevant that happened in the prior episode and its maybe 3 minutes long

That's the reason I stopped watching it. Also, I kinda felt like the fights were super drawn out and Luffy was always being weaker than he should until he would finally finish his opponent.

Watch "One Pace"!

Yea, The anime has awful pacing issues. The manga is much better. Funnily enough, the opposite can be said about HxH. Well, less pacing issues and more Togashi pls.

I think Anime is the superior format for HxH, as long as they stop the show when it catches up instead of creating filler, and manga is the superior format for One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece should get the DBKai treatment once it's finished. Those tv specials seem to be doing a good job of doing just that anyway.

Whats the DBKai treatment?
>> ARTICLE
If you know One Piece you just have to know Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball Kai is a version of DBZ that's shown without all the awful filler making the fights and power ups fast and to the point. Similar to with FMA and FMAB.  When I said DBKai treatment I was referring to having a version of One Piece without the shit-ton of horrendous filler, which will make the series fifty times more watchable and recommendable as it will be super shorter.

Yorknew and Chimera Ant were my favorite arcs, personally, with Chimera Ant beating out Yorknew for the top spot. My favorite character in the show? Honestly, as great as Gon is, Meruem and Komugi take my slot as "favorite character" despite being two individuals. I was skeptical at first that the King would end up being anything more than a tyrant, but instead I got one of the most heartachingly beautiful moments I've ever experienced with their final moments.

Tears were shed. So sad. I was rooting for the King-Komugi reunion so hard. Pouf irritated me so much, but his efforts really made it suspenseful.

it might be how along the lines of how ppl treat ppl with "Gender dysphoria" Alluka believes and feels like a girl therefore killua respects that enough to call her a girl while the others only see it as a tool so they really dont care. i could be wrong but w/e
>> ARTICLE
From the hunterxhunter wiki
> There is considerable confusion about Alluka's gender. Two of Alluka's brothers, Illumi and Milluki, refer to Alluka as their brother. But Killua, the closest brother of Alluka, specifically states that Alluka is a "girl" and refers to Alluka as his sister multiple times. This inconsistency can be explained by Killua's intimate and understanding bond with Alluka, hence he would know and care that Alluka is mentally female, versus Illumi's cold and dehumanizing attitude towards Alluka. While Alluka is most likely biologically male, Killua's interactions show that Alluka's psyche may be female.

Give me your spine.
>> ARTICLE
I thought killua called alluka "Nanika" which sounds much better than the english version "something".
>> ARTICLE
Does Nanika mean something deeper than Something or do you just think the word sounds better?
>> ARTICLE
Killua uses Nanika as a name. Normally you don't translate names (most Japanese games have a meaning). Of course Killua chose this specific name because it means 'something', but he still uses it as a name.

The subtitles had to translate it though, otherwise some viewers wouldn't understand the reason for the name.
>> ARTICLE
In the manga Killua calls Alluka's other form Nanika. Killua doesn't seem to be close to her if he calls her "something".
>> ARTICLE
I think it's just one of these Japanese habits (using words as names), and translators butchered it.

No one seen "Sora" translated as sky, or "Midori" translated as green right? 
>> ARTICLE
Well, we've seen "Raito" translated as "Light" (Death Note), so it's not unprecedented.

I think it's a difficult call...on one hand, if you go with the "Something" translation, you're right, it sounds weird.  But if you go with "Nanika", then viewers who don't pay good attention from week to week will be confused as to what Alluka's name is.  Hell, people are already confused about her gender.


By translating her alter ego as "Something", it at least clearly distinguishes Alluka from her "other" self.  Even if it sounds awkward as hell.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, let's not forget that Alluka & Nanika were designed to sound similar as well.

I reckon a TL note would've been enough, and if someone does not pay attention then.. it's their fault?
>> ARTICLE
The difference is that the whole point of the name lies in understanding it's meaning in this case. Nanika means something, and Japanese viewers get that, but if they had just left it as Nanika, many English viewers would not understand. Honestly this is a place where I feel it would be acceptable to use a TL note, but I don't think I've ever seen Crunchyroll use one.
>> ARTICLE
Well, yes and frequently. With anime from 20 years ago.
>> ARTICLE
Nanika is the direct translation but also sounds like a name, making it a better alternative to calling some one 'Something' every time.
>> ARTICLE
He does say Nanika. I guess they're going for the literal translation in the subs. Papa Zoldyk calls him Something out of spite. killua names her Nanika

>Also, will the he/she thing with Alluka be explained?  
  
Not directly, but it's easy to figure out. Alluka is *biologically* male, but identifies as female. Killua is close to her and refers to her as female out of compassion, but the rest of the family just see her as an "it" that shouldn't be empathized with.

As someone who just did the same thing in the past three days, care to share you thoughts on the Chimera Ant arc? Here are my thoughts:

I honestly got so bored nearing the end that I just began watching highlights until it was over. It felt to me that the style shifted from the previous arcs from focusing on Gon and Killua to a standard shounen battle setup. This displeased me greatly, as the arc evidenced many of the overused tropes that Hunter x Hunter had done well to stay away from. For example: Gon suddenly unleashed his "final form" when overwhelmed with emotion. Also, Characters suddenly spouted random "abillities" out of nowhere that had nothing to do with the application of "Nen." On top of this, I found myself falling asleep during the fights that involved anyone but the main characters, partially due to the fact that some fights took upwards of 5+ episodes to complete. I also think there were too many characters added too quickly for the viewer to gain any real emotional attachment to them, meaning I cared for their struggles that much less. The narration throughout the last half was abysmal, and only created a barrier between the character and viewer imo. From what I have heard, the author went on hiatus many times during production of the manga, so that could possibly have dropped the quality of storytelling. It got so bad, I honestly couldn't understand what either side was fighting for by the end. 

Overall, I thought the latter half of the Chimera Ant Arc was abysmal and am glad it is finally over. Hopefully the story will turn away from spending 20+ episodes on meaningless battle filler and into some real content. I will say that prior to the Chimera Ant Arc, I really loved the story telling and how fully flushed and complete the characters were. I judged this past Arc harshly due to my high expectations garnered from the previous arcs. After marathoning it, Hunter x Hunter is only second to One Piece imo as far as shounen epics go, and I hope it can be strong until it ends.

Sidenote: I really really really really hate the unexplained random abilities that just appear out of nowhere. It got to a point where it looked like the characters were just using mumbo jumbo magical powers to summon things rather than using "Nen." At least earlier in the series characters had more feasible applications of "Nen," Like "Bungee Gum" or Kurapika's "Nen Chains." Those were made up of manipulated "Nen" instead of the stupid ass abilities like Leol's "Rental Pod." I feel like it breaks immersion to add these random abilities and dilutes what was a really potent arsenal of fighters into simply being who gets the strongest "power-up."

Edit: After reading my post, I realize I may come off very negative. I would like to re-iterate that I absolutely love this series and only criticize the last arc due to my high expectations set by the previous arcs. There were a few things I liked in the C.A. Arc, (like how it highlighted that there is no real "good" vs "evil,) but I truly think that the author took a wrong turn halfway toward the end. On another note, this new arc looks really promising and has already begun on a much better foot. Can't wait for the next ep.!
>> ARTICLE
I agree. I liked the first end of the arc (the initial buildup where the ants started turning human was a little slow but not too bad) but after the Killua Ikalgo episode it got really slow.

I think the arc as a whole had some really good moments. I loved the Phantom Troupe episodes and the showdown between Killua and Rammot. I liked Ikalgo, but Meleoron was kind of bland and I got tired of the royal guard. And the whole thing where the King was flipping between good and evil was annoying.

Hunter x Hunter is still my favorite shonen, and I love the show. But I think the Chimera Ant arc was a lot weaker than the Hunter Exam arc or the Phantom Troupe arc.

I also feel the same way about the wierd powers. It seems like most characters at this point must be specialists, because half that crap doesn't even kind of fit into the other five categories.
>> ARTICLE
Just did the same. So depressing waiting for one per week now.

I'm actually filling the void by watching the 1999 show. It's pretty interesting to compare the two, but I'd definitely recommend staying away from the dub, it's pretty painful.
>> ARTICLE
It's ok, it's the summer time.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm going to die once school starts back up and I lose my anime time...
>> ARTICLE
top show, would watch again and again.
>> ARTICLE
For anyone confused:) 
Alluka is technically male but likes to think of herself as female. Killua is much closer to Alluka than the rest of the family which is why he refers to Alluka as "her" while the rest of the family says "him"
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. This is why I came to this comment thread. I was so confused.
>> ARTICLE
wait, since he made a wish he can't make another one in a row right? :| this is too complicated for me also pretty sure she made 4 requests, telling him to die, telling him to wake up, playing shiritori and patting her head :>

also it appears we'll see leorio next episode!
>> ARTICLE
Without manga spoilers, anime Killua has made reference several times to the fact that his family doesn't *really* know *all* the rules.  It's safe to say that Killua has information that the rest of the family doesn't, and that's likely due to the fact that he actually treats Alluka as a human being.

Also, regarding the 4 requests... I'm going to guess that either request #1 didn't count (he didn't really die) or one of requests #2-4 didn't count (it was just a sister playing with her brother).
>> ARTICLE
he didnt actually die though, he denied that request but in a playful way.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I thought him playing dead counted.
>> ARTICLE
It did
>> ARTICLE
i think it did count, and i expect a trick like that is going to be use when killua has to to fulfill the next set of request when he saves gon.

essentially it would be like loopholes.
>> ARTICLE
I interpreted it as working because he knows the difference between Alluka and Nanika. He made a point of the fact that when she calls him Onii-chan it's Alluka. I'm guessing that the asker of the request gets to decide what they consider fulfilling it. Alluka is ok with fake dead, because that's probably what she wanted him to do to begin with, but if Nanika asked him to die he would probably have to stop his heart and then get resuscitated. 
>> ARTICLE
nanika will never make a request, he/she/whatever is the wish granting form
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to spoiler tag this because technically it wasn't in the episode but I believe this is simply something not dealt with directly in the anime that was in the manga rather than something that just hasn't come up yet...

[spoiler](/s "Watch the 'wish' that Killua made again and see if you notice anything weird about it... Did you catch it? He didn't ASK a wish at all--He fucking *commanded* nanika to do that. In-universe that's not the same thing at all and something apparently no one else can do. Unless I confused this part for the next part (which seems unlikely given the wording) there are no requests coming next... nothing has to be paid for here.")

TL;DR Watch the episode again and it actually does a pretty good job of explaining why 4 requests were fulfilled without hitting you over the head with it. Nanika made ***0*** requests of Killua! Remember, Nanika's "requests" have a very explicit form "<Your name> <DO THIS>." and quite simply that never happened. *That's why Nanika can't make requests of someone she doesn't know the name of!* Everything you saw was of the form "Brother, do this". and were thus from Alluka, not Nanika. Killua didn't fulfill them because he had to, he could have refused them all... he did it because he never denies his sister anything because that's the kind of big brother he is. 

Corollary to this? The computer has NOT been paid for yet!

[Personal theory, although this comes from a lot of stuff talked about in manga this is in no way confirmed.] (/s "It's my belief that in the past Killua performed way more than 4 requests of Nanika without anyone wishing on her... thus 'banking wishes'. This would explain why he's the first person to be owed more than 1 wish out of it. It's for this reason, I would argue, that he is not a valid target for Nanika to make requests of to pay off the computer and also why in order to get a wish through he need only ask Alluka to let him talk to Nanika in order to immediately be able to make a wish regardless of the current 'state' of Nanika with regards to everyone who doesn't have banked wishes.")
>> ARTICLE
[Manga Spoilers](/s "killua can make as many wishes as he wants because of his special connection with alluka")
>> ARTICLE
According to the rules we've been told so far, he does have to fulfil more requests before he makes another wish; presumably that's why the caveat to his wish was so inconsequential, a kiss on the cheek requiring no reality warping magic.
>> ARTICLE
illumi said that hes gonna do it the other way around and get some1 else to make the wish while dealing with the requests
>> ARTICLE
The mother was so proud that Killua is finally being so threatening WAT. 

This anime is sublime. 
>> ARTICLE
Did you forget how ecstatic she was when Killua stabbed her in the face?
>> ARTICLE
I started watching this version since the Chimera Ant arc, what episode did that happen?
>> ARTICLE
It was prior to season 1.  Killua ran away from home to take the Hunter Exams, and had to stab his way out, through his mother.  She was so happy to see how her little boy was developing.  I believe she talks about it during the episodes where Gon, Leorio, and Kurapika go to the Zoldyck estate to "save" Killua from his family.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I've seen it referred to in some episodes but I was wondering if they did actually show it happening.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly not. 
>> ARTICLE
I confess, I got the hots for Cheadle Yorkshire. ( ).
>> ARTICLE
Reminds me of Kris from Shining Force.
>> ARTICLE
What would happen if someone's wish was for Alluka to stop asking requests of people for the rest of her life?
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking this is where it's going. That or cut out Alluka's tongue, but that's not gonna happen. 
>> ARTICLE
The family considered this in the last episode, but since they knew so little about how the power worked, they considered this too risky.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, plus it's such a great power you kind of don't want to just get rid of it, and since a request chain has to be completed they can just send someone away and keep her locked up.
>> ARTICLE
Wish for endless wishes without bad consequences?
>> ARTICLE
[Great episode. Uchida Maaya voicing Alluka is truly a miracle of the universe](http://i.imgur.com/heYksXW.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Good stuff, I really like how they pulled it off this episode. I honestly have no complaints this time, I especially liked the part where the music just cut off when Illumi went "oh" after Hisoka said Gon was Killua's most important person. Haha. I liked how the stuff between Silva and Killua was handled as well. Also, really nice kiss at the end there. Killua's always been a bro, but literally so now.

Also, and I'm not sure how I missed this when I read the manga, but it is specifically stated that Silva was behind Illumi putting the needle in Killua's head. I guess that would be kind of obvious in retrospect, but it kind of gives me a different view of him. I think this at least partially explains why Silva was so sure Killua would come back way back in the Zoldyck arc.
>> ARTICLE
An amazing episode.
Killua outsmarted his family and Leorio is finally back.
>> ARTICLE
This episode makes me sad the Hisoka is a villain. 
>> ARTICLE
The whole point of the last arc (and the show in general, to a lesser extent) is that all humans are villains, especially [the stereotypical shounen hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msGLfzGfNMI) (yes, that is the actual name of the song). Hisoka is just up front about it. 
>> ARTICLE
i understand this, but him being up front about it means he will have a conflict against somebody not so upfront about it, and this could mean the end of his character which makes me sad.
>> ARTICLE
Hisoka's a strange character with strange intentions. I find it hard to call him a villain...
>> ARTICLE
His intentions are pretty straight forward he loves fighting, specially strong opponents. Everything he does is to entertain himself and find even stronger opponents to fight.  
>> ARTICLE
Sounds exactly like Netero, but with better fashion sense and good looks.  
>> ARTICLE
Hisoka for chairman!!
>> ARTICLE
Going through a forest with a sadistic look on your face and killing the first person you come in contact with, that is kind of evil. 
>> ARTICLE
evil != villain
>> ARTICLE
it was hunter exam tough, everyone there knew they could die
>> ARTICLE
Not an excuse. You are forbidden to kill people intentionally as well. He got disqualified in the later round.
>> ARTICLE
He got disqualified from the previous year because he killed an examiner.
>> ARTICLE
He didn't kill that examiner, he hurt him. The guy who tried to get revenge in the, I believe, 3rd phase was the one he hurt the year before.
>> ARTICLE
Herp derp. I'm sorry about that. But he *almost* killed him though, so I was close. :P
>> ARTICLE
the rule that killing was forbidden was only for the tournament and it was just the chairman being cruel because it meant that people like gon will REALLY suffer because they can't get killed but will never give up
>> ARTICLE
it was Killua that got DQ'd because Netero specifically made the No-Kill rule for that tournament.
>> ARTICLE
Not on that phase, people were dying left and right. Also, he was never disqualified in that exam. He was one of the ones who passed. He *was* disqualified the year before for attacking that examiner who tried to (unsuccessfully) get revenge.
>> ARTICLE
On Zevil Island it was okay to kill. Being disqualified for killing some one was only a rule on the last stage of the 28th hunter exam. Only because the tournament wouldn't work otherwise. Also Hisoka passed the hunter exam only Killua was disqualified. 
>> ARTICLE
He's not a good guy, but he's definitely not a villain. If anything he has helped the main characters more.
>> ARTICLE
I would have a hard time saying he isn't a bad guy, not a villain but definitely a bad guy.
>> ARTICLE
Something about Pariston ticks me off...he seems even more calculating than Chrollo.

I wonder what will be the requests Alluka makes after restoring Gon or whether Killua will use some rule,unkown to the rest of the family to save both of them.
>> ARTICLE
I am wondering if the Alluka plotline will intersect with the Zodiac plotline. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a reason he's the rat in the zodiacs.
>> ARTICLE
The rules said nobody could ask for two wishes in a row, so how is Killua gonna save Gon now?

Hisoka's boss, btw.
>> ARTICLE
Remember what Illumi said? He said most likely Killua would have someone else make the wish so that he would be the one to fulfill the requests afterwards to reset her to a safe level. He wants to take responsibility for the wish instead of pushing the consequences on someone else. The wish maker is not the one who bears the responsibility after all.

However considering he also wants to save Alluka he might have some other shenanigans prepared.
>> ARTICLE
1. the wish wasn't actually a wish towards her power because the wish granting form is nanika but he asked alluka  
2. killua want someone else to do the wish so he could fullfill the requests because he doesn't want to risk someone else
>> ARTICLE
somebody else makes the wish
>> ARTICLE
According to the rules the rest of the family knows about.
>> ARTICLE
Alluka is so cute...

 Daga, otoko da.
>> ARTICLE
can sombody tell me how many episodes are there in this arc?
>> ARTICLE
Its been estimated 10, so around 7 more i think.
>> ARTICLE
Depending on the pacing I would say 10-12 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Omg killua got some big ass balls , like what if he tripped on his way out and didn't meet the time. Lol then next episode would of been killua tries to escape mansion from dad
>> ARTICLE
That's quite the trip lol!
>> ARTICLE
I'm confused whether Alluka is a boy or a girl. Either way, he/she is so goddamn cute.
>> ARTICLE
mind you that's just the "accepted" version of the situation since it does make sense in the context of the plot. there was no word of god on that subject.
>> ARTICLE
same with http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Kalluto_Zoldyck.. Boy that looks like a girl
>> ARTICLE
Alluka is biologically a boy, therefore leading everyone else besides Killua to refer to Alluka as a "he". 

However Alluka identifies him/herself as a female, therefore Killua addresses Alluka as a she since Alluka prefers that. Also since the family and everyone else doesn't really care about Alluka, the refuse to call him:her a girl.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for clearing it up.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone tell me why did killua ask for the kiss? I thought asking for his mother to die was going to be enough for him to get away. 
>> ARTICLE
A wish had to be granted.  He gave the wish two outcomes : Mother Dies, or I get a kiss on the cheek.  I think Killua has to set an if/then scenario for each option for these types of wishes to work.
>> ARTICLE
so the next 3 requests are easier. after a big wish she requests impossible/bad things from the next person like the butlers spine etc..
>> ARTICLE
Every time I see the ending I feel sad. The way Leorio looks at Gon and then at Kurapika and then looking so downed.. It's so disheartening :( So sad. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm so glad that we got to see a bunch of Silva this episode. Hes definitely has one of my favorite character designs and is a total bad ass. And his mothers crazy reactions never get old :D
>> ARTICLE
I am a little curious how tall he is. I think the show has actually aged the characters along with the show. When they were walking down the hallway Killua seemed smaller than I have seen him in a long time.
>> ARTICLE
"Killu tried to kill me!!!!!!!! ...I'm so proud of him!!" *swoons*

srsly -_-;
>> ARTICLE
Could someone please explain the whole Alluka request rules and warnings!
>> ARTICLE
There are five rules about Alluka's power known by the Zoldyck family as a whole, but Killua is aware of some others by himself. Below are the rules known by the family:

* If someone fails to Alluka's requests and gets killed, the difficulty level of Alluka's requests returns to level 1. That is the best time to make a wish.

* If Alluka is making requests from a particular person, they cannot be moved over to another person mid-way. Therefore if that particular person disappears such as concealing themselves, Alluka is unable to make requests to anybody else.

* If the person fulfilling requests dies mid-way, it will count as a failure and at least one more person will die.

* Alluka cannot make requests of someone without knowing the person's name.

* The same person cannot ask Alluka for consecutive wishes


>> ARTICLE
Also, the bigger the wish the person asks of Alluka, the bigger her requests will be to the next person.
>> ARTICLE
So Ikue Otani voices an animal doctor in two shows at the moment? She really has the perfect niche.
>> ARTICLE
What i want to know is why they haven't wished Alluka's powers away,
>> ARTICLE
getting that urge to read the manga... must suppress. only a few more eps left in anime!
>> ARTICLE
If I could do it from the end of the 1999 series to now you can wait a week. Be strong!
>> ARTICLE
It's been definitively worth to way through boring-ant-arc in order to see this. I'm vivid fan of HxH manga and I've been waiting literally years for this arc.

Also props to producers for pulling out such a great job. I hope there is more arcs after the current manga state as well. It's finally getting interesting again!
>> ARTICLE
You're seriously the only one who thinks the ant arc is boring.
>> ARTICLE
Well.. I thought it was a free country and we were allowed to express our opinions. I guess being downvoted to the oblivion proves me wrong.

**Okay let's compare different arcs for a second shall we?**

Ants arc vs Hunters exam arc? 

Ants arc vs Hunters arena(Tower)?

Ants arc vs Killua goes home?

Ants arc vs Greed Island?

Ants arc vs Kurapika wrecking spiders?

&nbsp;

I'm sorry but Ants seemed a lot more stretched out compared to the other arcs simple as that. 

A lot of filler content which no one was interested in. Just give me Gon & his crew going crazy, and I'll be happy.
>> ARTICLE
>Well.. I thought it was a free country and we were allowed to express our opinions. I guess being downvoted to the oblivion proves me wrong.

Freedom of speech means we won't stop you from sharing your opinion, it doesn't mean we can't respond negatively. And there was absolutely no filler in the Chimera Ant Arc, everything featured was entirely canonical and present in the manga. I can understand being somewhat upset with the pace, but the appeal of HxH is that it isn't all mindless action and things like "Gon & his crew going crazy" as with other shonen. There's far more depth to it which most fans appreciate.
>> ARTICLE
Hey don't take me wrong, I'm not your Naruto fanboy... I don't even like most of shonens.


Yes, I've read the manga as well... but I still felt it was one of the worse points of it.
The Chime Ants were certainly no filler, but the story shifted more to point of view of Royal Guards, which I particularly did not like.


I guess it's just me enjoying "Sunny" and "Positive" Gon more...




>> ARTICLE
Well, to be fair, everything before the Royal Guard hatches doesn't really compare to the rest, at all.

I didn't understand if Killua actually died and came back to life, or if he was just playing...
>> ARTICLE
he was just playing XD
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it seemed like he was playing, but it also seemed like a request to which he said "Sure".
>> ARTICLE
I interpreted it as working because he knows the difference between Alluka and Nanika. He made a point of the fact that when she calls him Onii-chan it's Alluka. I'm guessing that the asker of the request gets to decide what they consider fulfilling it. Alluka is ok with fake dead, because that's probably what she wanted him to do to begin with, but if Nanika asked him to die he would probably have to stop his heart and then get resuscitated. 
>> ARTICLE
maybe he can control his heartbeats (I don't read the manga).

Edit: He can, he did the same with the ant brothers (the one with the darts)
>> ARTICLE
That kiss. Kawaiiiiiii!
>> ARTICLE
I wish Leorio could save Gon with his medical knowledge/medical nen abilities that he hopefully developed since the last time we saw him. Then he could be the hero for once.
>> ARTICLE
Is Alluka a boy or girl? The translations as mixed up. Half the time it refers as a her then changes later in the episode.
>> ARTICLE
They're not mixed up, the manga is the same way. Killua refers to Alluka in the feminine, every one else refers to Alluka in the masculine. The most likely explanation is that Alluka is biologically male but mentally female. Only Killua cares for Alluka enough to address her the way she mentally identifies herself.
>> ARTICLE
The translations were bad and written poorly. One example is Killua saying oretachi but the translation is just I am your son or something along those lines and excludes Alluka. And the other sentences are written poorly so all the rules are confusing. Killua says his family doesn't know about the rule where Alluka calls him brother and the nanika calls him killua. The question is, does the real Alluka's requests, which Killua can obviously fake since they aren't serious, like when he played dead, still count with the three request rule? Or does the request have to be from the nanika and be seriously handled? Killua being able to turn her face into a mask says it also counts, but no one in the family realized him playing dead actually fulfilled one of the requests and that it was strange, even though they were all monitoring the situation. I think the anime flubbed the logic here.
>> ARTICLE
If Killua knows who's requesting he can decide whether to fail the request or not. I would assume if it is his sister the one requesting all she really want is to play, but when Nanika is requesting he knows it means business.
>> ARTICLE
And this is why it matters what translation group you go with. :P

And I don't think Alluka's requests count, only Nanika's do. However, the family doesn't understand that, which is why they're so confused.
>> ARTICLE
Also there's only one translation for the anime right now, which is Crunchyroll. Any others are just rips, re-encodes or slight edits of CR.
>> ARTICLE
Well, even if they're slight edits, they can fix certain errors, such as Nanika's name.
>> ARTICLE
mmm... to be fair, "Nanika" isn't a typical Japanese name. It's not even an uncommon or so-called "hipster"-type name. It's not a name at all. It literally means "something", "something else", "it", so really it's replacing the usual location of a pronoun.

Let's make up an hypothetical analogous situation. Pay attention to my use of lower-case and capital letters.

Pretend that this series was originally made in English. The character Killen goes back to his family in order to enlist the help of his sibling Spring, who has a presumably alter-identity that people call "something", because they don't know what it is and treat it like a specter or like Spring was possessed by "something", rather than "something" being an actual entity of its own. Killen also calls Spring's alter-identity "Something" (capital S), in part because he also doesn't really know what "Something" is, but he treats Spring and Something like actual living people/entities so "Something" became its given name.

That's pretty much exactly how the situation sounds like in reality, in Japanese. The Zoldycks call her "nanika" (aka something) because they treat her like an object, not a family member. Killua also calls this "other Alluka" as "Nanika" not because it's her name but because he also doesn't know what it is. It's... something. And so, Killua called it "Something" so much that "Something/Nanika" basically became it's given name. 

Kind of like if you had a dog, but you couldn't think of a name for it, nor did it come with a name, so you just called it "dog" for so long, that it went from lower-case "dog" to upper-case "Dog".

That's the best way I can explain this.

I wouldn't really call it an error that they didn't use "Nanika", but I suppose it loses a slight bit of meaning because Alluka and Nanika have the same last syllable, which I tried to copy with my Spring/Something analogy. On the other hand, if they'd only used "Nanika" to begin with, then we'd lose a whole lot of meaning because the Zoldycks use lower-case "nanika" (something), while Killua uses upper-case "Nanika" (Something).
>> ARTICLE
I get what you mean. I suppose it's just nitpicking on my part.

The same way I would have liked "Senritsu"'s name to stay as such, instead of being translated to "Melody".
>> ARTICLE
Alluka's been the one to give all the requests shown in the anime so far, both serious and simple ones. Alluka is never in "Nanika" mode when she makes requests.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the black eyes face was only once she's ready to grant her wish.

Prior to that, either Alluka or Nanika can be in control, but will look the same. Thus why Killua had to specify that he can differentiate the two because one calls him Onii-chan while the other calls him Killua.

At least, that's how I understood it.

Edit: Or maybe they only count as "requests" when the person's name is mentioned. So since Alluka asks things to "Onii-chan", it doesn't count? Maybe that's also why he's so confident that he can do this?
>> ARTICLE
Re-Edit: I recant everything I wrote earlier. The logic is not wrong. I can't say any more of else spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of nostalgia during the election when you could see all of the old characters from the series. The Greed Island folks, the Exam guys, and the other hunters Gon/Killua have met. 
>> ARTICLE
Surprisingly very few Hunters. Only 661. They use to talk about all their specialties and niches. But with such a low number, they may each be the only one in their respective fields.
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see that Hisoka cares more about Gon than Ging does.
>> ARTICLE
I've always thought Ging being absolutely sure that Gon will be okay is kind of cool, tbh.
>> ARTICLE
from what we have seen up until now i think ging wouldn't go to see gon even if he would be dieing
>> ARTICLE
Only because he wants to fight Gon.

No, Hisoka and Gon are special friends. 
>> ARTICLE
Special in that Hisoka gets a hard-on when he see's Gon's actual potential, special?

He doesn't just get a hard on.. he fucking man jizzes all over himself being hit by gon. 

That's more than special..

Bisky any day.

Honestly she wouldn't be a bad choice. She seems to be experienced and is a good person. Also good at supervising people.
>> ARTICLE
Also did anybody notice that somebody voted for Gon?  He had one vote.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't be surprised if Ging did that, since he had no interest in who won.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I think there are plenty of people who like Gon and don't really care about who to vote for that could have voted for him. I'm more amused that two people voted for Hisoka.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was probably knov who voted for Gon since he is talking about Gon like a national hero and spending a fortune to save him. Also doesn't voting for him as chairman imply that if he wins he must stay alive so maybe he could be validating his resolve?

Seeing Gon, Killua, Leorio, and Kurapika, in one picture brings back so many memories. I also laughed at the part where Leorio is getting tired of just standing there. xD

I see that Hisoka has been watching a bit too much JoJo lately.

Considering HxH and Jojo are the only two shows I keep up with, yes.  I most certainly approve of this.
>> ARTICLE
I liked how Ging was introduced in the anime, they gave him such a cool entrance in the last episode.

In the manga he was just sitting there chilling.
>> ARTICLE
Ging is still kind of a shitty absentee dad though, which subtracts a lot from his cool factor.  
>> ARTICLE
My attitude is: Gon's cool with it, I'm cool with it. 
>> ARTICLE
Whilst there is no denying he is a shitty dad. I like to tell myself that he has this all planned out and it is truly what's best for Gon. Look at the development that Gon has endured on his quest to find his father. 

Maybe it's not truly best for Gon, but it's given Gon a goal and meaning to life, and made him one heck of a hunter in the process. 
>> ARTICLE
That's just speculation. Who knows what could have transpired if he actually had a father figure around? Maybe he might be even as powerful as Netero. And giving him a goal and meaning in life? That's like saying Gon is some depressed, suicidal kid with no direction or purpose for himself, which is actually a common symptom of child abandonment...
>> ARTICLE
Well Pitou did say super saiyan Gon was what Gon could have been if he had done decades of training. It was his full potential, and if full potential Gon can fight pre rebirth Meruem like Pitou says than he must be close if not above netero.
>> ARTICLE
>some depressed, suicidal kid with no direction or purpose for himself

Throw in some long ass hair and a buff body and you've got it dead on.
>> ARTICLE
In an early portion of the manga (like the first chapter?), it was explained that Mito took Ging to court to get custody of Gon because she thought he'd be in danger with Ging.  Ging's initial intention hadn't been to abandon Gon.
>> ARTICLE
He never even visited him once. All he knows is that framed picture. That's why Gon got so enamored with Kite.
>> ARTICLE
Wait so did Hisoka call Illumi a 95? Thats some baloney.
>> ARTICLE
You saying you don't think Illumi is that strong or that it's too low? 
>> ARTICLE
He was stronger than all the zodiyak (that was present at least) and isn't Hisoka stronger than Illumi? 5 points isn't a lot of wiggle room.
>> ARTICLE
What makes you think Hisoka is stronger than Illumi? I think they are pretty much the same.
>> ARTICLE
Well back at heavens arena, Killua said Hisoka was stronger than Illumi, but its been a while so I guess that could have changed.
>> ARTICLE
Illumi is a different kind of strong I think is all.  Hisoka would probably come out on top in an arena battle or something, but if they were just trying to kill each other? I'd bet Illumi all the way...
>> ARTICLE
Considering Hisoka is looking for fights to the death his judgement of utility may be a bit skewed.
>> ARTICLE
They never say out of what though.  If it's 95 out of 100, then that's pretty freakin' badass.  I'm guessing that Chrollo Lucilfer is Hisoka's "100".


That's what I would guess, considering that the whole Zoldyck family is filled with monsters.   Hell, Killua was pretty damn scary even *before* he learned Nen.  
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I'd bet Netero would be the top of whatever ranking Hisoka has.
>> ARTICLE
110/100 - Netero.
>> ARTICLE
i don't think that hisoka actually ever got to see the powerlevel of netero

I don't think it's out of 100. Knuckle was doing this too, he assigned a value to a portion of nen. Hisoka is (probably) far stronger than Knuckle.

To assign a value Knuckle probably used his own Nen (or a portion of it) and assigned a value to it. After this he compared the enemies nen to his own and assigned a value based on the difference.

So if Hisoka is doing the same and uses his own nen as basis too, guess 1Nen(H) would be greater than 1Nen(K).

Or if he is using a /100 system, I would also say that he compares to himself. So Illumi  would be 95/100Hisoka strong.
>> ARTICLE
We didn't really see him go all out. Gon crushed his arm, yet he didn't even flinch. + he's a zoldyck, so we can truly anticipate that he's not the weakest guy around.

I want a "Heart is Valuable" Netero memorial poster...

Did they put all their budget into the OP? The OP was beautiful and also I'm one of those people who will never get tired of Departure. I just love the song. The ED was lacking, the song is just the next verse of Hyori Ittai. But the arc is pretty short so I don't blame them. At least we got some Kurapika. [Also that picture at the end. ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/VnXQBAM.jpg) Will we ever see the whole crew smiling again?

I love the Zodiacs, especially their voice actors and their personalities. Didn't know that Ging is voiced by Koyama Rikiya, one of my favorites. [Also Piyon is best Zodiac, that's a fact.](http://i.imgur.com/qIpHlfG.jpg)

Where was kurapika?

He was the blonde guy in the sweet black suit with the other three.

End credits, He was facing away though.

If i can ask ,how many episodes will it probably last?
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "Probably around 10-12 episodes")
>> ARTICLE
That short arc is as long as some full anime lol
>> ARTICLE
Everything seems short when compared to Chimera Ant.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit man yes, I recently started watching (around a month ago maybe? Can't quite remember) and basically I rushed through the series, and I caught up to the second last episode of the chimera and arc where [Ep. 135](/s "the King dies"), and I was pretty happy but also EXTREMELY sad for (obvious) reasons.

But yeah, this is by far one of the best shows I've seen so far. Hope that Gon gets better soon and I wonder what's gonna happen with Killua's little bro?!
>> ARTICLE
I like how during the ED, Leorio looks back at Kurapika and sighs, which sort of refers to how he won't likely be reappearing anytime soon to help out.
>> ARTICLE
Piyon best ~~girl~~ zodiac for sure
>> ARTICLE
Kurapika is still best girl overall though
>> ARTICLE
So it isn't just me that thinks Kurapika is a girl
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it was ever clearly established. There was never an "I am male" moment.

[Even Kurapika likes to think he's a girl sometimes.](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140118184414/hunterxhunter/images/3/3f/Kurapika_tied_back_hair_disguise.png)

I envy you, friend.

>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat as him. Every time I hear this track, it's been a week since last time, so I really don't feel like it's such a feat to not get tired of it.
>> ARTICLE
I get what you mean but I'm just tired of it. I skip it every single week. I just hate the song musically. Some people compare it to Smile Bomb from Yu Yu Hakusho but that had a singer (at least the dub, which I watched) who didn't sound so polarizing (IMO). It fit the feel of YYH too.

Anyways, it's just an OP. What else can ya really say about it?
>> ARTICLE
I hate the OP. watched it the first episode. Never watched the OP again. The only ending I liked was the first one. 
>> ARTICLE
The new OP is amazingly beautiful. Very happy with it.

I really wished they used [The Galneryus version of Departure!](http://youtu.be/XQe3RktRL0M?t=16m44s) to go along with the new OP.

It's invalid anyway. The important thing is that there is someone else voting for Gon and 2 other people voting Hisoka.

Wait . . . is Leorio actually going to be a bad-ass in this arc?! 
>> ARTICLE
[Well](/s "yes......kinda")
>> ARTICLE
is your spoiler revealing something about the plot or just an answer to the question
>> ARTICLE
Maybe Leorio is one of the medical experts. Would make sense, he learned about nen a (short) while ago and is interested in becoming a doctor. Medical knowledge + nen could go a long way. Even if he is really weak in nen, don't forget that he is a knife user. My guess is that he becomes some kind of surgeon hunter (knives -> scalpels)

It just answers the question.

It's a yes/no answer.

It just answers the question but i feel like that should still be tagged as a spoiler.

Did they just make an entire episode deciding how the next chairman would be elected, and show a little of the election itself, then just make it the best thing ever?

This whole episode had a really cool look and feel to it. The conversations between the Zodiacs were really entertaining to watch and I can't wait to see what powers they have. We've only seen a glimpse of two of them, the Bird girl and the Snake girl. I doubt all of the Zodiacs will get their powers explained in detail though, if we get to see them at all.

The cinematography (we can call it cinematography, right?) and background reminded me a bit of the conversation between Tsuhiki and Kaiki in Nisemonogatari. If this is going to be a very dialogue heavy arc, then I hope we get more scenes like this, that would be pretty great. Everything just looked so *clean*, I can't get enough of it.
>> ARTICLE
The Election looked very low key. It wasn't as flashy or dramatic as I had thought it would be. 
>> ARTICLE
This is literally named the "Chairman Election Arc"
>> ARTICLE
I really thought there would be a lot more Hunters. 
>> ARTICLE
They said that yearly disappearences were 0.6 on avarage and that this is strange as deaths are quite common, but disappearence is very rare. Guess there has to be a quite big gap between disappearences and gaps for them to say it like that. But even if everything together would mean that 10 hunters die/disappear every year that still would kinda control their number. Think about how many people pass the exam. Also those who lose their hunter licens are not hunters anymore and they said somethign lie 1 in 5 loses their licens in the first year (I am assuming that the first year is critical and weeds out those who shouldn't have passed)
>> ARTICLE
considering how risky being a Hunter is and how hard it is to pass the Hunter's Exam, it makes sense that the count would be neither to big nor too small.
>> ARTICLE
Wow i totally expected a new ED Song so i can add it to my playlist cuz HxH ed's are the best. QQ they just ripped some other parts from the full ED4 song. But the opening was badass as usual XD
>> ARTICLE
pretty slow episode. my thoughts:

* Wow didn't expect Ging to be this smart, considering Gon is not the brightest

* Yay Hisoka is back, but why?

* Is Hisoka going to save Gon?

* Wait, that unknown zoldyck sibling looks like the reincarnation of Kite?
>> ARTICLE
>Gon is not the brightest

Gon has intelligence but he lacks knowledge of the world and that often makes him seem dumb. But it is more naivety than anything else. I bet by the time he becomes Ging's age he will be just as cunning. 
>> ARTICLE
Gon's actually been surprisingly thoughtful at points. Such as how he questioned the possibility of having to sacrifice someone in the "Doki Doki quiz" at the start of the series or how he saw through Pouf's plots in CA. There definitely is a possibility that Gon could be on that level if he just wisens up a little bit. 
>> ARTICLE
> Wait, that unknown zoldyck sibling looks like the reincarnation of Kite?

There's no connection.
>> ARTICLE
To be precise, there's no way that the unknown Zoldyck dude can be Kite. The picture with the Zoldyck family can be assumed to have been taken a long time ago, before Killua left the family (he even looks younger in the picture). Kite got killed and zombified much more recently.
>> ARTICLE
Gon was always pretty smart, even if his plans were a bit risky. We haven't gotten to see any of his masterful strategies in a while, considering the last time he thought was a rampage fueled by hatred and despair, but if you watch some of the earlier episodes he does have some pretty cool plans. The fight with Bomber in the greed island arc is a good example of this in my opinion.

Hisoka is probably just here to look for a fight, as usual. We did see him ranking people in the lobby.

If Hisoka is going to do anything about saving Gon, then he'll probably be going to either Killua, to try and help him find whatever he needs at his home, or go to one of the Phantom Troupe to try and help him.

I'm pretty sure the reincarnation of Kite was Reina, the little girl who was one of the first to be eaten at the start of the Chimera Ant arc. He got Reina's body, and Reina got her mind put in a weird ant / human body. If a Zoldyck was eaten, then I think we would have been shown something about it by now. Hunter X Hunter wouldn't leave out a detail like that.

These are just my thoughts, though.
>> ARTICLE
Please remember Gon is like what, 14 years old? 

He's not going to outsmart a bunch of adults.
>> ARTICLE
Except Gon has outsmarted and overpowered a bunch of adults. Multiple times.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, though, Candleman's plan was silly.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think neo-Kite has anything to do with Reina, other than the fact that Colt was grasping at straws when he saw the microfetus emerge.
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty much it.  It was a name that meant something to him, though I don't think he ever figured it out.
>> ARTICLE
wow so much content in one episode..
just out of curiosity how many chapter did this episode cover?
>> ARTICLE
2 chapters.

That Pariston guy is soooooooooooooooo sketchy...

He's the best kind of sketchy.  His sole purpose in life is to make things miserable for everyone around him, and he's always happy to be hated.

Damn,Pariston seems like quite a douchebag.
It was nice to see more of Ging,Zodiacs and the older faces,mainly Hisoka is finally back.
Also the opening is really great and I too have never got tired of Departure.

The anime is based on the manga. The Manga is very old (started in the 90s) but due to many hiatuses due to the mangaka's poor health, this anime has caught up to its 10 years worth of source material in about 3 years. The anime will have to either slow down, add filler, or stop completely in order to deal with this in the future.
>> ARTICLE
I heard the writer said he would never let the anime catch up to the manga 
>> ARTICLE
Well it's going to happen. Otherwise the show will have to stop.
>> ARTICLE
My guess is stop comletly ince Madhouse doesn't like doing filler.


>> ARTICLE
Chapter 319 is where the episode starts off at
>> ARTICLE
so like the HxH opening fan i am, i watched the damn thing like 20 times. 

so anyway, why is ging a [panda](http://i.imgur.com/c2J16Gf.png) in this section of the opening? (CR @52 seconds) 

is that a spoiler?
>> ARTICLE
nice catch on the panda.

no, its not much a spoiler but a Ging's gag that you'll see in next few episodes. [just in case](#s "ging is an asshole, he eventually stop going to those meetings and just place a panda plushie on his seat to replace himself.")

[spoiler](/s "Technically, she also refers to herself as a girl, specifically as a sister")

Why doesn't Madhouse just animate everything?
>> ARTICLE
Cause the manga author is still making it. We don't want another infamous 100 episodes of Naruto filler or what happened with Bleach. Someone above me mentioned the anime going on hiatus to let the manga have more time.

I'm cool with that if it means we get more HxH like it's being made now.

EDIT: I'm an idiot.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you got my comment right, m8.

I understand with clarity now. But...what about Trigger? :D
>> ARTICLE
So does Hisoka have a new VA? Or do I just think that because I haven't heard him in so long?
>> ARTICLE
Nope still the same Daisuke Namikawa. It was a more gentle voice this time.. without the erotic excitement about Gon.
>> ARTICLE
Ugh I really dont like the designs of the zodiacs... Especially the horse guy, he looks so fucking redicolous, most of them dont even look human...

did anime mention that most zodiacs deliberately transform themselves to animal characters as a way to show netero their appreciation?

Nope it didn't.

Ahh, well that's nice. That horse guy must have done some plastic surgery...

Yes it did. before the opening sequence. (from crunchy roll, @0:29: "...and most members, out of adoration for the chairman, made moving efforts to embody their code names, such as changing their names or personas. However, there are exceptions.)
>> ARTICLE
Cheadle looks like she dropped straight out of a Goofy Movie.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's the point...
>> ARTICLE
Sigh they used the same ending but a different part of the song. They must be really low on the budget. 
Good episode though, got a feel for how this arc is going to be like.
>> ARTICLE
or they just think it is fitting
>> ARTICLE
Or they want to spend all their money on beautiful animation for the rest of the arc. That preview looked nice.
>> ARTICLE
This show is just getting better and better
>> ARTICLE
So, what's going to happen after this? Filler arc? Dark Continent doesn't/won't have nearly enough content to start the anime arc after the Chairman election, at least I don't think so.
>> ARTICLE
luckily madhouse doesn't like fillers so they will probably just wait until there is enough material to continue the anime
>> ARTICLE
The anime will most likely go on hiatus until there are enough chapters to adapt. We just have to hope that Togashi doesn't go on too many hiatuses himself. 
>> ARTICLE
Does something have to be Manga before it can become Anime? Is it possible that Togashi just goes all anime e.g no manga?  Rather than going on Hiatus I mean. 
>> ARTICLE
Togashi is back from his hiatus now, plus he has said that watching his work as an anime is too embarrassing so i seriously doubt that he would collaborate with the anime writers.
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty much unheard of. These direct manga adaptations will always be manga first.

Special cases include FMA which decided to just change the whole series. 
>> ARTICLE
Well FMA branched off due to lack of source material. Brotherhood was made after the fact when the source material was done.

>> ARTICLE
So, do we know what is going to happen with the series? Are they going to go on hiatus again to wait for the original material, or write on the go with supervision from the author?
>> ARTICLE
Aww yiss, Ging being the most crafty motherfucker.

DAT OP man, really enjoyed this episode. New arc, new characters and old characters made a come back as well.

This Rat is such a rat.

How much episodes til we reach the manga? You know that feeling when you want to read the manga but also don't want to because the anime is so awesome?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if anybody has already asked this...but since this ep started off at chapter 319, can I switch at this point from watching the anime to reading the manga?

Or should I just stick to watching the anime once a week?
>> ARTICLE
Look at some of the manga drawings, they are good, burt compared to the animation that Madhouse does along with the awesome music it really cannot compete with the anime.

I am staying away from the manga, but if you check the comments here we are going to catch up soon anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Watch the anime. It won't be long until it's caught up and this arc is difficult to follow in the manga.

awesome. thanks

I feel like the number should be over 6xx ... 18 died this year and only like five join a year, plus tons died on greed island, plus tons more die regularly, there just isn't anywhere close to enough of them for this, it should be a couple thousand minimum. Plus the next Arc should need a lot more...

18 went missing he said it was weirder for a hunter to go missing over losing there life unexpectedly

>> ARTICLE
18 went missing over *three years*. Hence the tenfold increase from 0.6 per year.
>> ARTICLE
So I guess being a Zodiac has less to do with being strong and more to do with being Netero's vacation/cosplay buddy, although Ging and Pariston seem to be the exceptions . . .
>> ARTICLE
Zodiac's probably get elected to fill all sorts of roles.  Some aren't strong fighters but probably are very good at something else (the rat guy being charismatic, the other girl being a peace-maker etc).  Netero probably just thought that if their was anything he couldn't deal with everyone else was fucked anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Well he was the chairman, I think he took strenght into consideratino too, but seeing how Netero was sucha fun guy I think he really just chose a theme that interested him and sought people with fitting personalities for lulz
>> ARTICLE
my current guess is that the zodiac members are the handful of people who saw Netero strength and did not went into "insane admiration" state but at the same time ain't strong enough or lack interest for a fight with Netero.
>> ARTICLE
They are plenty strong. Remember Hisoka gave them numbers vastly higher than any other hunters.
>> ARTICLE
this episode was sick. i love the way they introduced Ging. 
I feel like all the hype he had, and then he is just simply now a part of the show. no big reveal or anything.

Him and Itachi should form a crow club.
>> ARTICLE
With this and when they were talking about Alluka's powers a couple episodes back Hisoka and Illumi are becoming my favorite HxH duo.
>> ARTICLE
Hisoka isn't even fazed. These kinds of things make me question exactly how strong is this guy?!!
>> ARTICLE
I would put all of the royal guards above him as they were shown to be ridiculously strong. Youpi had somewhere around 800,000 on the APR, while Knuckle had I think like 6-70000. Knuckle was also putting quite the beating on Gon too.  
Netero is definitely stronger than him.  
Both pre and post nuke Meruem would destroy as he was wayy OP.  
Ging should be stronger based on what Netero said about him, even though he hasn't showed any feats yet.  
I'd put Chrollo above him too based on what the Zoldyks said about him during their fight.
I'd think he is stronger that most of the Phantom Troupe though. If anything maybe Feitan or Uvo could last against him but IMO, it doesn't looks like Hisoka has tried to his full potential yet.
>> ARTICLE
I think its more that Hisoka doesn't fear death as long as he gets a good fight. He *did* count Illumi as a 99(I think it was 99, it might habe been 95) on his scale after all.
>> ARTICLE
somehow i think hisoka counts himself as 100. meaning he's stronger than all of the zodiac's he's rated. 

ging or pariston or undead netero might give him actual trouble
>> ARTICLE
I don't think his rating isn't about the actual strength, but more about the potential he see's in his opponents. This is why he is rating gon so high, cause gon has do much hidden potential. And that's also why he wants to fight crollo so badly 
>> ARTICLE
He never gave gon or chrollo a numerical rating
>> ARTICLE
It was 95.
>> ARTICLE
i love how they just lose their noses all of a sudden. it makes that scene so much better.

From the thread on /r/hunterxhunter here's the translated relationship diagram:

http://images.wikia.com/hunterxhunter/images/archive/c/c7/20120417122937!Zoldyck-relationships.jpg

note that the guy in the bottom right with no connections is Maha Zoldyck, Zeno's grandfather. He appeared in the manga when the Zoldycks assassinated the ten dons, but was cut out of the anime.
>> ARTICLE
The picture doesn't work anymore, but I am really curious to read it. Can someone give me a new link?
>> ARTICLE
try pressing enter on the url
>> ARTICLE
It worked O.o thanks a lot :)
>> ARTICLE
Huh. Wonder why Kalluto (sp?) envies Alluka. Was it ever touched on in the anime? Maybe he just want Killua's attention too :p
>> ARTICLE
He's really Zeno's grandfather? He's 98 while Zeno is 67. That means Zeno's dad and his Maha popped out kids around 14-15.
>> ARTICLE
I have read somewhere that he was first intended to be Zeno's father but Togashi changed it for some reason. 
>> ARTICLE
Who is the baby between Killua's dad and mother? The one that has "basically untouched" written under it.
>> ARTICLE
That is Maha.
>> ARTICLE
Was he revealed in the anime? Can you refresh my memory I am afraid to look at the wiki because of spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
This is the first time he's been referenced in the anime. Except maybe when Zeno was talking about Netero? But I don't think he was named or anything.
>> ARTICLE
Hes zenos grandfather, he was in the york arc. He was only shown in the manga and not the anime. He was seen helping illumi assassinating the ten dons.
>> ARTICLE
that was Maha Zoldyck. He is Zeno's grandfather. They said that the only person who survived after fighting him was Netero.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, so he was even stronger than young Netero? Can't wait to hear more about him
>> ARTICLE
If he was stronger then why would Netero be the only one to ever survive ...
>> ARTICLE
Surviving doesn't mean he's stronger
>> ARTICLE
I like that the sister and the mother really have no relevance to the other characters. What really interests me is Illumi, what's his goals, why is he so obsessed with Killua what's his end game plan? I wonder how this chart would be changed with the removal of Alluka...
>> ARTICLE
If you're talking about the "sister" in the bottom right, that's Kalluto and he's actually a "brother."
>> ARTICLE
Wow! Is there any reason why he dresses like a girl?
>> ARTICLE
Well I don't read the manga nor do I recall a reason from the anime. But I heard some people say that Killua's mom was sad that she didn't have a daughter (she does have Alluka but evidently she doesn't consider her part of the family), so she started treating Kalluto like a girl.
>> ARTICLE
Alluka is biologically male as well. 

Kalluto just wears a kimono. When he refers to himself he uses male pronouns etc. There is no gender confusion there, just a bit of cross dressing. 
>> ARTICLE
Excuse me? The kimono girl right? The one that was hanging out with the Phantom Troupe? SHE'S A BOY? Did they mention that one episode? Or was I just brain dead and missed it?
>> ARTICLE
He's a guy, IIRC he dresses like a girl because of killua.
>> ARTICLE
I would say she is the same amount of a boy like Neferpitou.
>> ARTICLE
Not the same, Togashi has never clarified Pitou's sex. Kalluto IS a boy.
>> ARTICLE
For me it is the same as the ending of code geass. The one side arguments that the devs said so, so it must be true. The other side explains, that cause of thinge we saw in the anime, it can't be true. Even if the creator said sth else as long as it makes more sense to be the other way, for me is it the other way. 

If Togashi would come up to me, after Hunter x Hunter is finished and would say, that Netero is not dead even tho we have not seen him anymore, have no explanaiton how he could survive and there is not a single hint how this is possible, I would simply not believe it. It does not make sense.

Even tho it is not unrealistic, that Kalluto is a boy, as long as it makes no difference and as long as there is no explanaiton or reason why he/she should be a boy, I will see her as a girl. 

Edit: And somebody who looks like[this](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120330134443/hunterxhunter/images/thumb/e/e4/Kalluto3.jpg/185px-Kalluto3.jpg) is a girl to me as long as I can decide, no matter what Togashi says.
>> ARTICLE
Well you are just simply wrong. As you can see in [this](http://images.wikia.com/hunterxhunter/images/archive/c/c7/20120417122937!Zoldyck-relationships.jpg) graph Kalluto envies Alluka, since Alluka is transgender and he dresses up like a girl, Kalluto does the same in an intent to get Killua's atention. Killua has no sisters, just brothers. If you still don't want to believe, well that is just you, but you are wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
Where did you get that information from? The manga? And why does he want Killuas attention?
>> ARTICLE
Have we watched the same series/episode? ...
>> ARTICLE
Kalluto is a boy and that's all over the manga and the anime (pronouns, male honorifics etc).
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember if they ever mentioned it but I know it says on the wiki article that Kalluto is male.
>> ARTICLE
Why does he envy alluka?
>> ARTICLE
The guidebooks explicitly state Kalluto's a boy. In the show, Kalluto refers to himself with the male pronoun "boku."

People say that Kikyo (mother) treats Kalluto like a girl or that Kalluto puts on a feminine appearance, hoping Killua will pay attention to him (actually, I think Kalluto wants Killua to notice him but not necessarily using this method), but I've never seen canonical indication of either of these things... I think Togashi just likes drawing characters who are more than what they appear to be. 
>> ARTICLE
What I heard is that the mother does not consider alluka her child, therefore she got "sad?" that she had no daughters, so she began treating 1 of the brothers(kalluto) like a girl.
>> ARTICLE
But isn't Alluka really a boy as well?
>> ARTICLE
I just assumed he was a girl too. I'm getting used to seeing articles about these characters having a "Gender Confusion" section. To my knowledge that makes at least 3:

Neferpitou

> Not to mention both Killua and Gon's voice actors are female. Oh boy.

Well isn't it pretty common for children in animation to have female voice actors anyways?

>> ARTICLE
I imagine so, though Aang had a male voice actor, I'm not too sure about other young male protagonists though.

Edit:
Himura Kenshin (Rurouni Kenshin) - female vc

Simon (Gurren Lagann) - male vc

Ash Ketchum (Pokemon) - female vc 

Monkey D. Luffy (One Piece) - female vc

Goku (Dragonball Z) - female vc 

Aladdin (Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic) - female vc 

Edward and Alphonse Elric (Fullmetal Alchemist) - both female vcs

InuYasha (InuYasha) - male vc 

Yusuke Urameshi (Yu Yu Hakusho) - male vc 

Kirito (Sword Art Online) - male vc 

Yukiteru Amano (Mirai Nikki) - male vc 

Waver Velvet (Fate/Zero) - male vc 

Tsutomu Senkawa (Tetsuwan Birdy) - male vc 

Most of the younger characters are played by women.

The avatar cartoons are not anime though, as far as /r/anime seems to be concerned.

True, but the person I replied to did use "children in animation", which I took as anything animated, not necessarily "anime", which I think most Western people would consider to be referring to Japanese-only animation.

Why is it that killua who is from a family of cold blooded sociopathic assassins has more feels than Gon who is supposed to be the happy go lucky mc
>> ARTICLE
Which emotion are you talking about? happy go lucky or feels? They are kind of the opposite.
>> ARTICLE
I meant to say that overall killua is a happier person 
>> ARTICLE
I think the issue is that the word "feelings" seems to vanish from people's vocabularies after a few months on this site and, unlike "feels", would fit reasonably well here.

Gon was more happy-go-lucky than Killua. Then the closest person he has to a father killed and felt more responsible for it.

[Here is the vote tally from the most recent election, from the manga.](https://i.imgur.com/VEIE2lZ.png) The anime shows it too at 2:12, but it scrolls up, so I figured this would be preferable to see.

Gon and Kite have 4 votes each! :D

But Kite's dead..
>> ARTICLE
Who says they know he was killed?
>> ARTICLE
So does that mean he's counted among the absentees?

I'd imagine Morel reported his death to the association, but that doesn't mean that all the individual hunters have heard the news, right?

5 more votes and Gon would have been in the top 16 :(

Wow, it must really suck to have to carry all those coins all the time. Also, Gotoh is pretty Badass.

Too shy or too...Ging.
>> ARTICLE
Very excited to see Hisoka fight Gotoh, but I'm even more excited to see Illumi fight. We've never really seen him in a serious fight, barely even a small fight.

Small guess, I dont read the manga. But I think Illumi will end up fight Tsubone and Hisoka will get a run for his money(pun intended).
>> ARTICLE
I dont read the manga either, but Illumi fighting Tsubone seems illogical to me because if Illumi were to defeat Tsubone, Alluka would lose her target for requests.

_Unless there is another hidden rule at play for that._
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, I think Zeno/Silva knows some hidden rule aswell. We'll see, so excited for next week. =)

Hisoka's reaction was [priceless](http://gfycat.com/MeekFragrantBlackfly)

he looked like Pariston in that scene

Oh my gawd...just contemplated the possibility that they're related...my brain...
>> ARTICLE
Maybe that is a nod to how the voice actor for Pariston played Hisoka in the 1999 version of Hunter x Hunter? 
>> ARTICLE
I think it more has to do with that Hisoka was wearing a poker face in that scene (lying about not wanting to release Illum's bloodlust) and Pariston is ALWAYS playing a poker face because he is constantly scheming.
>> ARTICLE
I think its both

I love how in a "Zoldyck-way" Illumi cares about Killua.

I can't wait to see Hisoka fight again.

Also I hope Kurapika shows up soon, if he does.

After catching up on every episode, I hate how I have to wait a whole week now. I just want to watch more!
>> ARTICLE
I watch HxH on full screen so I can't see the loading bar. Every episode I'm always scared to hear that ending music. It almost always catches me off guard. When I **really** *really* wanted to see Gotoh and Hisoka fight, BAM ending music.
>> ARTICLE
I felt like that, too. Thats why I decided to read the manga. Now that i catched up there too though - I have the same problem again -.- 
Damn I just want mooooooooooore

Don't worry! After september the show will be on hiatus and we won't have to wait for episodes every week!

This is the last complete arc. The most recent manga arc just started a few weeks ago after a long hiatus. [Here is a chart of how much it sucked waiting around for chapters](http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/File:Hiatus_Chart.png) thats why people call it Hiatus x Hiatus

Pretty good episode! Also how did Tsubone know about Killua's Godspeed? I'm pretty sure he developed it during the Chimera Ants Arc.
>> ARTICLE
Can't be too sure on this, but I would assume that they keep tabs on anyone who leaves the house.

You know Illumi is someone to fear when he doesn't need any aura to scare the hell out of you

Cute Illumi, cute Hisoka and cute Alluka all in one episode. Awesome.

I guess I should be happy I didn't marathon during last arc, but this sudden stop is still pretty hard.

Kind of concerned over what happens once Gon wakes up though.

Yeah, I only just finished watching all the episodes over the last 2-3 weeks. Extremely glad that the Ant arc had ended by the time I finished. But goddamn, I should've waited another year before deciding to watch.

I caught up at the worst possible time: just before they started attacking the King's palace.

As someone who just finished my HxH marathon today, I feel for your souls. It must have sucked. 

When's the next episode coming out?

>> ARTICLE
Tuesdays, I forget what time. Late afternoon / early evening.

>> ARTICLE
But then you wouldn't get to talk about the show with us fine gentlemen. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, there's only another couple of episodes now, then we'll get a hiatus while more material is written. 
>> ARTICLE
I just caught up today. That means I just have 2 more episodes to wait for?
>> ARTICLE
Estimate is mid-September for the end of the current arc. It's pretty unlikely that they'll show the few episodes of the next (unfinished) arc needed to get right to the edge of the new material, so that's the likely end-point for now. The animators are already booked to shift over to work on the **Parasyte** adaptation, which should be quite good.
>> ARTICLE
I just searched it up. Sounds fairly interesting I guess. 
>> ARTICLE
Writing this as I'm loading the episode I'm so hype to see some hisoka action it's been a while since he had a good amount of screentime

Haha, all that popularity that Leorio gained just by punching Gon's dad xD

That chase scene though! How can you even ride like that?! And that bloodlust scene. It was hilarious xD

I am starting to like Gotoh. And Killua is so cute :3
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap, that car chase scene, I was expecting something big to happen right at that moment when I saw [this,](http://i.imgur.com/5SuwF4f.png) but nothing like what actually happened.

So much intensity in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what is is about Pariston, but he just seems like the absolute worst choice for chairman. I want to know if he is secretly evil or something. God that man gives me the creeps.
>> ARTICLE
Having parison as a representative for year of the mouse/rat Kinda seemed like offhandedly saying kids today will smile to your face and stab you in the back...


I guess that's just my take on it
>> ARTICLE
What are you watching... In one of the last few episodes they said missing hunter's rate increased a lot since Paris became Vice-president, he surely is into some evil shady stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Just because he's a shitty vice-president, doesn't make him evil. It also hasn't been EXPLICITLY said what evil-doings he has been up to. That's what I'm looking for here. But I assume it's the same kinda stuff that is with Alluka, that Ai or whatever, idk. I haven't read the manga so I only know what people mention here
>> ARTICLE
Not saying I like him, but with tons of Hunters dying in Greed Island and to the Chimera ants, isn't the hunter missing rate expected to go up?
>> ARTICLE
That's a good point, since I'm sure a lot more hunters went up against the ants than what we saw (like whoever Leol borrowed the wave powers from, that Morel recognized).
>> ARTICLE
I think Leol said he encountered him but never killed him and I don't think his power allows him to borrow moves from people who are dead.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, when they showcased leol's power when he was using the dragonflys they said that if the person he borrowed from died, their power would disappear from his ipod.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is that they're missing, not dying.  Hunters dying in the line of duty is expected, but instead they're disappearing without a trace.
>> ARTICLE
Does each hunter just make up what their 'Hunter thing' is? Because there are only a couple hundred hunters and i can imagine multiple say 'Virus Hunters' (best name) or 'Archaeology Hunters' but 'Counseling Hunters'.... and *shudders* 'Cutiful Hunters'? Leorio is referred to as a rookie which implies you need to do something to obtain a title. Do you need some kind of qualification in 'Cutifuling'?
>> ARTICLE
"Hunter" is just a title given to whoever can finish the grueling Hunter Exam. It bestows a lot of benefits and opens up a lot of doors, so-to-speak, but as far as actual responsibilities, it seems to be up to the individual Hunter to decide what they want to "hunt" for.
>> ARTICLE
Why is Leorio a rookie then? He still passed the exam
>> ARTICLE
He hasn't really "hunted" for something or made any accomplishments like the others.
>> ARTICLE
Rookie is down to him not having earned any stars yet, which are awarded for great achievements. He also hasn't selected a speciality, to my knowledge.
>> ARTICLE
I bet Gon is the friendship hunter. 
>> ARTICLE
Ging Hunter
>> ARTICLE
I think people basically make up what they're hunting for.  Doesn't matter what you hunt for, you're a hunter regardless.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, I think Hunters make up their own titles. : ) 
>> ARTICLE
Brotoh better win this one. He is a really cool guy
>> ARTICLE
I'm starting to kinda like Illumi. Even though he pulls a bunch of shit you can tell he really cares about his family.. just in a really fucked up sorta way

>> ARTICLE
 Yeah, he's the oldest and most devoted, and yet Killua's the one favored to be the successor.
>> ARTICLE
In this episode they mentioned something about illuminati being like his mother. It seems killua is the only male that represents his fathers side of the family and is therefore chosen to carry on the line of grandfather-father-killua 
>> ARTICLE
"Hisoka and Gotoh...are about to engage in battle." Literally the first thing that popped up in my head after that line was "No, Mr. Aho-Announcer-san, they're going to have a tea party."

But still a great episode. I love the Zoldyck family's problem solving skills. This internal family struggle, or whatever Killua & Illumi called it, seems as complex and nuanced as trying to run a country subtly from behind the scenes. It's wonderful. Also, Leorio for president!
>> ARTICLE
That lines translation was actually missing a little.

A more complete translation would be "...are about to engage in a no-holds barred, serious fight." with the stress on the seriousness of the situation.

Basically the narrator was stressing the point that the ensuing fight was going to be for keeps, and not the two of them toying with each other.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, gotcha. I appreciate the reply... I kinda read the vibe, but that definitely clears it up a bit.

This episode adapted Chapter 326 and half of 327 so start on that one.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't read this manga yet because I like watching too much, but I'd recommend starting from the beginning. It's always worth it to see the stuff they cut out of the anime. I peeked just based on the chapter names and 324 is titled "Butlers." First panel shows it's the episode where Killua goes to see Alluka in her play room. That will get you close, at least.  
>> ARTICLE
Pretty good episode.  Definitely could tell they had to stretch that animation budget some, but they made up for it with some fun facial expressions this time around.  Gotoh better be pretty damn strong if he has any chance of surviving the next episode.  I can't see him beating Hisoka though.  

I wish they'd blend the end song a bit better.  It's been somewhat jarring in some of the recent episodes, including this one.
>> ARTICLE
pretty sure hisoka is basically like an akabane. he isn't going to lose to anyone he fights. 

i give gotoh 2 minutes. 
>> ARTICLE
They said morel is likely to get 2 star hunter status. I think gon deserves it too, since he was the only guy to actually kill one of the royal guards.
>> ARTICLE
Not by skill. Several of them probably could have done it if they had entered into a restriction and pledge and basically given up their life.
>> ARTICLE
Cards vs. Coins! Who will win?
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else find it really stupid on Leorio's part that he just basically showed his Nen power to the whole world last episode? The element of surprise/confusion is enormous in Nen-user battles. 
>> ARTICLE
Interesting note: it was stupid for Leorio to reveal his power. And that's why it's so fitting - Leorio is headstrong and rather stupid.

Hisoka also explained his power to Gotoh, and Gotoh called him out for it! I usually hate when anime characters explain their powers verbally to the enemy because it's stupid and unrealistic, but it also makes perfect sense for Hisoka since Hisoka is Hisoka.
>> ARTICLE
[Leorio + Manga slight Spoilers:](/s "Not that he got Nen for battles.. 
Although, he'll probably use it for fighting anyways in the upcoming chaos.. but.. that really has nothing to do with those who would have seen his powers.")

bisky was a double star!? 

she never really fought seriously, but that should make her pretty damn strong

Actually, stars represent achievements, not strength, so even a weak person can achieve up to three stars if they meet the requirements.

Ging is eligible for 3 stars, just doesn't care for it (presumption).

>> ARTICLE
I like that they're starting to introduce the many different types of hunters: virus hunters, hacker hunters, and even "cutiful" hunters. 

Seeing as Morel is only a single star hunter makes me wonder how amazing you have to be in order to gain three stars. You need to accomplish a bunch of things in multiple fields to get three, right? Even if he did help defeat the ants, I still can't see him as a three star hunter, unfortunately. Doesn't seem like he would stack up against Pariston in terms of breadth. Even Ging is only a two star, though he could be ultra-specialized in one field.
>> ARTICLE
If I remember correctly, the Ten Commandments for Hunters state that you can only achieve 3 stars if you (a)contribute in several fields [2 stars] AND (b) have a discipline who has achieved 1 star.

Seeing as both Knuckle and Shoot was part of the invasion, I would assume either one or both of them got 1 star, and Morel finally did something on land (since he's a sea hunter) haha.
>> ARTICLE
they said he could jump to three star for helping to defeat the ants. he probably shouldnt be considered a 1 star anymore since hes pretty strong.
>> ARTICLE
then what does that make gon since he is the only one to actually defeat a royal guard?
>> ARTICLE
Half-dead and unlikely to ever recover if not for Alluka.
>> ARTICLE
Ging could be 3 star but he is lazy.
>> ARTICLE
The stars aren't really a measure of strength. It's just your overall standing in the organization. You could be the strongest hunter in existence and just be a one-star if you don't have many noteworthy accomplishments.  
>> ARTICLE
Illumi, your bloodlust is showing. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what looked worse: Gon's body, or Killua's face when he realized how broken Gon's body was.
>> ARTICLE
Killua's face was spot-on, Madhouse is just godlike.
>> ARTICLE
I was way more impressed by Leorio's face.

Actually, all reaction faces in HxH are spot-on and very expressive. Togashi is a genius and Madhouse know what they are doing.

At 04:18, when Killua asks Alluka to please help him... such god damn excellent direction. The nuances the voice actor brings to life... this show takes my breath away like none other.

Oh i've never watched previews, they are full of spoilers

Oh sorry bro.
>> ARTICLE
Same. The episode didn't show Killua after Gon was healed, but I don't think anything bad happened to him. It's the wish. That wish seemed like such a big display of power, I wonder who died...I mean someone had to have suffered from "something's" wish. I just hope its not a character(s) we know.
>> ARTICLE
It seemed like Killua had an exception to some part of the wishing rule, which is what he was hiding from Illumi. He mentioned they would put needles in his head if his family learned what it was.

Maybe it does hurt Killua in some way, and so his family would try to use the needles to protect him again. The first thing that came to mind was it would affect Killua's lifespan but that was just a random thought without anything to back it up.
>> ARTICLE
They (especially Illumi) would put needles in his head to control him (and therefore Alluka's powers) ... ;)
>> ARTICLE
"Something" only asks for kind requests after healing, like a pat on the head.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't Killua say that Nanika is a kind person so asking to heal someone doesn't have tremendous requests? So no one died.

>> ARTICLE
Pariston is such a magnificent bastard. 
Also can't believe Gon lasted that long in his condition. 
>> ARTICLE
He was worse than dead, so dying would be a gift to him which would be against the equal exchange he has to deal with for making such a nen contract. 
>> ARTICLE
Um, I know you wanted me to heal him, but for some reason when I started lifting the curse he just died.
>> ARTICLE
Pariston's only sincere smile in the arc. His antics in this series is an unorthodox, yet effective example of filibustering. It's also the reason why filibustering is controversial.
>> ARTICLE
It's not controversial. It's only used to delay the majority. Everyone knows that. But getting both sides to agree to dismantle when it is always advantageous for the minority to keep it alive makes it impossible. Parties flip flop between being majority/minority every other year in the US. The fillibuster isn't even a part of the constitution here in the US. It's made up as a Senate rule and can just as easily be removed if they wanted to.
>> ARTICLE
It is controversial as in it sets off controversy. Everyone criticizes it when their opponents are using it.  The fact that everyone approves of it by not voting for reform is does not negate the controversy it inspires.  The lack of fillibuster reform is even a subject of criticism in the press.  I think the only way you could argue it's not controversial is by arguing that there is no public disagreement about it--everyone condemns it, but the two parties are unwilling to give it up.
>> ARTICLE
Oh? How it's used today, as opposed to way back when, is pretty controversial. People can call them without putting any of the work it used to take in order to keep them alive.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome back Gon. His arm looked absolutely disgusting. Illumi's laugh was awesome. The reunion scene with Leorio was hearth-warming. Didn't know that Leorio could jump so high and so far. Looks like Pariston is gonna be the new chairman since Leorio has no motivation anymore because Gon is alive again. Pariston planned the whole election from the beginning. 

Also Gon and Ging finally meet, let's see what Ging is gonna say to his son.
>> ARTICLE
You totally summarized the episode very good

>> ARTICLE
It would be a great idea if there was an episode summary in every discussion post.
>> ARTICLE
Pariston can play everyone like a piano.
>> ARTICLE
I think the only one he played was Cheadle, who is just obsessed at contradicting him. Most of the other hunters don't know or care who the chairman is or what happens. It was hard enough to get a high enough turnout without locking the doors. Ging doesn't care. Most of the Zodiacs don't care. Leorio was more the clown candidate that everyone voted for to diss the election. Some do know who Gon is and know Leorio is trustworthy, but he has no intentions of running the association.
>> ARTICLE
I like to think that Leorio was perfect for the chairman position because he reflected what every other Hunter wanted with a chairmen.

Basically someone who cares about his friends and is head-strong enough to be honest, but doesn't want to change things.  

Most Hunters, I imagine, don't want to deal with the hassle of changing things and want to get back to their lives.  So leaving Leorio, a guy who doesn't really want to change anything, would be perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it just hit me like a ton of bricks that there are only 3 episodes left.

I know :( Out of everything I watch, Hunter x Hunter is always the highlight. A lot of folk seem to of the opinion it is gone for good... but that just seems like pessimism. There's no way in hell this is the last we see of animated HxH.

If it does continues it probably won't be with Madhouse since they have been known to never make sequels of things that are very popular

Hajime no Ippo has gotten a sequel every 6 or so years and that's not even that popular. 

Its certainly not impossible

Kaiji, Hajime no Ippo, Chihayafuru, Black Lagoon. All of those got sequels so it's not impossible, and HxH has been quite a big and long running thing so I can't see why they wouldn't continue it... Though the time between this and the "sequel" might be a valid reason, I just hope the (possible) new studio won't start from scratch in 2025 or something.
>> ARTICLE
Whaaaat!? They're not doing the 2nd world saga? Welp, I guess I'll have to wait for Hunter x Hunter 2019.
>> ARTICLE
On the plus side the current manga arc is awesome so far, which is something to look forward to. But until that is attempted we'll all just have to suffer withdrawals.
>> ARTICLE
Let's hope that Togashi-Sensei gets well and recover from his back pain in order to keep working on the manga on a weekly basis without much HiatusxHiatus. 
>> ARTICLE
every other week is fine too...
>> ARTICLE
you mean lets hope he finish whatever new game hes into recently quickly..
>> ARTICLE
I would rather be this way, knowing that we will get something amazing to look forward to in the future than have it killed with pointless fillers.
>> ARTICLE
So it's stopping to let the Manga go on for a while?
>> ARTICLE
Before you get too hopeful, it's going to be a looong while. Unless they make an OVA once a year or something, it's gonna be years until there's enough material to re-start a weekly anime. 
>> ARTICLE
*shrug* I've waited since 2001 when the original HxH anime ended for this reboot to continue the story and I'll wait another decade for more.  
>> ARTICLE
There's also the possibility that Madhouse isn't the one that does it. :(
>> ARTICLE
I hope not....
>> ARTICLE
The hiatus x hiatus is strong with this one
>> ARTICLE
It breaks my heart!
>> ARTICLE
Good thing I no longer have a heart after the Chimera Ant Arc!
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit of a lurker here on /r/anime, as I only watch a few different anime, but HxH has some of the greatest story lines I have ever seen. In addition to the story, the villains are nothing short of perfect. Hisoka is fantastic in his search for the ultimate opponent. And the Chimera Ant arc. My God, a few episodes in and I was genuinely afraid that Gon and Killua had no chance against such a foe. Plus the King was one of the greatest villains ever simply because he was not pure evil. He felt very relatable and real. That whole story arc crushed me.
>> ARTICLE
It was interesting that Netero, for all his benevolence, turned out to kind of be a bad guy for not even considering genuinely discussing things with the King. And then Gon became a bad guy too, brutally massacring someone he didn't have to just because he was angry over her killing a single person, not considering how his friends would feel after he uses a kamikaze attack. But I think I'm in the minority here thinking than Gon became a monster who should now be greatly ashamed of himself.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely! Netero surprised me as a character because I had sort of likened him to Dumbledor/Gandalf/Fistandantilus, but he did end up being kind of a dick.
>> ARTICLE
Netero wasn't a dick at all, he did what he had to in order to protect the human race.  Also, I wouldn't say Gon became a bad guy even though he did become consumed by his desire for revenge.  Anyways, if he didn't do what he did he almost certainly would have died to Pitou.
>> ARTICLE
I hate the fact that this is going to end soon :(
Great episode
>> ARTICLE
Question: Will the series resume, or is it just done after 148?
>> ARTICLE
Unknown, we have to wait for more manga material to be released and an arc or two to be finished in the manga. 

We all want the show to continue when there is more material of course, but there is no confirmation that the series will continue, and if it does it might be several years to. 

My hearth hurts from writing this :(
>> ARTICLE
The current series, hunter x hunter 2011 is done, but i think the chances arent too bad that theres gonna be another hxh in a few years, that covers the manga thats still being drawn right now
>> ARTICLE
> that covers the manga thats stll being drawn right now

Well *technically* the manga has been drawn for the last 3+ weeks.  The creator is on break due to back pain and I don't think there is word on when he is starting up again.


>> ARTICLE
Well "drawn right now" more as in that its not finished yet
>> ARTICLE
I really can't hate Pariston he's such a smooth talker this anime got the best of the best antagonists, Hisoka, Pariston, Chrollo and Meruem they're all so amazing in their respective ways
>> ARTICLE
Parison is the god of trolls .-.
>> ARTICLE
you forgot gensuru and illumi
>> ARTICLE
As much as I loved Greed Island (My favorite arc), Genthru was an extremely forgettable villain.
>> ARTICLE
Why are you putting hisoka and pariston as antagonists?

Hisoka never really was an antagonist, he even was really, really helpful to both gon and killua in the first arc and got them to learn nen before fighting in the tower. He is much more  psycho ambiguale protagonist than antagonist. Yes, you can have protagonists that are neutral/bad (sasuke from naruto, hibari kyouya from reborn etc...)

As for pariston, he never opposed gon and even hoped he would recover so he could win the elections. Suppose togashi decided to let us read his mind instead of cheedle's, you would root for him imstead...

From wikipedia : Anantagonist(fromGreek -antagonists, "opponent, competitor, enemy, rival", from anti- "against" + agonizesthai "to contend for a prize,")[1]is a character, group of characters, orinstitutionthat represents the opposition against which theprotagonistor protagonists must contend. In other words, an antagonist is a person or a group of people who oppose the main character(s).

Edit : just an exemple, in yorkshin when zeno and sylva zoldyck were fighting chrollo, they stopped fighting him because the mafia bosses were killed by illumi. There are characters that has a goal that makes them neutral to other characters (money for those two). For hisoka, his goal is to duel a full grown and powerful gon, which doesn't concern the present gon (unless he decides for whatever reason to fuck him up like he fucked up pitou).
>> ARTICLE
an antagonist isnt evil, by the definition of the word its someone that goes aganist the protagonist
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I would class them more as anti-heroes.
>> ARTICLE
What if the protagonist is evil, then the antagonist would be the hero
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, Protagonist is just another word for central, or main character.

Anti-Hero is a main character that does anything to get their way/point across ie Light from Death Note. He kills bad people but does it in a horrible way. Or Dexter from the show Dexter.


>> ARTICLE
Maybe because Hisoka kills inocent ppl and Pariston allegedly had hunters "disappear".

i.e. they're "evil".
>> ARTICLE
Oh damn. then i guess yagami light from death note is an antagonist.

Edit : i don't understand how reddit works... you guys approve what i say but still downvote to oblivion... or maybe my sarcasm was too assholish?
>> ARTICLE
Initially I misunderstood what you were saying, but in the end I realised I agree with exactly what you're saying.

Although I will say that mid-way through Death Note, Light stops being the protagonist. There's a shift in the perspective the story is told from, but I think that was to accommodate the "twist" at the end.
>> ARTICLE
... Isn't that the whole point of Death Note?
>> ARTICLE
Light is the protagonist. Good and evil have nothing to do with it.
>> ARTICLE
An antagonist is someone who opposes to the main protagonist and it has nothing to do with doing "good" or "bad" things.  In the case of Death Note Light is the protagonist while L is the antagonist. 
>> ARTICLE
GOOOOOOOOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LEORIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am leaving my thirties not embarrassed shed a few on the carpet for ya there!!!
THE YOUNG GENERAL IS BACK!!!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck I loved that episode.  Nice to see Gon actually looking happy for the first time in forever.  That moment when Leorio saw him was freaking beautiful.

Also did anyone look at the preview? Can't wait.
>> ARTICLE
"For the first time in foreveeeerrr!!!!"
>> ARTICLE
Gon goes from Mummy x ET to normal Gon. I thought that he looked terrible but boy I was not expecting that. I'm guessing that Killua is going to leave now to grant Alluka's wishes and wonder when Hisoka's going to make his move. Any how it'll be interesting to see Gon and Ging's reunion. Lastly, Pariston in my eyes doesn't seem like such a bad guy anymore. His expression at the end almost seemed sincere.
>> ARTICLE
wait on it
>> ARTICLE
I am curious about Hisoka making his move. He is on a quest to find the greatest, most powerful opponent of all time, and I simply don't feel that Killua and Gon are there yet. They are certainly strong, but they struggled with chimera ants (I would have loved to see Hisoka fight some of the royal guard!!). Hisoka seems to be nurturing them a bit, helping them get stronger so that in the end he can do battle with them.
>> ARTICLE
I was so happy to hear Gon's voice again!
>> ARTICLE
Leorio's happiness made me shed a [tear ;_;](http://imgur.com/0X4WeZ2) 
>> ARTICLE
[The reunion was so satisfying.](http://i.minus.com/iFwnGiyGTs7HK.gif) I shed tears of joy. I'd been waiting for the moment since the beginning of the arc, and it's the happiest situation the show has been in in awhile. I missed Gon and his smile, and then there's Leorio who manages to make everything slightly less depressing. Killua, though. It's been 145 episodes and the poor kid just cannot catch a break.  
>> ARTICLE
Gon is back!!
>> ARTICLE
great episode, wonder why pariston considers Ging an enemy- as far as we know hes a great guy, aside from the whole abandoning his family thing.
>> ARTICLE
Probably more like a friendly rival, someone you want to beat and outsmart just for the fun of it.
>> ARTICLE
Finally I'm up to date on the series. 

It took me just about 3 weeks. So sad that its ending soon. :( 

I love this series.
>> ARTICLE
I just caught up myself.

Sad that I won't be able to share the ride with everyone else.  Might as well enjoy the last 3 episodes...
>> ARTICLE
I wish that I had just found out about the series now. Waiting week after week in the chimera ant was brutal.
>> ARTICLE
I started two weeks ago and found the Chimera and arc brutal because of how little time progressed in each episode - having each episode weekly would be agonising.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you.. started midway through the chimera arc.
>> ARTICLE
"I trust Ging as an enemy", that's just so damn weird an awesome.

Hahaha I just smiled through all this fuckin episode, it was just soo damn good.

Hunter x Hunter is just so unique, you have so many weird characters that you really can't tell if they're "good" or "bad", I mean, just look at fucking Pariston, the guy's a complete rat but even Ging says he's the only one who follows the path of Netero. You can just see how Ging, Pariston and Netero are in a whole different level to characters like Cheadle, who is extremely rational and tries her best to out-smart Pariston and Ging but she just fucking can't.

That Gon revival was pretty cheap, I thought there was gonna be some sort of last-minute complication or something, but I'll take it just because of how horrible Gon's hand looked, damn I didn't know the damage was that... bad.

I can't believe this series is coming to an ending just like that, I don't know if I can't live without my weekly dosis of badassery :( I fucking love this thing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing Killua will be the one now dealing with any complications resulting from the revival. I'm still a bit confused as to how Something's powers work though... Did he dodge having to repay Something's requests somehow?
>> ARTICLE
Killua mentioned in the previous episode that when Something heals as the wish, there are no repercussions and her following 3 wishes remain at the base level. It's the only reason that Illumi let him go when confronted.
>> ARTICLE
From what I understand, Something also has to sleep in order to recuperate from healing. And this healing is so extreme that Something may have to sleep forever. This means Alluka turns into a normal kid from now on.
>> ARTICLE
The only question to this would be if Alluka never wakes up because Something is keeping her asleep.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, this is what I was missing, thankyou.
>> ARTICLE
man, I feel so bad for my boy Killua, this should really have been his moment in the sun to receive all the praise, instead we  get a shot of him nearly destroyed when he sees Gon


>> ARTICLE
I am so happy that he's back, that was so heartwarming.

Can't wait for Gon and Ging to talk to eachother.

Alright I need to know. I really don't want to be disappointed. I knew Gon was going to come back but in the back of my mind I hoped that it wouldn't turn out so happy. Somebody please tell me, I don't actually care about spoilers, can he still use nen?

>inb4 Ging transforms and it was Kite the whole time...

-.- if this is the case, I may just rage.
>> ARTICLE
Why he don't want to tell gon that killua healed him ?
>> ARTICLE
I think it is said in previous episodes that he doesn't want him to know because gon would be absolutely disgusted of how much lifes had to be sacrified for him to be saved... maube it was illumisaying it because he didnt know that alluka heals without an exchange... or maybe i was drunk 
>> ARTICLE
"Friends shouldn't have to feel in dept for helping one another out" is mostly likely Killua's way of thinking.
>> ARTICLE
it's very likely that its tied to "somethings" drawback or killua's effort to contain her power
>> ARTICLE
> Or maybe something terrible happened to him.
>> ARTICLE
Gon isn't someone that would take advantage of Alluka. I think it's because Killua wants an apology from Gon rather than a thanks.
>> ARTICLE
no, what i meant was that i imagine killua doesn't want Gon to realize everything he went through to save him. I remember them saying that a wish that would heal Gon would probably have a cost of about 10,000 lives or something, so i'm under the impression that killua is going to handle it and doesn't want Gon to know what Killua needs to sacrifice for it all.
>> ARTICLE
something only need to sleep after healing someone
>> ARTICLE
Killua also said that Something only has nice requests after healing, like a pat on the head.
>> ARTICLE
lol no
>> ARTICLE

May i ask , if someone knows the name of the song that plays just before the trailer hits in the last 10sec of the episode?
>> ARTICLE
If you're referring to the badass flute song, it's called "The Legend of The Martial Artist".
>> ARTICLE
Yep i was referring to that badass song! Thanks a lot!
>> ARTICLE
I love Pariston's character, he's that type of guy who can't be read, he's like a book written in a foreign language ; you can't tell what's going inside his head or what he's after and he's one of the few characters in HxH with the less monologues which makes it hard to predict what's his next move.
>> ARTICLE
Even though Gon could smile through any situation, and make the show more upbeat and fun, I always feel bad for Killua. He looks like he's going through the most suffering and heart wrenching pain there is. 

Also, I want to add how funny I think it is that Gon is finally going to see Ging. He was on the hunt for him, following clues left behind, then just walks in a auditorium and sees his friends pointing out his dad. Basically like, "Hey you just walked through the door after being healed, but here's your dad sitting next to us, so now your hide and seek game is over.".
>> ARTICLE
This is the only episode of any anime that i actualy clapped at the end of.
>> ARTICLE
Pariston's plan was so simple in the end. There really was not that much to it. Anyone could have done it. Genius.
>> ARTICLE
Pariston is creepy.
>> ARTICLE
Ah man. I hate to think that its all going to end soon. Even if the author is having difficulty doing the drawings for the manga, couldn't he just, like, turn it into a light novel or something so that its easier for him and he still gets the story across. At least that way the anime could go on. I just really want to see Gon fight again, because i'm assuming he might have a power up (as unlikely as that sounds, i'm just following the shounen formula)
>> ARTICLE
I would personally hate it. This thing wouldn't work as a light novel because the anime went after the panels of manga almost shot by shot.

And I personally think Light Novels are a waste of time with wishfulfillment, harem stories taking up around 90% of all light novels. but that's just me.
>> ARTICLE
I like the idea, however, The author may not be that great at describing things in a novel format (locations and such.. we already know hes a great story teller), which may be the reason why he went the manga way. But idk, I'm not the author.
>> ARTICLE
Silly goose following the shounen formula for HxH.

I just hope that the next ep is a movie or something. 

"Ging the journeyer"

A great episode filled with emotions, funny faces (I'm looking at you Ging)  and sad faces (I'm looking at you Killua) and Pariston is such an adorable yet bastard character.

So the whole time Pariston was basically just trolling the other Zodiacs by participating in the election? Like, he just wanted them to be freaking out but he never intended to actually do anything bad?

From what Ging said, Pariston basically just wants to be entertained. In the case of the election, he's trying to make it last as long as possible, which is what makes him unpredictable, from the eye of the other candidates, who are trying to win.

We still don't know. For now however he's all but certain to become the next Chairman.

It has barely begun...

The anime will 'end' at episode 148(?). It's actually not that far behind the manga right now. The next arc was JUST started in the manga so they would run out of material for the anime.

148 is a good 'ending' place.
>> ARTICLE
5 more weeks *sniff*

Does this mean that the anime will stop for good and the next adaptation will begin at episode 1 again or just continue from 148 as soon as more arcs are finished in the manga?

No one knows yet. The anime prolly wont come back until 3+ years so it might be redone.

Leorio for Chairman. Really don't like that Pariston especially his face because the smile is just so wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
As much as I love Leorio I'm not sure he'd be a good idea as Chairman.  We don't know how strong he is but Mizaistom seems to have a level head and I think he'd be the best option.  Probably won't be the case, but just putting in my two cents.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah with this episode I'm pretty sure Leorio's going to get elected. He's been slowly creeping up the rankings to the point that he is now second and there's a lot of opposition to Pariston.
>> ARTICLE
I figured he was going to be elected because of the opening credits sequence.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently I didn't pay enough attention....
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it's not like he's wearing a sash or anything, but when I saw it I thought "He looks like he's (unhappily) in a position of responsibility there..."
>> ARTICLE
if by a lot of opposition, you mean enough votes to put him in first place in the election, then yeah.

I meant that they have been focusing more on hunters opposing Pariston than supporting him, despite his obvious popularity.

I HAVE SPECIAL EYES!
>> ARTICLE
This is fucking terrifying. 
>> ARTICLE
I LOVE when Killua goes into assassin mode.
>> ARTICLE
how was the chimera ant arc that good without hisoka?
>> ARTICLE
Well, it wasn't that good for everyone. 
>> ARTICLE
IMO, I would put Hisoka below Chrollo and maybe Feitan, based on what we saw in the Chimera Ant arc. Based on what the Zoldyck elders said about Chrollo, I would assume that he is stronger than both of them. So I would say Zeno and Silva are stronger than Hisoka too. Although Hisoka is tactical fighter, I'm sure the best of the assassins are a notch better though.
>> ARTICLE
As the strongest characters on this show always say, strength isn't everything. Hisoka is a magician! A master of misdirection! In a fight between Hisoka and someone who's only moderately stronger, I'd bet on everyone's favorite murderous pedophile.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah idk, also powers might counter others. Why would Hisoka be constantly trying to fight Chrollo if he'd just get slaughtered? 
>> ARTICLE
Just imagine if it had Hisoka *and* Illumi -shudders-
>> ARTICLE
It wouldn't make sense to put Hisoka in that arc and have him survive, he would be either dead or turned into a chimera much like Pearl.

So i'm personally glad he was too busy with the whole chrollo thing.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I wish Hisoka was there just so that I can see his reaction when he sees king Meruem. It could go both ways: on one hand, we will see Hisoka filled with more ecstasy than we've ever seen, or we will, for once ever, see an absolutely terrified Hisoka. His internal skill radar would probably self-destruct.
>> ARTICLE
holy shit how did this never occur to me... im dying to know now
>> ARTICLE
I honestly wonder where Hisoka stands, he is obviously REALLY strong, but how strong is he compared to the Chimera Ants, Royal Guards, Chairman Netero, and Meruem?
>> ARTICLE
lmao no the Chimera ant royal guard were already OP to any of the characters introduced until Gon had a nen explosion. Meruem was barely phased by Neteros attacks and was clearly leagues above any character in the show pre-nuke, then literally became a demigod post nuke.
>> ARTICLE
Idk i think Morel would have standed his own against shaiapouf if he wasnt so exhausted. I think he said something about him wasting around 70% of his aura before they fought.

Someone should double check this though
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it. Morel, Killua, and Knuckles triple teamed Youpi and lasted for what seemed to be less than a minute before being beaten. None of the guards got more than scratched until Gon went insane.

Edit: Killua not Kurapika...
>> ARTICLE
First off i still think he was exhausted which could've played a big part. but when the fuck was kuraprika involved?
>> ARTICLE
Shit, I meant Killua, I'll fix that. Also you are right, he did say he only felt about 30%, but I the fact that the 3 of them together still weren't even close to being enough I can't imagine that he could have beaten a guard by himself even at 100%.
>> ARTICLE
Well I don't think the other two were close to in terms of strength with morel. But Killua wasn't in the fight that long either (he left after he saved knuckled can be wrong on this) and didnt morel lose his pipe so he couldn't produce more smoke. The fight seemed so loong ago >.< I wouldn't really say that was a 3 on 1. More like 1.2 on 1. Knuckles was nowhere close to beating him I think (maybe if he let morel die though he could have?)
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Meruem is leagues above anything we've seen simply because he transcended individuality, he was simply born unfair. His ability literally absorbed the nen auras of people he ate, and as stated, he was born to shoulder the entire chimera ant race, something that no individual human can compete with.

What is with Illumi's crazy obbsesion with Killua? You can tell that he cares about him but it's just fucked up.

well silva has white hair to, he isnt that old, killua has white hair as well, hes only 12, GREY HAIR is something you probably mean then 

to further support this, they are all transmutters, the black hair ones are manipulators

and Bald ones are enhancers then? XD

He wasn't shown in the anime I think.

He's got a huge little brother complex.

It isn't safe to consider hisoka and pariston on your side. They just side for whatever is more exciting. 
>> ARTICLE
this episode made me wonder whether Hisoka is stronger than Illumi. That would be an awesome battle.
>> ARTICLE
He is. During the hunter exam arc, it's mentioned by both of them during a conversation. Something like illumi is a few points lower than hisoka or how hisoka is the only one who *kill illumi, something like that.
>> ARTICLE
He says Illumi is 90~95 points if I remember correctly, assuming 100% = Hisoka, he's slightly weaker, but, again, Illumi is an experienced assassin from birth (not that Hisoka isn't, but he's more) and if you recall Biscuit relation with power an class C, B hunter can win against an A one depending on the powers and the state of said hunter, so it's perfectly plausible to a *weaker* hunter win against a stronger one like we saw a couple of times during the series.
>> ARTICLE
I HOPE THEY FIGHT PLS TOGASHI 
>> ARTICLE
Pariston's evil face caught me off guard.
>> ARTICLE
Pariston is one of the most interesting characters that I have come across in anime or manga, due solely to his characterization.  He seems villainous, but that is only due to every other character calling him evil, or sleezy or what have you, as well as some sinister looking facial expressions.  If you just read the things he had actually said, he seems like some goody-goody that legitimately wants what's best for the Hunters Association. It is only due to the opinions of other character that he seems like a bad guy.
>> ARTICLE
Just looking at him makes me think hes bad, or at least not showing his true colors. He's always very happy with a huge grin on his face. He's always dressed perfectly and never says anything negative. These all absolute, which makes his entire facade look like total BS.

We only know negative things about him because of our perspective on the situation, all the characters like him because they never see the bad, and the ones that do get a funny feeling only have their gut feeling and some unclear evidence against him (the number of disappeared hunters since he assumed his position).
>> ARTICLE
Didn't the Zodiacs say he'd been taking kickbacks for years or something?
>> ARTICLE
No, no you misunderstand. Those are pooled funds to help the Hunters association!
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, every good thing Pariston says comes across as disingenuous.  He's willing to switch sides on any issue and seems to hold no strong convictions one way or another.  He's basically your stereotypical politician who will do or say anything to sound good.  As such, no one knows what his motives are which makes him very dangerous. 
>> ARTICLE
> ~~very dangerous.~~

Fantastic. He's such a interesting character. Ging and Pariston play really well off of each other too.

I think The Hunter Association really need to stop sending cannon fodder at class A enemies, even if it reduces voters needed for the election.
>> ARTICLE
Well technically they sent the leader of the Seirin group which was an up and coming competitor for chairman... and he got offscreen'd. I like to think that it's not that they're weak, it's that Hisoka is ridiculously strong.
>> ARTICLE
like hisoka said, it's unlikely that any non-zodiac would give him any sort of challenge. Gon-san excluded. 
>> ARTICLE
ging? some of the three-star hunters? chrollo?
>> ARTICLE
Ging and all the named 3 star hunters are zodiacs. Chrollo isn't a hunter,, but sure , he definitely would. I forgot to mention that I was only referring to hunters. Chimera ants not included.
>> ARTICLE
I had thought that Chrollo mentioned that he was a skill hunter. I believe it was right after he fought Silva and Zeno. Or do you mean a licensed hunter?
>> ARTICLE
licensed, yes. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I missread zodiac as zoldyck. Speaking of which I'm sure that Zeno and Silva would be a match for hisoka too.

>> ARTICLE
This makes me depressed, fuck.
>> ARTICLE
The Chimera Ant arc took eight years for Togashi to write. The current manga arc is probably going to be closer to CA length as opposed to closer to the length of any of the other arcs, so if Togashi continues his infamous hiatuses we could be in trouble. (He is on a 2 week hiatus right now due to back problems, but we were actually told a reason so this time its completely acceptable). I think people are being VERY optimistic with 3 year predictions. I could see the manga arc being done in 5 years if Togashi gets his act together, and we could see an anime (who knows if it would be a reboot or continuation at that point?) around 6 years from now. I'm not saying 3 years is impossible, but given Togashi's history of taking extended hiatuses its exceedingly unlikely. 
>> ARTICLE
Can't he just hire more people to help him speed things up?
>> ARTICLE
He absolutely could, but he doesn't. I'm unsure about his reasons, though, haven't looked that far into it.
>> ARTICLE
He is one strange man.
>> ARTICLE
But it's *so* sad!
>> ARTICLE
Was I the only one who thought Hisoka had gone to the hospital at first to earn Killua's rage... another way? I was about to flip.
>> ARTICLE
In his own weird way, Hisoka cares about Gon.  If there's a risk free way to heal him, he's all for it.  He could easily pick a fight with Killua another day.
>> ARTICLE
thats what I found weird about this episode I thought that Hisoka would be all in for gon getting healed

In this episode he contemplated on killing alluka, which would more than liekly mean that gon would perish

I understand he is a fighting addict, he also said it himself that he couldn't wait for gon's full potential (or at least implied it) 
>> ARTICLE
He wants Gon to grow up so that he could kill him in a fair fight.  That's what I am getting from Hisoka.
>> ARTICLE
It's not that he wants it to be a fair fight, but he wants him strong enough to be a challenge to kill.
>> ARTICLE
I agree.  I would even go further and say killing is optional.  I don't think Hisoka minds dying.  He just wants an interesting fight where he feels heavily challenged.
>> ARTICLE
Wonder what rating super-rage-flip the shit modes rating is.
>> ARTICLE
True, however he was about to let Gon die in exchange for a chance at fighting an enraged Killua then an enraged Illumi.
>> ARTICLE
At that point, Hisoka assumed it was too dangerous to let Alluka heal Gon so that was already out of the question.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, I wouldn't completely say that considering he was subtly messing up Illumi in hopes that Gon might be healed. For example, he was going to mess up the map.
>> ARTICLE
He only cares about him because he wants the fruit to ripen for his feast.

First anime I've watched subbed. This is a brilliant show
>> ARTICLE
Mine too... now I would never watched the dubbed again... Best anime I've ever watched. 
>> ARTICLE
I understand loving the show but I don't see how sub vs dub comes into play at all here. Unless there's an HxH dub that I don't know about...
>> ARTICLE
Actually, there is. The 1999 version was dubbed and that's where I started watching. And then went to the subbed where it suddenly stopped right before the zoldyck vs spiders fight. The subbed was FAR better IMO.
>> ARTICLE
Same for me, but that doesn't say much because it's pretty much the only anime I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, well I've seen a lot, but HxH just suites my personality very well... Super involved puzzles, very great attention to detail, a great power system that actually makes some sense when you get into it, no fan catering, excellent character development, very descriptive plots and fights that are won by complex strategies instead of fight, fight fight fight, get hurt, fight more, win. 

I just love it all. 

It almost ruins other animes for me in a lot of ways, particularly ones in the same genre. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this has ruined other anime. I've tried to get into that One Piece but I can't really get into it. 
>> ARTICLE
After Hunter x Hunter, one piece's pace is unbearable, imo.

>> ARTICLE
Oh man right now its so bad.

I just wish they would stop and let the manga continue for a bit..
>> ARTICLE
Yeah and I feel the plot quality has gone down quite a bit since the buildup to Whitebeard.
>> ARTICLE
oda's problem is his lack of willingness to kill off characters when it needs to happen. blackbeard and akainu should be dead. WB absolute demolished them. the plot bias is too prevalent due to him having established a very linear storyline with predetermined villians, heroes, fight patterns etc...  


his devolution in the character development catagory is a bit depressing, with none of the crew retaining any of their original depth. though that's mostly my sanji fanboyism showing. 


the slapstick has gotten... out of hand. With basically every character other than zoro nami and robin devoted to it. (nami and robin of course too busy supplying the boobage.)


honestly, I blame his writing schedule. as fucked as it is being a hunter hunter fan in terms of chapter gaps, at least we are basically guaranteed quality progression all the time. 
>> ARTICLE
That's why I only read the One Piece manga, and tune in for the things I would like to see animated, primarily the fight scenes.  
>> ARTICLE
Another great episode, really looking forward to how this arc wraps up.
Honestly I know I should hate the guy but this episode really made me warm up to Illumi. He is perfectly fine with his death, as long as it means that the rest of the family lives (even with the spiteful comment of how Killua would be forced to be with him forever). The only reason he is acting this way is because of the value he puts on his family, and Alluka is not considered part of the family. Granted he's still a sonofabitch but his resolve towards protecting his family is impressive for me
>> ARTICLE
It's more that he wants Killua to carry on the family than protecting the family. Killua is the heir but he doesn't want it. He wants to be a normal boy. Therefore in Illumi's mind, letting Killua kill him and become a colder person and by corrupting his mind with the thought that he killed family would bring him back to the assassin Killua that the family wants him to be. This is further shown when you consider how proud Killua's mother was when he threatened her. The majority of the family wants Killua to become a cold blooded killer, the perfect assassin.
>> ARTICLE
That ending shot with the picture frame hits me pretty hard now that we're so close to the end.
>> ARTICLE
I think Hisoka figured out how to get the Zodiacs to fight him...
>> ARTICLE
This episode was really confusing for me, can someone help? What deal did Illumi make with Killua and why did Illumi accept his own death? Did Tsubone help Killua because Illumi was using her as a spy? Even so, doesn't she have to take Killua home because he ran away from her? Why did Hisoka run away after Killua decided to heal Tsubone's hand? And if healing doesn't raise the difficulty of the next wish, then why didn't Killua say so from the get-go? Was Killua able to make the wish from Something because Tsubone gave him permission to?
>> ARTICLE
Illumi's deal was that he'll let Killua use Nanika to kill him, if in exchange, Killua lets some random take the requests after healing Gon. Illumi's worry is that after Gon is healed, Killua will attempt the impossible requests from Nanika, fail, then pay the price for failing which, considering the level of the wish, would result in the deaths of the whole Zoldyck family and a bunch of other people. 

Tsubone did indeed offer to hold back Illumi for accidentally being a spy. Killua running away wasn't against the rules so, no, she didn't have to take him home. He only had to stay close to Alluka and not tell his friends anything.

Hisoka left because Killua wasn't going to try to kill Illumi. The situation became one that was better than "kill Alluka, earn Killua's wrath, kill Killua, earn Illumi's wrath" because Gon could still be saved. He wants to save Gon and Killua for when they're stronger so the best situation is where they both survive.

Killua kept that a secret because the more his family knows about Alluka's powers, the easier time they'll have abusing it. Killua doesn't want that. As for your last question, that'll be revealed later.
>> ARTICLE
Ah so Killua wants to save Gon and also reset the difficulty level afterwards, didn't remember that.

 Mind telling me in what ep he explained that so i can do a little recap? 
>> ARTICLE
Well what Killua himself was thinking wasn't shown, but Illumi explained things from his perspective back when he recruited Hisoka. Based on Killua's personality, Illumi knew there was no way Killua would let someone else pay the price for healing Gon, so Illumi's goal was to try and stop that from happening. Of course, since Killua revealed in this episode that the requests after fixing/healing are never difficult or cruel, Illumi's worries were unnecessary.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes i remember that part. Thanks for clearing things up for me mate
>> ARTICLE
No prob. The rules surrounding Alluka's power can get confusing and having to wait a week between each episode probably doesn't help.
>> ARTICLE
Illumi loves Killua and wants to make him into the perfect cold-hearted assassin, regardless of whether Killua wants it or not.  If getting Killua to kill him with a wish would do that, Illumi is more than willing to die.

Tsubone was always on Killua's side, but she has to follow his parents orders to take them home if Alluka's powers are revealed to outsiders.  She probably did get more involved by fulfilling Alluka's requests to get back at Illumi for being made a spy.

I think Hisoka left because he realized that Alluka could really heal Gon without putting his own life at risk.  The main reason he went along with Illumi's plan was that they were worried that they would both die when Killua couldn't meet one of Alluka's requests after healing Gon.  But since the request after a healing are really easy, there's no risk to him now--they can go heal Gon and he can pick a fight with them later.

Killua probably didn't want to tell them about the healing thing because the family might start exploiting her as a result.

If they end the show at chapter 339 then I think everyone will be satisfied and can stand to wait and see if more is to come later. If they end it at chapter 340 then they are scum of the earth for making people wait and see if more is to come later.
>> ARTICLE
Form what I've gathered regarding the end of the anime, I think episode 147 is going to be chapter 339.  Then 148 is going to be some sort of tie up episode that can qualify as an ending if they need it to, but leave it open enough to where in the future they can come back and finish the anime if they desire.
>> ARTICLE
But chapter 339 would honestly only last about 3 minutes in anime form and 340 is not very long either so i seriously doubt they would do that.
>> ARTICLE
Well, episode 147 might include multiple chapters, or they could have the wrap up with chapter 139 and other stuff too.

I see no reason for them to *not* make more, it's just a question of how long the manga will take to catch up.

Ok somebody spoil it for me...  What is the "last rule" of Alluka's power?
>> ARTICLE
You sure? It's pretty big. 

[Well, if you want to be spoiled. The last rule is](/s "that you can order 'Something' to do something, and if she obeys there's no consequences. Since you can't ask for payment when following an order. I think this only works with Killua due to his loving relationship with Alluka. Thus why Killua thinks his family would want to control him with needles if they knew.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that's a huge spoiler, seeing as it's already been either partially mentioned or hinted at several times in the arc. It makes a huge difference either way though.
>> ARTICLE
It's kinda hinted twice during this episode and during the episode that showcases the rules. Also before or during the start of the 'inner mission' killua explains that is a rule(s) that the family doesn't know.

There's another episode coming but knowing that's it already has me feeling sad.  parting is such sweet sorrow. 
>> ARTICLE
What an amazing episode.

1) They brought back my favorite Chimera Ant (idk why, I just loved seeing a pink koala in a suit). 

2) This episode felt like the first couple of seasons. I'm amazed this anime was able to recapture a tone that it first started out with. So now, towards the end of the series, I feel the satisfaction of an adventure that has come to a strong ending.

P.s. I took a class on the classical archetypes of heroes and their journeys, and the important thing about a hero's journey is that they end up where they began as a new person. This show did that for me with Gon. He finally found his dad and will meet him in a tree, which is where we first saw Gon in the first episode (of course its not the same tree). Hopefully this correlates with how you guys are feeling even though there is still one more episode.
>> ARTICLE
Sure doesn't seem to me like Gon is much of a new person at all.

The same situation for Killua. He's on the run from his family but now he's not doing it for rebellion but for his and his sisters' happiness

Everyone is talking about the heartwrenching ending (and I teared up, I admit it) but I also thought that the monologue by the Koala was really kind of beautiful in the beginning.  I thought the conversation between him and Kite was really great.

that monologue was seriously deep. Made me think a lot. I LOVE THIS ANIME

I think a lot of people are hating on it because of the repeating scenes. I think they did repeat them a lot, but maybe it was because of all the cycles the Koala was talking about.

Togashi, hire a fucking assistant so we can get the anime back

Please <3
>> ARTICLE
I said this before, but I'm taking it back after seeing how good the art in the current arc is. 
>> ARTICLE
It took Togashi 8 years to write the Chimera Ant Arc, and the current manga arc has the potential to match the CA arc in length if not surpass it. I'm not sure how much assistants would help to be honest. Obviously it is better than Togashi not having assistants, but he works at his own pace regardless, if he doesn't feel like writing a chapter for whatever reason, or is too sick, assistants can't do much. Even with assistants (which we have no reason to expect he will ever get, seeing as how he has gone this long without them) it will easily be half a decade before we see HxH animated again. 
>> ARTICLE
That's a good one, HA!
>> ARTICLE
All acclaimed manga artists like Togashi have assistants. That doesn't mean they can draw the whole thing for him. It wouldn't be his work anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the rumor says so though. And it is taken as a fact by the fans.  
I always believed it actually. But when I tried to find a source for it, I found none.
>> ARTICLE
I believe it. In one chapter of the manga, instead of drawing a background, a picture of some tree's were just pasted in. Why not just have the assistants draw the background if he has them? And when the art gets really shitty, the background art is just as shitty, or non existent.

He's probably insufferable to work with. Naoko Takeuchi (of Sailormoon fame), before they got married, helped him out with volume 1 of HxH, but quit shortly thereafter.

From wikipedia:

> In her short comic strip Princess Naoko Takeuchi Back-to-Work Punch!!, Takeuchi met Yoshihiro Togashi at a Weekly Shnen Jump meeting hosted by Kazushi Hagiwara, and had a meeting arranged between them by voice actress Megumi Ogata.[8][9] She collaborated with Togashi as an assistant (doing screentone) and as a manager on volume 1 of Hunter  Hunter. However the work and the demands proved more than she had expected, and Takeuchi left Shueisha as a result.

> Are there other shounens as good and mature as HxH that haven't been adapted to anime yet?

I don't keep up with current shounen manga but an anime that is out which HxH fans may like is:

[Katanagatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6594/Katanagatari) - Great fight scenes and indepth dialouge during fights that make you think and sympathize with the antogonists. Also, there is that air of adventure. That said it isn't as indepth as HXH mainly do to episode restriction but does one hell of a job in the character and story development for 12 50min episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
I hate the female character, they spend too much time talking and the action scenes are a bit underwhelming. For something over 40 minutes I'd expect more action. I dropped that actually
>> ARTICLE
>they spend too much time talking and the action scenes are a bit underwhelming

You're not seeing the show for what it is, almost every piece of dialog had significance in developing a character or advancing the plot. The action was only supplemental to the plot, and the plot itself was only a tool used for developing the characters.

It's fine if you criticize it while understanding what kind of show it's meant to be but it's not an action show and shouldn't be viewed as such.
>> ARTICLE
I did not care for the characters nor did I care for the dialogue to develop said characters. The combat was fun but very short and the female character ruined everything for me. That's why I dropped the show, it's not a show for me.
>> ARTICLE
Woah, what episode did you get to? I found the action to talking ratio extremely similar to the HXH (which lead me to the recommendation here). The female lead undergoes some great character development and the ending was heart wrenching yet satisfying. It's one of the few recent action animes that I can call a masterpiece. 
>> ARTICLE
It was formulaic and unexciting. There is no way you can deny this. From the very first episode to the last. HxH and Katanagatari should not be in the same sentence.
>> ARTICLE
6 or 5 I think? I really did not like that female character. The actual action was short, but I didn't drop it because of the action
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I'll chalk it up to "different folks, different strokes" but you are complaining about lack of action yet you are a HXH fan... I don't get it. 


>> ARTICLE
HxH actually has good characters and strategy and good world building, it's very intriguing and fun, whereas katanagatari, to me, personally, didn't.
>> ARTICLE
You hit the nail on the head. 
>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari looks so good but I can't find it in decent quality :(

Also, I would probably commit seppuku before I ordered it off Amazon. My parents don't know I like homo Chinese cartoons yet.
>> ARTICLE
Fights are good but don't watch the show expect lots of it, fights are a minor part of all the episodes actually. It's more dialogue and story. 
>> ARTICLE
I second this. It's not that great at first, but bear with it because over time it gets to be amazing. I loved the ending. And the soundtrack is pretty...unique.
>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari is written by the same author as the Monogatari series. Expect a lot of dialog and character development for just about every character that has a name. It's really good.
>> ARTICLE
> Katanagatari is written by the same author as the Monogatari series and it's animated by Shaft.


katanagatari is animated by white fox.

Whoops, my bad

Like i said last week, don't hold your breath. We all can hope, but the real truth is Hiatus x Hiatus will take forever to continue on a consistent basis. Of course That's if Togashi comes back from his hiatus anytime soon, and knowing Togashi, it's highly unlikely.
>> ARTICLE
You're starting to sound like a broken record, jumping on the top comment.
>> ARTICLE
This is my favorite anime ever, I don't know how 100+ episodes it still kept me hooked throughout each and every arc throughout each and every episode. I've never seen an anime quite like this before. Just one more episode and it's going to end until god knows when. I'm really going to miss this show.
>> ARTICLE
Killua get Alluka to heal Togashi!!
>> ARTICLE
Feels x Feels man, even having read the manga I can't deal with this. The bromance shall forever live on <3
>> ARTICLE
Did I miss something? Why's kite alot older than before? Gon couldn't have been out that long.
>> ARTICLE
Kite is a Chimera Ant, despite her very human appearance. Chimera Ants have very, very rapid development. 
>> ARTICLE
Well I knew about the Chimera Ant thing but it just seemed weird because no other ants aged, unless it's just Kite, that's what confused me.
>> ARTICLE
Her being born prematurely most likely has something to do with it.
>> ARTICLE
The other ants developed in their eggs before emerging matured. Kite was pulled from the Queen's womb as she was dying, and so Kite didn't get the opportunity to develop in an egg. If you think about the first and second time we see Kite, it's from an extremely tiny underdeveloped fetus to a toddler able to speak words, and between these two appearances only weeks have passed. Considering this rapid aging, it makes sense Kite would have reached her current state since another couple of weeks have passed.

Since she inherited the body from a pre-teen girl, I'm wondering if this is as matured as Kite's current body will get. This new Kite has a tail that she seems to be hiding in her clothing, but other than that she didn't seem to get very many animal traits or features.
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit. SO Kite is the fetus? OMG can't believe I didn't realize this until now. 
>> ARTICLE
Now it all makes sense! Thanks for that, I can be kinda dumb at times xD
>> ARTICLE
I'm wondering if him surviving in that girl's body has anything to do with what Ging mentioned about Kite having a secret or backup weapon slot that he would only use if he wanted to live.
>> ARTICLE
the wand #3 hasn't really been explained, BUT he didn't say "bad roll" when it came out like he did for the scythe and rifle. Maybe he said that because he knew he wasn't going to kill in that fight?
>> ARTICLE
Wat is life
>> ARTICLE
I marathoned HxH around 5 weeks ago, and I'm so sad to see it go.

My only wish is that I had started it back in 2011 to follow it up til now.
>> ARTICLE
Nor sure I'd you know, but the original started in 1999 ;p

The reboot in 2011 is basically the exact same as the original except with slightly better animation...the stopped before the chimera arc (ended with gon meeting Kite).

Original was an amazing show but the reboot covered everything in less episodes.

Hajime no ippo  and YuYu Hakusho (same writer) are very good alternatives if you're looking for other stuff to watch. YYH and HxH are easily in my top 5 FWIW.
>> ARTICLE
Would it be acceptable to pick up the manga where the show is ending? Or would I have to pick it up from the beginning?
>> ARTICLE
In all honesty, don't read the rest of the manga. It's on hiatus again for the next ??? months and it's not slated to come back any time soon. You'll just be leading yourself into disappointment when a gigantic storyline is barely introduced and doesn't go anywhere.
>> ARTICLE
The anime adaptation is very close to being 1:1. You can pick up where we leave off, but there's not much to read. You'll be sitting in the hiatus boat with the rest of us soon enough.
>> ARTICLE
it would be acceptable, but there are only like 8 more manga chapters and is on hiatus again.
>> ARTICLE
Damn this episode went by fast. 
>> ARTICLE
holy shit. The instant they started playing REASON the wave of feels engulfed me.

Such a good song. And them bring it back. HxH AOTC
>> ARTICLE
that ending made me shed a tear and feel all the emotions i felt watching this show in 30 seconds. That ending was very well done
>> ARTICLE
Kite 2.0 is really intimidating. His/her eyes remind me of Pitou. Even in the second to last episode we're still getting interesting character turns. It's a shame there's only one left.
>> ARTICLE
I watched from 1-147 in two weeks time the past couple weeks and I can say... however much we get will never be enough. I have not watched that much anime in years in such a short time, but I enjoyed every bit of it. I think this stopping point works well, but at the same time there are so many things left to explore and honestly this episode Gon and Killua splitting up is heartbreaking. I love them together, hell I love every one of the characters.  

Can't recommend this series enough to my buddies who have given up on most shounen. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn I can't believe this show is going to be done.. ;_;

I just don't know what to do anymore..
>> ARTICLE
Wait so the only reason Killua didn't want Leorio to tell Gon . . . was so that he could tell Gon? Killua pls
>> ARTICLE
Killua was still under the restriction of telling anyone about Alluka at that point.  It wasn't until after Alluka healed Gon that Kikyo rescinded her words.
>> ARTICLE
Well Killua had decided that he wanted to confront Gon and make him apologize seriously earlier on back in the CA arc, so it wasn't that surprising.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was just expecting it to be because of some as-of-yet unrevealed rule about the consequences of Alluka's power. The way it stands, Killua+Alluka is nigh omnipotent. 
>> ARTICLE
Is this the first episode to have a different ending compared to its arc? I feel like this may have happened once or twice before but I can't seem to remember any times.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 135 had a different ending I believe.

>> ARTICLE
Oh yea good call. So recent too, dunno why I forgot.
>> ARTICLE
That ending made me bawl. Killuaa... :'( 
I don't want this show to end.
>> ARTICLE
The Koala's monologue was one of my favorite chapters of manga that I've read, and (unsurprisingly) this episode brought it to life absolutely beautifully.
>> ARTICLE
Cried so hard at the end. Gonna miss this show, but thankfully the manga is still around.
>> ARTICLE
not exactly
>> ARTICLE
I don't want it to end ;_;
>> ARTICLE
I'm so sad right now.
>> ARTICLE
I am not ready for this to be over
>> ARTICLE
Guys why did Gon and Killua parted with such a sad face?
>> ARTICLE
I'm so sad that it's ending next week.  What a journey it's been.. That little montage at the end was like, totally uncalled for.  
>> ARTICLE
You are light. Sometimes, you shine so brightly I must look away. But even so, is it still okay if I stay by your side? - KIL

If we stay here any longer -GON

Mm, yeah. I know... -KIL

Kite said that no matter where we go, we'll always be friends -GON

It's beautiful! It's sad but at the same time fulfilling. It's like you're crying but at the same time you're happy.

>> ARTICLE
So I mostly enjoyed the way things ended this episode.  Very bittersweet.  I don't understand why Gon didn't say he'd do things differently when apologizing to Killua though.  When Ging told him the rule of apologizing for Kite, I felt like that was really about apologizing to Killua.  Seemed like he should have.  They really downplayed it considering how much shit Killua had to go through.

I actually have a couple more complaints too (very rare for HxH). I don't really like how Kite is basically still alive.  That seemed like a weird cop-out for me. I realize the narrative explains it well (some ants recall their past, human life), but I still don't like it.  Also why does he (she? I never know with HxH) look like a normal human? 

Also I would have much preferred the series end with Gon and Killua.  To me, their friendship is Hunter X Hunter.  It's easily one of the strongest friendships I've seen in anime.  In comparison I care much less about Gon's relationship (or lack thereof) with Ging.  I know it's the reason he started his journey, but to me the journey was the important part, not the end.

I realize it probably has to be this way due to the ongoing nature of the manga, but as an anime, I just think Killua deserved to be the finale, not Ging.
>> ARTICLE
I like how Kite is basically still alive, I hated how he died right after being introduced, that felt more like a cop out to me. We barely got to know him or his abilities and then bam, gone.   I'm glad he/she is sticking around.
>> ARTICLE
He was introduced right at the very beginning in the manga/1999 version. The 2011 just decided to be stupid for some reason and introduce him way later.
>> ARTICLE
I see, interesting. None the less, I would have been dissapointed had he been killed off. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he barely had any screen time after all.
>> ARTICLE
I'm more troubled by how Gon committed such an act of brutality in killing Neferpito, but doesn't seem to care, as if being angry over Kite is a perfectly justifiable excuse for absolutely mauling someone to death. He just sat there, pouring his fists into her skull over and over. Killua's killed a lot of people, but he was always doing it just to kill them, not to take out his anger on them. If he never shows any remorse over becoming a monster in both form and temperament, I'll be disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, Pitou was *also* a monster in both form and temperment. Worse, even.
>> ARTICLE
No, if she was a real monster she would've attacked Gon as soon as she was through healing Komugi, or tried to use a trick against him, but instead she kept to her word as well as she could. Sure, she was ruthless for quite a while as all the ants were, but how she acted at the end was what Gon would've seen and judged her on if he wasn't completely blinded by revenge, similar to how Netero could've considered negotiating with the King if he was more thoughtful himself.
>> ARTICLE
Kite has a tail, that we can see during her toddler stage.

And the anime is about Gon's journey. Everything that we see in the anime was because Gon wanted to find Ging. Killua only tagged along because he didn't have a goal, but now he does. Gon started alone, and now he's ending it alone. Because finding Ging was no one's business but his own (and Ging won't meet him if he brought someone along anyways).
>> ARTICLE
How is any conflict going to progress with Nanika existing? I mean, if she was with Killua during the Chimera Ant arc she could have just ended in the blink of an eye. I honestly don't see any way unless she's killed. 
>> ARTICLE
well wouldn't killua avoid using Nanika because that is what his character demands and i think that we won't be seeing killua in a long ass time in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Killua would lets say let any of his friends die just to not "use" Nanika
>> ARTICLE
Lets just say Togashi is a master storyteller and there will be more conflicts then ever before.
>> ARTICLE
Damn it Togashi! Please get back to working on the manga!
>> ARTICLE
Quickly! We must get to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and be on our way to the fast-track of becoming Manga Artists. Then fly over to Togashi and get him to make us his assistants so we can finish the HxH manga.


>> ARTICLE
Except Togashi doesn't use or want to use assistants :X
>> ARTICLE
Or we can just leave Togashi inside the time chamber, and open it every few days to get our new chapters.
>> ARTICLE
Almost cried at the end holy shit...

[Spoiler](/s "Kite was the underdeveloped baby that was born from the Queen, so Kite is basically a Chimera-Ant now and Meruem's sister in a weird way. As to how he got reborn through the queen isn't known yet in the anime, Ging hinted towards a special dice roll of Kite's special nen ability which lets him survive and it is also possible that his brain was fed to the queen by Pitou given that he would be a highly nutritious and rare Nen user to the ant queen.")

>I thought four years would be ok

There are no time limits on spoilers. Even if your spoiler was about an anime from the 1980s it would still need to be tagged or the mods would remove it.

Four?  This episode was last year.  But you tagged it so whatevs.

A spoiler is a spoiler regardless of show age.
>> ARTICLE
Of course just playing devils advocate. Just saying that the popularity of certain shows have spoilers that people outside their audience know about. Typically with older/ more popular shows. Obviously something auch as hunter x Hunter has a much smaller audience that makes spoilers more sacred. 
>> ARTICLE
Mostly chiming in to give the opinion of the mods on the matter.

I see what you're saying, and if anime was western tv or movie then it would be different.

As it currently stands, anime is a medium that people are continuously getting into. These people then often go and watch the shows that are highly recommended - NGE is the biggest example (and the one people most commonly try to defend their spoiling of). It's also important to note the sheer amount of 'old' or 'classic' shows that come highly recommended and need to be defended by the spoiler rules.

I've been on this sub for a long time, still haven't seen NGE and have managed not to be spoiled for it. I think it's very important that other people be given the same protection.

Basically, a show may be old, but it's not old for someone who hasn't seen it yet and plans to.

I know absolutely nothing about money or economy, so I wonder what could have caused that... or what it even means for someone visiting Japan. 
>> ARTICLE
I believe the other nations agreed to let Japan de value the yen to help out japans economy. If you are visiting in Japan it basically means stuff is cheaper for you which is a good thing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it's less about Japan's economy, and more about America's economy.

We're steadily recovering from the recession (or maybe we're already out of it?) and doing pretty well again.
>> ARTICLE
I regularly buy merchandise from Japan, and often the prices are shown online in yen. It's been kind of fun watching the conversions gradually go more and more in my favor over the last couple years.
>> ARTICLE
What I don't know is if it's because Japan's economy has gotten weaker, USA's economy has gotten stronger, or both.

What I *can* tell you is that it's a hell of a lot easier to be a caffeine addict in Japan than it is in the USA.

>What I can tell you is that it's a hell of a lot easier to be a caffeine addict in Japan than it is in the USA.

I find it pretty damn easy in the USA, so I'd be in a load of trouble in Japan...

Here I have to go to a convenience store to spend >$3 to get an energy drink that *doesn't* taste like men's deodorant, for enough caffeine to get me through 1/2 to 1 day, depending on the amount of sleep I was able to get the night before. 

In Japan, you can go to any vending machine (which are everywhere btw) and get a kickass can of coffee for 80 to 130.

or you buy caffeine pills and take one after drinking a nice cup of decaf and ur good.

IS it? I don't see how. It's likely one of those things where, unless you specifically know that it's a spoiler, it won't mean anything to you. So pointing out that it's a spoiler does more bad than good.
>> ARTICLE
How long do things need to has a spoiler on them? Forever? I feel like everyone knows [](/s "Snape killes dumbledor") This series is over so everyone has had a chance to watch/finish it. Not saying it shouldn't have spoilers for it but how long does something need to be finished before we can no longer worry a bout spoilers?
>> ARTICLE
I can confirm. I've been meaning to watch HxH for a while now, and only have a vague idea of the overall plot.  
This figure means nothing to me, just some guy with impossibly long stuck up hair. Although I am intrigued by the context of this figure now.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the middle of the Chimera Ant arc and I still don't understand this figure at all, honestly. 
>> ARTICLE
You will come to understand it soon. It's going to be magnificent.

Which episode are you on?
>> ARTICLE
IMO, that ark was painfully boring at times to watch.
>> ARTICLE
IMO your *face* is painful to watch

Nah, it's just a pretty significant change in pacing. They must have realized they were catching up to the manga at this point because the series drops from its "something major happens every episode" speed and falls back into classic shonen pace instead. I really like the arc despite that, though, it's right up there with the Phantom Troupe arc as a really interesting genre shift and successful use of darker themes. I thought Greed Island was pretty boring personally so this arc was entirely welcome.
>> ARTICLE
You're in for a fun ride my friend.
>> ARTICLE
I was also fairly interested in it, but isn't it pretty long? I haven't seen any anime over 100 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
After seeing a lot of "infinite" animes myself, Hunter X Hunter is the only one where I felt every episode is justified. Yes, there are slower moments, but they still progressed the plot or the character.
>> ARTICLE
You're missing out on some good anime if you're unwilling to go over 100 episodes
>> ARTICLE
Am I really? I've looked at a few long-term series' and other than Hunter X Hunter none of them really interested me.
>> ARTICLE
Well you know how synopsis can be for shows. I almost didn't watch HunterxHunter because of it. But honestly, it's preference. If you've looks into them and have found none then so be it. Personally, I would have missed out on a lot. As long as it is based on not being interested and not solely the episode count than you'll be fine 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say solely on episode count but that's definitely a factor. I don't always have the time or dedication to watch 100+ episode shows. There are some shows that I might have given a shot if they were shorter, but nothing has really seemed worth 100+ episodes of my time. I've gotten a lot of replies saying excellent things about Hunter x Hunter so I'll probably give it a try now that it's summer and I have more free time
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense. The way I see it is that I've definitely watched multiple 26 or 13 episode shows I would have gladly traded in for a much longer one I would have enjoyed. And hey nobody says how long you have to take to finish a long show! 
>> ARTICLE
It is 148 episodes and worth every single one of them. It is the only anime I have watched that is over 52 episodes.  It really keeps you interested until the 2nd to last arc then you will want to stop watching. Keep watching it it picks back up quick like 6-7 episodes and is killer for the rest.
>> ARTICLE
Which are you considering the second to last arc? Chimera Ants or GI?
>> ARTICLE
Chimera Ants. The start of that arc was just a solid WTF...
>> ARTICLE
yeah its pretty long i wouldnt recommend growing it out like that and even if you put in a lot of gel it';ll probly just fall over my friend greg grew out his hair once and tried something not that long thouhg good luck!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's 148 episodes. I'd still recommend it and I rarely watch anything longer than 24 episodes anymore.
>> ARTICLE
By the end of it you'll wish it was longer. ^^^^^^*cries*

Unless you didn't enjoy it, which is pretty unlikely but possible regardless.
>> ARTICLE
Is it over 100 episodes though? Because all the shows like that are really intimidating to me.

The longest anime I've seen is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which was around sixty episodes.
>> ARTICLE
The pacing is really, really good. You won't notice the length.

If you want, at least watch up to episode 58, which is the end of the third major story arc and would be a decent stopping point if you decided you wanted to stop watching. The third story arc is probably one of the best in the series, and a huge tonal shift from the first two, so it'll give you a pretty good idea of how diverse the show is.

But if you get that far, you won't want to stop watching.
>> ARTICLE
If you've ever seen Yu-Yu-Hakusho then you'll love this. I think its around 150 episodes so it's not terribly long if you watch at a pace (I didn't) but then again I've watched all of One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
It's long, but not long enough.  So freaking good.  Far and away the best shonen ever made, IMO.
>> ARTICLE
Same here FMA:B is the 2nd longest anime I have watched the longest being HxH it is totally worth it 100%. 
>> ARTICLE
148 episodes to be exact.

If the length is bothering you, try dividing it into sections and watching one or two arcs at a time and then taking a break (if you can resist watching more by then, that is).

To be fair, I got into anime watching exclusively long series (Inazuma Eleven, DBZ, Naruto, One Piece, Pokemon, etc.) and was actually pushed away from shorter anime since I thought it would be a shame if they turned out to be too awesome for their length, so I can't say I relate to your point of view, but hey, to each their own.
>> ARTICLE
As far as anime goes hunter x hunter is legendary level.  Not kidding at all. It may be kind of slow to start but if you get into it you will have no regrets.

>> ARTICLE
Imagining the shipping on that is giving me palpitations
>> ARTICLE
Question, why are these figures so expensive? Everywhere I see various figures are like $80 and up. 
>> ARTICLE
A lot of them are in shops that are consignment shops. So they will price them similarly across the board. Evrey once in a while you'll find one priced dirt cheap. Always hop on it. But never buy the first one you see all ways look around.
>> ARTICLE
But why so expensive? If they were $20 to $30 I'd be all over it but at like $80 a pop I can't justify spending it. I'd love to get a Hestia one but they're like $75 and I honestly can't pay that much.
>> ARTICLE
You pay for quality, both in design and in production. A lot of these things are done in smaller batches, which adds to the cost, and marketed to otakus, which ups the cost again. Kind of like how discs are so expensive.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, they seem interesting but I can't condone buying one for that price without feeling like a major otaku. 
>> ARTICLE
http://mikatan.goodsmile.info/en/2012/01/19/mikatans-factory-field-trip-finale/

Here, there are links from part 1-4 including some videos on how they are made.

This is pre-initial modelling btw, so it's not even the full process, but just production. You look for yourself if the worksmanship is worth the price.

I own three of these myself, they arent just cheap rubber plastic toys you get out there. These are actually very well crafted, surely the materials isn't worth the price, but hey, there is a reason paintings arent just the price of the paint and canvas.
>> ARTICLE
Arcade/Game prizes should be what you're after then. These can be found in crane machines around Japan and the quality is somewhat decent.

The ones fetching $80+ are very well sculpted and A LOT of time and effort go into it. Not to mention they are made to order (normally) and are hand painted, meaning they're not mass produced.

Ok, so Hisoka's riddle was actually a well executed pun, and this wasn't really translated in the subs. What he actually says is "O-shimai." Here are some translator's notes:

>This is a complicated pun that cannot be translated easily. The literal answer is "4 coins" ("Shimai") but this is written with the kanji for "death" which has the same sound as "4" ("shi"). At the same time, "o-shimai" is also the way to say "the end" and this final meaning is what Hisoka really seems to be getting at.

It kind of scares me that Kilua KNEW this would happen and seems pretty willing to sacrifice who knows how many civilians to save Gon/Alluka. 

It's one of those scenes were it looked funny but I felt bad for finding it funny considering these people are vegetables now. 
>> ARTICLE
Well I don't he could've stopped him with all honesty 
>> ARTICLE
Well, if he hadn't moved Alluka in the first place he probably wouldn't have done anything. He's acting becuse he thinks that Kil's wish will kill him. 

The show would be dull if Gon died, but the point I was making is that Kil is willing to risk other's lives just for 2 people he knew. I'm not saying if it's justified or not, in fact now he might finally be brought to justice but it's a very Morel grey area.

Gon was his first friend. Don't forget Killua is a cold-blooded killer. He killed those guys on the blimp during the Hunter Exam arc just for bumping him. He may have gotten a nicer but he's not that nice.

So it take killua 10 minutes to travel 40~km  (maybe 35 by going by the forest?)
So killua's full speed is approx 240 km/h (210?) 
>> ARTICLE
It takes longer to travel through the forest than on pavement, mind. I think his speed without Alluka and on pavement would be roughly double that.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
The average speed of a lightning bolt is apparently around 224,000 mph  360,000 km/h, while Killua was moving at some speed lower than 240 km/h. He was going at less than 0.07% of the speed of lightning.

So unless Alluka is *hella* heavy, I'm guessing Killua hasn't actually compared himself to lightning...
>> ARTICLE
i dont really like the anime translation on this *them saying god speed is at full power* i always thought killua wasn't going at full speed because he didnt want to shock alluka to death with lightning and not because alluka was heavy, because killua can open a door thats like 200 tons  i dont think he would give two shits about alluka being heavy even if alluka was 300 pounds
>> ARTICLE
If real world physics applied, then doubling his mass (i.e. Alluka riding on his back) would halve his acceleration, but that still wouldn't be enough to justify his speed. But you're right, he *did* say that he wasn't going to use his full power while carrying Alluka (which I forgot about), so I'm just going to assume this was an error of either the translation or the original story.

Maybe Alluka should lay off the pure lead diet

I'd say he struggled just a bit when fighting Kastro, but you're right, he never truly struggled per say.

i think he was a little, but just keeps a good poker face.

It looked more like he was toying with Kastro. Like, there was no reason for him to lose his arm or get hit; he gave up his arm for theatrical purposes and to progress the story by introducing the Phantom Troupe. When he decided that he had had his fun, he murdered the man.

Also do we really need to spoiler tag Greed Island stuff in an ep discussion?

I don't think that Razor came off as any more powerful then, say, any of the Phantom troupe.  It's as /u/Sennin_BE said: he created a game that gave him the advantage.  I mean he was super strong ~~because he was likely an enhancer~~ (EDIT: yea, emitter makes sense because he could transfer ridiculous power to that dodgeball; thanks /u/Alchnator for pointing that out).  But I don't think his Nen levels were "off the charts" or anything like the Chimera Ants.  


I'm frankly more surprised that Hisoka had absolutely no interest in fighting Biscuit.  Although she does make a strong effort to hide her actual power behind her cute exterior.  

>> ARTICLE
~~Didn't the Phantom Troupe turn tail and leave when Razor confronted them at Greed Island? If he was their equal, it would make more sense that they'd just kill him and keep going, but he was strong enough to scare them away.~~

EDIT: I am wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Are you talking about when Phantom Troupe sailed to Greed Island on their own, without Nen?  

My understanding of this was that Razor had specific GM powers (and/or special GM cards) that allowed him to expel those that entered the game through "illegal" means (i.e. not through the console & game cartridge).  I would have to go back to the manga/anime to know for sure though.

>> ARTICLE
That is what I'm referring to. ~~From my recollection, the PT left of their own accord after Razor told them he wouldn't allow them to enter the island unless they used the official method. If he had cards like that, I imagine the PT would have forced him to use them, since they aren't really the type to back down, especially when their leader is in need of exorcism~~. I could be mistaken, though. I'd also have to check the episode to make sure.

EDIT: I just checked, and it turns out I was mistaken. And you, my friend, are absolutely right. Good catch.
>> ARTICLE
He is stronger. The game was largely based in real life (think of it as using an irl engine).
>> ARTICLE
i think they meant the actual dodgeball game that razor made team gon/hisoka/killua play, that game made razor seem much stronger then he actually might be because his nen is designed around that game plus gon and the others were confined to a small area
>> ARTICLE
Though you'd think someone like Hisoka would be able to understand her power. A few episodes ago he was seemingly rating people just by sight, though maybe he couldn't do that back then.

Also in that arc he was pretty focused on Gon and finding that exorcist for Chrollo.
>> ARTICLE
he was a emitter actually
>> ARTICLE
Iirc, Biscuit was in Hisoka's toy chest of "interesting people". So he probably has some interest in fighting her, just not during GI.
>> ARTICLE
Well, he met the Phantom Troupe and their reaction was basically: " Nope! See you."
>> ARTICLE
Probably not, I decided to tag mine as a spoiler because I saw someone made a post about them being on episode 115 and didn't wanna give anything away.

I tagged mine since I was scared some of the context could reveal spoilers or something

Good point.

If you're only on ep 115 why would you come to the ep 142 discussion?

There was one throwaway line that smacks heavily of foreshadowing: who was Morel talking about when he said that the "Segregationists" would love to know about Alluka's abilities?

She's fucking cute, man. Guess I found new best girl since Pitou got #rekt.

It isn't safe to consider pitou a girl (   )

pretty sure that pitou was male in the manga and there are no zoldyck sisters in the manga so alluka and the other zoldyck sibling that joined the spiders are both boys

Butler is best girl by far.

Me too.  I keep hoping every week that Killua will reach the city...these episodes are too short.

Gon better be grateful as hell to Killua and his butlers after all this.

RIP Gotoh - first casualty of Gon's make a wish foundation.

>> ARTICLE
Also a bunch of random civilians getting needled in this little conflict around saving Gon.  Killua made it sound like they would at least incur some damage, if not eventually dying.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, also Gon wouldn't approve of Killua trying to save him if it meant innocent lives were at stake.  Granted, half of this predicament is also about saving Alluka.  I'm hoping Killua does whatever's needed to save the civvies.

I wonder if Gon will forgive him or leave Killua behind.. Would be so sad.

This show is amazing.  I wish it would continue forever. Togashi Senpai please.
>> ARTICLE
Damn it's good to see a little bit of [Hisoka Action!!](http://i.imgur.com/QcBJCuI.png). I can't wait to see where this conflict is going :D

>> ARTICLE
How didn't Gotoh notice Hisoka's bungee gum when he escaped? If he set that when he threw card at the beginning, Gotoh should've noticed it when he activated Gyo to see Hisoka's power when he caught his coins. So he should've known he would use it to escape...

Don't tell me he's really dead... I just started liking him...

I love those short cute/funny moments in this :D
>> ARTICLE
That and the fact that he stared himself blind at the coins, completely opening his guard. Everything before this episode implied that he was way more capable than that.
>> ARTICLE
Hisoka's body blocked Gotoh's line of sight, so he couldn't see the band of aura he attached from his back to a tree.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't it above him though? He should've seen it since his body isn't that tall to block it
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the same thing.  He definitely should have seen it, because when it showed it to us it was going way over his head, there's no way it would have been hidden.  
>> ARTICLE
Misdirection. Hisoka was being flashy with the coins, taking all his attention.

>> ARTICLE
I have missed psycho Hisoka so much, but it's top bad [what happened] (/s "to Gotoh, I liked him!")

The Hunter x Hunter world is just incredible, it's complex and huge in a wonderful way! It started out like a lighthearted world until we got some information, then it became pretty dark. It's also great how they bring in real life problems into the world! The characters are another amazing thing, time after time they bring out more fantastic characters! 

**I fucking love this show!**
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes I hate Hisoka. Sometimes I love him.

I always love him, even when I hate what he's done.

I think that makes you a transmuter. They're fickle.

He's awesome when he's on our side. When he's not...fuck that guy.

Still awesome though.

And gotoh is gone

http://a.pomf.se/vivcsd.webm the fight
>> ARTICLE
It always surprises me when someone dies in this show, I don't know why it still does after the previous arcs bout it's still jarring. Is it me or does Gotah have the lamest ability ever, I can shoot coins super fast, I'm sure he has other shit he could do but stil. Shoutout to Canary and her cute face she made in this episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call it lame, it seems like it's more suited as a long-range attack than for close combat.

If anything, it's perfect for assassination.
>> ARTICLE
well that thing he does where the coin will make you spin and crush you by your own power was pretty cool, and it serves as a good counter measure for an opponent who uses his Nen to defend.  
  
It's sort of like Johnny's Spin in Steel Ball Run.
>> ARTICLE
>  Is it me or does Gotah have the lamest ability ever

It's more interesting then Franklin from Phantom Troupe's ability.
I dunno, Gotoh could probably do some pretty interesting things with his ability. Considering the way he was able to make them spin in the air in order to drill through Hisoka's nen, he probably has a really precise level of control over how his coins act. If we'd seen more of him, I could see Gotoh doing some cool shenanigans with his Nen.
>> ARTICLE
not as stupid as Gomu Gomu no Nen is it?
>> ARTICLE
> Gomu Gomu no Nen

Which is that?

>> ARTICLE
He means Hisoka's Bungee Gum. Gomu gomu no mi is Luffy's devil fruit. They're not the same obviously but they both involve rubber.
>> ARTICLE
Bungee Gum Elastic Love. Hisoka's Nen killed Luffy and ate his fruit. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I don't watch One Piece lol. Thanks for the explanation. 
>> ARTICLE
Or Gon's "I can punch things hard after channeling for 10 seconds".

I love Jajanken. Not for the technique itself. On the face of it's it's pretty boring. The best part about it is the line he has when activating it.

Yeah the anime will go on hiatus after this arc, its better than filler!

zoldyck family wouldnt just let one of their top butlers die, right? :(

remember when illumi forced all those butlers to die after the wish. It was like a whole class of butlers and some change.
>> ARTICLE
yeah but you can't really compare those butlers to Gotoh, seeing as he's the head butler and Illumi and others might see him as a way to get to Killua somehow, so his life should be valuable to them :'(

or the fact that he is helping killua, knowing the concerns of the family, makes him an enemy of Illumi & Pa Zoldyck.

85 was a turning point for a lot of people as well.

The whole CA arc was great. The tone was set immediatly, though Togashi tried to set up a bit too much stuff before the invasion. But in the end it was necessary and oh boy did it pay off.

On my first watch-through of HxH I actually got bored part-way into the Chimera Ant arc, I stopped watching it for months until I thought I'd 'just get through it'. Fuck knows what I was thinking back then, it turned out to be some of the best anime I've ever watched.

This anti-chairman movement seems really competent.

/s
>> ARTICLE
Why did Gotoh have to die -__- JUST when i was beginning to like him. smh. Good episode though, looking forward to the next!

>> ARTICLE
i actually wasnt surprised with gotoh losing the fight and/or dying. didnt think he was going to be much of a match for hisoka after seeing the ending of the last episode.

overall this episode was slow paced but we get a small quick fight and more establishment of the anti-chairman people. we want moar madhouse!
>> ARTICLE
Although I it wasn't in the Manga, I kind of hope they animate [Hisoka](/s "vs Bushidora Ambitious")
>> ARTICLE
They are sending out small fry hunters agianst illumi and hisoka, nope not going to work unless they have someone in zodiac class or atleast a 2 star hunter with them. Also i wonder what will happend to Alluka if she saves Gon. Will they lock her up because of the giant wish killua made which is gonna have heavy consequence as very hard fulfiling requests. Because if not Alluka can end up killing thousands of people. If she starts randomly making requests to someone.

Brotoh is no motoh

Why isn't this show popular, the fight was fucking epic, and the chase too.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't aware that it's unpopular.. I thought it was one of the most popular anime of all time :o
>> ARTICLE
It's so unpopular that they reanimated all of the 1999 show and are catching completely up to the manga, with a production budget and animation quality that puts the other weekly neverending shounen anime to shame.
>> ARTICLE
i meant that it's not the same level as naruto, one piece, AOT etc.
>> ARTICLE
I've read/heard that people dismiss it when they look at the HxH cover art. You know, the one with Leorio, Kurapika, Gon, and Killua just being chummy and smiling

I know I've done it. Plenty of times, whenever I scroll through CR's alphabetical list, BUT I've read plenty of times on forums that HxH is amazing. I started watching HxH immediately after I was begged to watch Madoka Magica, which I fucking love, because you **really** can't judge an anime by it's promo/cover poster.

And now HxH sits together with Hajime no Ippo and Gintama as my all-time favorite shounen.
>> ARTICLE
Thank god, I saw the old one when I was a kid (absolutely loved the Hunter Exam arc) and knew what awesome thing I was getting into when I saw the 2012 one. If I never did I would have dismissed this or might have never flown on my radar because it's rarely talked about by anime fans.  
  
This is truly one of those shounen gems.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, I didn't watch it until my friend told me to. I thought it looked stupid and childish by the cover art. 

Boy, was I wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
Man that bike was fast. I would of thought that Killua would of been quicker with his new move.
>> ARTICLE
yeah but the bike was using 3 people worth of Nen to go fast
>> ARTICLE
They've done 7 episodes in 10 chapters. I think we'll make it to 150. That's a really satisfying number to end at, please do it Madhouse. 
>> ARTICLE
Ending where Togashi took his last major hiatus sounds about right, I believe that was Ch. 339, where everything felt resolved for the moment. But with any luck, maybe they'll have another arc to animate in a few years.
>> ARTICLE
The sadist in me wants [major manga spoilers](/s "the last episode of the anime to be the first chapter of the dark continent arc. This way, anime-only watchers can share the pain and suffering of the manga readers whenever Togashi takes a freaking hiatus.")
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah. Or you could also torture the audience by having each episode start out well-animated and gradually regress into chicken scratch drawings.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, that bit where I had an itch to want to read the manga during the GI arc, and then I pulled a random latest chapter (Chimera Ant arc) and looked at it and went "Is...is this...is this finished? I think they uploaded a draft or something..."
>> ARTICLE
And the BD release will feature the "proper" drawings!!

Oh god please don't ._.
>> ARTICLE
That was the main reason I was happy to see the Chimera Ant arc animated.  I wanted to know what the hell was actually happening.
>> ARTICLE
These episodes go way too fast for me.

And damn it Hisoka :( I really liked Gotoh.
>> ARTICLE
Maan... Gotoo :/
>> ARTICLE
Not enough kawaii Alluka.
>> ARTICLE
i'm still confused about Alluka's gender there was one episode where they were leaving the mansion that Killua said to Gotoh that Alluka's a girls thats why Canary was there now he refers to Alluka as younger brother.
>> ARTICLE
Alluka is transgender, he identifies as a girl and that's why Killua accepts him as a girl even though he's technically still a he. it's a representation of how Killua is the only one to really understand and love Alluka
>> ARTICLE
I didn't catch that at ALL. thanks.

Pariston has such a punchable smile.
>> ARTICLE
Just the smile? I find his whole personality almost unbearable.

Well the rest of him too, his smile is just a bit extra annoying.

He's my favourite character in this arc. How he doesn't need anything but still puts up a fight for everything for the hell of it. I'm enjoying it. 
>> ARTICLE
His personality makes him a fantastic character though.
>> ARTICLE
As of now it seems that they are hinting at Pariston being some sort of central antagonist going forward for this arc, so I think it was awesome that Togashi(might have the name wrong too lazy to look up) was able to create a guy who evokes such strong feeling from his readers. Especially given the fact that he's following up one of (IMO) the greatest anime antagonists ever in Meruem, the king.  I'll be honest I'm really excited to see just what's going on inside Paris Hilton's head! No more breaks Togashi I want more HunterXHunter!

Yeah, like One Piece that has only 5 mins of content per episode...
>> ARTICLE
Just like the chimera arc where the narrator has to tell the audience what's happening and explain every single detail since the viewers are seemingly too dumb I guess while there's 1 minute of actual content occurring in an episode. It's a worse version of the trope than 'oh look at him he is so powerful  omg' . One piece is doing a slow output of content per episode since anime as a medium moves faster than 19 pages a week while HxH already had the election arc finished about 2-3 years ago. ^^^sincethisisaHxHthreadimgonnagetdownvoted
>> ARTICLE
Nah homie, you're just raging about the wrong thing. They're creating a story with no holes in it, and sometimes that requires over-explaining things. It's a bummer it doesn't keep up a consistent pace with the LN, but some things are up to the production company, and thus far my only complaint is that the arcs are taking too long to close out. I love this show, I watch each episode the first chance I get on Tuesdays, but not everyone watches it like that. They have to keep the story air tight in order for future watchers to understand. That's why they go slow, why entire episodes are explanation, and why you're so upset. You are not the current target audience for the episodes that are being released, but there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back, shut up, and watch something else in the meantime.
>> ARTICLE
Light Novel? It's a manga. I never said I didn't enjoy it but saying it has shares no flaws like other shoenen is a bit far-fetched. The only major problem for ME was the ultra slow pacing in the CHIMERA ANT ARC ONLY. 

Something can still be bad even if it is engineered for my target audience(such as in this case young boys/general male audience since it is a shoenen demographic) although I'm not saying HxH wasn't enjoyable at all. I loved the companionship between Killua and Gon(and everyone else),everyone had a important part in the story.Telling someone to 
>just sit back, shut up, and watch something else in the meantime 

is quite harsh, I give you some points and you just say shut up, you even mistook HxH as a LN of all things and didn't address any of my arguments.

>> ARTICLE
I see your point but I just want to mention that the narrator wasn't added because of pacing or anything, he was present in the manga aswell and in my opinion necessary if you wanted to have a complete understanding of the situation. Some people liked it, some didn't.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I've read the manga too but sometimes you just need to let the audience figure some stuff out although I do understand that the general demographic is of a young age so it would be needed more.
>> ARTICLE
It's the curse of long-running shounens. Every long-running shounen faces the manga gap their own way.  

Either you do what Hunter x Hunter is about to do, and take a break that can easily be longer than 5 years long, or you do year-long fillers in between your major arcs like Bleach and Naruto have done, or you do like One Piece, where you minimize fillers but also don't take breaks by stretching out your individual episodes.

While One Piece's pacing definitely suffers from the studio's decision to handle the manga gap in this fashion, I think this method suits One Piece quite well. I personally wouldn't be able to bear a 5+ year break with One Piece, like what Hunter x Hunter is forced to do.

Ging and Pariston are on a totally different level.

The FUN level!
>> ARTICLE
Pikachu/Chopper for chairman!
>> ARTICLE
The way hunter x hunter gets me hooked with episodes that contain purely dialogues is similar to Death Note. I really love how stupid I feel most of the time because it feels so unpredictable and cunning. Pariston doesnt want to win nor lose. Awesome!! Ging is right that he has the same kind of spirit as Netero - they see everything as a game, as "hunting" for a greater goal as using the opponents intentions against them to win. I gained a lot of respect for Pariston with that sentence alone.

During the Chimera Ant arc, it was mentioned that the association didn't send many people to Gorteau because of Pariston's "influence".  So we have Pariston to thank for everything that went wrong in the Chimera Ant arc.  Including Netero's death and Gon's having to use his last resort.

He's just a massive troll, but he has Joker-like chaos hanging around him.

So you're saying that if Pariston weren't involved, we wouldn't have seen Gon go supersaiyan?

Pariston my hero~~

It's like Ging has the whole ordeal already planned out and knows how 
it's gonna end.


>> ARTICLE
I have always thought that that might be his nen power... to see possible futures or something like that. I mean otherwise he would be a horrible father in my opinion. Believing in your son is good, but he could have died two thousand times already.
>> ARTICLE
Then that would be out of character for Ging and make him a less impressive Hunter. Relying on Nen abilities just for spoilers. He wants to have fun, like Pariston, like Netero, so why would he ruin the fun by looking into the possible future?
>> ARTICLE
Thats certainly a valid point, however a power as strong as seing a possible future has to have strong restrictions. For example first he can only see 1 possible future and that is the future he least/most wanted future by him. he might have fun experiencing how he as an individual can change the future or similiar stuff

[mangaspoiler](/s "he can't see into the future, he is just very very good at predicting stuff and know's how pariston and netero liked to do stuff, his abilitiy get's explained to some extent in following manga chapters. The next Arc will probably focus alot more aroung Ging.")

Can somebody tell me without spoiling things: does the new manga series continue after a timeskip, like in Naruto Shippuden, or does it go on straight from where it left off? 16-year old Gon and Killua would be epic.

> i don't think the anime will continue for now.

It's been confirmed thats it is ending at i think episode 148
>> ARTICLE
Do people really think it's a mess? I think the new arc is really cool.
>> ARTICLE
The initial chapters were a mess because the people who translated it completely butchered the translations. It was impossible to figure out what was going on.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, if people are reading the fan translations, I understand why they wouldn't like the arc. It seems hard to judge it at the moment because it's pretty much all been setup.
>> ARTICLE
Oh okay, that makes sense. I've been buying the Shonen Jumps :)
>> ARTICLE
Must be good to be able to read Japanese..

I think the translations were so terrible because it was translated from Japanese to Chinese, and then from Chinese to English. I'm reading the Tokyo Ghoul manga, and the same thing is happening.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, sorry, I meant the English magazine published by Viz.

Haha, I wish I could read Japanese!
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, I'm one of those people who must read a manga chapter when it gets released, so I can't wait for the official translations =x
>> ARTICLE
It *is* moving into a "new phase", shall we say.  However, there isn't any timeskip *yet*.  Though it's possible that there will be a timeskip in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Well your question is a little unclear, so I am gonna answer this the way I see it. You ask if the manga continues in a time skip, and the answer to that is nobody knows.

 Right now HxH is primarily caught up to the manga, with the final episode (for now) scheduled to be episode 148, which will most likely be Manga chapter 339. 

As of right now, there are 349 manga chapters out, and in 4 weeks when episode 148 comes out, there will probably be about 2~3 more, leaving us with only 12~13 chapters not in the anime. 

To give you a scale, 12~13 chapters would only be another 6 episodes, and given the set up of the next arc, it will probably be quite long, so 6 episodes would only serve as a tease.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, time to switch my weekly Hunter X Hunter fix with the manga.

Hahahaha.... weekly, if only. It's more like monthly.

This months has been only one chapter sadly. But the last 2 months we got 3 chapters a month, so it aint that bad.

There is no time skip

there is a "minor" time skip, ie months not years.

I could watch an anime about the zodiacs and their interactions and it would be a blast.
>> ARTICLE
can someone clarify how the star ranking system works please? I thought it was a measure of how good a hunter is at his given field, rather than a measure of his strength.

The reason I thought this is that Ging is only a two star, whilst Pariston is a three star, despite Pariston saying on multiple occasions that he's one of the weakest among the zodiacs
>> ARTICLE
[Hunter Bylaws #5,6, and 7](http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Hunter_Commandments)
>> ARTICLE
Wait...so if Pariston doesn't really care if he wins or loses and he sees it as a game, then that includes withholding hunters from the Chimera hunt? He didn't even do it because he wanted the Chairman's position?
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't care if he wins. He does care if he loses. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda sad. While I enjoy every minute I have left until the Anime runs out of episodes, the political stuff bothers me. 
I'm not entirely convinced by this arc because of that reason. Though I can't get enough of cute little Alluka, Cheadle bores the fuck out of me.
>> ARTICLE
Can't disagree more. I enjoyed this episode more than last weeks. I were always om tje political shit. Doesn't matter if in an anime or like Game of Thrones.
>> ARTICLE
The thing that annoys me about this statement is that, even though I agree that the political stuff isn't as interesting as the other stuff int his arc, it's been proven that things that seem tedious at first turn out time and time again to be very important to the all around development of the series.

I mean let's look at the the Chimera Ant arc. Even though people praise it to be perfect, the fact of the matter is that there were a chunk of episodes that were boring as shit. ***However*** they were proven to be very important to the overall scheme of things. 

I'm annoyed because I saw statements like that throughout and people ended up dropping before they even got to see why it was necessary. So rather than glossing over it, try to think about how it will affect things later. And look at it this way, at least the fact that this political stuff is going on means that the show can continue on a bit longer.
>> ARTICLE
> Even though people praise it to be perfect, the fact of the matter is that there were a chunk of episodes that were boring as shit.

Maybe if you have the attention span of a 3 year old.

> I mean let's look at the the Chimera Ant arc. Even though people praise it to be perfect, the fact of the matter is that there were a chunk of episodes that were boring as shit. However they were proven to be very important to the overall scheme of things. 

That doesn't make them better, though. There were plenty of episodes in that arc that could have provided the same level of useful information in half the time or less. Picking up the pace would make things a bit more interesting in those episodes.

Alternatively, some characters could have been cut. Brovuda, Wolfrun, Bizoff, even possibly Palm and Ikalgo. In the end they and their arcs just served as an extra distraction from the central plotline. While there were definitely some good things involving them, the baggage in the form of setup was too much.
>> ARTICLE
Without all of the characters you mentioned being developed their inevitable run-ins with the King would have been a big WTF moment. Every moment isn't going to blow you away. Sometimes you need context to truly see what is going on. 
>> ARTICLE
> Without all of the characters you mentioned being developed their inevitable run-ins with the King would have been a big WTF moment.

That's why my proposal was to remove them entirely rather than just some episodes involving them. 
>> ARTICLE
Which is a pretty shitty proposal. They are minor characters which advance the plot in showing how the progress of both the antagonists and the protagonists. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to add that my comment probably made people draw the wrong conclusion from what I originally intended to say. I guess I'm just having problems with the fact that a large amount of time is spent on explaining stuff thoroughly to pad out the episodes. 


Another reason why I'm slightly disappointed might be the fact that I was able to marathon for almost 130 episodes and slowly get the grasp of how slowly the story progresses in order to make it last longer.
Cheadle simply happens to be the least interesting character to me.


I do, however, see your point. I shouldn't judge an arc that is only halfway through.


>> ARTICLE
I know I completely get where you're coming from. I've been watching since episode 1 so I'm used to it, but all of those that are marathoning to this point are obviously going to be hitting a wall like this. This happens for everyone when marathoning long running series, even me. I can't even guarantee that it will go somewhere. I can only go off the track record of the series. 

So believe me when I say that the everyone is feeling your pain, but we should still have faith and try not to exhaust ourselves when hitting the wall like this.
>> ARTICLE
Cheadle's thoughts, in fact, all of the character's thoughts are very interesting to me. I think they are important. I will agree I wouldn't want to watch election-related parts a second time, though. I miss Killua, Alluka, and Gon!
>> ARTICLE
Slow episode but progress nonetheless. Can't wait until gon gets healed
>> ARTICLE
God this was the most boring episode yet. I didn't like the zodiac and election bits of the previous episodes and now they've gone and made it worse. Zodiac looks like a bunch of One Piece filler characters. It's all one big joke with the cow, dog, and pony show. I get to spend 20 minutes listening to speculation upon speculation, like they have to read out every trivial thought in their head. At least in the chimera ant arc, it was a life or death situation with their decisions. Now it's all about a chairman position that no one respects, and not letting "Pariston" have his way, god forbid that! No one cares about the election and Leorio is one of the top candidates so everyone thinks its a joke. Pariston is just having fun, and so is Ging. The music makes every scene sound like a circus. I can't believe people think internalized dialogue of this low caliber is actually deep and profound.

Someone win already so we can go back to healing Gon. I don't know why all these people are securing the building for though, since Illumi has given up already.
>> ARTICLE
I can only speak for myself but I don't think internalized dialogue is deep or profound, I however find it really interesting. I love Pariston and all the scheming and the mind games that are going on. Maybe you're not into this kinda stuff, that's too bad. I enjoy it immensly.
>> ARTICLE
Acquiring the chairman position is going to play a big role in the upcoming arc. They are securing the building because that was one of the conditions Gotoh had Morel set so that Killua and Alluka can visit Gon.

The King has a reason to fight now. That's the worst thing that could have happened.

>> ARTICLE
Care to elaborate? I havent read the manga so i wanna know what I'm missing out.
>> ARTICLE
This adaptation is incredibly conservative, in a bad way. It follows the manga almost panel to panel, sometimes literally (still images that are just the manga with colour).

You get nothing out of this adaptation if you haven't read the manga. Due to the nature of the medium, the pacing is way worse. Not only that, but the budget is obviously extremely low since the animation sucks and the storyboard is paint-by-numbers.

If you want to see an HxH adaptation done right, check the 1999 version, except for Greed Island which isn't so good there. The 1999 adaptation has great direction and one of the best OST I've ever heard (contrasting the pile of mostly repetitive, overused tracks from the 2011 OST).

It's FINE, because the story is great and completely carrying the disappointing adaptation, and for a panel-to-panel adaptation it's OK (though the seiyuu choices for some characters and the change of Meleoron's colour scheme are odd). But it's simultaneously funny and sad when people here praise the anime for... the manga. It's a Reddit thing. Like people who think they're cool for reading manga adaptations of anime Light Novel adaptations.
>> ARTICLE
When did someone regard himself as "cool" due to being an anime only watcher?
 
I've read the manga of HxH and the Anime(2011) adaption is fine. Of course, it isn't as good as the manga but I don't understand where the hate towards Anime only watchers is coming from.

Some prefer this over that, what's wrong with that?
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen someone be so wrong, especially when the manga version (as awesome as it is) was basically chicken scratch on paper. And the 1999 version was shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit compared to this. Take off the nostalgia goggles.

~3.5 sec,
manga had a timer :D
>> ARTICLE
Someone should speed up this episode, so it matches.
>> ARTICLE
I love how they made maybe like 3.5 seconds of events into the most grueling, jaw-gritting, wonderfully paced 20 minutes ever.  
  
Why is this anime so overlooked?! You have Naruto still pulling out bullshit and holding the Shonen trophy and AoT being the soul successor of SAO for being overrated, and then there's this shonen gem the best arc I've seen in a shonen genre.
>> ARTICLE
Attack on Titan is nowhere near as overrated as the shittrain that was Sword Art Online. In fact , it is really similar to HunterXHunter in its thematic. The portrayal of danger and the fact of having to face odds that are so uneven that a joyous outcome is impossible without huge sacrifices are common for both shows. It is impossible to compare HxH or AoT with the normal Shonen Series, as both are borderline Seinen series because of the way they are written. 
>> ARTICLE
It is as overhyped as SAO though, the only similarity with HxH is they both establish that the world was grim dark and gritty. Whereas, AoT is trying hard to be seinen, HxH tries to balance itself in the middle of seinen and shounen.  
  
I've tried a formula on both, I was up to date with both manga before AoT started and before HxH really started the Chimera Ant arc and watched both. I've stopped at AoT on Episode 14 (planned to finish at some point) because the pacing was so clunky and whenever they do get to the scenes with talking it's uninteresting and everyone is so besides Jean (who was a perfect MC for that show because he has flaws but not entirely useless and he's completely human) and Rivaille (or Levi if you want to be official). HxH on the other hand strives greatly at keeping you interested, on the edge without using a fight scene and some episodes doesn't have any of the lead characters on it but the supporting cast keeps the whole episode completely steady.
>> ARTICLE
Since this is a matter of opinion, i guess we have to agree to disagree here :) While I think that Sword Art Online is so overhyped ( not necessarily on this subreddit , but on the Internet as a whole ) that one could actually make a point that Guilty Crown is a better show ( which was horrid in its own way ), Attack on Titan, in my opinion, is a show that deserves almost all of its hype. I did not think that the Anime had pacing issues at all, except maybe for the episode with Eren's inner monologue in Titan form, which felt like it dragged for quite a bit. 

I can't agree with you on the dialogue being uninteresting either : The episode with Pixis talking to the soldiers from the wall made very interesting points about the human condition as a whole for example. Had you watched the rest of the show, you woudl have seen that some of the later episodes hit quite a few nails on what it means to die in combat as a soldier. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it is the deepest show ever, but neither is HxH.

From a plot progression point of view, I think that it is even more consistent than HxH. Don't get me wrong, I find the Chimera Ant Arc quite amazing, but among the other arcs, most were either hit or miss. I found the Hunter Exam as well as Yorknew City Arcs delightful, while I could do well without Greed Island, which felt completely disjointed to the rest of the story as a whole. 
>> ARTICLE
I've actually been up to date with the manga, much like Naruto because at this point I just want to see how Naruto ends, I don't even care about anyone in the series anymore but AoT I'm still invested since the creator said he has a definitive date for it but he still doesn't know how to end it and right now I feel like the latest chapters have so many plot (Royalty, Murder, Titans, Planning, Daddy Issues) instead of focusing on one at a time.
  
AoT would've worked better if Eren never became a titan, I don't mind other characters becoming titan, but I felt like Eren's goal to stop the titans by proof of humanity massively decreases because he's using the titan power instead of being led to win using his own human power. It deserves the hype for not trying to be another generic anime plaguing this generation but if you really look at it it's nothing special it's the typical shonen story but like I said mixed with a dash of seinen tones.  
  
As for the arcs of HxH, I really loved the Hunter Exam, the tone just darkens on Yorknew, then it lightens up on GI with a card game with consistent rules (but yes I can see why most people think this is the weakest arc) and of course the Masterpiece Chimera Ant arc, I just love how the whole arc played out because it didn't feel like shonen.
>> ARTICLE
Him becoming a Titan has always been one of the most central points of conflict in the story though. I believe i've read somewhere that the author's inspiration for writing stemmed from the fact that he was often sick and had a frail body, and imagined his main character surpassing this obstacle. 

Still, i have to agree with you that HxH surpasses most other Shounen series easily.
>> ARTICLE
I'll probably get around to finishing it when the hype goes down, there were some damn good animation I've seen but questionable like Rivaille (or Levi if you're an official guy I still think Rivaille sounds better) doing those quick inhuman attacks on THIS ONE TITAN when it was immobile, I mean I get it in animation it's cool but really? Rivaille is that fast? He was like The fucking Flash with blades.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure the shonen trophy is held by One Piece. And the "shonen" name that gets associated with stuff like naruto or AoT, usually turns off people, which is funny because its just a demographic.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen a few episodes of One Piece and it really doesn't impress me, I don't really get the hype.
>> ARTICLE
I am just saying its the biggest anything out there. You should probably read the manga though, animation is iffy, especially after episode 300 or so.
>> ARTICLE
It's not that I hate One Piece, I mean I hate Bleach and Naruto, but I just don't care about One Piece.

Really! They should of keep that in the anime!

THAT SCENE

A single splash of blood. The entire anime goes silent. No music, no sound effects. No movement except for the panning of the camera. All color drained from the world except the red of Komugi's blood.

Holy fucking shit.
>> ARTICLE
can someone explain how she dies or would that be a spoiler?
>> ARTICLE
You mean how she got hurt? It was one of Zeno's dragon dive lighting strikes that hit the building that injured her.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. The silence was so powerful in that moment, you could just feel the King's anger.
>> ARTICLE
Are you sure that was anger? And who was it directed at? I remember him ordering his royal guards to protect Komugi, which obviously they failed to do. Very nicely done scene can not wait for the next episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought the same. I felt the anger was directed at Pitou. Almost felt bad for him.

Gon acting like a determined bad ass, not even flinching at whats in front of him, and the King going from emotional to slowly walking past Netero and Zeno...[Shit's on fire, yo.](http://i.imgur.com/m0PaEWz.jpg)

Respects all around. Netero and Zeno for the respect toward Komugi and to the King for not attacking as he walked by them.
>> ARTICLE
>and to the King for not attacking as he walked by them.

Forget attacking, he would have killed them.  Instantly.  And both Netero and Zeno understood that.  In that moment, the two of them realized just how MASSIVELY they are outmatched by the king alone.

The king could kill them at will.

Every single one of those ants is a monster when it comes to how strong they are. Yupi was looking powerful up against the hunters and Pitou's En is the best in the series, it reminds me of Aizen's(bleach) reitsu. As for the king, he could have killed Netero and Killua's granddad easily when he walked through the two. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the King decided not to do anything as he passed because they respected what he was feeling towards Komugi.
>> ARTICLE
> As for the king, he could have killed Netero and Killua's granddad easily when he walked through the two.

That is what I am expecting, the king may seem like a nice guy at that moment, but you need to remember how many people he has killed just because. And if Netero and Zeno pose a threat (which they sure as hell do), the king would most likely do what he could to avoid fighting with them.
>> ARTICLE
The earlier murders were before the King had his nice character development.  However, I think that the only reason he hasn't obliterated Netero and Zeno right now is because he doesn't want to kill Komugi as well.
>> ARTICLE
There's also the possibility of the two surviving the attack thus starting the fight inside the room Komugi currently is in, which in turn might harm her more.
>> ARTICLE

Most, if not all, of the remaining episodes will have that intense feeling to them. This arc is absolutely amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure I took a breath for the second half of that episode. This incredibly rich and complex narrative, all this tension and intensity they've built up, all poured into this one [personal, heartbreaking moment](http://i.imgur.com/f49HUpi.png) that digs straight at the "what does it mean to be human" message of this entire arc. That was a gorgeous, gorgeous episode. I don't even know what to say.

Damn I thought Komugi was dead, and that the King was going to berserk. Glad that wasn't the case. I wonder if seeing this humane side of what is supposed to be this vicious monster will change the way Netero fights.

I'm scared for Gramps.

HOLY HELL, HYPEEEEE
>> ARTICLE
Those episodes are fuckin intense lately. But seriously, i cant help but wonder... how the hell any of them stands a chance in this fight? Because I've got a feeling that they just went there to get slaughtered. Enemy's power level is fuckin off the charts. And they make it feel even bigger with the slow pace and narration.
>> ARTICLE
They don't stand a chance. That's why this is so good.
>> ARTICLE
What makes you think any of them actually DO stand a chance?  The villains are overpowered for a reason.
>> ARTICLE
[Slight Spoilers about Power Levels and Netero's character](/s "Netero wants an enjoyable fight, and likes giving impossible missions to people.   There *are* stronger Hunters he could've brought (as strong as him or stronger), but he didn't, because that wouldn't be a challenge.")
>> ARTICLE
Because in HxH isn't just about power levels, don't you remind their training before? That some B or C class fighter in a good/excellent day has a chance to beat a A one in a bad day? Also powers actually matters and not just the "level" part.

I won't spoil you, but you probably won't expect what's going to happen by the end of this arc.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah, i remember the training. Actually the training parts in HxH are probably my favourites in the show. You're right in everything. And the thing that I cant even predict the outcome of this is probably the reason why HxH is my favourite (and IMO simply the best) shounen out there.
Honestly, this show never cease to amaze me.

Call me a fanboy, but i just cant stress enough how good this anime is.
>> ARTICLE
It's not really about standing a chance tho, the only purpose of their mission is to kill the king, and that's up to Netero, the rest of the team could all die for all they care as long as they manage to separate the guards from the king so Netero can deal with him.
>> ARTICLE
Now that i see what i wrote, it kinda seems like i was complaining about it. So, just to clarify, i was amazed with this episode, and the plot development is just phenomenal. I cant predict ANYTHING of whats coming, and for that i simply love this anime.

Damn, the character development for Shoot. I was scared for a second that we'd have another Knov moment, but, man. I was moved.

Always, she has those ponytails on the side thats why it doesn't look long.

I had a feeling Komugi would die but still these feels for Meruem and her. And i am so glad Netero and Zeno let Meruem do his thing out of respect for the situation before shit got real.

This episode had me holding my breath from how much shit is going down! I was so worried for Pitou, I thought she might've died when she reached the King.

By the King's hand? It was a real possibility.

Amazing episode! 
I just wish they had added the timer like the manga had so people that didn't read the manga could realize how fast everything is happening.

I honestly didn't expect that much humanity...from Netero and Zeno.

There's always a few anime's where you watch an episode like this and you're itching to read ahead...This series, especially this arc, is incredible.  Trying to hold out for as long as I can before popping the manga open.

Some serious business will go down soon, now that the king will run loose ! Can't wait for the big fight. 
>> ARTICLE
The narrator is making the big bucks.  
  
On a serious note, I love how they handled the manga to anime transition of the narration+action. The narration and slow movement of everything actually makes you feel the intensity of the situation more than if they just pulled out fight scenes and you get how professional and quick thinking these characters are.
>> ARTICLE
So how old is Netero really? Zeno looks much older than Netero but apparently they're two generations apart
>> ARTICLE
150
>> ARTICLE
Great episode, so many great moments. That scene with Meruem holding Komugi and that narration.....we are in the middle of something special folks.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone is a monster, Netero with his strength, Pitou with hers, Youpi is just a freak with what seems like unlimited aura.

I was beginning to think Gon, Kilua, Knuckle, and Shoot were one of the only people who weren't complete beasts, but it looks like Gon is on his way, he may have seemed stupid, but I am beginning to think he is the smartest of all the characters, and I am really in awe at Shoot's story, if he was trying to avoid fights, we have yet to see even half of his potential...

And the king, this is going to end badly I know it, if he walked freely between them we still have no idea what happened to Netero and Zeno while they had their guard down.

This ep just makes me wonder how much of a chance Hisoka actually stands against Gon. From my perspective as of now, it seems like Gon will wipe the floor with him. I would rank Gon close to Netero, and probably in the top 20 strongest nen users.
>> ARTICLE
Your perspective is highly skewed. Netero isn't in the top 20 Nen users. They say that earlier in the arc, but his Bhuddivista palm makes him still one of the strongest fighters. Keep in mind that this is an Instant punch, faster than .1 of a second, that blasted away Pitou. 

Gon is now stronger than Knuckle and Shoot, but to compare him to the upper echelon of fighters just doesn't reason. He's impressive as a person and that is what carries him. Hisoka and Gon would be on the same level now I think, but experience and strategy would decide the fight.
>> ARTICLE
What? Name 20 people stronger than Netero
>> ARTICLE
We haven't met them...

Netero and his 2 hunter partners while ambushing the ants earlier in the arc says that he is not in the top 20.
>> ARTICLE
In the manga, Netero ponders whether Pitou could be stronger than him. His 2 partners object, saying that if Pitou is stronger than him, then no hunter stands a chance. Netero is pretty modest saying he's not even at half his strength, but Netero is certainly still top 5 AT LEAST, if not Number 1.
>> ARTICLE
hmm I seem to remember him saying "i'm not in the top class of nen users anymore" but them disagreeing thinking he is still the strongest fighter overall.
>> ARTICLE
Remember who Gon's father is.  Genetically speaking, he's following along with his father powerwise.  But he's got a long ways to go to get near Hisoka's deviousness.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know. Even though we know Gin's rank, there's no clear indication of his power even in the manga. He could just be really damn smart for all we know. 
>> ARTICLE
Nen is an emotional thing, isn't it? I don't think lineage matters.
>> ARTICLE
Not everyone can use Nen.  But all Hunters apparently have the knack for it (they wouldn't be able to become Hunters without it).
>> ARTICLE
I thought Nen was available to everyone, but it could only be brought out by intense training?
>> ARTICLE
My fuzzy recollection is that the hunter card was provisional, and they have that training they go through afterwards for Nen.  They don't pass that, they lose the card.  That suggests that training isn't enough.

I might be thinking of the original vs the 2011 HunterxHunter though.
>> ARTICLE
in the new show, though who pass the Hunter Exam unknowingly take the Secret Hunter Exam. They learn Nen from a professional who offers to teach them without saying they themselves are a Pro Hunter. The people who pass become Pro Hunters. Pro Hunters get jobs more frequently because by default they're stronger than Hunters.
>> ARTICLE
Hrm, so pro hunter vs regular hunters instead of booted out?  But still have to have the aptitude for Nen I think, vs it being available to anyone.
>> ARTICLE
>From my perspective as of now, it seems like Gon will wipe the floor with him.

We still have not seen any of the improvements from the training he had gotten since the fight with Knuckle.

I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that Gon has become insanely strong, simply because of the power spikes he had gotten until now. 

The Ants are on a whole new level, reaching their strength should be insanely hard and very time-consuming (although it IS Gon after all who has shown to be capable of fast learning).

From what we know, Netero isn't even as strong as Pitou normally (in the state he was when he demonstrated his aura in front of the friendly ant), and we've seen the amount of hardcore training he had done in his life to reach that strength. 

From the way I see it, the only way to beat an Ant would be through sheer strategy and teamwork. I wouldn't say that Gon alone can beat any of the Royal Ants, let alone even his subordinates have more strength than him (Knuckle, Shoot, Morel)
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say gon is the SMARTEST, but he is the most focused without a doubt. It's hard to say that gon is smarter than killua.

Also, what on earth have you seen to say that gon is top 20 most powerful? Literally nothing can lead you to believe that.
>> ARTICLE
''This ep just makes me wonder how much of a chance Hisoka actually stands against Gon.''

Since hisoka wanted to fight with Netero on the airship with not a second of a doubt i'am pretty sure Gon would get killed in a matter of seconds.

Remember that we haven't seen hisoka going all out yet we have seen him fooling around in the arena. 

Just a speculation but im anticipating Hisoka to be the final villain.
>> ARTICLE
Haha. You haven't seen Netero fight yet. Gon is not even in the same universe.

>> ARTICLE
I have. Multiple times. Which only strengthens my case.

This dude's fucking tripping, Gon hasn't done a single thing so far that would put him anywhere close to Netero. Maybe in a couple of episodes, but even then he wouldn't stand a chance.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Stop giving too much info tho, don't wanna ruin it. Nah but still I disagree, Netero has way more experience, even, EVEN IF and I'm not entirely sure if Gon was stronger in strenght and power, I'm sure Netero could deal with him with intelligence, intuition and lots of experience.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, that entirely depends, if Gon and Netero both had the same amount of nen, I would put my money on Gon, his insanely fast reactions, as shown in this episode, would push him ahead of Netero and give him the edge.
>> ARTICLE
Fast reactions? dude....we just saw and entire episode on Netero's insane training to achieve sound-barrier speed punches, I'm pretty sure the dude's faster, on top of experience.

And you should really think of it more, the only thing Gon has going on for him in term of strenght is his insane nen capabilities, meaning he has a lot of nen and shit like that, that's the only reason Knuckle, Morel and a bunch of people are always surprised by him, because his nen is huge and that Jajanken proves it. So if they both had the same amount of nen Gon would lose most of what he has going on for him.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "Though I would still pick Netero over Gon at that moment because badass adult Gon is kinda berserk and has no control. Netero has comparable strength plus his experience and intellect.")
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "Well in fairness I think it's kind of moot to talk of Gon using that power on a non-ant because it shares *many* similarities with kurapika's power--the conditions and requirements for the power are such they simply couldn't allow him to fight netero...")

[spoiler](/s "That said, I'd offer two things. #1. Netero loses to the king. There is literally no point in that fight at which he's winning. The king never suffers any damage and doesn't even consider it a fight--He sees it as a chess match to find out his name! Pitou also had good knowledge of Netero's full power and from all appearances (at least to me?) never considered Netero a threat.")

[EPIC spoiler DO -NOT- READ IF YOU HAVEN'T READ MANGA](/s "#2 Netero loses, the massive tag team versus Youpi never succeeds in hurting him to any degree; He probably SHOULD have lost to potclean but it doesn't happen and even then that would have been a tactical loss not a straight loss. Pouf doesn't REALLY ever fight anyone, he's a tactician and unlike the others he wins his tactical fight not loses. Pitou though arguably the strongest of the royal guards is terrified of Gon BEFORE the SSJ, then proceeds to get OHKO: It wasn't even a fight. Pitou's zombie, which is exceedingly more powerful even than Pitou with unlimited nen and practically indestructible STILL gets completely curbstomped. Pitou lands one hit--one. It occurred only because Gon was having a conversation with Killua--and he was actually HAPPY it happened.")



>> ARTICLE
This looks like a spoiler, so please use spoiler tags.
>> ARTICLE
Gon is nowhere near top 20 Nen users tbh :D Hisoka would still wreck him most likely. This ep might make him appear to be strong (most determined of all invaders), but remember just a few ep earlier it was made clear Gon isn't that strong at all compared to other characters. Keep in mind he's still young.
>> ARTICLE
I think its Gon's determination which makes him seem like one of the best. As all the others were lost in confusion, Gon continued to run up the stairs without a flinch.
>> ARTICLE
Close to Netero? What? Maybe in 50 or so episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Look at his progression, I say he is around half, maybe more of Netero at this moment. In the 112 episodes he went from absolutely nothing to this, and before a new arc he seems to grow in power really fast all at once before going on the mission, which is what you saw before the ant arc.

When I said close, I meant compared to the other people. The only other person I rank that high is Zeno, who is still weaker than Netero. Then it takes a deep fall to Gon Killua Shoot Knuckle etc...

I still haven't seen enough of everyone to accurately rank them, but as of so far, it would go Netero, Zeno, large drop to Knuckle, Morel, Gon, Killua who are all fairly even at this point, then Shoot (who I assume is going to skyrocket in the coming episodes)

I do rank in terms of their abilities, and since Knuckle seems to have one of the fastest and most useful abilities, I rank him above Gon, but just slightly. If Gon's punch didn't take so long to charge Knuckle would be below Gon, and at this point, if he landed a punch on Netero, it would probably injure him. And since Gon is still advancing, while the other characters seem to be flatlining (aside from Shoot, who we may see increase due to his new found courage).
>> ARTICLE
Gon couldn't beat Knuckle. Gon is still way too raw. Netero hasn't even shown his power and knocked back Pitou, who wiped the floor with Kite, and you think Gon is close to him? Its not even close. This isn't your typical Shounen where the main character just gets ridiculous power ups out of nowhere.
>> ARTICLE
Knuckle won't be able to beat gon in a couple episodes

It may be true that he would loose now, but Pitou is terrified of Gon, but isn't for most of the other characters.
>> ARTICLE
[Super Major Spoiler](/s "If you're talking about when Gon uses nen to speed up his aging by like 20 years, that doesn't really count. Its a one off thing that very nearly cost him his life.")

Hate to break it to you, but there's hardly enough material for 50 more episodes. Maybe if there were a filler arc or something, but we know how those usually go.
>> ARTICLE
I kno.
>> ARTICLE
I love HxH but I really hope that they don't go with the filler route once they run out of material. I would prefer if they just stopped where the manga did (maybe 1 chapter less than that?). Don't ruin a good thing.
>> ARTICLE
Or Togashi could jump on board as a writer for the show and continue the story where he left off. I know its a long shot, but he has never been that great of a drawer (as seen by this lovely picture here - http://shonenbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hxh-337-1.png) but he is an amazing story writer. I think that he could do some awesome things there but who knows.
>> ARTICLE
What exactly did happen with the manga?  It's like his team of artists just stopped working bit by bit until the writer himself just gave up.
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing. He doesn't have a team. Even his own wife (not yet his wife at the time) quit as his assistant.

He's just one of those temperamental geniuses who do things at their own pace.
>> ARTICLE
What the hell happened to his art then?  It got worse and worse until the last few chapters were damn near unreadable.
>> ARTICLE
Every time he comes back from a hiatus, he just churns out enough chapters to publish a tankobon. But before that can happen, he would need to publish those chapters weekly on shonen jump. I guess he just gets overwhelmed by the weekly deadlines. He runs out of time obsessing over his outlines and the perfect connectedness of the plot details that he ends up neglecting the art. He does redraw the bad art for the tankobons, though. He gets burnt out, takes a hiatus, and the cycle repeats itself.

Unlike other successful mangaka like Kishimoto and Oda who have at least 2 or 3 assistants helping out with the art and backgrounds and textures, Togashi does it all himself. He's probably the type of guy who can't entrust his work to anybody else.
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait to see Netero go full out, you guys are in for a real treat!

Same here! Everyone is going to freak out lol.

It's good, but it's sooo slow. How many seconds passed in this episode? Not even five.

Edit: [All into the lifeboats, ships going down!](http://imgur.com/8nlldcs)
>> ARTICLE
I would say maybe a minute or so passed by.

The reason it is slowed down so much is because they want to be in depth as they can before starting a fight scene. They are trying to show how much work everyone put into figuring out all of the plans and actions to take if something happened. Basically they just mapped out an entire game of chess based on what they know about the king and his surroundings, ending the map at a win.

thats the beauty son

It was kind of funny how he said he's not a fan of popular battle shounen tropes, yet out of the 2 that he decided to try, one was Fairy Tail, which takes these tropes to extreme levels of cheesiness.

was rather ironic that he picked by far the worst of the mainstream shounen

He also hates fights that are won by the power of friendship, which is Fairy Tail in a nutshell.

Every fight goes like this. Mc uses powerfull move, it's super effective. Opponent powers up and starts beating down mc, could this be the end? Mc had flash back/ emotional  motivation about friends. Mc powers up and wins with a super move. 50% chance opponent joins the guild
>> ARTICLE
What? Ft is probably the most solid example of power of friendship, I haven't seen another one that made it so obvious
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding? friendship literally and physically makes them stronger in the last minutes of fight. It's not a leg-up that should be used over and over in same fashion without characters go under power-up normally.
>> ARTICLE
While I actually enjoy Fairy Tail more than most on this sub, it *definitely* abuses the "power of friendship" to give the protagonists powerups in more often than not asspully ways.
>> ARTICLE
The characters do usually have the power that allows them to do so and it does get explained. But it always happens so suddenly, they do seem convenient. They really should explain the character powers in more natural ways in FT, as much as I like the series. For example, the backstory of Natsu in recent manga chapters explains why he is so overpowered. They could have hinted that more throughout the story earlier.
>> ARTICLE
And there's one character who's literally omni-powerful to the point you can't get her meaningful power-ups (without breaking the scale) and character growth. They have to somehow inject plot device to make things seem balanced, thus making it very dull to watch over.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe so, but the thing is, at this point in the story, basically every character seems to be overpowered now. Which is why it's frustrating to see if character just  friendship powers their way to victory. Still, it's not like these aspects are completely unexplained. But I wouldn't hurt for the manga to elaborate and establish the power levels a bit more. But I don't think that's really on the agenda for the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone being overpowered isn't as much of problem as being omni-powerful. If everyone's overpowered, no one's overpowered in the end unless you compare it with supporting/side characters.

Being omni-powerful means ability and character-wise without glaring flaw or weakness. And that is a terrible thing to have in a shounen. Especially if a character is pivotal and have regular appearance in the series.

Many evidence shows the mangaka's inexperience and lack of long term plan for the series. Or for some reason, disregard catering for older audience.
>> ARTICLE
-.-
>> ARTICLE
The whole concept of "power of friendship" went south in Fairy Tail.

Traditionally in shounen "power of friendship" is one of the defining qualities that separates *good characters* vs *evil characters* (minus anti-heroes), not a tactical edge that gets abused over and over in order to tip the balance during the fight.
>> ARTICLE
I stopped watching midway through episode 115 in the original Fairy Tail or something like that Erza was fighting some dude who controlled trees or something and she was getting her ass kicked, then she thought about her guild and how she cant let them down, queue she beating the everliving shit out of the guy who was wrecking her while he goes ''bakkana!''.. freaking ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
oh man. Currently airing arc takes this way further. Erza loses all of her 5 senses and is beaten to death. Yet wins the fight by one fucking punch because friendship. 

>> ARTICLE
Even in death the power of friendship reigns supreme!...It's just such lazy writing and it's embarrassing that it sells hundreds of thousands of copies still.
>> ARTICLE
Same. It's always the same, bad group shows up, Fairy Tail gets involved somehow, face the top members, getting their ass kicked, "DON'T UNDERESTIMATE FAIRY TAIL", becomes One Punch Man. There's never a believable struggle, any powers are never explained, no strategy just flashy moves and the worst part is that Fairy Tail has a legitimately interesting world and cast of characters but it's wasted.
>> ARTICLE
I assume the reason he chose Fairy Tail to check out is because it's short compared to the others like One Piece and Naruto.
>> ARTICLE
Not like he needs to watch all of them to get an idea.

Hell, Fairy Tail.isn't finished.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's likely what happened. 
>> ARTICLE
He chose Fairy Tail because he loved the music. It's also in the shorter end of long Shounen.
>> ARTICLE
It's actually not. Magi, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Hunter x Hunter, Rurouni Kenshin, Bakuman, Cross Game, Hajime no Ippo, etc. All long running shonen. All shorter than Fairy Tail. All 10000x better than Fairy Tail

The way it just keeps introducing more and more intermediate antagonists is ridiculous.

I don't mean to hate on you, but hear me out. You know how when you are really nervous about something that's very challenging, every second feels stretched. Well that's how that part feels to me, like you are in the characters state of mind during the invasion. Many movies, tv shows, anime l, etc. try to give you that feeling but they fail because they are constricted by runtime. I'm not making excuses for the show, i feel like this was an unintended effect, but its really cool to think about it this way and it adds to marathoning this show, at least i feel that way. 
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. To me it just felt dragged out. I also just didn't care at all about the antagonist even though it felt like they tried to shove them down my throat.

Personally I thought the Chimera Ant arc was the best with Yorknew City in second.

While I respect your opinion, as someone who just finished HxH two days ago something inside me died when I read your comment. 

Edit : Come on guys are you really downvoting him for stating his opinion?

I don't get why people love that arc. It's okay, but it would have been better a lot shorter and a lot more fast paced. And there were just too many ant character stories that seemed kinda boring  ie not enough Killua, gon, leorio, kurapka, hisoka or the spider troupe
>> ARTICLE
Good to see a fellow CA arc fan. I personally think it is one of the best shounen arcs ever, but it simply gets hated due to its unorthodox approach.

Fellow ant arc lover here. There's a lot going on in the battle and I think it's great that it goes over everything in slow motion.

Although I'd *hate* to have to wait a week for each episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah you're right about not wanting to wait each week. Being able to marathon an anime really isn't the same as waiting each week, that's also why I didn't have any of the pacing issues other people seem to have had. 

But  King Ant is still one the best written villain I have ever seen in a shoujen

way, way, way too long. Fifteen episodes into the bit you're talking about, I'm sure one of them said ''But only two minutes have passed". Sad viewing moment. And way too much commentary. Also, one word, octopus
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Nearly finished this part off right now. Only started watching HxH a few weeks ago. The narrator explains every single little detail while everything carries on in slow motion, as another poster pointed out, and it seems like every single character has their own 5+ length episode complete with rival and mission that could be completed in one. 

I kind of liked the narrator at the start. But holy crap. I expected this arc to be over 30 episodes ago. 

The pacing is horrible, and while some of the characters I really like the overall plot is imo a little boring.
>> ARTICLE
Now imagine watching it as it was airing!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that was that part that seemed to drag to me too.  It seemed like it took a month for 30 seconds to pass.
>> ARTICLE
> It seemed like it took a month for 30 seconds to pass.

Oh god yes.
>> ARTICLE
the narrator decided to take over the show and go ham... He was describing everything that was going on right in front of our faces in slow motion....
>> ARTICLE
I assume that was because they wanted to keep the same style as in the manga. The narrator also takes over there.
>> ARTICLE
It honestly felt like half of the review was harping on the length of the show. I know he was trying to avoid spoilers, but he only really went into some detail about the Hunter Exam. It felt kinda shallow to me.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, first half he was talking about how he has never really given battle shounen a chance because of the massive length and the fact that he doesn't like the well known tropes contained within them (yet, ironically he decides that, out of the 2 battle shounen to give a chance, Fairy Tail, the king of generic battle shounen tropes, is one to watch). Second half, he basically said what you literally hear everyone say about the show on a daily basis. I felt as though there was nothing of value stated in this review. 
>> ARTICLE
Fairy Tail might be a very generic one, but the others arent too different. i can understand why he would not want to watch one piece or naruto as they have like 700+ episode(as he mentioned). try watching 700 episodes for ONE review... god. 250-ish from Fairy Tail is a lot already, though i think if he is going to review it he will do so for the first 175 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
>Fairy Tail might be a very generic one, but the others arent too different.

I'd **really** beg to differ. As someone who has completed or is caught up to: Hunter x Hunter (2011), One Piece, Naruto, Bleach and Fairy Tail, I can safely say that Fairy Tail is by far the worst and definitely the most generic with it's tropes. 

In terms of writing One Piece stands on a very high pedestal as an incredible work. It is honestly hard for me to decide which one I find more impressive in terms of writing between One Piece and Hunter x Hunter.

I do understand that the fact that it is 700 episodes makes it a very different beast to Fairy Tail, so I do understand why he wouldn't want to watch it, but saying that it "isn't too different" from Fairy Tail is a statement I simply can't agree with, and would say that it's almost disrespectful to Oda, who is an elite writer in my opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
>It is honestly hard for me to decide which one I find more impressive in terms of writing between One Piece and Hunter x Hunter.

Consider that HxH is tied with OP for best for you, while being 550~ episodes shorter. Imagine how much better it would be if it was the same length. It isn't even a contest for me, HxH beats OP by a long shot.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, for me, a series being shorter isn't necessarily equivalent to being better. I actually love how long One Piece is just because it was so fun to be able to marathon it, without worrying about it ending any time soon. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh i understand completely, i marathoned it up to 600, then watched weekly to 700 from there before dropping. The pacing issue only really starts from around episode 550 onwards. It's a shame that Toei have to do that, or else i'd still be watching it now.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, don't get me wrong, the pacing issue is very much a real issue with the show, what I was comparing between Hunter x Hunter and One Piece was the level of writing and storytelling. If we were to judge all components of the show, including animation and pacing, I think Hunter x Hunter's anime series is clearly the better product. 
>> ARTICLE
I think OP does win story-wise. Characters would probably go to HxH. It should probably go without saying that the OP manga demolishes HxH's, while the HxH anime blows OP's out of the water.
>> ARTICLE
Length isn't always a good thing. I think it's actually more impressive that One Piece is still great despite being 700 episodes deep.
>> ARTICLE
Implying you *don't* want 550 more episodes of HxH.

OP is gifted with it's awesome mangaka. Oda is only gonna keep the series good throughout it's/his entire life. If anything, the anime is being made worse by Toei because of the absolute dogshit pacing they've reduced to now. I dropped it a while ago because of all the filler they put at the beginning and end of every episode with constant recaps, OP/ED, and so on.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I watch OP in bursts. I stay clear of it until an arc has finished then watch it all and skip the fillers in each episode. 
>> ARTICLE
>If anything, the anime is being made worse by Toei because of the absolute dogshit pacing they've reduced to now. I dropped it a while ago because of all the filler they put at the beginning and end of every episode with constant recaps, OP/ED, and so on.

The pacing is really bad.... But the official manga calls Zoro "Zolo" and I can't handle that. 

>Implying you *don't* want 550 more episodes of HxH.

I haven't watched Hunter x Hunter, but I guess I still want more episodes because it seems like that would make a lot of people happy.

Dude if you enjoy One Piece, You'll probably enjoy HxH as well. Definitely give it a go when you've got the time.

And yes. the dubs are crap. Lots of older ones are.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to offend you, but i dont think theyre all too differnt. Having tropes is Not Making it a bad show. Btw i like fairy tail, but its far from being perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, they all have similar tropes, I'm not arguing against that, but the level in which they use said tropes, how they use them, and the quality of writing overall, differs vastly from one series to the next. Fairy Tail uses tropes like the "power of friendship" to the point where that's literally how the main characters win every fight. Let me know how much that happens in One Piece. 
>> ARTICLE
>Yes, they all have similar tropes

Thought we were talking about this along. Anyway i just dont think one piece is that much better as you make it out to be.
>> ARTICLE
Uh, I don't see One Piece anywhere on your anime list, are you even watching it? Anyways, I could go on and on about why One Piece is better. Way too many reasons to count. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Oda's work is best on the manga, but yeah, I do think Fairy Tail is a lighter watch than many shonen shows. I still really like Fairy Tail a lot for what it is, but it may not have the same kind of appeal as some of those shows. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't calling it "harping", but the length did take up too much focus.  This is likely just a result of him never reviewing a long running series before, but it unfortunately resulted in me not really taking much away about the show itself.  Never having seen Hunter x Hunter before all I know now is it's a long show, with a slow start, and the tone gradually changes.  The "Certified Frosty" might be deserved, but it really took me by surprise.  It would of been nice for me if Arkada spent more time on the characters.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I wish he had talked at least a bit about some of the major characters because they are a lot of what makes the series amazing. There's a reason Killua etc. have such vocal fanbases on this sub.
>> ARTICLE
It would've been nice to see him touch more upon the deeper parts of the show like the Yorknew City Arc and the Chimera Ant Arc but I guess he had to not go into too much details because of spoilers.

Also would've been nice to see him touch on character development a bit more but it was nice that he touched upon the excellent secondary characters.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I've read lots of discussion in /r/HunterXHunter, and there really is a lot more depth to the show than it seems like at first glance.
>> ARTICLE
The first few episodes are quite deceptive indeed. People tend to drop it before they get into the meat of the show.
>> ARTICLE
It seemed like this was mainly because he's never reviewed a show like this before and didn't necessarily know how to tackle it like his other reviews.

I liked the Hunter Examination arc. Sure it was far from the best arc of the series, but that shit was fun.

I found it to be a bit hard to get through at first, but when I rewatched it I loved every moment!

The Hunters Exam arc is my second favorite after the CA arc and the most fun to watch. Definitely wouldn't call the beginning part "horrible".

The CA arc was my least favorite. The beginning and end of it were good, but it felt like it dragged on forever. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I can see what you mean, it's pacing is definitely hit or miss. I just think the good of the arc more than makes up for the bad.

I agree, but I also see what Arkada is saying. I liked the show during that ark, but it wasn't until the [Spoiler](/s "fourth stage which was like the hunger games but better") that I really started loving the show.

Togashi explained it in the manga. I think he was watching a show where they put the X between words, and he like how it looked.
>> ARTICLE
So is Killua X Gon not a shipping term but just saying their names? Did Togashi accidentally create the shipping method?
>> ARTICLE
Probably just a stylistic choice. I don't really know about the X.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's like vs. in Japan. So Hunter versus Hunter which would make sense considering that the first arc was the Hunter exam.
>> ARTICLE
Well fuck. Please tell me this wasn't supposed to be obvious.
>> ARTICLE
You just blew my mind. How did I not see this before?
>> ARTICLE
It's also used between the words of all the episode titles. "Departure x and x Friends", "Hisoka x Is x Sneaky", etc. So one would assume that it's meant to mark a space, and thus the title is actually "Hunter Hunter".
>> ARTICLE
maybe "X" is space between words in the Hunter alphabet.
>> ARTICLE
He's gonna be wishing he never got involved in Fairy Tail. It was interesting at first but fan service can't hide poor story telling where the solution to win fights is to give repetitive friendship speeches. The level of difference with HxH and FT is too high. 
>> ARTICLE
And that's the way the news go...

Concluding the Week of Awesome with a Hunter x Hunter review, it has been so great seeing so many high quality reviews over the course of a single week. You might not agree with his opinions but there is no denying the tremendous amount of work, planning and editing that goes into making these videos.  

Thank you GRarkada.

Do these videos have spoilers in them?
>> ARTICLE
It spoils the tone of the show and the direction it takes if that matters to you. Honestly the review suffered and was a bit shallow because he didn't touch upon a major part of what makes it good(to avoid spoilers). 
>> ARTICLE
No, it's safe.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks
>> ARTICLE
There are some minor ones, though nothing of considerable spoiling. [Example](#s "Leorio passing the exam, luck stat too high")
>> ARTICLE
I feel like some of the spoilers are worse if you have already started the show. For example he shows footage of [Example](/s "Hanzo beating up Gon for the final part of the hunter exam"). I can see why that would mean nothing to you if you haven't started the the show, but if you know who those characters are,but haven't gotten to that part yet, I can imagine someone being confused.
>> ARTICLE
This video has practically no spoilers in it, I was a least expecting a few spoilers about some parts in each arc (especially the Chimera Ant arc), but thankfully he doesn't have them in this video.
>> ARTICLE
Do his other anime reviews have spoilers in them?
>> ARTICLE
For the vast majority of cases, no. And when there are major spoilers, he says so at the start of the video, so you don't have to worry.
>> ARTICLE
Ok thanks
>> ARTICLE
I disagree with his assessment that it only starts to get dark as the show goes on... During the first arc [slightly vague but pretty important spoiler](/s "the whole thing with Killua's brother was pretty intense") and just the idea that the hunters, who are shown off as basically the most powerful organization in the world, [unimportant spoiler](/s "don't care if they're accepting a psychopath or whatever, just as long as an applicant follows the rules of the tests perfectly") both came across to me as much more grim than I was expecting from a shonen anime that seemed like it was supposed to be family friendly for all ages and all that shit.
>> ARTICLE
Copypasta **with spoilers**:

> This is a world where nobody thinks it all that strange for twelve-year-olds to take part in a death-game. A death game that grants the winners near-total immunity to the majority of the worlds laws and freedom to roam killing where they will - or the ability to *sell* those perks to anybody they want to. Note that the **only** established character who sought the Hunter License because of the opportunity it provides to help other people is the wannabe doctor Leorio. You know, the *comic relief* character, whose antics and slightly dim naivete you're supposed to laugh at.

> This is a world where a family of assassins can live openly, auctioning their skills to the highest bidder without fear of retaliation. Killua's background is horrific. He's a child soldier whose own *parents* tortured him from an early age, conditioning him into almost total sociopathy. This is one of the *heroes* of the story. And for all of their heinous lifestyle and outright evil, the Zoldycks are by and large portrayed as being "not that bad". They're tourist attractions, for Christ's sake.

> This is a world where superpowered terrorist groups roam the world committing multiple acts of genocide, and are still given shelter and ignored when they're not actively killing people. The organs of their victims are casually auctioned off across the world, where they find many willing buyers. The most popular televised sport across the globe is ritualised gladiatorial combat, often to the death at the highest level of play. The public can see that the majority of the top players are *already* crippled to some degree by what they need to go through to get there, and they still tune in to watch them get beat to a pulp once again.

> Nuclear weapons are held by virtually every nation, and the balance of power only maintained through Mutually Assured Destruction, allowing North Korea-like absolute dictatorships to survive largely without comment by the international community. Then again, why worry about the ubiquitous briefcase-nukes when any person on any street in any city could already be the equivalent of a walking nuke and you'd be none the wiser, given that Nen is visible only to other users.

> And nobody treats any of this with any concern at all. People are literally torn to shreds or have their organs ripped out in front of a crowd, and nobody on screen reacts as if it were anything out of the norm. Even Gon - a wide-eyed idealist who grew up isolated from the atrocities of the wider world in a small fishing community - doesn't bat an eye when someone's heart is torn out in front of him, or another is dismembered apparently by magic for simply annoying another competitor. This is the most innocent a person gets in the show.

> The world of Hunter x Hunter is not a shounen adventure wonderland, it's a horrific dystopia. Togashi has put together a Tarantinoesque pastiche that decries the way in which violence has become normalised within our own modern society, and the way that human life has ultimately become devalued outside of each individual's very small personal circle of friends. And the show-writers get the *audience* to accept all of this just by using cartoonish visuals, upbeat music, and a set of funny protagonists (including: the psychologically-scarred child soldier, the utterly obsessed blonde kid who tortures people to avenge the genocide of his entire culture, the child whose issues over early abandonment by his father leads him to put basically zero value on his own well-being and, from time to time, the pedophilic masochist with a three-figure body count who openly lusts over the children around him). 

> One of the common comments on the Chimera Ant arc was that it took a lighthearted show down a sudden detour into dark territory, what with the cannibalism, slavery, on-screen child murders and all that. I have to ask the people who say that: what kind of show did you *think* you were watching to that point?
>> ARTICLE
Why is this guy the only anime reviewer this sub embraces?
>> ARTICLE
He spouts popular opinion (circlejerk)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this is probably an extremely unpopular opinion, but I don't enjoy his reviews. It's pretty much just an summarization of the popular opinion you'd hear on this subreddit, so in all honesty it's pretty boring. I guess he's more appropriate to people who are newer to anime, or don't follow the community too closely. 
>> ARTICLE
Why is that a bad thing though? isn't the point of reviews to help people find stuff they might enjoy? I think it's not a bad thing that his opinions align with the common ones.

What's important is having the ability to explain why in an eloquent way that makes it easier for people know if their opinions will or won't align with the reviewer's opinions, there's reviews by him where he enjoyed certain shows that I felt weren't for me and vice-versa, thanks to the fact that he's good at understanding why a show is or isn't for him.
>> ARTICLE
True but I don't mind that. No need to be extra edgy and go against popular opinion.

I mean there is usually a reason why things are liked/disliked. 
>> ARTICLE
Cause he is a weeb and we love weebs.

jk Honeslty no idea, he is elocuent, makes god points and has a nice production value. I think that's enough?
>> ARTICLE
He isn't a salty yelly neckbeard? I've never watched something like this before and I was totally expected a salty yelly neckbeard but he was very well spoken and what the person above me said, charismatic.
>> ARTICLE
hes usually hated on quite a bit here but people really liked his week where he reviews a show everyday so hes gotten a lot of attention.  Usually not the most well received here though
>> ARTICLE
He's the most reddit-like of all the youtube anime reviewers. His reviews typically fall in line with popular opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah theres the Demo Deezy.
>> ARTICLE
There aren't many and they never get posted here.
>> ARTICLE
Most reviews are downvoted here, this guy must be really special.
>> ARTICLE
That's not true. Demo D made two videos a little while ago, and this sub went crazy.
>> ARTICLE
I must have missed that.
>> ARTICLE
Good sense of humor and good production values. Also he seems pretty fair about most shows, giving them all a decent shot.

Still, people shouldn't take his reviews as the authoritative rating though. Good, fun reviews, but there are many good reviewers out there. Including many who do a good job of breaking down individual episodes. I suppose that is the thing too. Some people may appreciate his general rundowns and clipping a lot of talking points into a shorter video.
>> ARTICLE
Is he actually critical about stuff? Which shows does he rate good for example?
>> ARTICLE
He likes Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo. So the short shows that pack lots of development and fun.
>> ARTICLE
He gave champloo a 6.5, not sure I'd say he liked it a whole lot
>> ARTICLE
Arkada also loves Madoka, FMA, and Steins;Gate
>> ARTICLE
Also Melancholy and Disappearence of Haruhi Suzumiya are both certified Frosrty. He even has Yuki in the background.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah he pretty much shares the opinions of most people which isn't necessarily bad.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter (2011)
>> ARTICLE
I mean what are his favorite shows and his unpopular opinions etc.
>> ARTICLE
Well he did give a "buy it" rating for Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-Chan which a lot of us thought was complete dog shit.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I actually more interested, which popular shows he rates low. This would define a reviewer for me.
>> ARTICLE
He gave Nozaki-kun a skip it rating, gave School Days a Fuck it rating. He gave NGNL a somewhat above average rating while a lot of people were going apeshit about it. Also gave Watamote a fuck it rating.
>> ARTICLE
I still disagree with his assessment of Watamote, but then again, I can totally see why that show's comedy style is divisive. It seems he is pretty rough on comedy shows in general, or it just doesn't take to him.
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't often rate shows low, the reason for this as stated by himself is that if a show is "shit" then there is no point in him making a video and then rating the show "shit" to everyone. His time is much better spent recommending good shows to people and not wasting his and their time.

Too me that makes sense, however he did review Guilty crown this week and gave it a skip it rating. Which is his form of a negative rating.
>> ARTICLE
*He gave a Stream It rating for Guilty Crown.  
  
>> ARTICLE
It was borderline though
>> ARTICLE
He gave a skip it to Nozaki-kun. But in the end, ratings are meaningless. What's more important is what he actually says about the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed, but it would indicate if he uses his own head to judge something or just always goes with the flow instead to please the masses. That Nozaki thing is interesting.
>> ARTICLE
If you're interested in controversial opinions, he also really liked the second season of Darker than Black, much more so than the first season IIRC. The general consensus here is that it is pretty much the other way around.

Although, outside of the occasional outlier, his opinions are usually roughly the same as the generally accepted ones on this sub.
>> ARTICLE
No idea about his favourite shows, but he was very critical towards Angel Beats and Darker than Black and that rubbed people off the wrong way.

However I actually agreed with him regarding those reviews. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it's great that he is critical against popular shows as long he can back it up with reasoning. More interesting for me :D
>> ARTICLE
Its problematic when people are intentionally critical against popular shows. I know there are at least some people that go into a popular show looking for reasons to hate it. 
>> ARTICLE
Being intentionally critical and looking for reasons to hate it are not the same thing.
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't though. A lot of the shows he's considered great are very popular (Steins;Gate, FMA, etc.)

In fact, some people are annoyed by his usual agreement with /r/anime's general opinion. Dude has some pretty generic taste. So do I, so I really like him, but more unique people don't like him as much.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, people with more unique tastes usually know that about themselves, and should know how, why, and where their tastes will differ from the norm.  So a dependable, consistent reviewer can still offer valuable opinions, as you can view their review through your personal lense :)


>> ARTICLE
I actually disagree with the guy on many shows, but I can at least admire his ability to talk rationally through it. I can see why people take his word seriously. I think one can still watch this stuff, disagree and still like his material. I don't think I actually agree 100% on any reviewers I watch regularly. But they have other qualities that makes them interesting or informative.
>> ARTICLE
We generally like all of the main podtaku people (Arkada, Holden, Gigguk, Jimi) but Arkada is the only one that actually releases videos at a level in which people can remember him. Holden has released 1 video in almost two years, Gigguk isn't doing much better, and Jimi is down for the count because of copyrights and computer issues.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, it's like people don't care about the publicity and money '_'
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed following Ark and the rest of the DesuDes Brigade before that dissolved. Ark and JesuOtaku seemed to have made it out the best.
>> ARTICLE
He's usually very safe in not pissing people off since he's not too harsh (Nozaki is the only thing that comes to mind where he got large backlash) and takes as middle as a middle ground he can possibly take on controversial shows or topics. Example being his Guilty Crown or SAO II reviews in this review week of awesome. It's weird though because before this last couple of videos people here called him out on being a reviewer who basically just gave summaries of the shows and took the most neutral approach to reviewing anime.

Compare this to someone like Digibro who is *very* harsh and very analytical that the reactions are pretty negative whenever one of his negative [videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3uyhfv/digibro_the_asterisk_war_sucks_part_2/) [are](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3ui2du/digibro_the_asterisk_war_sucks_part_1/) [posted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/279cp4/sword_art_online_an_analytical_diatribe/) 
>> ARTICLE
For Glass Reflection I suppose that he has some charisma that no other Youtube reviewers has. While he has been criticized of not being harsh enough and nitpicking on stuff that makes no sense to nitpick on, he is still eloquent in the way he speaks and has an overall great production quality, which places him over most Youtube reviewers.

I'd argue that DouchebagChocolat is more loved on this sub, but he's not as active as Arkada.
>> ARTICLE
He speaks the best of all the reviewers with the best mic and doesn't get all profane shouty like some people do.
>> ARTICLE
Digibro and Mothers' Basement seem to get a lot of love here too, is where I first heard of them.
>> ARTICLE
I saw the Mother's Basement review of the JoJo OP and was hooked from there. that guy deserves all the attention he is getting and more. His breakdown of OPs are fantastic and his recommendations have gotten me to watch a bunch of anime that I normally wouldn't have found or wouldn't have given the chance that they deserve without him.
>> ARTICLE
On a random note, if anyone here is an automotive enthusiast, RegularCars has a very similar style of humour in his review style as Demo.
>> ARTICLE
Discovering both of them in the same week was an amazing experience. They've grown into such large channels in the last few years too.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised he didn't mention the narrator or go into any detail about the slowdown in the CA arc. That's one of the biggest beefs people have with the series but it sounds like it was practically inconsequential to him. Also kind of disappointed he didn't talk about the excellent character development for the main pair.
>> ARTICLE
He tried to avoid the spoilers a bit too hard. Arkada obviously remembered the CA arc as mentioned by the tone shift he brought up.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the intro is the same as roundabout from Yes. I keep thinking I'm going to hear the rest of the song.
>> ARTICLE
It sounds like the intro before the guitar kicks in.
>> ARTICLE
I find some of his mannerisms to be kind of annoying and even borderline cringe-y, but the content is presented well and I am interested in what he has to say for the most part. I personally wish there was less face-time, but that's me.  
>> ARTICLE
Like what is so cringey?
>> ARTICLE
Well for 1, the pony tail and red blazer are a big visual give away on what kind of person he is if he thinks that looks cool on camera. Like others have already said in response to your comment hes like a walking Fedora. I'd enjoy his videos so much more if he didnt put himself in them tbh. 
>> ARTICLE
He's great but he's literally a walking fedora.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus, I've been trying to find the words to describe what my issue with his presentation is. I think you pretty much nailed it, hah.
>> ARTICLE
Probably his over-the-top persona and mannerisms? I personally like the quirks, they help differentiate him from others, but I can see why some would be annoyed/weirded out by them.
>> ARTICLE
True but the other popular reviewers are just pure snark or an over the top whiney kid with loud profanities that get old after a while...
>> ARTICLE
And here I was hoping he would delve more into the arcs in a separate video. Kinda like what he did for Haruhi and E8.

The CA arc alone could fill a 10 minute video.
>> ARTICLE
Just started this series recently after hearing all the praise it gets here. Glad to see a review of it. I see people recommending this show to fans of FMA:B so I have high expectations for this now!
>> ARTICLE
It is also a good continuation from Yu Yu Hakusho fandom considering it is made by the same author.
>> ARTICLE
It's not entirely accurate to say that the intro song doesn't change - they change the verses played between archs
>> ARTICLE
Calling /u/shaking807 to see her thoughts on this review.
>> ARTICLE
I wanted to know your thoughts on his UBW review. 
>> ARTICLE
I agreed with a lot of what he said. The adaptation was good but of course feels incomplete at parts due to the multiple route format of the VN. They did the best with what they had for that route and fleshed out some side characters more than others while characters like Sakura Kirei,and Rider seem largely forgotten but again that's because they get more focus in HF. Until every F/SN route is adapted  it will feel incomplete. As a full package it will be great. (hopefully the fate route gets adapted by ufotable some day too...as it is right now the Fate Route is kind of being shafted by the DEEN adaptation.)
>> ARTICLE
>as it is right now the Fate Route is kind of being shafted by the DEEN adaptation

The Fate route shafts itself by being awful in just about every narrative metric.
>> ARTICLE
So so glad he reviewed the glorious Hiatus X Hiatus! Everything he said seemed very accurate and fair to me except when he said:

> The first 3/4 episodes are **horrible**.

I know the beginning can be considered a slow star but I wouldn't go as far as to call it horrible. Still really glad he enjoyed it and gave it the highest rating possible! Especially for a non-shounen watcher.
>> ARTICLE
The wife-or-mother quiz was a good moment, the shapeshifter chase was interesting, and a clown turned a guy's arms into flower petals. I think they were pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
I think a main point was that they are very different from what the show has to offer later on. 

As a lover of the series, i fell in love after the first few episodes alone, so they are maybe subjected to a tad different taste for some people compared to the other parts/arcs. Both are good, but appeal to slightly different interests in a way. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah agreed! The tones are definitely very different so I can see how that can catch people off guard.
>> ARTICLE
Awww yiss, certified frosty rating. Good job Arkada.
>> ARTICLE
the Pokemon reference was great.  Good review
>> ARTICLE
Did Ash really become a trainer because of his Dad? Did he even mention him at all? 
>> ARTICLE
> Did Ash really become a trainer because of his Dad

Yes.  Ashes dad left home to become his own Pokemon master and ash wanted to follow in his footsteps.

> Did he even mention him at all?

Besides for a few mentions in the first season of pokemon where the show reveals that he on a pokemon journey and he would be proud of ash, nothing else has been revealed about him. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the first 2 episodes or so mention him.
>> ARTICLE
So happy he finally watched it. It is my favourite show.

A lot of people don't like the first few episodes but personally, I loved them. Obviously they're not as good as the later arcs but the hunter exam is still amazing. And trust me, the episode count isn't that daunting when you start watching. It will hook you.
>> ARTICLE
Was it just me or was there no substance at all in this review.
>> ARTICLE
Arkada does reviews for people who haven't seen the series yet, not analysis for people who have already finished the series, so he never goes too deep into spoiler territory since that's not his thing.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I'm well aware of that, I've been watching his videos for a long time.

It just seemed like for this video all we got were generalizations (since the anime is pretty long)

I mean heck he only spent a couple sentences talking about the characters other than Gon. Pretty sure he could've talked about their personalities and group dynamics without spoiling anything significant.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, he basically sold me on the show, warts and all, so I think he did his job pretty well.
>> ARTICLE
Aight well in that case I'm not gonna hack it.

I can only offer my opinion as someone who has already watched the show so if you haven't watched the show and liked it then that's good.
>> ARTICLE
At last a Hunter X Hunter 2011 review in youtube can't wait to see his review.
>> ARTICLE
The reviewer Bakashift did a pretty solid review of HxH on his channel.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with Bakashift's review is that he criticized the show for not having Leorio and Kurapika in Chimera Ant. There is no need for shows to shoehorn in characters into arcs just because the fans want to see them. It goes against the character's motivations and creates plot holes.
>> ARTICLE
I really dont see that as a problem. Its his opinion. It doesnt invalidate the review. Its just something he would like to see. To be honest, if you wanted more of those characters in the show, that is a very valid reason to criticize it. While i dont agree with him, i see where he is coming from.

But hey, opinions differ man.
>> ARTICLE
If he wanted to see them then that's fine. The thing is, he used that as criticism and dropped the score of the show as a result. 

Trying to force characters into an arc for the sake of pandering to the audience is not only unnecessary but it also breaks their personal motivations. That's bad writing.
>> ARTICLE
Finally someone else who thinks Leorio is useless! Don't get me wrong, he's a great character, probably my favorite out of the main four because of his attitude and wit, but the guy was incredibly lucky. He hardly even has any real fight scenes (outside of a couple of punches and knife jabs)!
>> ARTICLE
well leorio hasn't had a time on the spotlight in the anime, he is currently the main character of the current arc ( along with kurapica ) let's see how that turns out. 
>> ARTICLE
In the 1999 version, Leorio is a lot more helpful. Dunno how helpful he is in the manga though
>> ARTICLE
Some parts where Leorio shows himself to be useful (like spotting the needle wound on the Kiriko) were 1999 anime-only filler. The 2011 version is much more accurate, so the 2011 Leorio and manga Leorio are basically identical.
>> ARTICLE
he opened the testing gates by himself in the manga, but that's about the only difference between the leorios that stands out (to me at least)
>> ARTICLE
> He hardly even has any real fight scenes 

The guy's a doctor, not a fighter!
>> ARTICLE
Dammit Jim!
>> ARTICLE
Hunter X Hunter 2011 was truly a masterpiece and I'm honestly completely fine with it not being complete. (At least as an anime-only fan)
>> ARTICLE
I thought the ending was pretty damn great personally. All the direct conflicts were solved and it left a few hanging threads of interest for whenever they decide to pick it back up.
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't have said it better myself to be honest, the first few episodes are really weird and the show seems to be some kind of show for 6 year olds at the start but oh boy, thank god I continued watching.
>> ARTICLE
Wow i saw the words Hunter x Hunter 2011 on the front page and my face dropped, but it was just a review QQ.
>> ARTICLE
Damn it's been awesome having a new video out every day.

Props to Arkada for slaving away and giving us an extra review this year!
>> ARTICLE
Kinda pissed they didn't include Kite at the start of the serie.

Becaus Gon wasn't going to be a hunter becaus of his father, it was Kite. Gon didn't even know his father was a hunter.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
The start of the 2011 anime is after Gon's meeting with Kite. Their meeting is how Gon finds out about his father and leads to him deciding to become a Hunter. 
>> ARTICLE
they had that scene iirc. it was in a flashback i think
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but the flashback was shown in episode ~76.
>> ARTICLE
He forgot the show is on sub for Netflix as well 0 ads
>> ARTICLE
Is the complete thing there though? I'm watching it on Netflix and I don't think all the episodes are here
>> ARTICLE
No they aren't all there. Something like 100, I think.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you 
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised he didn't talk about the alluka arc. The only major flaw in this series imo.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who gets sad when someone mentions hunter x hunter knowing we probably won't see much more of an animated series?
>> ARTICLE
We really need a spoiler review of this. He didn't really go in depth on the show.

(But I really appreciate that he finally reviewed it :) )
>> ARTICLE
"Toneshift as drastic as in Madoka Magica"  
wut?

Fair review otherwise. Would like to see a spoiler review.
>> ARTICLE
He said it wasn't as dramatic as Madoka lol
>> ARTICLE
I meant more like, there is no drastic toneshift in Madoka.
>> ARTICLE
The first arc is one of my favorite arcs in the show personally. I love the creativity of the hunter exam and how the characters deal with the problems the test presents. 

I thought the combat tower and killua's house arc are slower and less interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
Kinda shallow review. For some reason he didn't bother talking about any of the characters or themes of the show. There's a spoiler-warning, but just no information. If don't know how this is supposed to tell anyone if they might like the show.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
From what I hear, the manga is... uneven in quality. Largely to do with the amount of time the mangaka spends sick and on hiatus. Some chapters are incredibly detailed and others look like they published his rough sketch draft. 
>> ARTICLE
It's best damn thing ever, there you go, you don't need a review, go watch it and fall in love.
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully he does Gintama soon...even though it is 300+ episodes and he hates long shit.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure he said somewhere that he doesn't like Gintama (and gag anime in general), so that is pretty unlikely.
>> ARTICLE
Damn shame. Just though giving more spot light to the show from his viewers would have been good. XD
>> ARTICLE
well i wasn't expecting a frosty for HxH since i always thought arkada wasn't mush of a shonen person. 

but alas, with this HxH joins FMA on the certified shonen good taste for newcomers, hope he reviews JoJo soon to have a solid trinity of shonen good taste to recommend.
>> ARTICLE
Not Yu Yu Hakusho?

I mean, during the rewatch here. Many couldn't wait to the next thread and just watched through it. lol
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure he's talked about an older adaptation of Stardust Crusaders before so I expect he's at least interested in the current version. I can't find the video though.
>> ARTICLE
Why alas?
>> ARTICLE
I dropped HxH a while ago and didn't like it at all. But now I understand why, and am willing to give the show a second chance.

They really did butcher the character of Leorio. Like... why does he even exist. He is this "normal joe" underdog medical student who everybody wants to root for. He's also voiced by [God himself](http://myanimelist.net/people/63/Keiji_Fujiwara). But then, he's the most mediocre character in the world that has no reason to exist. After a while I didn't know whether I wanted to like him or not and in the process I lost interest in the other main characters and quickly grew annoyed with them.

I guess some day soon when I pick this show up again, I just need to ignore him as some novelty side character and try to like and understand the other main characters.
>> ARTICLE
You'll think he's the best bro ever by the end though. Seriously, I felt the same way until the last arc of the series.

Hunter X Hunter is my favorite anime and it feels so sad to see these threads go without a single comment. I can only hope that it's because everyone couldn't resist and have already gone way ahead of the rewatch and not because they don't find it interesting.

The problem (along with visibility) is that people aren't sticking to the schedule. They're starting the series then mararthoning it at their own pace and so nobody is coming back to comment because they finished the episodes weeks ago.

I've stopped participating in rewatches for this reason. Every discussion is either empty or full of people that have not only finished the series but have riddled the place full of spoilers so newcomers avoid them.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't know there was a rewatch going on here until I saw this post. I'm I'm a little behind with my current rewatch but I'll hopefully catch up soon so I can join in the discussions. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched it through one and a half times already, and I started when these discussions were on episode 30 something. I couldn't handle watching at that pace because the show is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't know this was going on. I just speed through all episodes this week. I've seen it at least 4 times.

I think people skip to the fight scenes. The drama is good, but the fight scenes are legendary.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't participate with the re-watch but started watching this show for the first time 2 weeks ago. I am already at episode 101. It is so good! I think I'll finish the show before next week, since it's summer vacation for me and have a lot of time on my hand. I hope this cheered you up a little bit :)

Being one of the people who happened upon the ~~thread~~ rewatch by chance and had to search of follow-up threads actively, I can tell you it's a lack of visibility.

Threads move fast in this sub and, in my opinion, it's not ideal to be posting on weekends as there are presumably less users spending time browsing reddit. *It's like how television shows go to Friday to die. People refocus their idle time on weekends.*

It might help if there were a "Ongoing Rewatches" list, but that would involve a lot of work from a mod. 

----

edit: Perhaps a RewatchBot could be devised to:

* Identify a rewatch thread submission based on series title and user
* Confirm to begin or continue compilation of that rewatch for archiving
* Inform users if their submission is undergoing a rewatch
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like this should simply have its own subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
That would work on paper, but in practice is akin to MMO subreddits forming branching subreddits (for things like grouping or trading) - Only a fraction of people would remember it exists, let alone remember to use it.

The ideal solution keeps the activity flowing in the same subreddit, just with more organized visibility.
>> ARTICLE
There already an ongoing rewatch list in the /r/anime wiki. Threads do move fast but this re-watch has been on the front page each weekend since it started.

Right, because people totally look at the WIKIS of subreddits on a regular basis. What was I thinking...

/s

> but this re-watch has been on the front page each weekend since it started.

Again, weekend vs weekdays. User activity changes.
>> ARTICLE
Is there anywhere to view this sub reddit's activity on average for each day? I would think most members here would have more free time to post during the weekends. 
>> ARTICLE
From my original comment

> *It's like how television shows go to Friday to die. People refocus their idle time on weekends.*

Having more free time doesn't mean spending more time on the same weekday leisure activities.

It often means doing activities we lack time for on weekdays, such as:

* sleeping until noon
* binge-watching Netflix 
* ~~going to a party~~ leaving your house to pretend to be social

Activities that overshadow browsing a subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
Yes,  I understand your argument with those points. I was just asking if there is anywhere we can see actual proof that this sub reddit has a lot less traffic on weekends compared to week days. I personally don't have much free time during the week to browse reddit compared to sat-sun when I am off from work.

Ah, Knov's breakdown in 106. I recall having high expectations for the voice acting in this particular scene, fearing it would be downplayed for being "over-dramatic" or some other dismissive line of reasoning. 

Madhouse did not disappoint. I treasured and sympathized with every sob from Knov when I first saw that episode. 

Things to note: 

* The menacing aura Knov sensed was Pouf's, twisted by frustration and malice towards Komugi no less 
* Gon and Killua, who Knov criticized, had not encountered Pouf's aura as Knov now assumes in his internal monologue, but Pitou's
* The aura of Pitou that Killua encountered embodied amoral curiosity which is relatively tame on its own
* **Knov was in a partial Zetsu state that made him more vulnerable to the emotional properties of nen** (recall Hisoka barring Gon and Killua from the registration window at the 200th floor of Heaven's Arena), **properties like Pouf dark thoughts towards Komugi that translates into an aura of unbridled disdain**

These disparities in awareness are important to understanding Knov's traumatic reaction. He is not weak-minded, Gon and Killua do not possess some unknowable mental strength. It was simply a tragic misunderstanding and unfortunate circumstance for Knov.
>> ARTICLE
People like to underestimate pouf but he's a manipulater and the strongest yet.  It makes sense that his En would be more potent and toxic to the human psyche.
>> ARTICLE
So what, you are saying he is stronger than the king of chimera ants!? HUH?
>> ARTICLE
He is saying that Pouf is the strongest manipulator shown so far.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah my bad! I read his comment incorrectly, just realised. Well in that case, yes he most definitely is! In my opinion the strongest in the whole series!
>> ARTICLE
Sorry could you please explain what makes him strong, I really have an open mind but I don't see him as being very powerful, Like I see Shalnark being more powerful, but not as clever.
>> ARTICLE
He was able to hypnotize hundreds of thousands of humans. He is also able to manipulate himself at a molecular level allowing him to repurpose himself as anything or anyone and become a multitude of clones. He transformed the captured humans into ants. Shalnark is powerful but he doesn't compare to the scope that Pouf has or the manipulation technique. And remember, Pouf did this all for the service of the king. Imagine if he was an independent character with his own selfish desires. 
>> ARTICLE
But Pouf was also kept at bay by single-star and no-star hunters. I'm pretty sure there is no way in hell Shalnark could ever be trapped in smoky jail or struggle in any kind of fight against Morel.
>> ARTICLE
Stars don't mean strength or ability. They're giving to Hunters for achievements.

Hisoka has no stars and has killed double star hunters.
>> ARTICLE
True, but he also admired during the chairmen election arc that he was no fighter AND during his fight with pouf wasn't he at half strength?
>> ARTICLE
105 is when *that one part*, I had been awaiting to be adapted from the manga, had finally arrived. There are many moments that this arc that I hold in high regard, reveling their adaptations as well, but the following moments in particular are what I find most memorable, as they so clearly became the catalyst to the rest of the story. 

* The King's attempt to destabilize Komugi with a wager
* Komugi's response of unshakeable resolve
* The King's resulting shame, and subsequent "apology"
* Komugi's audacious kindness, defying and rejecting the King's barbarism

A lot of people view psychological warfare as "fair play", but, in my opinion, the exchange of mental gymnastics observed between these two is a resounding boon to the argument of pettiness. 

And as the title of the episode suggests, an awakening occurs within the king. One which predictably affects the entirety of the arc and is why this pair so intelligently and wholly captivated my admiration.

This conversation had between Komugi and the King is among my favorites of all anime, sharing space with moments like Fate/Zero's Grail Dialogue and [HxH spoilers.](/s "Gon's long awaited conversation with Ging.") It is half the core to why this pairing is [my one exception to abstaining from the fanatic culture of OTPs.](/s "The other half being their tragic and beautiful final scene that made it canon. :')")
>> ARTICLE
Just finished watching the whole series, didn't know there was a rewatch, I watched these 10 episodes 3 days ago and all I can say is that I fucking love the Meruem and Kogumi segments.
>> ARTICLE
Loved the infiltration part. Reminded me of playing Metal Gear Solid. Poor Knov though...
>> ARTICLE
On the whole I thought this weeks episodes were fine, but I'm worried as to where the arc is heading. Gon's fighting chimeras, as is Kilua and the other hunters, even the Phantom Troupe (who still exist for some reason) are fighting the ants. Speaking of the Phatom Troupe, I hope we get a good reason for their continued existence, Kurapika will presumably fight them again some time, but I don't think there are enough episodes left for that conflict to take center stage. Speaking of Kurapika what the hell is ~~she~~ he up to, not to mention Leorio did the author just forget about them. Although I did find a lot of the fight scenes rather poorly adapted for the most part, filled with way too many pauses and inner dialog, they did a good job of conveying the scale of the conflict, even with everyone working together the weaker chimera ants are a huge challenge. The king's board game matches on the other hand, are not overly exciting, especially since we don't know the rules to Gungi. It's possible that the King might get some interesting character development as a result, but I'm much more worried that the arc will get overly drawn out by these games, delaying the explosive climax the action seems to be building towards.
>> ARTICLE
From what you've said on the troupe I'll just tell this to you flat out. There are plenty of plot points that are going to be left unresolved by the end of the anime because the anime ends at a point that the manga still continues past. Hunter x Hunter is not a completed series, so the Phantom Troupe's continued existence, among other things, is due to the fact that they will take center stage at a later date.

Kurapika and Leorio don't really have a place in this arc. Putting them in would feel like a shoehorning at best because it wouldn't be in line with their pre-established characters or ambitions. It would just feel lazy or pandering honestly. They're not gone for good, just busy with other things in their lives.

I would say that the purpose behind the Gungi games is to not necessarily be overly exciting. The point is not the game itself but how the game is used as a device to understand both Meruem and Komugi better. However don't worry, the games will not draw out the climax.
>> ARTICLE
It's rather unfortunate to hear that there will be lots of loose plot threads in the anime. I was under the impression all the jokes about Hiatus x Hiatus were things of the past, but it seems I'm mistaken. To some extent I agree it's unfair to judge an incomplete story for its incomplete plot threads, however it's also dishonest to ignore them.

I agree that putting in Kurapika and Leorio in this arc for no good reason would be unfortunate, but they're supposed to be main characters, or at least were presented as such for the first few arcs. I simply don't understand why they aren't being given more screen time, or rather why they were given so much screen time at the start, either way it's a weakness in the story.

I sincerely hope you're right about the Gungi games. Everything up until now has foreshadowed that at some point the King's character will subvert his archetype, but I'm curious as to if they'll be able to make an interesting character out of a savant like Komugi.
>> ARTICLE
No, unfortunately Hiatus x Hiatus is a very present and very upsetting reality. I won't act like it's not a fault in the anime and that it shouldn't bother you. I just feel it would be disingenuous to blame Madhouse or the crew working on it for it. They did the best they could do with the amount of material they had.

As I said they're not gone for good. In fact with the way things are in the manga currently, the roles have pretty much been reversed. Leorio and Kurapika have gotten WAY more panel time than Killua or Gon have gotten as of late. The Chimera Ant arc is long, and so it does feel as if they haven't been in the story too much (which is true, in part due to hiatuses Kurapika wasn't seen in the manga for the better part of 9 years or so), but if you look at it from an arc by arc standpoint, they've only been left out of one arc or so.

You're picking up on all the right cues regarding the impending climax and The King's character, but the gungi games will most certainly not slow down the climax. You'll know when the climax hits, trust me you can't miss it, and by that point you'll more or less see what I mean.
>> ARTICLE
For those who have only watched the anime and are considering reading the manga: 

The anime goes up to chapter 339. There has only been 10 chapter installments of the next arc. Togashi has consistently only released a few chapters every 1 to 1.5 years for several years. 

Use this information however you wish.

I didn't watch this with you guys, I just came to say that I hope you enjoyed the best shounen of all time IMO.
>> ARTICLE
HxH is probably my favorite long-running, battle oriented shounen as of yet. The spot had originally been taken by FMA Brotherhood, which still an awesome show, but HxH is just such an adventure. There's so much of it, in such variety, in such high quality that it's impossible not to go back and rewatch your favorite moments and arcs. 

I'd also like to give praise to the setting. While initially very bland (at least, I felt like there wasn't enough of an establishment on how the world of HxH worked before going into its first arc), the setting became gradually more fleshed out as the story demanded it, creating a very cool, adventurous world that, from the viewer's perspective, still has much to be explored.

There's so much I'd like to praise here, but since everyone has already praised everything good about it, let me say the one issue I had with this show: the pacing. 

While the pacing was completely addictive during the best arcs, it had a tendency to slow to crawl during some of the less exciting ones. Greed Island and Heaven's Arena were both very fun arcs to watch in retrospect, but it was boring how they set up the rules through a variety of info dumps. And if you weren't paying exact attention to who had what card, and how certain mechanics of the game (or Nen, in HA's case) worked, then you were only getting half of a great action scene. 

If HxH didn't have as many info dumps to explain the rules for each arc, I would have been able to marathon with even more ease. This is why the Hunter Exam, Chimera Ant, and Yorknew Auction arc are some of my favorites, because they have minimal amounts of info dumping that are completely crucial to appreciating the plot (except for Hunter Exam, but this problem is bypassed by having single challenges that have their rules quickly explained). 

In fact, I do have problems with it, but those problems are fucking shadowed by how much I enjoyed the things that I liked that I am completely willing to overlook them, especially in subsequent viewings. 

I don't like using scoring systems, but as long as you understand that this is completely arbitrary and I have not actually done any calculations for this number, then I would like to award HxH a 10/10. Cause fuck it, this show is so much fun, and it deserves it.

> That implies we'd have gotten more than five chapters in that time. 

Well, we can do some rudimentary fact-checking and find out!

1. The Chimera arc goes from 186 to 318, for a total of 132 chapters. 
2. The second longest arc is Greed Island, standing at a mere 65 chapters, less than half of the Chimera arc. 
3. Even if we were to include the 56 chapters of the Yorkshin arc as a subset of Greed Island, the total is only 121 chapters. 

Due to the number of newly introduced characters, and barring an abrupt massacre of characters, **150 to 200** is a reasonable minimum range. For simplicity, we'll use an **average 175**. (edit: fixed formatting)

1. [Based on this chart I found on the wiki](http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:MrGenial11/Hunter_x_Hunter_Hiatus_Chart?file=Hiatus_Chart.jpg) and starting from the first major hiatus in 2006, Togashi releases an average of 10.6 chapters a year. 
2. 10 chapters were published in 2014.
3. The probability of there being **at least 2 chapters in 2015** is extremely high. 

175 - 12 = 163 / 10.6 = **15.37**

Rounded up to 16 for margin of error and going onward from 2016, we can expect the majority, if not the conclusion, of the Dark Continent Expedition to be published **no sooner than 2032.**

As a follow up to the Chimera Ant arc it is no surprise that the 13th Hunter Chairman Election arc [exhibits regression to the mean.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean) While I thought Alluka's power was cool, the fact our heroes ultimately avoided equivalent exchange felt anti-climatic and thematically ruinous to the anime's theme of the reward of hard work. (As an aside is Alluka supposed to be trans* because it was confusing how some characters used male pronouns while others used female pronouns?) The Hunter election itself was hard to swallow even though it was made clear most hunters regarded it with apathy. While I can accept that Leorio could win votes by hitting Ging, his passionate appeals of friendship were cringe worthy not the type of thing that I would expect to see applauded. However the biggest issue I had with the arc was the villains Pariston and Illumi both had seemingly no motivation other than a desire for, for lack of a better, [evulz](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz), which made both the conflict and its resolution disappointing. I can't say I'm at surprised that Gon is so accepting of his father's lack of a proper excuse for abandoning his son, but I think the show missed out on some character drama.

My overall view on Hunter x Hunter isn't overly negative but it so heavily contrasts the opinions expressed by everyone else in these threads that it must come across that way. While Hunter x Hunter did try to approach some adult subject matter and thematic nuance, the low quality of the writing, especially the characterization severely hampered it's success. While the anime had above average production values content was often spread so thin that it failed to be emotionally compelling. Since Hunter x Hunter is unfinished it seems a bit unfair to criticize it for all its loose plot threads, but I do think the story's lack of closure remains an issue, most arc based stories either have a larger objective that is being worked towards or simply don't leave their conflicts unfinished at the end of their arcs. Hunter x Hunter has taught me to never give up when you're a protagonist and to be more critical of other people's taste in anime.

Hunter Exam: 2

Zoldyck Family: 3

Do you even enjoy the shows you watch?

I'm asked that question relatively routinely, probably because I actually rate anime out of 10 as opposed to from 5-10 and because my comments generally focus on weaknesses which spur discussion as opposed to strengths. I enjoy anime that I rate 5 (average doesn't mean bad) and higher. In retrospect with Hunter x Hunter I would have rather just watched the Chimera Ant arc since it was very self contained, but hindsight is 20/20.
>> ARTICLE
I mostly disagree with a lot of your points, but that's beside the... point.  I'm curious as to which shows you have enjoyed, or at least received higher ratings.
>> ARTICLE
Click on my MAL link. All my ratings are purely in terms of enjoyment, which of course is simply a function of how good I think the anime in question are, it's hard to enjoy stories that leave you in disbelief, and insightful themes provide more long lasting enjoyment than comedy ever could. Does anyone rate things on another basis?
>> ARTICLE
Okay first big question, what the hell is WOST? (Better not mean Worst OST...) Yes, you will find many, many people will rate things for different reasons (art, comedy, *cough* amount of panty shots, music). Not necessarily a good "critical" practice, but at the same time not every work of art needs insightful themes or a lack of disbelief. It's very easy to fall into the trappings of criticism, especially after you've seen a work at the pinnacle of a specific medium. Instead of comparing everything to the highest benchmark, it's best sometimes to look at a work from a different point of view and appreciate the effort that went into it.
>> ARTICLE
Want OST. Art, comedy, music and panty shots (although they are of course a net negative) are all things I take into account in my ratings, if all of Hunter x Hunter had been as visually compelling as episode 131 I would surely have rated it higher. I don't see any value on rating anime on a scale if the top of the scale is not the highest benchmark of the medium, while I don't think 10/10 needs to imply perfection it seems absurd to me to use it for anything but the best of the best. Effort in and of itself is not something I care for, I'm looking to be amused not boost the self esteem of others. As for the notion of what is necessary for good anime, I agree that suspension of disbelief isn't integral but that's largely because of surrealist works like [Mind Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/875/Mind_Game), but I'm reluctant to accept the notion that anything could be truly excellent without insightful or at least powerfully delivered themes since they provide such long lasting enjoyment. You're not the first person to suggest that I should try harder to appreciate anime for what they are, which is a notion I simply don't find appealing, if you have force yourself to try to enjoy something that means it's not enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
Can you give a TLDR as to why you didn't enjoy some of the other arcs? 
>> ARTICLE
Not him but for me I really hated the pacing and I though Gon's development was awful.

The arc could easily be 20-30 episodes at most without anything lost. You don't need to spend so much time on
 
-An ant eating
 
-Training
 
-The eight fights against Knuckle
 
-Killua whinging about always running away, just for him to solve it when it's convenient so it can never get mentioned again
 
-The narrator telling me what's happening every single frame, even basic things like Youpi being angry. I'm not blind.
 
-The slow fights that take way longer than they need to.
 
-3 minutes taking over 6 episodes
 
-The octopus in the basement
 
By the time I forced myself through it as if I was putting myself through the ludovico technique, I stopped caring about the characters so I had no emotional reaction to the sad parts.

As for Gon's development, [HxH and Breaking Bad](/s "Before I get into it, let's talk about Walter White from Breaking Bad. In terms of morality, the character goes from white to black, but it also has every single shade of grey in between. There's never a moment where he feels out of character. Take Gon. He has three shades. He has White dumb cheerful Gon, Grey quiet "I'm just gonna sit in this corner" Gon, then Black Screaming in Killua's face to fuck off because his anger boner would rather fight Pitou and have an innocent child die because of it. It's so unbelievable and comes out of nowhere it's off putting and abrupt. There's no gradient. Especially because this was all for a guy he knew for 4 days. It's like what if Walter poisoned a child in the third episode of Breaking Bad? It makes him entirely unlikeable and I really didn't give a shit if he died, I stopped watching the second after that arc so he could have and I don't know.")
>> ARTICLE
Kite was the closest thing Gon ever had to a father lmao. He's known him for A LOT longer than 4 days. As for all the other things, the only thing I can agree with is the pacing. Yeah it could have been shorter, oh well. 

They talk a lot about Killua's relationship with his brother. It's not just one scene lol. There wasn't 8 fights against Knuckle. I agree they were a little boring, but it was to show how weak Gon and Killua were. The narrator was a little annoying but overall I didn't mind him. Some fights were super hype (Killua vs Youpi for example) but some were a little less hype. The octopus in the basement was a little boring. I admit I didn't care at all for Palm and her relation to the story. 

As for Gon, I think his development was fine. His transformation was well done. For the Breaking Bad comparison, you're dumb if you're comparing him to White if you haven't even finished the first season. 

May I ask what shows you *do* like? HxH is considered to be one of the greatest shows ever made so it's weird you had so many problems about it. I'd like to hear your opinion on other shows.

FMAB was great. Did you not get feels during CA arc though? I didn't tear up at all in FMAB but I did like 3 times in CA arc. Also I dont think it's fair to compare them. One is a full story, while another is just an arc. (Also CA isn't even the best arc imo. I enjoyed Yorknew a lot more). 

I didn't enjoy TTGL as much as other people I liked it, but would never think about giving it a 10. IDK why really I just didn't think it was 10 worthy at all. 

Lain is on my PTW so I should be watching that soon. Heard great things from it. Haven't seen Shiki but I'll check it out also. 

Most of your 9's I really enjoyed (gave Baccano a 10). Never heard of Noucome though. 

What would you give Hunter x Hunter? Do you have a MAL?
>> ARTICLE
> Did you not get feels during CA arc though?

The only thing I felt was contempt for people who told me it got better. I watched 131 completely blank faced. I don't think I've ever seen a show that tried as hard as it did to give me an emotional reaction and fail as hard as it did.

> I didn't enjoy TTGL as much as other people I liked it, but would never think about giving it a 10. IDK why really I just didn't think it was 10 worthy at all. 

I have a lot of reasons for it.

-It balanced character, drama, and action extremely well

-It gave me feelz.

-All the characters were really good. Kamina had a surprising amount of depth too. Instead of making him this big, over the top cool guy they made him say that the only reason why he can do what he does is he knows Simon is always there to back him up and his over the top personality is there just to keep up Simon's spirit.

-As ridiculous as it got, it never had a moment where I said "That's too stupid." It only ever took a half step up to being more crazy. Just the next logical point.

> Haven't seen Shiki but I'll check it out also. 

I love it a lot. That's a show that does a slow pace well.

> Never heard of Noucome though. 

It's absolutely hysterical. Now that's something that got tears out of me.

> What would you give Hunter x Hunter?

I gave it a 1 but that's mostly out of spite from how much I hate CA and how much jerking off I see online about it. Realistically I might give it somewhere between 4-6.

Hunter's Exam is alright. Nothing to write home about but nothing I can get worked up over.

Zoldyck Family and Heaven's Arena are awful. They need to exist in some way (introduce Nen and the Zoldyck family), but I thought they were a pain to get through and were just boring. I'll give it some credit since they were very short.

York New City was pretty good. I don't think it was worth the 40 or so episodes to get there, but I did like it a fair amount.

Greed Island was alright. I didn't like that Ging starts the arc off saying it's filler and it did start to drag on after a while, but the dodgeball fight is easily my favorite in the series.

Never saw the 10 episodes after CA. CA killed any interest I had in the series.

I haven't been here for every thread, have you maybe expanded on this in the past? Because this is what, well, everyone sees as the show's greatest strength. I'd be very interested in hearing an opinion that's not just different from most, but the exact opposite.
>> ARTICLE
Yes I have expanded on the writing and characterization issues' I've had with the show in past posts, but I'll give you a bit more with regards to this last arc.

To look at this arc in particular the new characters of importance are Alluka and the Zodiacs. Alluka is given minimal character development, defined by nothing more than her (I'll use female pronouns because that seems to be Alluka's gender presentation) loneliness and fondness for Killua. Alluka really serves more as a plot device than anything else and adheres strongly to the imouto archetype. The Zodiacs are all very colorful (visually different and have their own personality quirks), but only two of them (other than Ging who has been previously introduced) are given enough screen time to be worth talking about. Pariston is sly and evil, full stop. I think it would be hard to write a character more archetypal than him without it coming across as parody. Cheadle is intellectual, prone to overthinking but cautious, but she does nothing in the arc but worry about what Pariston is doing, so she too never manages to escape an archetype. Now archetypal characters, are not necessarily a bad thing, in particular when they help fill the background, but they're really poor choices to build plots around.

The preexisting character who could have gotten more character development in the arc, include Leorio, Killua, Ging, Illumi and Hisoka. Hisoka continues to join whichever side allows him to get away with fighting strong people, not revealing any more about his past or any other way of deepening his character. Leorio reconfirms how strong his bonds of friendship are, something which he's done every arc he's appeared in. Illumi is evil for the sake of being evil and wanting to be powerful, it would have been really great if they did a better job of explaining why he feels that way but that didn't happen. Killua is shown to not only be strongly loyal to his friend, but also to Alluka which he conveniently didn't know about until he skipped over some character development by removing a needle form his head last arc (see what I mean about bad writing). It's a shame because the arc didn't try challenging either of those two loyalties. One of the ways I had thought of resolving Alluka's demands would be to kill her instead, but instead Killua uses the power of love. \*yawn\* As for Ging he at least lets the viewers known that he's not so evil as to want Pariston be chairman, but lazy enough that he doesn't really try to do anything about it. I do think it's a shame that Ging never addressed the elephant in the room, that abandoning your child so you can run off and have adventures is unpardonably selfish, but Gon isn't a realistic enough human to have daddy issues so no harm done.

So in summary, while some characters had some new pieces of information revealed about them, none of them really grew meaningfully or had deeper complexities revealed to the audience. Contrast this with the amount of characterization AnoHana had in 11 episodes.

Alright, I'm mostly with you on Alluka. She was mostly just a plot device, though like a lot of other things, I feel she's going to get more development if Togashi ever keeps writing. 

>The Zodiacs are all very colorful (visually different and have their own personality quirks), but only two of them (other than Ging who has been previously introduced) are given enough screen time to be worth talking about.

True, the others weren't ever supposed to be major characters in the arc. Just kind of a 'they exist, I may or may not do something with them in a future arc if I feel like it' from the writer. At this point though, it seems unlikely that that'll happen. There are already way too many more interest plots the story still hasn't wrapped up.

>Pariston is sly and evil, full stop. I think it would be hard to write a character more archetypal than him without it coming across as parody.

Why is he evil? I mean, yeah, no question he's sly as fuck, but it seems to me he just wants to fuck around and have fun. He really didn't do anything evil in the anime, though there were some undertones and rumors about it. And yeah, he was pretty archetypical, but he also sort of subverted that trope because his motivations were so bizarre and unclear. Most characters like him want something that's easy to define: power, money, fame, whatever. He doesn't give a fuck about that stuff. He got what he wanted and promptly resigned. What exactly did he get out of everything he did? Kicks. That's about it.

>Cheadle is intellectual, prone to overthinking but cautious, but she does nothing in the arc but worry about what Pariston is doing, so she too never manages to escape an archetype

I feel like you're using the term archetype pretty liberally here. In an story with only 14 episodes and over a dozen significant characters, it's hard for any one that's not already established to gain a lot of characterization. I thought for the amount of screen time she got, she gained a lot of personality. I found her relationship with Ging far more interesting than her interest in Pariston. She's another character I really hope gets expanded on in the future, and considering she's now the president of the Hunters Association, I might just get it.

>Hisoka continues to join whichever side allows him to get away with fighting strong people, not revealing any more about his past or any other way of deepening his character.

Maybe that will change if he becomes a primary character of an arc again instead of just a mildly important side one like he is in all but Heaven's Arena. And the HA arc did reveal a lot about his character.

>Leorio reconfirms how strong his bonds of friendship are, something which he's done every arc he's appeared in

Leorio is a very uninteresting character for the first few arcs he's in- this last one is really the only one where he gains any significance and relevance to the plot. But I really like him in this last one. Yeah, it's kind of cliche, but it's consistent with his character's personality, which is very much built on loyalty, trust, and friendship. 

>Illumi is evil for the sake of being evil and wanting to be powerful, it would have been really great if they did a better job of explaining why he feels that way but that didn't happen.

I wouldn't say his motivations are definitely just 'evil for the sake of evil' quite yet. We don't know exactly what they are- his enjoyment is probably one of them, but I feel like there's a deeper agenda there. 

>Killua is shown to not only be strongly loyal to his friend, but also to Alluka which he conveniently didn't know about until he skipped over some character development by removing a needle form his head last arc (see what I mean about bad writing).

Wait, do you mean he didn't know about Alluka before the needle? And we can discuss the needle too. Is it the best writing? No. I think we're both thinking that making it a psychological thing that Killua has to live with and could only overcome by years of effort would be more interesting, but that's just not the story the author wanted to convey. And to me, a story being logical is pretty high on my list of what constitutes good writing. A needle might be a stupid plot device, but given what we know about Illumi, it really does make perfect sense that he would do something like that to Killua. It's kind of boring and a cop out, but it makes sense. And to me, that makes it acceptable.

>It's a shame because the arc didn't try challenging either of those two loyalties

This isn't really a show for melodrama. Well, except for the end of the CA arc where there's a ton, but that's kind of the exception to the series. Killua has bigger problems to worry about than questioning whether he should really care so much about Gon or Alluka. Plus, and I've said this quite a bit, I imagine Killua will eventually have a arc like this regarding Gon. Gon isn't even close to the model of perfection Killua thinks he is, and eventually he's going to realize that. That moment could be what you're looking for.

>One of the ways I had thought of resolving Alluka's demands would be to kill her instead, but instead Killua uses the power of love

He actually uses the power of Deus Ex Machina, which is also one of the big things even hardcore fans of the series didn't really like. 

>As for Ging he at least lets the viewers known that he's not so evil as to want Pariston be chairman, but lazy enough that he doesn't really try to do anything about it. I do think it's a shame that Ging never addressed the elephant in the room, that abandoning your child so you can run off and have adventures is unpardonably selfish

That's Ging for ya.

>but Gon isn't a realistic enough human to have daddy issues so no harm done

And we already knew this. He was never mad at Ging. Though I find Gon to be the most realistic character in the series in some aspects, his views on family are definitely not normal. 


>> ARTICLE
He has some pretty good comments throughout the rewatch. Honestly you can't really blame him for anything. I agreed and disagreed with many things he said. Above all it's just interesting seeing this kind of viewpoint on the show.
>> ARTICLE
He has some good points about some things, but others I think he either didn't understand or is being far too harsh on. And for the comment I quoted him on, I honestly just don't see how that can be supported by evidence. 
>> ARTICLE
What do you think I didn't understand?
>> ARTICLE
Specifically, the motivations of Pariston and Illumi. For Pariston, his seem to be the same as Ging's- that is, to mess around and have a bit of fun in the election. That may not be a very interesting reason, but it's certainly not only 'for the evulz'. More like 'for the lulz'.

As for Illumi, I feel like we're going to find out more about his motivations later in the story if Togashi ever starts writing regularly again. At this point, it's clear he's pretty goddamn evil and likely enjoys doing evil tremendously, but I'm not so sure that's his only motivation. He's helping his family out with his actions for one, so that could be a potential motivation that you have to consider. 

And this isn't so much an issue with you not understanding, but a difference in opinion I guess. I personally loved the way Gon reacted the way he did toward meeting Ging. Had he reacted in any other way, it would've been so illogical out of character I would've hated Togashi for making it that way. The beauty of a character like Gon being put in these situations is that it's fresh and original. With 99% of characters put in this situation, you're going to get one of three reactions: a lot of apathy, a lot of emotional hatred and sadness, or a lot of emotional forgiveness. But not our MC. Gon doesn't really forgive Ging because I don't think he ever blamed him for leaving him in the first place. He's just so ecstatic that he finally met him and harbors no resentment at all, it's bizarre. And I love it.
>> ARTICLE
> That may not be a very interesting reason, but it's certainly not only 'for the evulz'. More like 'for the lulz'.

That's implicit in the definition of the term, at least as I use it.

> As for Illumi, I feel like we're going to find out more about his motivations later in the story if Togashi ever starts writing regularly again. ... He's helping his family out with his actions for one, so that could be a potential motivation that you have to consider. 

Perhaps, but that doesn't improve the current arc. The latter claim is hard to believe since he's actively working against the family butlers, but even if it is supposed to be true, that he thinks he's helping the family by doing what he's doing, I don't think we've been given sufficient reason to believe it.

> Had he reacted in any other way, it would've been so illogical out of character I would've hated Togashi for making it that way.

I agree that it would have been out of character for Gon to immediately ask his father why he abandoned him, but it would have been interesting to see Gon offhandedly ask Ging, moreover I think Ging could have reacted differently. Perhaps get wracked by guilt as soon as he saw Gon, it's much harder to ignore the misdeeds you've done when you're looking at the person you've wronged.

> The beauty of a character like Gon being put in these situations is that it's fresh and original. ... He's just so ecstatic that he finally met him and harbors no resentment at all, it's bizarre. And I love it.

I agree that Gon is certainly a unique character, but at the cost of being entirely unbelievable. I have never met anyone remotely like Gon, no one is that optimistic, no one is that stubborn, no one is that forgiving and outside of psychopaths I doubt anyone is as amoral as Gon. If you enjoy his character then that's good I guess, happiness is a good thing after all, but I don't think I'll ever be able to.
>> ARTICLE
>That's implicit in the definition of the term, at least as I use it.

Then I don't really see what's wrong with it. He wasn't even really doing anything bad and it was just for fun. Yeah, that motivation isn't as nuanced or mature as some of the other ones, but it's still pretty interesting. You don't see many characters with that as the main source of their actions.

>The latter claim is hard to believe since he's actively working against the family butlers, but even if it is supposed to be true, that he thinks he's helping the family by doing what he's doing, I don't think we've been given sufficient reason to believe it.

Yeah, it's just a theory. We really don't know what his motivations are at this point.

>Ging could have reacted differently. Perhaps get wracked by guilt as soon as he saw Gon, it's much harder to ignore the misdeeds you've done when you're looking at the person you've wronged.

That's true, that would've been interesting. But I think that's also the reason Gon didn't ask. He wants to talk to Ging about stuff that matters to him, he doesn't want it to be an awkward thing. To him, talking to Ging about his past adventures is far more rewarding than hearing him stammering on about something he really doesn't give a fuck about. 

>I agree that Gon is certainly a unique character, but at the cost of being entirely unbelievable. 

And? Does a character really have to be believable for them to be good? You'd fucking hate Gurren Lagann.

>I have never met anyone remotely like Gon, no one is that optimistic, no one is that stubborn, no one is that forgiving

Yeah, it's clear that Gon is a very strange person. But there are some people who are pretty much always optimistic and there are some people who are stubborn enough to literally kill themselves before surrendering. Not many, but some. 

>and outside of psychopaths I doubt anyone is as amoral as Gon.

He's about as amoral as the average person. He's not actually amoral, he doesn't really have a hard, set moral code at all. He just kind of does whatever feels right to him, and let's be honest- that's kind of what we all do. We let our feelings get the better of us, sometimes we forgive people we shouldn't, sometimes we get irrationally angry and don't realize what's most important to us until it's too late. 

To add to that, Gon's a kid. Most kids don't have either the life experience or knowledge to think intelligently about things like philosophy or the consequences of their actions. Gon is pretty much a legal adult because of his Hunter license, but he's still only 12-14 years old. He should not be held accountable for his actions because his actions are coming from a mind that's not even close to being fully developed.

I feel you brah, i started watching this series because of the rewatch but couldn't stop busting past the 5 episode limit in the first week.... At episode 7x now (somewhere on greed island). 

I more or less stay away from these battle shounen type animes nowadays cos they tend to degenerate into stupid power creep and deus ex machinas after a while, but HxH may be the best example of how to do a battle shounen right that I've ever watched. I really enjoy the thought that is put into each fight, the explanations, and the system which governs the fighting skills.

I think naruto did it better up till the chuunin exam, and bleach had a more compelling and interesting supporting cast (basically every single captain) up till the soul society arc, but both those series turned into nonsense after that _

I can't really comment on if or how that contrasts most battle-shounen because I haven't watched much of it.

Hopefully the show will eventually try treating its themes and characters more maturely.

The purpose of showing them as different hybrid creatures was to show what made them CHIMERA ants. They're not just giant monster ants. You complain about making it cheap, but it sounds to me like your idea would make it even more cheap and simplistic. Instead of the creative species that Togashi came up with, you just want an army of giant invading insects with nothing more to it than that. The whole concept of the Chimera Ant species was not only creative, but was masterfully used to develop psychological and moral perspectives that would have been otherwise impossible to create realistically. Especially with just an army of invading ants.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously do not even begin to understand how that reason would keep someone from enjoying the arc as a whole. Sure I wasn't on board with the ant concept and most of the design choices because it felt completely out of place for me at first but that's such a minor factor in the grand sheme that I find it beyond silly to dismiss the whole arc because of it. Also, your explanation leads me to believe that you didn't really understand the ants' origin. Well, part of that, I'll atribute to the fact that you did not finish the series and that you aren't caught up with the manga but some things you say don't add up and are simply untrue. I can't really elaborate since I'm on mobile and can't do spoilers but could you explain again what your problem with the ant's origin is? I feel like I either completely misunderstand what you're trying to say or you just suck at explaining.
>> ARTICLE
I think that was only part of the reason I disliked the arc.. There are many others than my belief that the origin of the "ants" is ridiculous. Since you want a summary:

 1. The arc was too long nearly 150 chapters and what 50+ episodes many of them what I would call filler. 

2. The art style was very different from other arcs such as new york or greed island. The manga was drawn very poorly during this period. 

3. For some reason the characters that many of the fans liked were sidelined for most of this arc. Where was kurprika? I would have loved to see more of Zoldycks. Why wouldn't the zodiack help netero and so on.

4. This was also the arc where the author was in constant hiatus and I truly feel this impacted the quality of what was written.

5. Endless dialogue episodes and no real conclusions. I would preferred less chatting and more conclusions.

6. All of the ant's being written abilities based on another animal even though supposedly being some form of ant. Cheetah speed, octopus ink, the wolfs sense of smell so on.  This also falls under the category "I just hate the ant concept" 

7. Finally power scaling. This was the first time I felt the series fell into the shounen trap of needing to come up with vastly overpowered characters to define growth. I enjoy the themes of Netero working for what he achieved and also having an innate ability however these ants just magically were better than the top percentage of hunters. 

Generally I know people will not agree with me but I will continue to state this was my favorite anime right up into this arc and would have happily watched more even after it. I simply wish they show didn't end after what I consider the weakest main story arc in the entire series. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
1. I was talking about both anime and manga, and there is 0 argument on the manga side this is where the series was drawn poorly.

2. I loved all of the arcs with the CA exception including GI it still followed the main theme of Gon trying to find his father which sidelined like crazy in the CA arc. 

3. In your opinion but manga readers saw a decline here that was reflected in the anime. As the authors priorities had understandably shifted to his health over the series. 

4. They needed to reach the conclusion faster is the only point meant. 
5. 
6. Genetics don't change instantly and innate skill doesn't always = actual experience.  It's also amazing they popped out fully grown, developed, experienced, and amazing overpowered. 

And no they didn't do anything better than other arc's GI was pure fantasy, the Hunter X Hunter exams were unexpected and eventful, and the YN was simply amazing with a gritty realistic sort of feel with amazing battles and is by far the best for pure content and pacing. 

You don't have to take me seriously and as I said I know that people will not agree but I feel the same way when people say that the CA arc was the best in the series I automatically assume either we have different tastes and agree to disagree or simply that they are wrong which I GENERALLY keep to myself.

The difference is I won't jump down your throat for stating you disliked YN or GI.  Your clearly not asking for why I dislike CA to understand but looking to argue why you think I'm wrong. 

Arguing about a preference for those reasons is simply asinine. 
>> ARTICLE
Question.  Is the pacing that bad in the manga, or did they realize that they were going to catch up and stretched the arc?  Because my main difficulty with it was that the episodes started to suddenly be 50% narration, which was a major divergence from the earlier methods of exposition used and honestly seemed like a lazy downgrade.

the pacing is better in the manga because manga and anime are inherently different. hxh has lots of dialogue and in some cases it just doesn't translate to anime that well while you don't really mind it in written form. 
>> ARTICLE
So why did they cut out the dialogue for narration?  That's totally a step backwards.  If you can say it with character dialogue you should *never* do it using narration.
>> ARTICLE
Imo dialogue wouldn't have made alot of sense in most cases were I remember heavy naration. why would the characters be talking to each other or themselves during the battles. Not to mention most of the invasion part happened during only a few seconds. I'd rather have naration than inner monologues.
>> ARTICLE
I just don't think most of the narration was necessary.  If you can't get your characters' reasoning across with their actions, dialogue, and  sparse internal thoughts, it's just lazy writing.  And if it was just to stretch out those "few seconds", that's honestly even worse to me.

Episode 135 has probably the worst use of an episode preview of all-time. I'm sitting there bawling my eyes out to a beautiful episode ending and then suddenly ... [BADA DA DA DADADADADADADA DAAAA DAADADAAAAAA..](https://youtube.com/watch?v=pOBppjlkXGc). Way to kill the moment Madhouse xD
>> ARTICLE
At the time, that was pretty much the sentiment of everyone in the discussion threads. Surely when they watched the final product, someone in the production schedule should've realised how jarring that change in tone was?!
>> ARTICLE
I believe that when it aired on television the screen went to white and then commercials played. After the commercials ended it came back with the preview.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 135 is probably one of my favorite episodes all time, and one of the only moments to really make me cry. Both times I've watched it. 

The amount of character development Meruem goes through to reach this point is insane, in perfect contrast to the dehumanisation of Gon we saw last time.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks to you now I'm balling my eyes out. Great ep
>> ARTICLE
I get what you're saying, but I don't think *dehumanisation* is the right word. The whole point of the confrontation between Netero and Meruem was that malice and spite are some of the most human characteristics there are.
>> ARTICLE
Such a beautiful conclusion to the arc.  No "final battle", no asspulls to actually beat Meruem - those weren't necessary.  Instead, we get perhaps the best developed character of all time reaching the pinnacle of his development, and realizing the beauty of humanity.  I can't believe that someone who originally seemed like such a generic, inhuman villain ended up being perhaps the most "human" character in the arc.  Komugi was the perfect foil for him, and this was the perfect conclusion to his character arc.
>> ARTICLE
Also interesting seeing how humans dealt with the problem. It says a fair amount about humanity.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, the humans are probably the bad guys in the second half of the arc.  Think about it.  In Meruem vs Netero, you basically had Meruem pleading with Netero to not fight, and Netero was the belligerent one who wouldn't listen to reason
>> ARTICLE
His reasoning wasn't good enough yet. While meruem was becoming more humane he still intended to do some terrible things. I will sgree that netero had no intentions of negotiation though because he enjoyed the fight.
>> ARTICLE
But in Netero's eyes wasn't he fighting for the survival of the human race? Not for him to just allow them to live in a certain area. 
>> ARTICLE
But it makes sense to insist on fighting. The Chimera ants would had continued to kill humans, right? Its you or them. 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, Meruem was saying that he would protect humans and seemed to be the one who wanted to negotiate peacefully.  I feel like the whole arc was showing how the ants were exactly like humand - its just that humans were now experiencing it from the bottom end of the food chain, where they are the ones being dominated.  His quote about "do you listen to animals pleas before you kill them" comes to mind.
>> ARTICLE
I guess its because he is probably the incarnate of that gang leader they gave the whole back story on
>> ARTICLE
He still was going to kill a ton of humans.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished HxH a while ago and it took me a bit to realize the hero of the show never met the villain of this arc at all :o

Just recently finished it aswell. I really expected Gon and Meruem to have some epic fight at some point.

They never had a real meet or anything. But Gon did look at Meruem.

*Above: My reactions transcribed, as authentically as one can hope in a subjective manner, because my usual vocabulary and critical-analysis simply does not capture how much I adore this couple.*

The final moments of Meruem and Komugi is my favorite scene from the manga, as well as any manga. In case you cannot tell, I'm not completely happy with Madhouse's choices here, but make no mistake, I am still deeply grateful to see it adapted to this extent.

Here's to Komugi X Meruem, the only One True Pairing anyone should ever need! :)


>> ARTICLE
I recently finished this Arc two weeks ago, I cried like a baby for a couple hours, then I found this and posted in on /r/HunterXHunter . It makes the whole Gungi game much more meaningful:

Kokoriko is an advanced Gungi technique developed by Komugi that centers around isolating the King (as in the Gungi piece, not the Chimera Ant), separating it from the other pieces and killing it off. Just like Netero and the Hunters were planning to do to Meruem. However, Komugi unexpectedly develops a counter to this technique in the middle of a game, meaning that the King piece (representing Meruem) no longer has to die (since he unexpectedly survived the nuke). Then, later on, when Komugi uses Kokoriko again, she actually develops a counter to the counter ("she reversed my reversal???"), representing that the King piece (Meruem) apparently actually does have to die after all (because of the Rose's poison). However, immediately after beating Meruem using Kokoriko (symbolizing his imminent death), Komugi and Meruem start one final game together, a game that they never finish. 1-5-1 Black King -> 9-5-1 White Lieutenant General, I believe, or something to that extent. Immediately afterwards, they die together, leaving on the board Meruem's one black piece and Komugi's single white piece, together in Gungi forever. This represents that the two were always united through Gungi, and will continue to be together even after death, undisturbed and united for all eternity. Meruem places his piece down, symbolizing his death, and then Komugi responds by placing her piece down next to his, showing that she is perfectly willing to die at his side..
The black screen/black panels in the manga show that the Rose's poison has made Meruem go blind. That's why he has to keep asking Komugi if she's still there, because he can't see her anymore. This is ironic because his name means "the light that illuminates/shines upon all". He even got some godlike light-related photon-based powers before his death, allowing him to fulfill his name. In addition, as they are playing in the bunker before their deaths, Meruem sees a blinding light radiating from Komugi as she "reverses his reversal", making her "the light that illuminates even the all-powerful light". Despite being far weaker (and blind to boot), her light shined far brighter than his. Then, as he dies, Komugi holds him and feels his head, allowing her to finally "see" or know what his face is like. Thus, as they die, Meruem joins Komugi in blindness as she joins him in death. Meruem can finally see what Komugi has been seeing all along, and knows what it feels like to be blind like her, and Komugi finally knows his face, allowing each to understand the other more as they fade away (the OST used during their death scene is called "Understanding"). Touching, isn't it? Togashi is a mastermind, and this entire story, especially this arc, is a masterpiece, a beautiful work of art, a canvas depicting love, hatred, innocence, corruption, happiness, suffering, loyalty, betrayal, anger, sadness, life, death, malevolence, destruction, resolve, determination, avarice, sacrifice, "true" power, truth, and understanding.

Oh god damn you Meruem you are the best villain i will ever lay my eyes on. I love this show way too much  
  
''Kumogi you still there?''

This is just brutal, and 136 is even worse.

Same here. Everyone warned me about this arc and it still felt like someone was ripping my heart out.

Very sad episodes.  Meruem and Komugi are heartwarming.  I was glad that Meruem [mentioned](http://i.imgur.com/gzSicpw.jpg) the Royal Guard one last time.  He'll be [seeing them all again soon ;_;](http://i.imgur.com/Vi7vXPG.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Hahahaha there is no way Pitou is going to heaven.
>> ARTICLE
She wasn't a bad person if you take her viewpoint... Granted we don't have that much, we have just enough to understand why she's doing what she's doing. 

Remember she's an insect at heart, she just happens to be... A mixture of animals and insects with a human form. 
>> ARTICLE
No one is a bad person to themselves because bad is a relative term. But from the perspective of basically anyone who's human, or even just has a bit of humanity at all, she's fucking monstrous. She kills and eats people and enjoys it. She's sapient and more human than anything else from the looks of it, so I'd say she deserves to be judged for her actions in pretty much the same way as most other people. And Meruem (along with numerous other Chimera Ants) showed it's possible for the ants to demonstrate benevolent human qualities and cooperate with humanity, giving more credence to that fact. 

Saying that, I don't blame her for being bad. She didn't have any epiphany like Meruem did, she wasn't born with the mind of a small innocent human child, she lived her entire life believing the Chimera Ants to be far above humanity. But I do think she absolutely had to be stopped. In a perfect world, Meruem would've calmed her the fuck down and taught her a bit of his newly gained philosophy to give her some perspective, but since that wasn't going to happen, her death was the next best thing.
>> ARTICLE
Pitou cannot be judged on human morality, because at the end of the day Pitou isn't human. Even if Pitou has human genes, her brain is not that of a human's. It is that of a Royal Guard Chimera Ant. True Pitou is sapient, but in the broadest scheme of things sapient does not equal human. 

For example, all Komodo dragons are essentially cannibalistic infant killers. If you were to make them sapient, but retain those instincts I still wouldn't consider it fair to judge them for their cannibalistic behavior on a human moral scale. Human morality is a construct created by ourselves that goes in line with our own species' instincts and the way our brains are constructed. We value synergy and keeping one another healthy, but only because we are social creatures that have developed an inherent value for such things. To other creatures in other situations, synergy might lead to their own species's demise. A good example of this would be Meruem who in the end went against his species's prerogative. In that way Meruem could be labeled as amoral.

However, that isn't to say that the statement of her needing to be stopped is false. From the human perspective Pitou absolutely needed to die for many reasons and most of those reasons are justifiable. Alternatively every action that Pitou made has justifiable reason to it as well. Human morality is not an inherent law of the world and its denizens. It applies only to a single species in a wider universe of millions.
>> ARTICLE
So war mongers (read: Netero, Gon and Pitou) make it so the peaceful (read: Meruem, Ikalgo and Knuckle) are forced to kill and nukes are bad (even if they're arguably good at solving problems). Honestly, I can't help but say I'm disappointed by the themes of the arc's ending, it never managed to finished addressing the bigger elephant in the room of if the King's fascism was justified (yes, he realized that lesser beings could be of value, but he never accepted that they should be free from his rule). Unfortunately the ending was also horribly anti-climatic, which almost worked to make it sombre, except it was focusing on the dying king who unfortunately never managed to break out of his archetype (supreme being questioning his role in the world), and a plot device masquerading as a character, instead of our main characters' regrets. Gon could have actually had character growth! Above all else it just feels like the show should be over, but this ending really didn't bring much closure to its living cast, and apparently Hunter x Hunter prints money, so the show must go on. I'm not expecting much of anything out of the anime's final arc, hopefully it will at least close of some of the holes in the setting.

Nen is possibly the best power system I have seen in an anime, it has almost limitless potential for different types of powers and yet makes for some pretty awesome visuals, I envy those of you that have not seen where this is going yet! Nen is awesome.
>> ARTICLE
It's a good system. The only problem with it is that it needed such a big infodump before you could even begin to understand it.
>> ARTICLE
So, kind of like real world physics?
>> ARTICLE
Probably my favorite shounen power.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was thinking that this was ingenious system! I really like this universe. Also, that part that nen specialities are linked to personality traits... I think this is going to play an important role some time or another!
>> ARTICLE
SCHWING!
>> ARTICLE
Whoa that fight between hisoka and gon was so intense! Also, *shwing*! I don't understand, why is he so eager to murder Gon and deriving pleasure from the thought of almost killing him. I'm really curious about his character!
>> ARTICLE
Hisoka is kind of like Gon in that he gets very, very excited when he's fighting for his life. He wants Gon to becomes stronger because he recognizes Gon's potential and wants a worthy opponent to kill later on. You get to see more of him later.
>> ARTICLE
Hisoka derives sexual pleasure from fighting and killing strong opponents. Not just any old strong opponents though; the absolute best of the best. He sees immense potential in Gon and fantasizes about how thrilling it would be to fight him once he ascends to that potential. So Hisoka actually isn't eager to kill Gon. He's doing everything in his power to resist the urge to kill Gon right now so that Gon can continue to grow and he can have a more pleasurable fight later. 
>> ARTICLE
Perfect explanation.
>> ARTICLE
I'd be surprised if people still remember this part, they're so far ahead. 
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, I also wanted to point out that Gon has only won one fight against competent opponents so far. He technically got Hanzo to concede, but he got his ass whooped pretty hard and didn't even have an opportunity to fight back.
>> ARTICLE
Also, when he deffended shitzu (?), he was so loyal to him! It was heartwarming to see how caring he is for his friends. 
>> ARTICLE
That really was one of the most satisfying punches I've seen in an anime. (Though not my favorite single 'punch' in the series)  When gon lands that hit, you KNOW he earned it.  That didn't come easy.

Guardian Enzo mentioned something around this part saying "why do I get the feeling this series has only just begun", and you get a deep sense why that's true as you learn more about nen.

This series was really excellent *before* the ant arc too, which sometimes is a bit swept under the rug by those looking only for the 'artsy' elements.  The ant arc might be my favorite, but just by a hair. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't find the punches in this anime very satisfying at all, none of them have yet to be very visceral. In contrast the punches in the Monogatari and RAINBOW evoke the proper sense of bone crunching pain and animalistic power (though I'm sure One Punch Man will demonstrate punches that make everything else pale in contrast). All the violence in the show has come across as very cartoonish for lack of a better word, except when Kilua is fighting seriously in which case the edginess meter is cranked up to 11. I feel the reason that you get the feeling that things are only starting is because the first arc effectively spent the whole time hyping hunters and their adventures and the second arc consisted of hyping nen-users and their conflicts, while neither really contributed to the story very much. After so much setup something bigger *has* to happen, and given the shows' episode count that something could be a very large story.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not really sure what you want from a 'visceral' punch.  The sound?  The 'this is the strongest punch ever' type effects?  Perhaps for one punch man that certainly makes sense, as it is the premise, but by 'satisfying' I tend to mean 'the payoff for massive amounts of effort'.  They're satisfying because no punch comes very freely or easily.  You have to work for the damage you inflict.  At least, you do as the underdog.

I prefer that to everything comes easy, especially with characters who are already 'incredibly talented'. 
>> ARTICLE
Sound effects would certainly help make punches satisfying, but I'm more so thinking of injuries such as bones snapping, organs rupturing and skulls concussing. That sort of debilitating pay off has been very absent from the show, instead the characters just go flying smash through some rocks and come out looking mildly bruised and sometimes bloodied. When I was young I was bullied violently a fair amount until I learned how to punch people in the kidneys so that they would pee blood for the next few days, that was satisfying.
>> ARTICLE
Nen acts as a sort of shield when used even semi-professional, only REALLY powerful attacks will produce that sort of damage.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, well in that case you just might be a bit more interested in how the 1999 series was constructed.

Although I still say the ant arc and yorkshin had plenty of pretty bold carnage even in the 2011 version.
>> ARTICLE
It was simply mindblowing the first time I witnessed the nen - system. Nice ability chart, btw!
>> ARTICLE
* The story kind of splits away from two of the four main characters in a weird way. I hope Crap-ika and Leorio don't get the Krillin treatment in this series and just get left behind with the introduction of a new power.

* Did anyone else stop episode 32 to simplify Hisoka's equation? Nope? Okay then.

* I'm really growing to love Hisoka as an antagonist. If you can even call him that. So far he's only helped the main characters every step of the way, including making sure Gon and Killua don't go through the Nen-initaion on the 200th floor. I almost wonder if he wants to help Kurapika take down the spiders by pretending to be one.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I definitely hope we see Kupira and Leorio back into the main cast soon.

What? Do you not like Kurapika? What is wrong with you? Well, I guess the rewatch is still in the Heaven's Arena.

[L-lewd!](http://puu.sh/i6JPn/52efd4db25.jpg)

I am really loving the concept of Nen so far and can't wait to see it be further explained and expanded to be used in more unique ways. I always heard how well thought out of a power it was compared to the typical shounen stuff and it's defnitely living up to the hype after seeing it in action. 

I feel pretty bad for Zushi and I would hate to be in his shoes. He trains so hard and is easily surpassed by Gon and Kilua who seem to hardly break a sweat while learning about Nen.

Seems all the guys are learning it thus far with the exception of Leorio, though I guess his role will probably continue to be primarily a comic relief character. Regardless I really hope to see him and Kurapika back into the main story and not become sideline characters.

Also gotta make note that apparently Hisoka himself is also hunting the Phantom spider guys. Looking forward to see how his role interwines together with Kurapika in the future.
>> ARTICLE
You're going to enjoy the next arc a lot. You get to see way more Nen and more characters you like. Also it's the turning point where the story gets significantly better.
>> ARTICLE
And so we come to the Heavens Arena, and leave just as soon afterwards.

The traditional "tournament arc" is definitely a staple of the Shonen genre in general, but never is Heavens arena really treated as something the characters suddenly feel the need to devote themselves to. This is most seen when the receptionist attempts to set up the  Floor Masters as major adversaries within the narrative, only for Gon and Killua to lose interest half-way through her speech.

The biggest contribution this arc provides is the introduction of the Nen system. And with this comes long scenes of exposition, that manages told hold to viewers interest, but not exactly break any new ground. When i first viewed these episodes, i considered the Nen system decently thought out, but not all that exciting.

Thankfully the battle with Hisoka and Kastro shows the unique ways the Nen ability's play into the fights, Hisoka defeating Kastro, not by brute force, but the clever usage of his Bungee gum technique to overcome Kastro and his clone.   

The battle with Gon and Hisoka is a satisfying conclusion to the arc. Showing how much Gon has grown, while still having quite a ways to go to reach the level of his distant rival.  

As a whole, for an arc that mainly serves to introduce mechanics which the show's later story arcs will rely on, Heavens arena still manages to tell a decently compelling story to tide us over until the next arc.

Next week is the start of the Yorknew arc, and the point where a competent and promising Shonen, becomes something truly special.

Man it was hard forcing myself through so many episodes this week. Nen is so far a very boring and standard power system, but it's possible they'll improve on it. It was particularly disappointing to see a training arc immediately following a testing arc, this anime needs more of a story. The fight scene with Gon against Hisoka was really fluidly animated and as such is probably the high point of the series thus far. The show has yet to have a fight scene that has had any real emotional weight behind it, it has been way too obvious who would win every fight as of yet. However unfortunately the show still has nothing going for it in terms of characters (a particular weakness as of yet), plot, setting, themes or comedy. I'm curious as to how people justify rating this show so highly when the first quarter (and perhaps more I haven't seen the rest yet) was garbage. I've invested enough time in this show that I might as well start the next arc on the belief that it could be "when the show gets good".
>> ARTICLE
The next arc is arguably the best, but if you don't like the characters and the setting the show might not be for you. You can always tell who will win fights, but that's the case for every anime.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't agree that you can always tell who will win fights in anime, LotGH and GITS come to mind as strong counter examples. As for the setting I've just been disappointed by how under-thought it feels,  for example the technology in the show seems mishmashed together to allow for easy writing, but ignoring the logical consequences of differing technologies such as computers and architecture capable of creating tall buildings, the show has on numerous occasions shown people without nen to be able to take impossible degrees of punishment without dying and socioeconomic consequences of the hunters association simply does not make sense in a world that still has separate nation states.
>> ARTICLE
I guess we just have different tastes then. I'm more of a bigger picture kind of guy so I can look past some inconsistencies as long as they're not important to the story (LotGH is a good counterexample of this where everything you see and hear has some significance).
>> ARTICLE
What makes Nen boring to me? IMO it seems very interesting and probably one of the best power systems I've seen in a shounen series thus far.
>> ARTICLE
This show is another spontaneous hit and miss show IMO. I loved this show a lot through my first run but I'm actually confused as to why I find it so cheesy and generic while I'm re-watching it now. At least the next arc coming up is something actually serious and I can enjoy regardless. Still love the show as a whole.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually the exact opposite. I started watching this with a friend and we struggled through the first 30 episodes for a month. It wasn't really boring, it was just not so engaging as we thought, just mildly interesting. 

So for that reason my friend stopped watching just as the Yorknew City arc began. Imagine when I told him a week later that it was one of the most interesting shounen I've ever seen; and the anime was still halfway of the Chimera Ant arc. So I haven't even reached the juice of it.

Anyway, with this rewatch I found the first 30 episodes a bit more interesting than my first. I'm not sure why exactly, but I think it's because it gives me a sort of nostalgic felling.
>> ARTICLE
In order:

* JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency)

* Natsume Yuujinchou 

* Mushishi 


>> ARTICLE
> Natsume Yuujinchou

Yes!
>> ARTICLE
I was gonna start Mushishi soon, was it that good?
>> ARTICLE
It's very relaxing and slow with incredibly drawn backdrops and one of the best soundtracks of any anime. Ginko plays both detective and naturalist as he solves the afflictions caused by spiritual creatures called Mushi. It's often very philosophically minded and every episode plays out like a Japanese folktale. Unfortunately, not every episode ends happy, and most end bittersweetly. Since, you don't mind slice of life according to your MAL, I would definitely give this a shot and Natsume Yuuhinchou as well since it has a similar feel.
>> ARTICLE
I also want to add to this. On top of the amazing soundtrack and the atmosphere the anime presents, the voice acting is also very refreshing for me. It feels more raw compared to other modern animes, as in it doesn't feel like acting, but how people actually converse. 
>> ARTICLE
Cool, I think I'll give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
That's obviously a question of taste, Mushishi is a highly episodic show and not everyone enjoys that. I love the atmosphere and the mystery aspect, it's like House with alien diseases in edo era Japan. Nearly every episode is great and the whole thing's fully adapted, so yeah, I think it deserves the praise it gets.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, thanks.

Its like watching a painting come to life....

Really?  It is pretty accepted to be one of the best,  if not best romance out there.  The ending isn't great but that happens when the author gets sick and had to leave it unfinished.  
>> ARTICLE
I don't know; I found the romance in a lot of other anime; such as White Album 2, Toradora, etc. to be more appealing.
I went on a spree last month watching all music-related anime; Beck, White Album 2, K-On!!!, Sakamichi no Apollon, etc.
Nana was the biggest letdown out of all of them; the constant depressing commentary at the end of each episode ended up leading to absolutely nothing it felt.
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree. Honestly, it's the first I've heard anyone call Nana the best romance out there. I kinda thought of it more as one of those teen drama television series so I just couldn't enjoy that much. Out of curiousity, how did the manga end? I don't mind the spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
You thought Nana, a show that had actual problems between adults come up was more of a teen drama then WA2 (which I also gave a 10) and toradora?
>> ARTICLE
> Cross Game

People should seriously at least watch the first episode. Probably the best sports anime out there right now.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say Hajime no Ippo or Haikyuu are better *sport* shows. Cross Game is a show that uses the sport genre as a basis to build an amazing slice of life romance show with sides of both comedy & drama, accompanied by excellent character focus & development that make 50 episodes go by like nothing.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game doesnt really emphasize the sport so much though. I think its really the romance that makes people remember it.
>> ARTICLE
Best sports? You are selling series short. 

I would go with best SoL or best comedy.

Good list, Cross Game is awesome. Never watched Kids on a Slope, but looks good.

- Parasyte

- Steins;Gate
>> ARTICLE
I would've given Parasyte a 10 if it weren't for the last three or so episodes.
>> ARTICLE
What was wrong with them?
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler] (/s "I'm gonna guess it was the whole preaching thing. How humans are actually the real monsters who destroy the environment and this planet, blah blah blah.")
>> ARTICLE
I guess, but what anime _doesn't_ work that kind of stuff in? It may have been a little superfluous, but I didn't think it detracted from the overall quality of those episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
While it might be true that other anime have done that (though I can't think of any right now), it felt really forced in this particular case. The author even went as far as [Spoiler](/s "having the "last boss" die because of some random toxin/poison the MC happened to hit him with to run his point across.") I believe it was overall unnecessary
>> ARTICLE
I suppose that's fair. I didn't let it get to me because I was infatuated by the series as a whole, but looking back it is a little forced. It never really explained how all that junk got there in the first place... Not properly, anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I'm in the same boat as /u/MeesterMan00. I gave the series a 9/10 but it might have gotten a 10 if not for that whole thing.
>> ARTICLE
 I think HxH did the preaching thing best.
>> ARTICLE
I found them an awesome wrap up. Set the final tone and reinforced that the show was always a metaphor to Humans being parasytes to earth. 9/10 for me tho

Welcome to the NHK. Never had an anime give me so many emotions before.

And depression, lots of depression.

It's my latest 10. Went into it thinking it was gonna be your typical romantic comedy. oh boy was i wrong there.
>> ARTICLE
Its small scale, so its hard to give it a 10/10 next to stuff like FMA:B, but it hits on a really personal level, which helps it transcend its humble scale.

For me, I care more about characters than scale (some favorites are ping pong and tatami galaxy) and if I can relate to them. To be fair though I haven't watched FMA: B yet though so I should get to that lol.

They're all really good imo.

* Texhnolyze

* Spice and wolf (both seasons)
* Mushishi
* Shinsekai yori
* Clannad: after story
>> ARTICLE
Props for Texhnolyze and Shinsekai Yori, they're both incredible.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I just love how shinsekai yori ties up all of the loose ends and the style of storytelling (the way it shows more than it tells) of Texhnolyze is just incredible.
>> ARTICLE
I just don't get the works of that director (talkin about Technolyze here. Shinsekai is easily of the my favourite animes aswell). He hit it big with Lain but then went off trying to make the same impact with Texh and Haibane but to me he failed hard at it. 

For example in Texh i get the whole desperation for mankind as a dying race thing but most episodes are just things happening without any logic behind them, or I should say I haven't found one.

Or the whole trip to the surface thing. I get that he's trying to convey something but he's staying too much generic and abstract almost like he banked on people to theorycraft but the base for it is so vague that everything you say can be considered right and I HATE with a passion this feeling of getting played by the author or the whole open to interpretation thing.

I'd love if you can help me by explaining why it was so good for you.

I hope you understand that's not my intention to troll but I'm seriously trying to understand this anime and I watched it some time ago so I might not remember everything perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
To me, it's the vague way of storytelling that gets me. Because it doesn't say all that much, and tries to show you what's going. This leaves some room to try and figure out yourself what is actually happening, I like doing that.

I personally didn't have any probleems with things happening without logic, that is not to say that there weren't any illogical events. I'm sticking to main storyline here when I'm saying that I did not find to many illogical things in the series.

I'm also a huge sucker for anime which display  a strong sense of despair and/or have "dark" stories. And this one certainly has plenty of that kinda stuff.

But as with all shows, personnal preferences and taste play a huge role in liking a show or not.

I think the main reason you didn't like the show is because you don't like the "open to interpretation" theme, which is absolutely fine ofcourse. It's just that that one thing you aren't a fan of makes up about half of the show. And since I tend to like this "open to interpretation" thing, I loved the show.

>> ARTICLE
Can you write me a bit of why the 10 on White Album 2? I'm not a big fan of romances, but I still enjoy some of them, toradora being one my 10. But this anime was very boring, I was watching it as a chore to see why were people so hyped up for the end. I couldn't even stand the MC
>> ARTICLE
Firstly, White Album 2's anime adaptation only covers the first VN - Introductory Chapter. It is a prequel and setup to the main story of Closing Chapter/Coda VN. I'm not sure whether to recommend you to read the summary of it or not since you didn't like IC, [but here it is because my post will contain minor Coda spoilers as well.](http://mdzanime.me/2013/12/29/white-album-2-concluding-chapter-coda-rough-summary/)

Things like art & OST were amazing to me. I loved the soundtrack, with these being some of favorites:

* [White Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdwng6aLa0Q)
* [After All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRw1M4htfN4)
* [Sayonara no Koto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXSmnBSdwz4) 
* [Todokanai Koi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z4DZ_s7roc) 
* [Twinkle Snow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4HDTtWQr6A)
* [Yasashi Uso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5ThMw9gEg8)

The inserts in the anime were also beautifully done, as well as a remix of Closing playing at the end of Episode 2 when that song is actually used during [Coda](/s "the end of True Kazusa.") The lyrics also play an important role, and give more meaning to the series. Todokanai Koi and Powder Snow (Coda song) especially.

I found the characters very realistic compared to other anime, and the romance and [WA2](/s "love triangle were well-done.") 

Yes Haruki is a dick, but it really is meant to be shown that way in IC as it's just his high-school self he doesn't have much experience at all. I personally find him better in CC/Coda. 

Setsuna's character seems very bland and average at first, but as you go deeper into the series you see her [WA2](/s "manipulating personality, like for example during the series taking Haruki first while she is completely aware of Kazusa's feelings.") Read the Coda summary, and then Setsuna's personality extra article at the end to see what I'm mentioning here in a lot more depth. 

Kazusa is just a fantastic character to me, and I view her as a deconstruction of kuudere. She is my #3 best girl after all. There's a lot I could write here, but I don't want to take away too much time from my Gintama watching.


I enjoyed that the thesis of the whole VN story is [](/s "the existence of pure love.") which is why [Coda](/s "True Kazusa route is imo the most canon ending.") The interactions between the characters, growth, music, romance, I was able to get heavily invested into it. 


[Also the uncensored BD goodies](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/929/429/8e1.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Touma was the only thing I enjoyed from the characters and the plot, apart art and music. I really hated Ogiso, she's crying because she's always left alone and excluded before, but then she's excluding her others friends (president of the light music club also) and always seeking for attention she "deserves". No matter how I see it, she's that popular bitch in high school kind.
>> ARTICLE
Psycho pass really
>> ARTICLE
Psychopass season 1 was absolutely brilliant
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, until I watched the ending I would've been inclined to agree with you (and others of your opinion) - I thought it turned into a bit of a shitshow if I'm being brutally honest; Makashima's plan comes out of nowhere considering the insurrection-type mechanic behind his earlier plan(s), and felt more like an arbitrary raising of the stakes rather than an organic development of events.

I also had a problem with how Makashima was dealt with by the show over the course of the series - [despite] (/s "Ginoza's doubt over his existence, the viewer is not left with any room to entertain the possibility that Kogami might be wrong about Makashima being behind the earlier crimes, which serves only to make Ginoza look foolish and narrow-minded or to enforce the brilliant aura the show repeatedly puts upon Kogami. I feel it would have been better if Kogami was portrayed as obsessed bordering on paranoid which would have the reveal in episode 11 infinitely better.")

I also thought thatTsunemori's development towards the end of the series was rushed.
>> ARTICLE
Season two was also great. It just looked bad in comparison to season one. It not getting as many episodes didn't help.
>> ARTICLE
Rebellion is fun but it's no 10/10, especially in the context of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Feel free to think that, but it is definitely a 10 for me. 
>> ARTICLE
What about Rebellion would you say compliments the rest of the franchise? 
>> ARTICLE
Homu's development [Rebellion](/s "is basically what Rebellion is all about that's a continuation from the series. It wasn't a 10 for me on my first watch, but after the 2nd and understanding, and seeing everything once again it earned it's place for me alongside Madoka. The series is a buildup of Madoka and Homu's suffering leading Madoka to become a God, whilst the movie exacerbates homura's despair without Madoka, leading to her transformation.") I mean you obviously disagree, so there's really no point in debating this. I'm on my phone and in class, so probably didn't word it best as I could have.
>> ARTICLE
What I also loved about it was how post-show movies have an expectation for fans.  Movie managed to [Madoka Spoilers] (/s "totally subvert that and change expectations w/ fans thinking it was another timeline" ) while actually moving the world-building, plot and character development forward and ultimately being surprising without coming off outside of what we've come to expect from Madoka.

And doing it all despite executive meddling wanting more sequels.  It was like a movie version of how it would feel if the show if the show had ended on Episode 11.

Both series, even though there's flaws in both Zero and UBW, I love them for different reasons.

What are the flaws in F/Z?
>> ARTICLE
Just personal gripes, I think the exposition was a little too heavy-handed at the beginning and could have been spread out, and something **extremely personal** just as a VN reader it just became redunandant and reminded me of Rin's lectures in the Fate route. Lancer's [](/s "death was way too corny and dramatic for a minor servant in regards to other servant deaths in the Fate series.")

They could have made the ending a little bit clearer for those without Heaven's Feel knowledge [Heaven's Feel](/s "specfically about Angra mainyu."), and just other minor things like Rider/Waver not being expanded on as much as in the LN and other adaptation things.

It's just all these minor things added up that prevent it from being a 10 for me, same with UBW and specifically Answer's handling. Heaven's Feel would be the most likely candidate for a 10 for me though simply because it is my favorite route and they don't butcher the length of the movies.
>> ARTICLE
>Exposition heavy handed


You don't like circle walking? Woah man. 

>ending 

[](/s "That one is quite true. I think leaving it open ended fits better with the amount of confusion Kerry went into the Grail with and left it with, but as a standalone really hurt it.")

But true, the difference between 10 and 9s do often become pretty personal.
>> ARTICLE
Ah that's a good point on the ending [F/Z & F/SN](/s "with Kiritsugu thinking he successfully destroyed the grail and the war being permanently over we kind of see it in his viewpoint. Which obviously isn't the case with him being cursed, eventually dying due to it, and all the complications that come forth in HF.")
>> ARTICLE
I like that viewpoint because (**extremely personal** as well) I view a large part of Kerry's character as based around risk and human innate limitations and lack of knowledge ever since childhood: [](/s "The last time he placed emotion over what he saw as utilitarian good was with Sherry's death; afterwards he takes the path of assuming he can't know everything, and the only final thing is to apply death to the side of the lesser, from Natalia to Kayneth to sacrificing Maiya for Irisviel to Irisviel himself."), yet not taking risks kinda trolled him hard and [](/s "ends up losing all his chips in the gamble of the Grail.")

Yeah, it was ok for me but I don't get the appeal that makes it people's favorite. It was good enough that I gave Bake an 8, well above average, but it was never really pushed into the "definitely something I'd recommend" territory. 
>> ARTICLE
But he liked SS.
>> ARTICLE
About Death Parade, it's not bad at all, I just don't have any interest on it.

And about Katanagatari, its first episode is really bad, but I haven't dropped it yet, I will eventually finish and give it a better score ( maybe).

I really enjoy the Monogatari series ( I watched all of it), but I hate its fan service with a passion. I have a sister, sis-con makes me want to vomit. And the child-abusing, just NO!.

Nise is full of fan service, its story is just mediocre. A solid 6.
Tsuki is really boring although Yotsugi is one of my fav character in Monogatari. 

And about Hana, I'm not really sure but seems like Monogatari movies are kinda dragged and lost focus on the plot. They could be much shorter and better but money changed everything. Although Hana has a quite amazing plot idea but 2 hours for that is unnecessary.

The Monogatari TV series seem to be more polished though. Owarimonogatari is really concise and has a brilliant storytelling, it brings back the feeling that I got from the first time watching Bakemonogatari. 
>> ARTICLE
Good, good... \*puts down the nuke I was gonna throw at your house and close the door where I throw the people who say Death Parade is bad\*

I agree that Nise is the weakest of the series. But what can I say, I love Monogatari's comedy, and I can't get Ep. 8 out of my mind: it's dirty, it's terrible, but the comedy is just genius, specially before and after the incestuous act.

Tsuki was a solid 10 for me (for some reason lel): I liked the OP/ED, I liked the storyline, the feel of it. Felt dragged out a little bit, but overall solid. Guess it's cool to have a slower pace anime after a while.

Hana for the other side, was painfully slow sometimes, gotta say beard Kaiki, incest Araragi jokes, long-haired Kanbaru and Numachi made up for it, at least for me. Each one with its cup of tea.

At least we can all agree Ougi Formula was perfect. And don't watch Plastic Memories, it gets to 3/10 after the start.

I think I will have to revamp my rating system, but I am sure that Revolutionary Girl Utena is going to remain my 10/10, since that is my favorite thing ever.

Yep (:


I absolutely adored the setting. The pacing was great considering this was an adaptation of an arc. The characters were all interesting and had their quirks and own personalities. The strongest man in the world seemed OP and like a generic shounen protag but he wasn't. He didn't have bullshit as to why he was so strong (friendship etc.).  He trained hard and imo had an interesting backstory. His character was consistent too. Then Fremy had some really good character development along with a good backstory too. The story itself was a pretty refreshing mystery using lore. The animation was beautiful (while it had it's moments) and the action scenes were *really* well done. And there were no fundamental flaws that I caught so 10/10 was easy for me to say.

That's nice to see you enjoyed it a lot! I liked it as well but for me I tend to rate weirdly and more in terms of "enjoyment" so to say. So in that sense I guess I'd rate Arslan Senki 10 before Rokka no Yuusha. :P

Oh I get you 100%. I have a sort of scale I use. I can't give something a 10 unless I enjoyed it or thought it was 100% stellar. I usually have 1 point for enjoyment.

Shinsekai Yori.

I've rated a lot of anime 10 because I enjoyed them a lot and they were fun.

SY, on the other hand, is truly an anime worth watching. It starts off slow but the ending is worth it. The world is so well made and the characters, there emotions, everything is top notch.

The ending is one of my favorite endings of all time. Simply a masterpiece.

All Gintama series & movie is a solid 10/10.

Gintama is the easiest 10/10 I have ever given. 

I mean,  what more do I need to say about it that has not already been mentioned?  The characters are absolutely fantastic (Gintoki Sakata is one of my favorite protagonists in any medium,  and the supporting characters don't slack either),  the voice actors are brilliant (Sugita is Gintoki and I couldn't imagine reading the manga since Sugita leaves that much of a  impression),  its completely and utterly hilarious when it wants to be (with its constant references and potshots to and at... well...  everything and anything.), badass at all of the appropriate times (whenever Gintoki activates rage mode),  and even a tearjerker in certain arcs. 

There are very few shows that are as well rounded as Gintama. 
>> ARTICLE
Here are my 10's and I'll briefly talk about each of them. 

Ano Hana:.... I probably wouldn't 10 this today, but apparently I thought this when I rated it. It's probably because I couldnt think of anything wrong with it. 
Casshern Sins:.... No real need to explain for those who get it. Kinda like kino's journey, a real though provoker. 
Cowboy bebop: No need for explanation
FLCL: It just makes me so happy
Hellsing Ultimate: Nothing gets more badass than Alucard. Nothing.
Monogatari Second season: Kaiki is the man.
End of Evangelion: Simply because it made me say wtf at least 100 times. 
Kenshin Trust and Betrayal: Just a masterpiece in my opinion. 


>> ARTICLE
I would list all my 10s but that's a bit too much.

The "best" 10/10 is definitely Shinsekai Yori, though. Absolutely fantastic show and I can hardly see any flaws with it.

I have 8 10s on my list, the highest tens are Monster, Texhnolyze and Hajime No Ippo. They are by far the best shows I have ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
As a writer I am crazy critical of this kind of thing and my standards are way too high

The Visual novel version of UBW was perfect because you have to play through the fate path first, and the build up for the plot twist that leads in to the climax becomes buried in your memory and when it comes up again it is the most mindfuck moment. Another visual novel would be ever 17 which is beautiful. Both are tens
I have never watched Fate/zero, but from what I have read here, it seems like it may be a 10 as well

In terms of straight anime/ manga... maybe.
Hunter x Hunter would be a strong candidate if it was actually complete, but it rests at a 9 right now
Gurren lagaan would be a 10, but there are a few episodes that are complete garbage thrown in for no appearant reason. also a 9

Samurai Champloo is my FAVORITE anime of all fucking time, but the ending keeps it from being a ten. It needed more of a bang to finish it off. 9.5


actual tens?
Baccano! is the first to come to mind. I preferred this far above durara
Parasyte the Maxim is an easy 10
The first seasons of Tokyo Ghoul and Code Geass, but only if you pretend season 2 never happened in both
Psycho pass is a 10 for season 1, but still a 9 for season 2
Death note is a given
Overlord... it didn't do anything unique, but it executed what it is perfectly. I hadn't anticipated a weekly show that strongly since I was 14.

Movies would be Spirited Away FOR SURE along with a lot of studio ghibli films
Akira is close behind spirited away, even though the plot arc is a mess from the ammount of meat they had to cut from the source to make it a film (if stanley kubrick made an anime, it would be like this)
Paprika and tekkonkinkreet rest in my memory as 10s, but I haven't seen them in years

and I would say the best example of a 10/10 anime would be Neon Genisis Evangellion. If you doubt me, take a look at digibros episode by episode analysis of the series. While the last 2 episodes are too abstract to actually comprehend, the movie makes up for it by giving a slightly less abstract, and satisfying conclusion to the story. I would say it is objectively the most important anime ever made, though subjectively I prefer others. Many would care to disagree.

I have not finished mushishi, but so far it seems 10 worthy

As far as Manga?

Jojo is a 10 at times, but it is far too inconsistent for me to call it a 10.
Berserk starts as a 6 and slowly ramps its way up to a 10, it has not fallen off since.
21st century boy is a much less believable counterpart to monster, however it was good enough for me to read it TWICE despite all its meat. It emotionally impacted me in incredible ways. Looking back on it, most of the story was soap opera padding (much like monster) but it is still an arguable 10 nonetheless

devilman could easily be a 10, created by the legendary tezuka, though the ending feels heavily rushed.


Finally a videogame... if you've played it you might be able to understand why I chose this specific game
Killer 7 - the greatest art-house game I have ever played. It is absolutely style over substance, but if you go in knowing that, you are in for one HELL of a ride. It is a piece of interactive hyperviolent abstract literature about the culture wars between east and west. Beautiful.

I'm taking "anime series" to mean "franchise," not how a TV series is marked on MAL (with the split cours and all) and by including spin-offs and sequels.

- Neon Genesis Evangelion, End of Evangelion, and Rebuild of Evangelion    
- Fate/Zero + Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works   
- Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (including Rebellion)    
- Cardcaptor Sakura (& The Sealed Card)  
- The Suzumiya Haruhi franchise ( especially The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya) [while I don't think the TV show is a 10/10, I think the set up is what made the film so, SO good.] 
- Sora No Woto

>.> so much 10's <.<


>> ARTICLE
Some people think "10s" are something special you reserve for shows that are "literally flawless". I am not one of those people. Numerical rankings kinda just piss me off in general, so I rate things somewhat haphazardly. I will, however, say that each of my top five are unquestionably deserving:

* Eureka Seven
* Aquarion EVOL
* Kemonozume
* Utakoi
* Hamatora
>> ARTICLE
Well, MAL classifies "10" as masterpiece and I would much rather have people using it cautiously for shows they absolutely adored than throwing it around for every show they somewhat liked.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, everyone's standards for what constitutes a "masterpiece" are all going to be way different, and pretending to have some sort of "objective" system for scoring is just silly. And boring. 
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree. As long people truly feel that their score reflects their enjoyment, I fully support people deviate from the common rating. In fact I try to have my scores display my own enjoyment without any outside influence as it is possible.
>> ARTICLE
I would have to say mine are in this order
Code Geass
Deathnote
Sword Art
Attack on Titan
Naruto Shippuden
And One Piece 
(Naruto and One Piece were the ones that made me fall in love with Anime, so they may not be 10/10's but they opened my eyes I guess)
>> ARTICLE
Obvious 10/10 :  
-Code Geass ( best ending of all time )   
-Fate Zero  ( has literally zero flaws aside from the broken golden plothole the archer is . )
-Ping Pong ( People need to get past the art style )  
-HxH 2011 ( has 8/10 9/10 moments/period , but the end of Chimera ant and Election arc are 10/10 ) .  
People Wont agree with me but its worth 10/10 imo :  
-Fate Unlimited Blade work , the flaw of this anime is basicly the characters , While a lot people hate Shirou ( because of translations error haha ! ) i really like him as a main character , the antagonists are very poor ( save Archer if he counts as one ) , Caster is half assed and Kirei/Goldy are basicly ruined compared to what they were in Zero .  
-Rokka No Yuusha : This one isn't worth a 10/10 but is a personal favorite . The main character is great , the characters are good . The animation has its moments ... it was a very refreshing anime to watch . It comes from a low budget studio that made the not popular rail wars  , looking forward to what they will make in the futur .

So far none. The closest would probably be HxH 2011, though it imo has a long way to go before becoming a 10/10 (and yes, I know that the anime's over).

Katanagatari would be the only show that I would give a 10/10. My favorite show would be a tie between Clannad: After Story and Steins;Gate but both have flaws (Katanagatari has no real flaws so I think it's the only one that deserves my 10/10 ranking).

Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood

Tengen Toppen Gurren Lagann

Non-objective 10/10: Durarara!! and Baccano!

My tens in general order:  

* Samurai Champloo  
* Ping Pong  
* Hibike Euphonium  
* Katanagatari  

Katanagatari is close to being dropped to 9, still thinking about it. Really close is Danshi koukousei no Nichijou except I can't bring myself to rate it higher than 9 since it's not very deep, just funny
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, these probably aren't perfect anime, but they were my 10/10's. They all felt like they had a goal, and they all succeeded at it. 

* Bakemonogatari

* Psycho Pass

* Stein's;Gate

* Toradora

* Katanagatari

* Cowboy Bebop

* Jojo's Bizzare Adventure (Mostly for Battle Tendency) 

* Spice and Wolf

I want to put Kill la Kill and Gurren Laggan on this list, but I had a few problems with them that stopped me from saying they were "perfect". They're like 9.5's, though. Planning to start up Code Geass and FMA at some point, thanks to what I've read from this thread.

Toradora and Madoka Magica!

I give high scores very easily, so here are my top TOPs. Sharing, since there don't seem to be a lot of people who rate dialogue anime highly.

Sort of in an order, but not set in stone, because I rate them highly for different reasons. EX: xxxHolic has worse excecution than the top ones. Spice&Wolf is just personal bias, cause I read all of the LNs and cried that it ended for a day. Hit me really hard.

Instead of listing my CLEAR 10/10s, I find Hitsugi no Chaika (+ Avenging Battle) to be a personal 10/10. Certainly not perfect, with many flaws, but I'll be dammed if I didn't enjoy that show all the way through.

* Fate/Zero 2nd Season

* The World God Only Knows: Goddess Arc (season 3)

* Welcome to the N.H.K.

* Your Lie in April

If I had to order them, I would probably place NHK>F/Z>TWGOK>YLiA; because TWGOK's ending was unresolved, but at least you didn't see it from 10 episodes away.

I also think that some anime have better traits than my 10 ten in certain areas, but completely shit the bed in others. An example would be that:

* (I rated 9/10) Clannad: AS is way better in the saddness department than YLA, but has a worse overall plot, music, animation, art and side-characters.

* (I rated 9/10) Steins;Gate has an amazing romance and twist, but really falls flat in side characters and how the beginning is a little slow.

* (both I rated 7/10) Magi and No Game No Life both had great main characters, which I liked more than the main characters in NHK and YLA; but both had it's bad points too (I don't like alladin and all of the ecchi isn't my thing).
>> ARTICLE
A 10 for me is one that I feel changed me somehow so:

Spice and wolf->first romance I ever watched, opened me up to the genre. Watched it a while ago and loved every episode.
Kimiuso->first music anime I watched plus I loved the romance in it. The feels were so real and intense that I couldn't help but feel them too
Dbz-> simply too nostalgic to not give a 10
Fma:b-> I actually enjoyed the 2003 series more but only because it got me back into anime. I recognize that fma:b is better though. 
Ttgl->I don't think i need to explain why ;)

Edit: forgot Steins;Gate
This one was a 10 because of the character development and good story writing. Plus he feels plus ep 12
>> ARTICLE
I have a few 10s now after reworking some of my list and how I rank things but the things that were absolutely 10s as soon as I finished them, kill la kill my all time favourite and puella magi madoka magica my second favourite and then madoka magica rebellion
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy
>> ARTICLE
Gintama
Death Note
Great Teacher Onizuka
Zetsuen no Tempest
Clannad: Afterstory
All these made me really feel something while watching them, and if an anime somehow changes the way you think about life etc, it's a 10/10.

I've got this trifecta of Serial Experiments Lain - Haibane Renmei - Kino's Journey going on. Those anime take the medium in a direction I hope to see more of in the future, and they rank fairly high on non-anime films and series that I also like. They transcend anime in my opinion, or at least have shown me that anime doesn't haven't to be a niche medium in world art.

I don't really like scores because I think they are mostly arbitrary and often distracting from discussing the art itself, but I do use MAL to log what I've watched and I do score things roughly based on how I feel. I don't even know how to define a 10/10 because everybody has a different arbitrary definition of what that is, and I myself have other 10s than the 3 shows I listed. However, in the spirit of the thread, I think those 3 specifically stand out so much. I never have doubts about how much I really love them.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano
Ghost in the Shell
Cowboy Bebop
Madoka
>> ARTICLE
69 out of my 476 completed are 10s, but the ones that stuck with me the most and are well above 10 to me are Scrapped Princess, Code Geass, and Spice and Wolf. Those 3 bring me endless joy regardless of how many times I see them. Whether it is through characters I relate to, characters I just love the personalities of, the setting, or the scale of the adventure. As long as I can keep rewatching these 3, I can be happy. 
>> ARTICLE
I have given only 1 10/10 and that's to One Piece, before you start saying how the animation quality and the fillers suck, imagine the difficulty of having an anime that has over 700 episodes and maintaining that level of story telling and world building 
>> ARTICLE
I have a bunch of 10s. Most of them are shows I think are completely amazing, although there are a couple that reach the threshold because of my personal taste.

Some of my 10s that aren't as commonly talked about:

* [Kino no Tabi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/486/Kino_no_Tabi:_The_Beautiful_World)
* [Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori)

* [Aiura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17082/Aiura)

1) Akame Ga Kill

2) Magi 

3) Code Geass

4) Black Bullet 

Not in that order necessarily. Those are just my favorites.

* Angel Beats

* Cowboy Bebop
* Hunter X Hunter
* K-On!
* K-On!!
* Madoka
* Nisekoi
* Spice and Wolf 1&2
* Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso
* Steins;Gate

Some of those are rated higher because of some sentimental meaning it had to me, such as coming to me at the right time in my life. Based on content alone I'd say Bebop, HxH, Spice and Wolf, Steins; Gate, and Madoka are the most deserving

1-Katanagatari

In extending order:

* Death Parade

The first that comes to mind for me is [Birdy the mighty Decode](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3974/Tetsuwan_Birdy_Decode). The first season was a trip, than got deeper with season two. Everything was choreographed so well, and the effects and sound were amazing! And it was all packed into a immersive story line.

- FMA:B

- Bakemonogatari (because I couldn't give EP12 a 10 by itself, I chose the next best thing)

- KLK

mainly because i've been far too lazy to watch more shit or update my MAL recently

* Legend of the Galactic Heroes

Politics, philosophy and an especially poignant character driven drama. 

* Monster 

Psychological & both thrilling and chilling critique of human conditioning. 

* Noir 

Girls with Guns, Great music, interesting plot concerning the nature of self-identity. 

* One Piece

Creative shonen with strong character arcs and a very silly fun nature to it.  Great fights. 

* Ghost in the Shell

Amazing Cyberpunk series with strong characterization, action, animation and intricate plot mechanics. 

* Great Teacher Onizuka

Silly slice of life about a motor-cycle gang leader going back and teaching high school.  Very silly and down to earth with a good clash between serious and humorous arcs. 

* Space Battleship Yamato 2199

A re-imagining of an older show.  I really enjoyed the desperation and final outcome (realization) plot twist towards the end.  Very heartfelt ending. I just about cried. 

* Zeta Gundam

Stays true to the original sort of "Gundam Formula" while not overly trivializing death as some of the more modern series like Gundam 00 & Seed have a tendency to do.  More character driven drama while maintaining decent mecha and fights. 

* Master Keaton

Underrated and under appreciated slice of life from Naoki Urasawa (Monster) that focuses on an insurance agent who's touted as a "Master of Life" with a wide range Indiana Jones esque skill set.  It does an amazing job of telling stories in an episodic manner and conveying familiarity.  It's a great show when you don't have time to commit to something of longer lengths.

I love YYH for what it is, but for me it was way too formulaic and generic at certain parts to be anywhere close to a 10. It really felt like a test run for HxH. I will say that Yusuke was a fan-fucking-tastic MC and really made the show for me. 
>> ARTICLE
I definitely agree with you. I think I was just overlooking the flaws and paying attention to the good points of YYH. It definitely deserves a 9, though, at least to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I gave it an 8. The last two arcs were 9s for me, but the first one was a 7 at best.

Man, I've watched too many already. (Can hardly remember if I watched 'the world of Narue' or not). Imma dive in my watch history. to check. Here in no particular order are some of the best (IMHO) anime I've watched

* Charlotte
* Dogdays S1 to 3
* Grisaia no Kajitsu, Meikyuu, Rakuen
* Log Horizon
* Nanatsu no Taizai
* Spice and Wolf

And
Utawarerumono is most likely on that list too, currently watching and the new season/setting is airing.

>> ARTICLE
Wow these anime are regarded as fairly mediocre by /r/anime. (Especially Charlotte). I am sure your list will change somewhat in the future as you watch more shows. Try the new Gundam for example ;D
>> ARTICLE
I just cant seem to get into the general 10/10 shows sadly. I also missed 1 or 2 anime I watched real early in my anime life-wasting aventure that would be rated higher, there is also this show I just remembered. Senjou no Valkyria: Valkyria Chronicles. Dont see it mentioned that often though.

Steins;Gate: The whole show felt like a big puzzle. Everything was thought out so well. I don't want to spoil anything, so just watch it.

Non Non Biyori: The most calming show I've ever seen. The comedy is fantastic. The characters are all amazing this show also has the best art I've ever seen, and a fantastic soundtrack to go with it.

Bakuman: This is my favorite show of all time. All of the characters a are extremely relatable, and I loved the relationships between all of them. I never thought people writing manga could be so exciting. I loved all the romance, yes even the main one. The story was so compelling and engrossing.

Kill La Kill: This is simply the most fun I've ever had watching a show. The animation was so fluid and the soundtrack was fantastic, so every action scene was so fast paced. I also really enjoyed the characters. The comedy was really good.

Death Note: Every plan in the show was so well thought out. I always loved seeing how any character executed a plan they had, and the counter plan another character would have. My favorite part was I really never knew who was going to win. So many things caught me by surprise.

* TWGOK S1(It was just so unique and nice, the interactions were great.(Might move out, kinda the barely hanging onto top 5 spot)

The "Everything-with-the-kids" Arc in both seasons of Log Horizon.
>> ARTICLE
*cringes while remembering the noob squad arc in season two
>> ARTICLE
I wished the whole series focused more on politics, the administration and development of Akiba and the surrounding region, and the hostilities from Kansai. From Kanto to Hokkaido should be well on its way to becoming some connected domain of the players/heroes and the citizens of the land by the second season. 
>> ARTICLE
To be honest I never had a problem with any of Log Horizon season 1, though I agree about season 2.
>> ARTICLE
It's because season one's mixed in with the goblin army arc/Krusty+Reynesia/Shiroe hacking the world, which made it feel a lot less tedious overall. 

Season two as a whole I think would have been better if they diverted from the LN's way of segmenting things and done all three of the major arcs(Akatsuki v Dude, Shiroe's Raid and the kid's travelling) at the same time as opposed to one after the other.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you on that.  The kids in season 1 didn't bother me.  What they were doing was kind of interesting on its own (exploring the game mechanics as a group) and even if you didn't think it was that interesting, there was plenty of other stuff going on with the main characters.  Not so much in season 2, where it was just them.
>> ARTICLE
The second arc of Railgun S is so unnecessary, poorly written, and just plain bad(especially when compared to Sisters arc) that even the main character wanted to forget it happened.

 I would not only recommend skipping it, I would say its almost mandatory to skip it if you actually want to have a positive opinion of the show. Its anime-original filler too so if we get a third season of Railgun, it wont even be necessary to understand the story.  
>> ARTICLE
[Reasons why the Silent Party arc is atrocious.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3i0j6r//cuc72fc) This arc made it 100% clear that neither J.C. Staff or Nagai have any real understanding or respect for the series.

**Edit:** And what makes it worse is that they kept hinting at Liberal Arts City but didn't fucking animate it! Why go with filler when you have a canon arc that you can animate?! Are you *trying* to piss off your fans?!

god.... this Fairy Tail Filler arcs... they are so bad. SO BAD.

I'd disagree with that. I had some fun watching the Key of the Starry Sky arc in Fairy Tail. It was better than Galuna.
>> ARTICLE
There can be exceptions to any rule. Go watch Naruto Shippuden and report back.
>> ARTICLE
Right. Mine is the exception. He said any filler in a long running series is bad, and I came back with one that isn't bad.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, I can't think of a single filler in Naruto/Naruto Shippuden that managed to be hold up to the canon's standards (Even if you don't like the canon, the fillers were worse). 
>> ARTICLE
The Chikara arc was pretty good and had movie quality animation.
>> ARTICLE
I forgot that I had stopped watching fillers. Think that's the first one I decided to skip. After the Kage summit right?

I'll take your word for it though. Watch it sometime in the future. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually in Naruto (the first series) there were plenty of good filler arcs. The most notable one that comes to mind would be the very last one where Gaara gets a shit ton of development. The great thing about the first series' filler is that it all built up into how the characters end up in time skip. I also love the fact that one of Hinata's signature moves (which is completely badass) originates from a filler episode.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about those ones man. They weren't curry of life certainly, but still.. To each his own.
>> ARTICLE
True, they weren't the greatest thing in the world, however as someone that had no knowledge that this was "filler" (Naruto was probably my first time marathoning then watching the ongoing episodes of any 'anime') I didn't find any problem with the episodes, other than the fact that I was tired of the Sasuke "dick-teasing"
>> ARTICLE
I was the same haha. I didn't realize it at the time. Binged through everything.

I think I started the manga when I caught up with the anime. Just after Shikamaru's arc in Shippuden. Episode 90 was it? Somewhere there.
>> ARTICLE
I caught up to the anime right as the Naruto vs Sasuke fight ended and the filler were starting. I was like, "damn they are taking their sweet ass time finding Sasuke", but I still enjoyed watching the intermingling and mixing of the groupings between the characters so I was fine with it. I didn't realize there was a timeskip (obviously the manga went on but I was completely unaware) until the very last ending of Naruto where it shoes him running and hints for a few small seconds that he is grown up. I lost my shit and looked it up online.

Shortly after the anime was announced to continue as "Shippuden" so I stuck with it for a while but eventually couldn't wait anymore and started reading around when Sai got introduced.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I enjoyed some fillers more than others but I still felt the series was going downhill. Intermixing of the groups was the key that kept me going. 

Ah.. Yeah, that's just after the first arc of Shippuden so pretty early on :P. Actually thinking about it, I think I caught up a bit earlier than what I said as well. I just started reading the manga after where I said.


>> ARTICLE
The infinite Filler arc from Naruto Shippuden would like a word with you.
>> ARTICLE
That means you don't like Detektiv Conan?^ ^ 
>> ARTICLE
The fillers were fine for like the first few hundred episodes and then it just got repetitive and annoying because very little plot actually progressed.
>> ARTICLE
I think that there can be good filler, as long as it doesn't break any world rules, or take on any cliche plots that amount to nothing.

If it serves only to expand on the world then I'm cool with it.

Favorite filler arc is probably the G8 arc in One Piece, THAT is how you do filler.
>> ARTICLE
> I think that there can be good filler, as long as it doesn't break any world rules, or take on any cliche plots that amount to nothing.

You would *loathe* the filler in Railgun.
>> ARTICLE
I've heard terrible things

Contradicts canon material like no one's business and even undermines the very tone of the source material. It's a real shame since the manga is so good.
>> ARTICLE
Nagai has me very worried over the new Gundam show, as if Okada wasn't bad enough.
>> ARTICLE
He's directing a Gundam show? Holy shit. I joked about him doing that since he was constantly putting mechs in Railgun (another inconsistency with the series canon). He's great with character drama driven stories (Ano Natsu de Matteru was amazing), but needs to stay away from things with event driven plots. He just sucks at anything with anything not centered on character drama.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm expecting a pretty convoluted mecha show with a fuckton of shitty melodrama thanks in part to Okada. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched a Gundam since 00, but Unicorn looks like it's the only decent one since. I could be wrong, but that's the impression I got.
>> ARTICLE
I only got into it recently watching from the beginning for the most part, Unicorn was really good but I don't think you'd like it so much if you aren't a UC fan. 00 seems good, but haven't gotten to it yet, Build Fighters isn't a good Gundam series but it's still pretty good on its own.

Gintama doesn't have fillers . Gintama is just a big filler which is why it is the best anime

Gintama has plot. Theres a whole bunch of drama with space pirates, the shogunate, and a shit ton of other stuff. It is far from just being filler. 
>> ARTICLE
I really hope both of you have actually watched Gintama.... The filler episodes (non-manga material) are hilarious, yeah. My problem is both of you seem to be promoting that Gintama is just another non-plot, entirely episodical anime, which is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Sunrise only makes fillers which they think are actually worth airing. When they catch up to the manga, they STOP the anime rather than hastily concocting a subpar plot. 

I think the choice of studio here is a big reason why Gintama is one of the best Shonen Jump titles.

Endless eight.
>> ARTICLE
Kyon-kun denwa?
>> ARTICLE
Believe it or not, there are entire anime series that felt more boring to me than E8.
>> ARTICLE
I actually didn't mind that arc very much. It felt like I was playing Monster Hunter and grinding a monster for something. Each episode was the same thing, but it was not always the exact same. Certain lines were not always said. Different angles were shown for scenes. That's just like Monster Hunter where I just have the same old equipment and fight a monster that uses the same old moves.
>> ARTICLE
In Monster Hunter you're grinding a monster though. You can make a pretty sword in the end. What do you get at the end of the endless eight? Empathy for Nagato? I watch this for entertainment, not for time wasting.
>> ARTICLE
I liked seeing the minor differences. Entertainment enough for me. :/
>> ARTICLE
Endless eight is one of my favorite things an animation studio has ever done. That took some serious balls.
>> ARTICLE
I both love and hate E8. I love and am extremely fascinated by the concept of it - especially [Haruhi spoilers](/s "helping you empathize with Nagato during the timeloop, and the "HOLY SHIT IS IT FINALLY OVER" when Kyon manages to break it"), but hated watching it.
>> ARTICLE
I can't help but hate the movie making arc more. It feels *so* tedius, and I *really* dislike Haruhi during that. I strangely enjoyed being trolled with the Endless Eight. It was frustrating and funny at the same time - also, I went in completely unaware.
>> ARTICLE
The "second season" of Haruhi was definitely not good... the movie makes up for it, though.
>> ARTICLE
For a long run yeah. I like the movie more than the series. (and I love the series)
>> ARTICLE
I really wanted [Spoiler](/s "Kyon to punch her when she said Asahina was her toy.")
>> ARTICLE
At most other times I really wanted Kyon to punch Asahina for her annoying voice and character (or lack thereof)
>> ARTICLE
Damn straight, me too. I'm reading the manga now... she becomes much nicer, fortunately.
>> ARTICLE
Haruhi's behavior towards [](/s "Asahina") was always one of blatant sexual harassment. Her attitude towards Kyon wasn't much better, I think his actual role in the movie was literally listed as "slave".

As much fun Silent Party was, it's trash compared to the rest of Railgun S.

Surprisingly haven't seen anybody say this yet, so I'll go ahead and say the Near/Mello arc of Death Note
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I don't know how this isn't the top comment. It was the first thing to come to my mind.
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Why do people say this? I thought the arc was a breath of fresh air after the horrendous memory loss arc. Also, the ending was great imo. Yeah, Near's a piece of shit, L clone but I thought Mello was very unique and interesting. Still not as good as the first cour; however, it's definitely more similar to the first cour than the second cour is.")
>> ARTICLE
I agree the ending was great. [Death Note](#s "However, I could not stand Mello and you think the memory loss arc was bad? Idk man. I certainly haven't heard that one before. That arc was sweet.")
>> ARTICLE
[I have to agree with this](/s "The memory loss arc kept me interested, I knew it was Kira's plan but I couldn't figure out why exactly or how he benefited or how he knew he'd get the note back at all. I knew it was a plan but *what exactly was the plan*? Also I disliked Mello a lot, literally probably the third smartest person in the world and he turns to a life of crime because he didn't get what he wanted. It's like the worlds largest temper tantrum.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the ending was so, just meh, after having such a good antagonist like L
>> ARTICLE
Man i stopped watching after L and didn't finish the show because i lost interest really fast.

Would you say it's worth finishing ?
>> ARTICLE
I stopped halfway too, for a few years. Just finished the rest this week. The 2nd half still had the loveable ridiculous back-and-forth, counter-counter-counter-trap-card keikakus. *keikaku means plan
>> ARTICLE
I would definitely say finish it, its not as bad as people make it out to be, but the antagonists aren't as good. It still was really good though, just not like the first half
>> ARTICLE
Alfheim ^^^^^Fight ^^^^^me
>> ARTICLE
The Calibur arc was much weaker imo. Alfheim actually had development of characters and a reasonably interesting story. 

It was also a nice continuation of the Aincrad arc whilst Calibur may as well hvae not happened.  
>> ARTICLE
Idk, the Calibur arc was pretty much just slice-of-life mmo-ing afaik, whereas during the Alfheim arc I kept thinking about what a bullshit premise it had.
>> ARTICLE
The Calibur arc was just a side story (in Vol. 8) that was meant to fill in a small plot hole that presented itself in the Mother's Rosario novel (Vol. 7) which was [SAO II spoiler](/s ""omgggg wtf how did Kirito get the legit Excaliburrrrr"") because that was never covered in the novel until the volume after, and I find it ironic that this small side story ended up eating up 2 (or 3?) episodes of anime when it could have very well been covered in 1. [After all](/s "it was just approach maze, go through maze, fight boss, collect loot, end")
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one that likes Alfheim? I mean, seeing the sister worrying about Kirito going back to the game, seeing her trying to play that double life. Yeah, incest and tentacles were weird AF but otherwise, it's pretty standard.
>> ARTICLE
I put the excaliber one as the worst simply because of the sheer pandering and the nothing interesting happening whatsoever. Second to it I put the mother's rosario arc because again, nothing really plot relevant happened and it made a really bad and shameful attempt at getting my feels up and I really don't see any point to it at all, I didn't even like the characters that much. *Then* I put Alfheim because it was so shit with the incest and the stakes lowering so much and the change of mood and many other things, but the fact that it gave closure to Kirito and Asuna's story and the whole SAO incident does give it some points. Close to it I put the GGO arc because the stakes went up somewhat and it was rather interesting, although the whole new girl thing and Kirito's attitude with her are bullshit. I put the Aincrad arc on top because I honestly think it's really good as a self contained story and as a short anime and it doesn't even need to be longer to be better, it is perfectly good as it is. SAO really has to be jusged by arc, and SAO proper (the Aincrad arc) is the absolute best.

The character introduction arcs lasted way too long, I hated the future battle arc the most though since the fights just ended up getting so ridiculous to look at. Mukuro arc and later the inheritance battle arc was probably the high point of the show imo. 
>> ARTICLE
And sadly i can only agree with both of you... for someone who is a big fan of the series i believe that this killed the hope for an adaptation of the two last arc of the manga which were really good and gave more explanation about the whole arcobaleno curse.

Its because the manga was suppose to be a gag manga, but it was not successful so it turned into a battle manga lol

Which was for the best. It was a bland gag manga, but a pretty good battle manga.

Garlic Jr. arc in DBZ. I mean, I think it was filler, but it was so boring. I wanted to get to badass Gohan, Trunks, Goku and the Androids. I didn't care about a blue thing on steroids creating a black hole, or Kamisama's search for holy water. 

EDIT: Oh, and the pre-sanctuary arcs of Saint Seiya. In between fillers and bad guy Ikki, I pushed to get to the sanctuary. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't much care for the Yakuza arc in Black Lagoon. Ginji was awesome and we got some good character development for Rock and Revy, but the plot felt forced and I didn't really like Yukio.

I completely agree. I was glad they ended it the way they did. Yukio was terrible. 
>> ARTICLE
I stand by my love of Bleach and my opinion that it is of quality.

However Fullbring Arc is the fucking worst thing I've ever seen, downright disgusting.
>> ARTICLE
I never made it past Fullbring in the manga. After the first few chapters of it I finally dropped the whole series. Didn't even bother watching past Aizen in the anime. I like to think it ended there.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, do yourself a favour, pick it back up. you don't really need to read the rest of fullbring because it is shit and if you want I'll give you a tldr of what happened but the current arc (the last arc actually) is probably a tie with soul society for the best arc in the series. SO MUCH SHIT goes down in this arc. characters die, we get answers to questions we've been asking the whole series, new badass ichigo powerups, his parents backstories and a whole lot of other shit which I can't tell you not because it's a spoiler but because comments on reddit have a 10000 character limmit. 

It totally could have ended after the aizen fight, but I'm sooooo glad it didn't.

also quincies, the final enemy is quincies 
>> ARTICLE
Question though.

You liked the Bount arc?
>> ARTICLE
That was filler, I only watch canon material.

:P
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the fullbring arc felt just an explanation for [spoilers](/s "Ichigo getting back his shinigami powers") The Thousand Years Blood War, the present arc, is f*cking awesome. Man, shall the anime return, some fights would be amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I want the anime to return just to see *that scene* with yama. I don't even care about the rest of the arc being animated. I just want to see that sword wreck some shit for a good 40 minutes. My life will be complete. 
>> ARTICLE
What, not a fan of the 'gaining strength as your boots get dirty' ability?
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed Bleach but yeah. It had been losing steam for a long time by that point at any rate.

Fullbring Arc was just the nail in the coffin. 

I even stopped reading the manga. Sigh...
>> ARTICLE
The manga gets a lot better after the Fullbring arc actually, granted its the final arc of the series, but still. The story has tied up a good majority of the loose ends and the Quincy are awesome as fuck, though it doesn't go without its problems.
>> ARTICLE
Is it finally the end of Bleach?

I stopped following the manga around when Ichigo gets to the above place. I was loosely following till that point by then anyways.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean the first time he goes there for training? At the moment we are in the final battles of the series. (Yes this was confirmed to be the last arc back when it started)
>> ARTICLE
Oh nice. Yeah, when he arrives for training. He learns about Zangetsu. 
>> ARTICLE
given the pacing (it's giving the Hueco Mundo Arc a run for its money...), it's probably still be a couple years (~100-150 more chapters), but if you keep up with the manga, you can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh nice, I'll pick it up again soon. Currently rereading TOG, so when I catch up again...

I'll start Bleach reread. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved seeing Ichigo get put in that position, though. His character experienced a lot of development and growth in that short arc. The current arc, though. I'm just sticking around because I've already invested years in the series and need to see it end.
>> ARTICLE
Same, it was pretty boring and had terrible pacing, hard to believe it wasn't filler. As for filler arcs, only one worth watching was the Zanpakutou Rebellion, then skip Beastswords :P
>> ARTICLE
Care to elaborate? I enjoyed it because we got to see a bit more high school Ichigo, not demigod Ichigo.
>> ARTICLE
To me, it seems like Kubo created the entire arc as a half assed reason to make Ichigo relevant again, and thus continue his manga. While from a purely productive standpoint this is a smart move, however I strongly feel that if he had stopped the manga after the final [] (/s "Aizen arc"), then Bleach could have been a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
To me it just felt Asspuly. Kubo had the perfect chance for a season finale after Aizen, but it continued, so they needed a bullshit way to get his powers back. Then the villains were cool enough, but they weren't nearly expanded on as much as they should have been. 

Then the manga just gets worse and worse every week. 
>> ARTICLE
[Bleach Fullbring arc](/s "I thought it was especially pointless to have Ichigo learn his fullbring powers, only to later get his original power return to roflstomp the guy anyway. could have just done the arc about his mexican mate or something I thought would be better, considering he's generally more related to them anyway")

Bleach Soul Society arc was so good, but it went downhill fast starting with the Bount filler arc.
There were some decent storyline arcs after, but i don't think any of them were as epic as the beginning.

Well including fillers, Bount arc was absolute trash even by filler standards.

Bleach fillers are pretty much the low point of the rating. I couldn't push through any of them.

Hunter x Hunter - I thought the Zoldyck Family arc was pretty weak compared to the rest of the show.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure - Part 1 is by far the worst part of the entire series to me. I think it's very important in setting everything up, but I still feel like it's kinda meh.

And now for a show that likely won't be said by anybody else.

Yu Yu Hakusho - I thought the final arc, Three Kings, was pretty meh compared to the rest of the show. It had a tournament arc compressed into 5 or 6 episodes. You can't do that!
>> ARTICLE
Phantom Blood is easily the weakest arc of JJBA. The creator himself would probably agree. He was mostly copying popular shonen at the time like FoTNS. 
>> ARTICLE
i think the only major thing that was copied was the character design of johnathan
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one that thoroughly enjoyed YYH last's arc? Sure seems like it.
>> ARTICLE
I liked parts of it, but the arc as a whole I wasn't the biggest fan of. I would have preferred it if the show were longer and the tournament at the end had been fleshed out a bit more.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely agree that it was rushed as hell, but I don't know, I enjoyed the set up and the ideas SO fucking much, much more than anything else in the entire series. Yuske's ancestor staying sitting but still shitting on Yuske repeatedly and being a presence so big that even in that state still caused a deadlock, his stomach growling could be heard through the entire place. Mukuros' story, Hieis', the blind dude knowing all along that he was betrayed.

Even with how rushed it was it still is my favorite arc in the entire thing. *please don't stone me*.

Also might be worth noting that I actually read the manga and just watched a few episodes of the anime here and there whenever they were on tv and I happened to be watching.
>> ARTICLE
That whole arc is only 18 episodes, compared to the 40+ Dark Tournament. It is definitely rushed.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really like the Zoldyck arc but Zeno and Silva were two of my favorite characters, granted a lot of why I like Silva was because he looked like Steven Tyler from Arrowsmith  
>> ARTICLE
Any of the fights with the zoldycks were good.
>> ARTICLE
They were cool, and I really liked their appearances throughout the series.
>> ARTICLE
For the record, the Zoldyck family arc was important as it provided us some much needed information on Killua and even got Gon to a point where he could compete in Heaven's Arena.

That being said, Togashi actually understood that the arc could start to get drawn out, so he decided to wrap it up quickly.
>> ARTICLE
for hxh, i am of opinion that the chimera ant arc is split in 2: hunt for the queen and hunt for the king. the first one sucks imo and the second one rocks, making up for the first
>> ARTICLE
The last arc in the YYH manga didn't show the fights of the tournament. The arc was about seeing the tournament, and Togashi kind of rushed it. The anime added some fights, but couldn't do much. 

I don't dislike the arc as much as early dumb arcs in the manga and the shit between Dark Tournament and Sensui's arc.
>> ARTICLE
You are right. Only in the Battle tower when Killua and Gon learn nen the anime really take off.

My favourite arc was the Spyder btw.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed the Exam as well.

I agree, though. Yorknew was my favorite arc as well.

Yeah that arc was just "they show up at his house and pick him up and that's about it".

I'm currently watching JoJo and I felt like the first part was pretty good. You mean to tell me it gets better with Joseph Joestar?
>> ARTICLE
Part 2 is really good, then part 3 is better than that IMHO. Then if you're interested enough, try the manga. Part 4 is my favorite by far and 5-8 are all amazing too. 
>> ARTICLE
It only gets better with each part.
>> ARTICLE
You mean Joseph? And yeah it gets better. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes Joseph. I'm terrible with anime character's names. The other day I switched Shinji and Gendo.

And man, if this gets better I'm in for a wild ride. I have a feeling I can trust someone whose username is "Joestar_" on this matter.
>> ARTICLE
imo Part 2 was my most favorite parts out of all 3 parts for jojo (part three I mean all of stardust crusaders) 

The mc in part2 is just so much fun to watch
>> ARTICLE
If you like Part 1 which I did too I enjoyed it. You should like the later parts. Just keep watching and don't google anything about Jojo you'll get spoiled.

Only things I know are:

1. There are multiple JoJos
2. They get spirit things on their backs that shout some dank shit.

> JoJo's Bizarre Adventure - Part 1 is by far the worst part of the entire series to me. I think it's very important in setting everything up, but I still feel like it's kinda meh.

I really loved the finale of Part 1 though. To me it was very unexpected and beautiful in a way.  I also liked how part 1 told a concise story and paced quite well. I know it's a sin to say it around here but I enjoyed it more than most of part 3. To me part 3 only gets better towards the end. 
>> ARTICLE
No, I get what you're saying. Part 3 gets very villain-of-the-week, and the stands aren't very creative at the beginning. This one punches, this one has a sword, this one shoots fire, etc.

Towards the 2nd half, you can really see Araki get more creative with stands, with Bastet and Cream being two examples.

Part 3 is basically an introduction to stands, which the following parts really take advantage of, like with [Part 6](/s "C-Moon being able to turn things inside out by punching them. Yes, this includes people.")
>> ARTICLE
I feel part 3 was more of Araki experimenting with Stands to see if they'd work and part 4 as the *real* introduction to Stands, mainly due to the ridiculous amount of characters that come and go, whose abilities are far less "cookie-cutter" than a lot of part 3s. C-Moon's example isn't even the best in my opinion, Araki has thought up tons of amazing Stands, and even more so than the Stands themselves, how they're used, hence why I love JoJo more than anything.

Yu Yu Hakusho had great buildup, but the ending felt super compressed and abrupt for sure

so much cringe

Part 5 is a fan favorite

Giorno is my the worst protagonist. There's like a huge power gap between him and the next protagonist.

that sounds like a issue with jolyne and akari not gio

No way its worse than part 1. I'm a big Jojo fanboy and part 1 bored me to death. I refuse to believe part 6 is worse.

Then go ahead and believe that?

Just the art and the Stand battles should easily put it above Part 1 at least. Even if the writing is potato.

ok

You take that back now!

Nope, its easily the shittiest in the entire series

Looks like someone couldn't handle Araki's(more homoerotic than part 5) ride.

I personally loved the first 3 or 4 episodes of Jojo, a lot was going on and the story was pretty good. Some of the worst episodes come after them though.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the first 3 episodes instantly hooked me, it was predictable (seriously the OP summarizes them), a typical 80s shounen, but I still love it. It also [](/s "has the guts to actually kill characters for real") and an amazing soundrack, seriously, Roundabout as an ending theme, how does it not win all the ED contests ever?

I love it when the acoustic strumming comes in at the end of the episode. Just makes me want to watch the next one right away. (as if the cliff-hanger didn't already!)

The Online Gaming/Pyramid Scheme arc in Welcome to the NHK.

I enjoyed that part of the show, but it was really shoehorned in.

SAO = Alfheim (Fairy Dance) arc. I just CANNOT STAND OBERON.  
Naruto = I forgot what arc I disliked, there have been SO MANY.

Let's ignore fillers.

Which arc did you not like in Naruto? Which ones in Naruto Shippuden? 

Just for curiosity sakes. 
>> ARTICLE
That curry arc (Although Lee's face at the sight of the curry is hilarious) , the New Chuunin Exams in Shippuden (That guy swinging his flab around and sweating all the time was just disgusting) and the War, because it goes on too long, and [Naruto war arc spoilers](/s "Shikaku was too awesome to die")
>> ARTICLE
My biggest dissapointment was after the Pain arc, I feel all the characters [spoiler](/s "that died should have stayed dead, and after that I really wanted to see more of the sage mode of Naruto, I was really let down that he got another powerup with the Kyuuby first power spike, and then he gets another one, and another one, and then the biggest part that really made me want to kick the author ass was killing Madara for someone weaker than him, like wtf? But still I like the series, I hate all those fillers though and the studio that animated it was the one that destroyed my favorite manga Tokyo Ghoul so yeah.")

Everything after that arc felt rushed, I thought we would have more fillers arc with Naruto using that power more, but then all the power ups came :/
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'd agree actually. 

I understood the plot points, including the final nemesis but yeah.. The execution was far from ideal.

Tokyo Ghoul aye, I've only read the manga. Didn't bother with watching the anime. Heard they messed up Kaneki's development really badly.
>> ARTICLE
To me was the war that killed that manga/anime for me. Akatsuki had a fucking *great* headstart with *everything*, they had the numbers, the means and literally could take the world in a fucking *second* AND they got all the fucking Kages in **ONE PLACE** and what does one of the strongest ninjas of all time? While the kages were on the verge of fighting themselves he fucking CHALLENGES them. Why? WHY? The only fucking thing that could have stopped him was if the whole ninja world united against him and he *actively made them do that*.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. It's still my favorite but I agree. It was going downhill. 

Biggest disappointment was the way they evolved the Sharingan. It was perfect at the start. Just an asset.

Story wise as well. The war made sense and so did some of the events that happened during it, but the execution was... not good.
>> ARTICLE
Second biggest disappointment IMO. First biggest disappointment was Sakura. She get so much build up and setup in Part 1, and the beginning of Part 2, then shoots down to terribad so fast.
>> ARTICLE
I know mate. She's a second Tsunade yet.... 
>> ARTICLE
Just finished Cross Game, and I loved it. That said, I was pretty bored with all the Women's baseball stuff in the show. It just felt kinda unnecessary, and ended up not really serving much of a purpose other than reminding us how great a pitcher Aoba is and how dedicated she is to the men's team, two things we already knew. I found out later that those plot points weren't in the manga and got added in just for the anime adaptation. Not terrible by any means, but considering how great the show was, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed whenever that "rival" girl appeared to recruit Aoba, like "not this again." 

Not really an "arc", but I also felt like the subplot with Aoba's live in cousin who had a thing for her ended up being completely unnecessary. I was intrigued when it was first introduced, because I thought the introduction of another guy who knew Aoba very well, and was actually aggressively pursuing her, might rumble up some jealously in Kou and jump-start some KouxAoba romance. But in the end it never really did, and Azuma/Akane ended up serving that very role later on. The character didn't really amount to anything story-wise. Plus the dude was kinda annoying. 
>> ARTICLE
just finished cross game. And I kinda agree with women's baseball stuff, but from the different perspective. I wasn't bored by it at all. It made the role of great character even more pronounced (I'm not sure on which MC the story focused more as a result). But it had the annoying side effect of Aoba's story having no proper closure and indeed this "rival thing" ended up having not much of a purpose.

Also totally agree with Aoba's cousin.

Still, I loved this anime. And I'm astonished by the fact it's kids show.
>> ARTICLE
Greed Island in HxH was so meh. It was really just a glorified training arc. It was the only one of the three major arcs that I didn't love. Even though it wasn't that bad it was inconsistent and I was expecting better (which made me like it less than I probably should have). Like seriously, it was the whole reason Gon and Killua go to Yorknew in the first place, so I was expecting something grand. And yeah, Zoldyck family was probably worse overall but I just didn't like GI except for the dodgeball game.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, Greed Island pretty much prevents me from giving HxH anything above an 8.
>> ARTICLE
For me, Yorknew and CA redeemed it but GI was pretty weak so I feel you 
>> ARTICLE
Considering that it was my favorite arc, in what is my favorite anime, I would probably disagree with you. It being a glorified training arc was partially what was awesome about it. It took the concept, and perfected it while making the entire arc a nonstop thrill-ride.
>> ARTICLE
Glad you liked it! As for it being a glorified training arc, that's not a bad thing to me, I was just expecting an epic arc especially after Yorknew set the bar so high 
>> ARTICLE
The worst in my opinion was the Chimera Ant. Bear in mind I quit watching half way through but it was just going downhill...
>> ARTICLE
I think anyone that watched all the way through it will say anything about it, except that it went downhill. It's a shame though, since by reading your other spoiler-tagged comment you literally stopped watching at the time where it was going to pick back up, because you are right, it starts pretty meh.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the Chimera Ant arc was pretty good, but I feel like it would have been much better if the damn narrator didn't keep pointing out the obvious to me just to extend the show.
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't something done to extend the show, it was there in the manga as well. As much as people want to act like this show doesn't exist, Toriko actually did/does the same thing and makes it work so gloriously every time.
>> ARTICLE
The ending is the best part but if you didn't like it when the king showed up, you probably won't like the rest.
>> ARTICLE
[Chimera Arc Spoiler](/s "I only got to where the rabbit? discovers he can uses Nen. After he's defeated by Gon's party. A lot had to do with how I felt about chimeras in general. Especially after the excellent setup the arc had. The introduction of Ging's apprentice, his work as a hunter. The situation in NGL, the death of archer guy. I'm slowly rewatching the series, I'll finish it this time. But yeah, don't think the king appeared.")


>> ARTICLE
Lol, this is like nothing, surely if you watch it all (try to binge watch it), then you'll probably change opinion.

Would be nice to see your thoughts about the series once you finish it ;) especially the CA arc.
>> ARTICLE
Can you spoiler tag that please?
>> ARTICLE
Your opinion may change once you finish it as it picks up once the royal guard is born. Just don't go in expecting anything too exciting as its very slow paced, but you probably already know that. Also bear with the narrator.
>> ARTICLE
That's what another person just said in this thread to me.

Given that I like the series overall, I'll definitely finish it this rewatch. 
>> ARTICLE
Hope you like it :)
>> ARTICLE
idk I thought the worst arc in HxH was the the final one
>> ARTICLE
I personally think that [Manga Spoilers](/s "It does a great job as a short transition arc from the Chimera Ant arc to the Dark Continent arc. It sets up Leorio, Kurapica, Ging, and Pariston as the next four main characters, whilst tying up loose ends with Gon and Killua. This journey to the continent is important enough to draw in a lot of characters from previous arcs and heavily involves the Zodiacs. Also,  Something (Nanika) is a similar being to the enemies they'll be facing in the next arc and introduces us to the next power level.")
>> ARTICLE
Is the manga still going on? Cause the last chapter i read was like a year ago I think and I haven't seen any updates. 
>> ARTICLE
Saying it's ongoing isn't exactly accurate. It is certainly not finished, but yeah, last chapter that came out, did so last year.
>> ARTICLE
Imo it offered the perfect resolution for the entire show [](/s "with Gon finding Ging. Also has the Leorio punch. It accomplishes what it tries to do, but one of the complaints I have is that one of the things it tries to accomplish is setting up the DC arc and then the anime just abruptly ends :(")

That being said I respect your opinion and it definitely wasn't one of the stronger arcs.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped it before Greed Island at around, episode 40. Unlike OP, I actually enjoyed the first two arcs, but thought that Heaven's Arena was pretty bad. I really didn't like the introduction of nen at all.
>> ARTICLE
I can understand that. Though just FYI, the characters use nen very creatively at points
>> ARTICLE
I completely disagree and think Greed Island is one of the best arcs. What fucked up was the chimera ant arc's extremely slow pacing for a great ending that ended up being unsatisfactory due to this EXTREMELY slow pacing that completely turned me off from watching the show I otherwise thought was perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Agree with your point about the CA arc
>> ARTICLE
The Greed Island arc was so uninteresting to me that I actually stopped watching the show. I still think about going back to it now & then, since it's so well loved... idk, I don't watch many long 50+ episode shows, so it's hard to want to get back into it.
>> ARTICLE
Skip Greed Island and jump straight into Chimera Ant. My god /r/anime wasn't kidding about that arc.
>> ARTICLE
I was fine with the arc, but the one thing that caught be off guard was bisky...... OH GOD
>> ARTICLE
The next major arc after that (Chimera Ant) is fantastic but its extremely slow with 70 something episodes and its one of those things you like more after its done. I liked yorknew more but I'd say the CA arc is definitely worth the watch. It has its flaws but bear with it and you won't regret it. 
>> ARTICLE
> It has its flaws but bear with it and you won't regret it. 

Says you. I wish I quit halfway through the arc like I planned.
>> ARTICLE
I loved it but I know what you mean. The arc had some major flaws
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, some parts dragged on for far too long (The palace assault says hello, and don't forget about Pouf having multiple 10 minute orgasms about Mereum). A lot of the ants weren't that interesting to me either, there were some amazing fights though.

You could probably shave off a dozen episodes/compress some and it would've helped with the pacing issues immensely.
>> ARTICLE
Also the narrator, pacing and the fact that a lot of my favorite characters were shoved to the side out of nowhere for 70+ episodes. I still think it was fascinating that they spent so many episodes on such a short timespan though
>> ARTICLE
I consider Chimera arc to be a masterpiece within anime in its storytelling and what makes HxH so good. 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. No other anime has spent who knows how many episodes covering only one hour in the actual world. Yorknew is definitely my favorite but I can honestly say I've never seen anything else like the Chimera ant arc
>> ARTICLE
>No other anime has spent who knows how many episodes covering only one hour in the actual world. 

Maybe if it actually covered different things happening but the reason it took so long was because the narrator continuously narrated things we were JUST SHOWN. e.g. if someone got attacked the narrator would say something like "X caught Y off guard. Y contemplates his next move while X patiently waits for me to finish my narration. Y ate grilled cheese yesterday."
>> ARTICLE
LOL, unfortunately that's a problem in a lot of anime
>> ARTICLE
But dodgeball :(
>> ARTICLE
I loved the training, it was my favorite part of the arc. It was so refreshing in a shonen to see training like that. It harkened back to early Dragon Ball with Master Roshi's training to me. I love seeing how they get better. 
>> ARTICLE
What killed it was that the Bombers had no story. None of them had any backstory. Hair eating guy had better devellopement.
>> ARTICLE
This was my only real problem with Greed Island. I didn't mind the training sequences, and I thought the idea of it was really cool. HxH always has great villains, from Chrollo and the Troupe to Hisoka to the Ants, all of them are really interesting personalities that are extremely entertaining to watch. The same just isn't true of the Bombers.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, bomber was by far the worst main antagonist out of the main three arcs

This god forsaken starfish arc in Clannad, fucks sake man

The starfish arc was awesome and cute. It was so funny seeing Fuuko delivering those stars. The boring one, IMO, was the Kotomi arc.

Loved the Tomoya & Nagisa development..hated everything else.
>> ARTICLE
what? It was actually my favorite part of all clannad :(
>> ARTICLE
The thing about Fuuko's arc for me was that [Clannad Spoilers](/s "At first, I really really hated Fuuko because to me she was just such an annoying character, no depth, no complexity whatsoever and also just acted obnoxious. However, once it hit what was actually happening, and how everyone was forgetting her, that made it probably the second hardest hitting sadness in the show, including Clannad AS. The combination of her childhood innocence and the absolute cruelty happening to her all of a sudden made her struggle so much more sad, and that's what probably hooked me more onto Clannad/anime than anything.")

>> ARTICLE
Agreed.  I liked the Fuuko arc.
>> ARTICLE
Probably the 'filler hell' arch that was the last 80 or so episodes of Naruto. I still think that the original Naruto series is really good, as long as you skip all of the filler. 
>> ARTICLE
What filler? ;)

Actually, no joke, I never watched it. Maybe if I lose a few marbles and start writing fanfiction or something, I'll watch the fillers just to get some absurd ideas to adapt.
>> ARTICLE
Fullbringer in Bleach.. Awful.
>> ARTICLE
I'm one of the rare few that actually liked the Fullbring arc. At least, the ending was pretty decent, animation quality stepped up, and an attempt at a plot twist was made. I shut my brain off and enjoyed it. 

Most filler arcs were bad though (Invading Army was aight)...

I will say, the Fake Karakura Town and Hueco Mundo arcs were both much too long, and took forever to get interesting.

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass is a anime original, nothing is non-canon. Was it padding? Probably. 
>> ARTICLE
CG is original material, isn't it? Not based off any source. Therefore there cannot be filler, per se. 
>> ARTICLE
> Therefore there cannot be filler, per se.

Filler is anything that is used to "pad out" material of higher quality or relevance.

For example, it is commonplace for music albums to have 3-4 great songs, and the rest are known to the musicians and the studio to be tracks of lesser quality, those are referred to as filler. Courtney Love once famously said that the recording companies are afraid of music piracy only because they are afraid of their own filler, meaning that the fans can listen to the albums beforehand instead of paying full price for a black box and being disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
TIL the actual definition
>> ARTICLE
There are also half-fillers (?), where the original creator of the source material gives guidance/writes the plot, but doesn't include it in the main work because of time constraints or other reasons.

Naruto: The Last movie is an example I think.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Railgun has a similar situation. I think Kamachi had some input in the Railgun season 1 filler arcs, but they're still non-canon.

one piece has sort of fallen off a cliff after the time skip sadly, i plan on reading all of dressrosa in one guy eventually, but reading it week by week with over 20 characters doing little by little was just too much.

Well, Dressrosa's done now, in case you didn't know.
>> ARTICLE
It had a lot of extra stuff that could have been omitted, but wasn't because Oda wanted it in. I think it will lend itself well to a binge read though.

So for me it's 1/3 post timeskip, which isn't good, but the direction we're heading in now makes me pretty happy and I think it'll make up for FI/PH.

Really? So everyone liked the foxy arc? 
>> ARTICLE
Davy Back Fight was entertaining to me. Afro Luffy was pretty goddamn funny.
>> ARTICLE
and it was a lighthearted segue into aokiji's first appearance
>> ARTICLE
Fishman Island was just a poorly timed arc. Oda wanted something to show off how strong everyone got. But he took too long with it and it became a huge bore. It could have been compressed to: Shirahoshi is weapon, Hordy and co. are threatening her and the kingdom, Strahats wreck shit. There was no need for the strawhats to become enemies of the state or anything else in that arc. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow OP was one of the first anime I started, years ago, and I had the inpression it was always like the fishman arc. Maybe Ill pick it up again and get through it 
>> ARTICLE
Chimera Ant arc was my favorite even though it dragged everything as long as it could. Weakest was the first one imo.
>> ARTICLE
I was pretty pulled into HxH during the first arc honestly, I think I marathon'd most of it. The Zoldyck Family arc wasn't great, but then Yorknew was my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
I think the Chimera Ant arc had some great parts, mostly whenever Meruem was on screen, but there were alot of slow parts and side stories I didn't care about at all (the octopus guy and wolf guy episodes come to mind). 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the Fishman Island arc was terrible. Certainly the racism was a little overplayed but I don't think it was bad. Thriller Bark was the lowpoint of One Piece for me. Brook joining and singing Bink's Booze were really the only highlights from that for me.

High School arc in Clannad: AS. I wasn't a big fan of Clannad and wasn't expecting another high school arc in AS.
>> ARTICLE
The portion of AS which is in high school actually counts as three distinct arcs. With AS itself counting as 1. That gives it really weird pacing, four arcs with one consuming more than 2/3 of the entire anime. What happened was that these were some leftover arcs from the VN that they hadn't included in the original, so they were just wrapping up loose threads. Then you get into the actual After Story arc from the VN.
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense as the beginning arcs in AS had the exact same feel as Clannad did.
>> ARTICLE
Nadeko Snake was a pretty awful arc imo.
>> ARTICLE
Her exorcism scene was unbelievably uncomfortable to watch
>> ARTICLE
It was kind of the point, no? Nadeko is one of the most sexualized of the cast and the contrast between being sexualized and violated is highlighted here.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, it absolutely was, I'm not saying it detracted from the experience -- everything we see or feel is basically what Araragi feels. I'm sure he was uncomfortable in that moment.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, But Nadeko Medusa is pretty close to being my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
It made me hate Nadeko *so much*. Which doesn't make it bad, if anything, it's great that it could make me feel so strongly about a character. She's still shit, though.

Hitagi End made everything super satisfying.

Snake did nothing wrong.

I actually really like her character.

She's undoubtedly not a healthy character, but her design is great and her development is top notch.

Also [best girl](/s "Kaiki") is always great to have,

You see, it gave me the exact opposite reaction. I absolutely loved Nadeko after Medusa, whereas before, I thought she was cute, but only felt ambivalent about her beyond that. Other than maybe Misato, she's probably my favorite female character in anime from a pure development perspective, and also in my top three as far as enjoyable personalities.

Yotsugi Doll (aka Tsukimonogatari).

All it did was do some vague buildup for something that may or may not happen in the future and hammer in some things about Araragi we already knew from before, coupled with some really tired gags. Felt quite pointless, really. Then again I don't find Ononoki interesting in the least, so that might be a big reason for my dislike. 
>> ARTICLE
Tsuki felt to me like it was written almost entirely to deliver Ononoki's closing line of dialogue: [Tsukimonogatari](/s ""I'm sure there was a way to solve this without killing him. Yet, the reason I killed him anyway...is because I am a monster. Don't end up like this, Araragi. When humans become like this, it's the end of them""). It sounded like the introductory idea for the next season.

For me the pacing was only really intolerable in the second half. When the narrator mentioned that the last 6 episodes were 3 minutes of time in show, I put my face in my palms. It only got worse from there.

The first half wasn't great pacing wise, but at least it wasn't that bad.

its usually the opposite for most people where chimera ant carried the show other than yorknew lol

It had a great setup certainly but it just went downhill for me after it. A lot was to do with how I felt about chimeras in general. I quit around the episode the rabbit discovers he can uses nen after he's defeated by Gon's party. Whichever episode that was.

Maybe it gets better. I'm slowly burning through a rewatch so I'll get to it eventually. See if it actually improves.

This is my personal favorite part of the Hunter Exam Arc. With the perspective shifts going on, it keeps a really fast pace, and keeps the viewer invested in what's going on.

We get to see one of my favorite Hisoka moments too, when he's wandering around the forest suffering from what I can only describe as the world's worst case of violence-blue-balls, which really serves to hammer home just how fucked up this individual is.

 I'm on episode 13! So far, I've marathoned the episodes up until now, since I saw the threads a bit too late. However, I'll see it as a challenge to not watch ahead and stick to the schedule! 
>> ARTICLE
I was so excited about the rewatch because I wanted to see the opinions of first time watcher but now everyone's ahead of schedule. I sure hope we still have some people left with enough self control once we get to a certain arc. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not ahead of schedule I'm just catching up. The first arc was pretty horrible. It alternated between painfully childish and painfully edgy, strangely enough the background music don't seem to follow the switch very well which has been especially jarring. None of the characters as of yet are remotely unique or likeable, and the world building has been atrocious illogical, why would anyone allow Hunters to get away with murder and why aren't people using guns instead of primitive weapons if there are laptops. I really hope the show gets better because, as of yet the only positive thing I can say about the show is that sometimes the fight scenes are fluidly animated.

I'm honestly surprised by all the people getting ahead of schedule. Why is this show held in such high regard and when does it cease to be awful?
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm pretty biased regarding the show since I've been reading the manga for years but I do understand your criticism. The first arc is generally considered the weakest. The following one will be quite short and the one after introduces the power system of the show. After that it gets really good. All I can say is that many people dislike the hunter exam arc. I still enjoy it but I recognize its flaws, especially now that I'm rewatching it. It will get alot better though, the show doesn't score so high for no reason.
>> ARTICLE
I sincerely hope you're right.

At this point the greater danger is that I'll lap the field.  Currently on 138.

That's perfectly fine. I'm honestly enjoying it more the second time at a slower pace.

Currently watching this show. I really hated the exam arc but I'm glad I stuck through it. I've been enjoying it since around episode 30 and now I'm at the end of Greed Island. Will start slowing down so the threads can catch up to me. Will be interesting hearing what other people have to say.

>> ARTICLE
I personally love this part of Greed Island as much as the next, despite the low amount of action, as we get finally get the in-depth look at Nen's intricacies that the intensity of Yorknew left no time for.

* The [Ryu](http://hunterxhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Nen#Ryu)-sparing in episode 64 lays the groundwork for understanding future battles more deeply in a reasonably engaging fashion.

Perhaps it is because I am an avid gamer, but I greatly appreciate the minute commentaries on game design and player mentality we receive throughout this arc. For me, Greed Island is Togashi and Ging's way of expressing the vibrance of Nen (and games) and how it is destructive people (like Bomber) that twist them into something bloody and dark. 

The whimsical atmosphere and training montage act as both a delightful reprieve from the knife-edge intensities of Yorknew and a strong build-up towards the confrontation with Bomber.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not a huge fan of the first half of this arc because it's mostly training. The Bomber is definitely my least favorite main antagonist in the series even though he has a pretty interesting power.

There's nothing definitive yet, but someone once noticed something that may give The Bomber some really interesting significance later on. I really hope their theory was right because it would be so good.

Huh, that's interesting. But I don't think we'll ever know...
>> ARTICLE
Why's that?
>> ARTICLE
As if Togashi will ever make so much progress in the manga. He has given up on it for now...
>> ARTICLE
That's what people said before he returned from his last hiatus. People over exaggerate how much Togashi goes on hiatus. Fact is, there has always been at least 2 canon chapters of Hunter x Hunter every year since 1998.
>> ARTICLE
2 chapters per year is literally pitiful honestly. He can do whatever he wants, it's his story and his universe, but let's not act like what he's doing is adequate.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not acting like what he's doing is adequate. I'm disproving the notion that he's given up completely.
>> ARTICLE
First, people were right complaining about his last hiatus. He hadn't written a chapter for a year and a half, made 9 chapters, and resumed his hiatus until further notice. It's been nearly a year since then.

Also, you point that fact as good? I'd say it's bad. At least I wouldn't say it's an exaggeration to say that he is not producing nearly enough content from '06 till now. Well ok, it's his manga after all, but I think I'm entitled to being a bit salty...
>> ARTICLE
You don't really understand what I'm saying. I am by no means making excuses for Togashi or saying that the hiatuses aren't ridiculously long and bad. However you said, like many others that: "He has given up on it for now..." which is a 100% false statement. The very fact that he's not gone an entire year without writing at least some chapters disproves it.
>> ARTICLE
The graphics are nice, but the gameplay is menotinus and boring.

* **Thoughts on that arc of the show.**

 * [Hisoka's face](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/HwuVb_0wqhg/hqdefault.jpg) when he realized Chrollo couldn't fight him was the funniest thing I've seen so far. What a dicktease that fight ended up being!

 * The Yorknew arc was incredible. The ending and fates of the main characters were ultimately decided by the differing wills of the spiders. While the boss was more concerned about the group's fate than his own, some of his followers loved him so much to betray him and save him instead of putting the group first. Kurapika bet everything on this and won because of it.

 * Speaking of Kurapika, I really think his crisade took a toll on him emotionally. He didn't want to even talk to Gon or Killia before they left, and I couldn't help but think it was guilt. Guilt for (unintentionally) dragging them into his fight, getting them captured twice and nearly getting them killed. He struggled to realize that even though it was his grudge, the strong bonds between him and his friends would end up involving them, and ultimately it was a selfish crusade in that very roundabout way. 

 * The moment where Gon and Killua met two of the Spiders at the auction house *after* their conflict was memorable. Not a week removed from the hostage exchange. They were able to gain a mutual respect for each other through Pakunoda's memories, and I love when opponents can do that. 

 * And perhaps the most interesting part of the whole arc eas that the conflict didn't end with one side completely obliterating the other. It didn't need to. 

I'm not too intrigued by Greed Island so far because it's just training, but Gon and Killua really need training given how utterly helpless they were in fighting the Spiders. Also, we finally have a best girl candidate so that's nice. One in 67 episodes isn't bad!
>> ARTICLE
Is Leorio ever going to matter in this show? I feel like he's about 40 episodes behind the others in the quartet in terms of development, personality-wise and combat strength-wise. Although the hotel blackout scene was pretty cool.

Actually, don't answer that question.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if he will matter as a fighter. I don't think he has any interest in becoming strong, he's only mentioned wanting to be a doctor as his passion. It seems like some hunters aren't that interested in fighting strength, like the food hunters we met in the very beginning. 

However he played a crucial role in organizing and coordinating the capture of Chrollo, which saved Gon and Killua. So he mattered a little it, if only for his wits. You could argue he was *more* useful than Gon and Killua this arc. 
>> ARTICLE
You might have to wait a while, but don't worry, his time will come. ^(Hopefully that was vague enough for you?)
>> ARTICLE
Ugh, so this week's episodes were another step downwards in quality. I don't understand why this show has so many training arcs, not only are they repetitive, but they're not remotely emotionally compelling. As for ~~Hunter Art Online~~ Greed Island itself, it's nice that it's not actually a video game and as such justifies that people die when they're killed, but I can't say I find the card game mechanics very interesting, at least as they've been employed so far. Why are the Phantom Troupe still hanging out together, weren't they supposed to go their separate ways after meeting up? The bomber and his minions are rather boring villains especially considering Hunter x Hunter's propensity to make all of its characters colorful, but what leaves me most worried about this arc is the lack of urgency and conflict, most clearly illustrated when Kilua runs off to become a hunter halfway through. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry it's just a set up arc. Gon and Killua needs this training arc since they're aren't strong enough for the "real" thing. You might find the villains boring, I do too, but even those boring villains are really strong. This arc's spotlight IMO is in the next episodes to come where Razor, the one who sent the Phantom Troupe away, becomes involved.
>> ARTICLE
Of course Gon and Killua haven't fully developed their powers yet, but I think it's a poor decision on the part of the writer to chose to do so through yet another training arc.
>> ARTICLE
It was either a training arc, or an asspull later on the show.  I think the training arc sounds better.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously are you that close-minded? What about the characters gradually growing stronger during their adventures without explicitly devoting time to training, having a time skip or simply having it so that the villains aren't as strong so that a training arc isn't required?

Moreover, a 3 minute ass pull such as Gon's abilities suddenly inexplicably becoming stronger, would save us from having to sit through 4 episodes worth of training seems like an excellent trade off.
>> ARTICLE
>Seriously are you that close-minded?

I believe you're closed-minded.  I mean if you expect someone getting stronger doesn't require training, I'm deeply worried about your health.  Plus the training arc was needed to expand on the power they have obtained as well as the background on Nen.  This will help explain later battles.  It also develops the characters more along with their relationship.  There's even more to them.  This isn't Naruto where they skip all the training, pull asspulls everywhere, and hardly care about character development.

>What about the characters gradually growing stronger during their adventures without explicitly devoting time to training

That's like asking for a major asspull right there!  If getting stronger were that simple, then why the Fuck am I going to gym!  I might as well go an adventure.  Fuck!  Ash Ketchum must be fucking ripped right now.

> or simply having it so that the villains aren't as strong so that a training arc isn't required?

It's like you hate realism or something.  Villains are going to keep getting stronger and stronger.  You might as well drop this show.  There will be no realism if out of nowhere the MC is the strongest character that don't need no training.   The MC may be strong but there are stronger characters as shown in the phantom troupe arc.  Have you forgotten that the MC just got rekt by Hisoka?!?!  The author wanted the anime to be realistic.  And that's what we are getting.  

>Moreover, a 3 minute ass pull such as Gon's abilities suddenly inexplicably becoming stronger, would save us from having to sit through 4 episodes worth of training seems like an excellent trade off.

Go back to watching Naruto!  At least there you don't have to worry about realism ruining your show with a bunch of training arcs.  God Fuck this shit!  I'm done. /rant

To everyone who think that the miniture rose was an asspull: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/3c5onj/spoilers_netero_chimera_ant_arc/csshvb5

This thread provide some (to me at least) solid arguments why it was not an asspull without foreshadowing. 
It could have been more obvious, but I like it more subtle.


>> ARTICLE
A point against all that is the significant tendency for climaxes to take place in 1-vs-1 scenarios; the wartime motif was weakened by this trope. More wartime-suitable teamwork is often left for minor sequences, like the first encounter with Rammot.

That said, it is definitely a fault of the viewer for being stuck in the "honorable shounen duel" mindset after all the exposition we've received about oppression, military brutality, espionage, PTSD, etc.. We've been on the path of ruthless tactics long before the Miniature Rose detonated.

Perhaps this is a reflection of how compelling some people find Meruem? *They were cheering for him so deeply that his defeat came as a shock.*
>> ARTICLE
ehhhh i think it was pretty obvious Netero had something on his sleeve, plus all hints showed Neruem was pretty much god, no human could even fight with him
>> ARTICLE
People think it was an asspull? I thought it was pretty obvious that it was going to end that way. They definitely put in enough foreshadowing for me to catch on and I'm usually pretty dense.

* [The song that plays when Killua debuts his Godspeed ability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4zM5XbRzHE) is definitely going on the workout playlist. I'd heard great things about this anime but I wonder why I've never heard the soundtrack specifically get praise. It's definitely up there with the best.

* I read a discussion about episode 126 that said Netero's final line was changed to "Meruem, King of Ants, you understand nothing of humanity's **infinite potential for evolution**," when it was originally ""Meruem, King of Ants, you understand nothing of humanity's **bottomless capability for malice.**" The latter line is more fitting towards Netero's attitude in the final showdown.

* "The fake, in its genuine attempt to be real, is more real than the real thing." That quote (from Nisemonogatari) keeps echoing in my head because throughout this story, I think the Ants in their genuine attempt to become human are more humane (generally) than the humans trying to wipe them out. It's hard not to argue that Netero, driven to kill by pride and hatred in the end, was a bigger monster than the Ant King, who was calm and collected throughout the final fight, not in a cocky (I'm stronger than you and I'm just toying with you) way but in a way that genuinely wanted a peaceful negotiation. He even talked about his change of heart and plan for the survival of the human race even when the Ants became the dominant one.
>> ARTICLE
> infinite potential for evolution

I always thought that line was a bit odd, now I get why
>> ARTICLE
> that said Netero's final line was changed to "Meruem, King of Ants, you understand nothing of humanity's infinite potential for evolution," when it was originally ""Meruem, King of Ants, you understand nothing of humanity's bottomless capability for malice."  

I think it is more that the original has both the kanji for evolution and furigana for malice written.

>> ARTICLE
I've always been a fan of [the theme that comes on when Netero and Meruem break into the tomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfR9haRPlSc). The soundtrack is above average, but it's greatest strength is the context in which you hear the songs. Pretty much every song that comes on in the show (from Heaven's Arena on) perfectly matches what you're seeing on screen.

Meruem is one of my favorite villains because he went from being a monster to being close to human because of his experiences (instead of being born that way). I also love how Netero was referred to as a monster in episode 111.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with a lot of what you're saying, but if memory serves, Meruem was still talking about using humans as a food source and keeping them contained at the end of the fight--he was just saying he'd be nice and fair about it. To put it one way, it was still the magnanimity of the *predator* to the *prey*. 

That's what I like about this arc: it's not a battle over morals, it's a battle for the **top of the food chain.** Survival, freedom... it was all on the line for both races, and the one trump card mankind has in this desperate battle?

>"... humanity's **bottomless capability for malice.**"

Though, I still want to know the details of his new ability, despite it being years since I read the scene in the manga.

I fucking lost it after like 8 episodes since the start the invasion the narrator said something like "only 30 seconds have passed since they started".
>> ARTICLE
Nothing like watching three episodes in which only an hour passes.
>> ARTICLE
An hour? When the invasion started, 3 episodes was like a minute of time for Gon and co.
>> ARTICLE
Well the first episode was exactly half an hour if I remember correctly. Then there was the episode where like a single minute passes... After that I didn't keep up with how much time had passed so I just rounded up to an hour.
>> ARTICLE
Haha I started rewatching about 5 or 6 days ago and I'm on ep 57. Hopefully I can catch up. Wish I started rewatching while you all were in the phantom troupe arc like I am haha, this arc is amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
So you just saw the Kurapika fight? The Phantom Troupe is my second favorite arc after the Palace Invasion.

At that pace you might be able to catch up by next week. Now **that** discussion will be interesting...
>> ARTICLE
Greed Island was always my favorite arc when I was reading the manga. I just really enjoyed the whole collecting thing and that practically everything in that world save for players could be cards.   
  
After finishing the anime though, I gotta say it's Chimera Ants > Phantom Troupe > Greed Island. I dunno why but the Greed Island arc didn't step up like I remembered it in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Haha yes! Phantom troupe probably is my favorite, I'll have to see once I get to the palace arc again :p and hopefully! :)
>> ARTICLE
The whole reason I don't join in on all these rewatches. I sure as hell know I don't want to watch only one episode a day of Madoka.
>> ARTICLE
This arc is rivaling Goku vs Frieza in terms of time it takes to finish a battle. So far less than an hour has passed since the battle in the palace began.
>> ARTICLE
Thankfully this is the only arc that does that. After this is over it goes back to short and sweet again.

....and then after 1 arc you're caught up with the manga.

Most of the same problems as last week, in particular the naration during the fight scenes egregiously disrupts any sense of urgency. To be honest I was rather disappointed that Knuckle saved Morel and in turn let Yuppi live, while I understand why he did it (not that I agree) it really makes all the episodes spent on that fight feel like a waste of time. As much as I see that they're building towards something with Palm, but it felt really anti-climatic when the fight against Yuppi and the king cut back to Ikalgo's struggles, all the tension just drops to the floor. As predicted Netero died, I doubt that ~~nuke~~ [rose bomb](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo) will stop the king, but it's always interesting to see Japanese commentary on the most destructive of weapons. Lastly, Killua supercharging himself, was pretty awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree. When Chapter 7 Bankruptcy was deactivated I literally paused and looked at my friend and said "Really? The last 10 episodes were a waste of time!"
>> ARTICLE
in the manga is even worse believe me
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I'm pretty sure at least 50% of the text during this arc were narration squares. 
>> ARTICLE
Manga? More like a light novel.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of like how they spent so much time planning the invasion only for everything to be pretty much pointless in the end. Meruem willingly agreed to accompany Netero alone so there really wasn't any need for them to go to such lengths to seperate him from the royal guard. The only one succeding in keeping his target away from the king is Gon and to him, seperating Pitou from the king isn't even his real objective.

To me it certainly doesn't feel like a waste of time because I very much enjoyed the episodes leading up. Their efforts ultimately being pointless doesn't negate my previous enjoyment. Not to mention that I'm not necessariliy watching the show just to see the main characters beat the bad guys.
>> ARTICLE
The whole point of fighting Youpi was to waste time. Killing him would be ideal, but the whole point of Morel's group was to stall the Royal Guard so Netero could fight Meruem alone
>> ARTICLE
Of course, but what I mean is that it felt like a waste of the viewers time.
>> ARTICLE
fair enough
>> ARTICLE
The Phantom troupe is still just a great set of lovable villains.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously? I must be one of the rare few who hate them.
>> ARTICLE
Hate them for what they do or hate them for their character design?
>> ARTICLE
They're heartless killers full of arrogance. They slaughtered Kurapikas entire clan on a whim and continue to murder people without any remorse. Their hypocrisy also irritates me. There's many things about them that make me hate them. Feitan torturing people doesn't help either. I don't understand how they could be "loveable". They've probably killed more people than the Ants.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure about /u/MaxAugust but I'm a big fan of the Spiders as characters.  That's why I asked.

Kurapika's fight was amazing, one of the best in the series as I'm pretty sure it's the first to truly showcase how powerful Nen can be.

Gon's and Killua's reaction when they were caught and Hisoka almost getting caught were really great moments.
>> ARTICLE
Kurapika's brutal when he's pissed. I love how he's just depressed when he sees the fake bodies.
>> ARTICLE
Maaaaaaan this is why I love Kurapika. Yorknew arc is really something.
>> ARTICLE
The closing scene of ep 51 with the classical music and Chrollo conducting is one of my favourite television sequences of all time. Love the Phantom Troupe endlessly. 
>> ARTICLE
My favorite part this time around was when Hisoka tricked the spiders by switching out poems. He essentially countered the future sight ability by using Chrollo's intelligence against him.
>> ARTICLE
Phantom troupe best group i've yet to see in an anime.

Chrollo my fav character(pls Togashi).

Kurapika... fluff off.
>> ARTICLE
Chrollo is cool, but Hisoka completely plays him.
>> ARTICLE
The Kurapika screws them both over :p
>> ARTICLE
[Potential Spoilers?] (/s "With the condition/condition thing Kurapika has stating that if he uses his power on any non-spider member then he would die, when I first watched HxH I thought Kurapika and Hisoka would fight and when he uses his power he would die.")
>> ARTICLE
I felt like such a smart-ass when I made that assumption as well. "God, this is *so* predictable, I'm *way* too smart for these shows". Silly fool I turned out to be ;)


>> ARTICLE
Kurapika's condition confused a lot of people but no, he will not die if he fights someone other than a spider. The condition he placed on himself only applies to chain jail, the ability that completely nullifies aura. He could still fight Hisoka and survive provided he didn't use that ability. 
>> ARTICLE
That was what I was alluding to, him possibly using Chain Jail if his situation required it, without Kurapika realizing that Hisoka isn't a Troupe member. 
>> ARTICLE
Hisoka is a spider, he just wants to fight and kill Chrollo. Kurapika has no reason to fight him because he 1) helps out the good guys more often than not and 2) didn't wipe out the clan.
>> ARTICLE
But on episode 58, when Chrollo has a conditional bond placed on his heart preventing him from talking to other Troupe members, Hisoka reveals that he isn't a Troupe member by removing his tattoo. Chrollo realizes this and talks to Hisoka without consequence. This was also the same for Pakunoda, who speaks to Hisoka without consequence, realizing that he isn't a Troupe member. This is the same situation as Kurapika using Chain Jail on Hisoka, for whatever the reason. I'm implying that the situation between Hisoka vs. Kurapika could've arised, for whatever reason the manga writer could've decided. It can be justifiable to say that Hisoka was a member of the Troupe up until that point, however. I'm just alluding to the fact that this interaction between Hisoka and Kurapika would be an interesting little plot twist. 
>> ARTICLE
What the hell...its only the next ep but please spoiler tag that. 
>> ARTICLE
theres a rewatch going on? Man. I binged the whole thing in a week just a couple weeks ago =[. Oh well. First time watchers, enjoy!!
>> ARTICLE
Leaping off of what I said last week, we are seeing more well-orchestrated fights that serve a secondary purpose of taking us to the deep-end of Nen and foreshadowing Gon and Killua's potentially awesome futures as Hunters. Kurapika, the Troupe, then we even get the Zoldyck elders! We get to see a whole slew of epic abilities.

* One specific new aspect in these portions is the introduction of En. We get to see a basic version from Nobu of 2m, then a ridiculous demonstration of 100m from Zeno with the implied possibility of 300m.

A personal highlight occurred in episode 52: [Quirky knuckle crack!](http://i.imgur.com/llAQxQd.png) 

To me, this is just screams that Madhouse should have adapted Tokyo Ghoul. :I

----

Meta anime-viewing enjoyment aside, this slew was primarily dipped in secrets and intrigue. Togashi spares no expense in showing Nen is an organic part of the HxH universe he's crafted, and does not eclipse the world like in other series.

We get a crash course on fraud in the auction industry, espionage, and information control. 

The biggest moments for me is between episode 51 and 52. 

1. The Requiem. We are given time to digest Chrollo's fortune, then we see the despair of the mercenary he just tortured, the music, drops and we are inundated with with a similar despairing awe.
2. Kurapika being called back to his employer's side. As the viewer, we feel far more frustration than he ever will! We know his goal lied right beyond those doors - One more minute and we could have assisted the Zoldycks in an assured victory!!

----

Of course, we all must mention the final climatic moment with Hisoka in the spotlight!  

Togashi is painfully realistic with his characters' consistency. When Uvo's death and the threat of the chain-user is confirmed to the rest of the group, the general consensus is to flee. We see here how the Phantom Troupe deals with the threat of genuine death.

Hisoka's rewriting of his own fortune pushes my suspension of disbelief to its limit, but it is also the saving grace that keeps the troupe on track to a conflict with our protagonists. 

The aftermath unravels perfectly to setup what's the come. So exciting! \>w<

>> ARTICLE
Decidedly not as good a bunch of episodes as last week, but still better than everything yet. Ton and Killua had way too much plot armor, and there was barely a fight scene the entire time. I also find that hostage exchanges tend to be boring plot lines. I haven't consumed many arc based stories, but I really found the lack of closure frustrating. Ultimately I'm still intrigued by the Phantom Troupe, but it was disappointing to see so little character development over the course of so many episodes. Chrolo in particular seems like he could be really cool if some of the mysteries aground him were unveiled. At this point in time I would have a very hard time recommending this anime, because the first third was so weak, but as I'm already this far in I might as well keep on watching.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the lack of closure is really off putting. The thing is, there was no room for closure Gon, Killua, and Leorio couldn't do anything but assist, and Kurapika was way ahead of himself when he tried to take on the troupe. The way it ended was pretty well done IMO. No one won, and it strikes off a dark feeling of wondering if the good guys are really in the right mindset.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that in given the larger narrative scope, it would have been difficult to give a lot more closure if they intended to continue using the Phantom Troupe and Kurapika, in the story. But I question if that's the right decision, because it seems to me that a final confrontation between them will have to be shoe horned in (as opposed to given it's own place in the story), if we ever get one. I really do think that for a 20 episode arc is long enough, to permanently resolve a main character's conflict.

I've always considered the protagonists in this story to be alarmingly amoral, despite Gon's tendency to try to cooperate, none of the characters really seem concerned about if their actions are for the greater good.
>> ARTICLE
This is interesting because this arc is a favorite for a lot of people.  Can you explain where Gon and Killua had too much plot armor because I don't really see that?

>> ARTICLE
I found it hard to reconcile the tendency of the Phantom Troupe to kill first and laugh latter, with Gon and Killua being captured twice without injury (especially considering the sadism of some of the Troupe's members) and easily escape.
>> ARTICLE
As far as the Troupe was concerned, Gon and Killua were completely innocent, they were even checked by the Troupe's most trustworthy member. There are sadistic members of the Phantom Troupe, but outright killing children without notable gain isn't what they're known for. If anything, they other members thought Nobunaga was going too far when he decided to keep them and locked them in a room. Any other instance of their capture has them invulnerable via hostage situation. I wouldn't call this plot armor in the slightest.

In fighting anime, do they really need to call out the names of their attacks each time? Kind of makes it easy to dodge, right?
>> ARTICLE
In supernatural shounen anime, it doesn't bother me.

However action anime such as in Rurouni Kenshin, its so unnerving. Everyone has a different way to use a sword, and they will mention that as much as possible. The names are also very long sometimes. So when explaining a move, they will say the entire name, sometimes multiple times in just one sentence.

Example: *Hiten Mitsurugi Style Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki Final Attack*.


>> ARTICLE
Ultimately, this derives from the JoJo manga in the 80s. It proved popular with young boys, and never changed.
>> ARTICLE
From JoJo? No, older than that. Calling out your attacks was a staple of Mazinger Z, both the manga as well as the 1972 series.

"ROCKETTO PAAANCH!", "KOSHIRYOUKU BEEEEEEAM!", "BREASTO FIRE!", "RUST HURRICAAAANE!", "FINGAAA MISSILE!", etc.
>> ARTICLE
If they make a fighting game out of it it's nice that you don't have to invent attack names afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
in Hunter X Hunter it's explained that Gon calls out his attacks because it actually makes them stronger based on how Nen works.

it's the little things...
>> ARTICLE
For those who don't get it.  In hxh, if you make rules that restrict your ability (ex: not using it to kill, only working on specific people, time limit etc.)  Will make it stronger depending on how restricting it is.

Given that [Musume ch.27](/s "Lamias' male breeding stock is exclusively human") and [Musume ch.29](/s "Centorea is the result of a Centaur/Human coupling") it's probably the case that mating with a monster girl would produce a monster offspring.

The answer is simple.



Such an anime is the anime that will pierce the heavens.

For points one, two, and three, that's *mostly* the fact that [spoilers? spoilers.](/s "the ending took place in a sort of artificial extra-dimensional space, so standard universal laws don't apply.") It was only bigger than our observable, known universe, but obviously not bigger than the universe as it is in the anime.

Logic is that there's no great meaning to the world, and everything and everyone you love will eventually disappear forever. But we're human, so even knowing that the universe doesn't care about us, and that we'll even be its downfall, we'll continue to find meaning in ourselves and struggle against the despair of a chaotic existence that could be lost at any moment.

>> ARTICLE
A Shinigami in real world mythology is like an Angel of Death. Why they have rules? I don't really know. But I do remember some line about using a Death Note even once means you have to go to purgatory, and I'm pretty sure it's implied that that person would become a Shinigami in the world of Death Note.

But really, then it would seem as if the Death Notes are more designed to recruit more Shinigami, so why is it such a big deal that Ryuk drops his? I think it is just assumed that you view them as Angels of Death and kind of inject your own beliefs onto them.

dragon ball z ultimate question:
   how long is 5 minutes?
>> ARTICLE
Considering they are most likely moving at super speed for most of their fight, it seems logical that 5 minutes real time might not seem that way from their perspective. But, it's really just about the Manga, I think.

A Manga writer might not have to worry so much about how much time is felt while someone reads, and it can be hard to show a certain amount of time with just pages and drawings. So, when it was animated, it wound up being much longer. Though I like the first explanation.

It's a ribbon that lifts her boobs.  That's the entire purpose.

Fictionally, that's a good purpose... but technically it would *never* work that well. :p

Heh, of course not!  That shit would have to be *really* tight to not just fall off her tiny frame, and then it wouldn't be able to move her boobs because she can't lifter her arms!

Was Kiritsugu a cool dad or a depressing dad
>> ARTICLE
Servants that are really compatable / in sync with their masters (and vice versa) have a kind of memory bleed where they see a lot about each other.

This happened between waver & rider in fate zero (and probably between COOOOOOOL & Caster). It also happens between Rin & Archer and Shirou & Saber (and maybe rider & her master) in F/SN. Saber had previously hated kiritsugu because she didn't understand his motivations at all, having seen stuff about who he is from shirous perspective she understands him a lot better and as it turns out, he was a pretty cool dad to a pretty crazy kid.
>> ARTICLE
In Fate route, Saber says to Shirou that she could "dream" with his memories, and saw a completely different person. So yes, hes a cool dad.
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember that but I assume Kiritsugu was a cool dad because he's best best guy
>> ARTICLE
[Found it](http://imgur.com/sdK4JOW)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks and Kiritsugu was a great guy in fate/zero I don't know what saber talking about
>> ARTICLE
I realise this might be sarcasm, but I'll try anyway :D

It's probably the continuous assassinations and seriously unorthodox methods. Don't get me wrong, Kiritsugu is a badass. But he did blow up an apartment block, snipe multiple people and do bad things to Lancer (no spoilers :))

Saber never liked his lack of chivalry and honour.
>> ARTICLE
He did everything to win so I'm not being sarcastic. I think what he did was reasonable and cool
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I get that. I'm just saying Saber doesn't like him because of her stubbornness when it comes to "knight's honour"
>> ARTICLE
You right I completely forgot about her Knights honor crap thanks for reminding me 
>> ARTICLE
Same could be said for any other master, but because he's the MC and his intentions with the Grail were shown to be noble we call cool what we would have called "evil" or be angered if an antagonist character did the same.
>> ARTICLE
He had a good ideal, but his 'ends justify the means' mentality is what really screwed him. Saber was very much of the belief that if your means are contradictory to your ends the things you do are self-defeating. There's also some other stuff there too, like saber losing a weapon and some comrades due to a single unchivalrous deed.

Fate/Zero liked to really contrast/mirror servants to their masters. Saber & Kerry were one of the worst possible compatabilities possible and if saber wasn't the honorable person she is, she might have killed Kerry. Kerry & 4th Lancer would have been a pretty awesome combo as long as you got lancer in the right mind-set.
>> ARTICLE
Kerry would never let the poor guy have an honest fight. He'd only be sent in when he totally outmatched the opponent (which, admittedly, would be most of the time in the fourth war).
>> ARTICLE
Fourth Lancer honestly wouldn't need a 'honest' / fair fight. Nasu had originally decided that Magic Resistance was a class skill of lancers, but as of a later interview (sometime around the psp games) had changed his mind to battle continuation being a class skill of lancers. Battle continuation is the ability to either withdraw or pursue fights safely, or continue fighting while injured without suffering penalties. When you combine this with the lancer container having statistically the highest agility and a propensity for carrying very nasty anti-person noble phantasms, you have an excellent skirmisher that can bleed their opponents. Fourth lancer also had Eye of the Mind (true) which allows him to accurately assess enemy abilities with even just a tiny bit of information and furthers his ability to safely engage or retreat - as the skill describes so long as there's a 1% chance of victory, an eye of the mind user can effectively amplify that chance.

You can see the combination of fourth lancers high agility, eye of the mind and battle continuation when he does crazy things like dodge riders chariot - something most other servants would find near impossible. Or when he discerns sabers weapon and identity after a few exchanges of blows and manipulates her into getting wounded by his yellow spear - something sabers instinct skill should prevent.

A lot of the servants in the fourth war actually had a win condition. Lancers would have been to stick em with the yellow spear, retreat and repeat until he could get a fight where they're very, very low on mana. His red spear also made him the natural enemy to berserker.
>> ARTICLE
lol wut

He was absolutely terrible to Saber . He did not chat to saber at all apart from the Lancer scene  . He used her only as a tool he dont want hear saber's wishes for the holy grail or her past .  But you are right he is a great guy but not to Saber .

In FSN Sabers hates him 
>> ARTICLE
Well a servant is supposed to be a tool. You're trying to win this war so it doesn't matter how you win it as long as you win it. But I do agree he didn't like saber because there views on how he wants peace are different.
>> ARTICLE
I agree and that is the reason Saber likes Shirou and hates kiritusgu .Since shirou treat Saber as a friend/love interest in Fate stay night they work together on achieving their goal while Kiritsugu works on his own and let his wife handle saber. 

Its pretty much the biggest difference between Zero and FSN in Zero every master treated their servants as tools apart from Waver . In FSN they are more emotionally connected with their masters and see them as companions or love interest like shirou(Fate route) and Caster's master 
>> ARTICLE
true that's why I wanted to know if Kiritsugu was a cool dad or a depressing dad since all of his life has been depressing I guess shirou was that one good thing
>> ARTICLE
Hey, F/Z Caster and his master were pretty tight, Ryuunosuke and Gilles were both equally enthused in their hobby of kiddy murder as an unappreciated art form.

He certainly was never nice to her. Saber has all the reasons to hate him with a passion.

[Code Geass R2](/s "Lelouch, alive or dead. Personally think he's dead, but it doesn't matter. He accomplished his goal, and he felt it was worth his life.")
>> ARTICLE
[Code Geass R2](/s "He's alive without a doubt in my mind. The series' title shows it all. I mean, he absorbed the Code from his father, effectively letting Lelouch have both the Code as well as Geass at the same time (Code Geass). Now, as far as R2...well, the two major characters who had Codes in the show were C.C. and V.V., essentially pronounced C2 and V2. Well, remember Lelouch's non-prince name? Lelouch Lamperouge. Well, in Japanese, it roughly translates to 'Rurshu Ranperji'...RR...R2. The entire show is about how R2, with the Code of immortality and the power of Geass, came to be...and the world he created.")

>> ARTICLE
[CGR2](/s "Just rewatched the end part. I can definitely see how him living could be a thing. I don't know if it was him driving the cart though, or if C.C. was talking to him via a telepathic communication like the one she had with Marianne. Though I guess Marianne was a part of that one chick's mind or something, so maybe Lelouch is doing the same thing with the cart guy. Either way, it's interesting stuff!")
>> ARTICLE
[CGR2](/s "Well, the reason Marianne was part of that one girl's mind was because of the most ridiculous geass power shown in the anime...so since it was a geass power, I don't think that's the case since we all know what Lulu's geass power is")
>> ARTICLE
[CGR2](/s "Okay. Up above you said something about Lelouch absorbing the Emperor's Code. What was that about?")
>> ARTICLE
[CGR2](/s "The Emperor took VV's code, resulting in the Emperor losing his geass power and having a Code instead. Then, once the Emperor was dying as a result of Lelouch using Geass to literally make god obey him, the Emperor in his last moments rushes Lelouch, gripping Lelouch's neck with his right hand...the hand that has the mark of the Code on it. Then, just before Charles dissipates, Lelouch says 'begone now' and then there's the sound of Geass activating. This means that Charles WAS effected by geass, meaning that he no longer had a Code...meaning he passed it to Lelouch. Oh, and the reason Lelouch didn't lose his geass is because he got the Emperor's code...not CC's.")
>> ARTICLE
[CGR2](/s "Another interesting interpretation involved pointing out that Code might only be activated when its new owner dies. Charles 'died' once before we saw he had Code and CC was shown in a pool of her own blood in her flashback suggesting she had been attacked in some way. This would tie into a concept that I think the show itself brought up about how Code and Geass were each incomplete, Code allowing you to remain in the world but unable to change it while Geass allowing you to change the world but isolating you so that you wouldn't be able to fully enjoy the fruits of your changes. This would bring one interpretation of the combining of them in the name of the series as Lelouche achieving the desired results of both by obtaining Code and only activating it once he actually successfully used Geass to change the world. So, maybe not having both but having each one at the exact right time.")
>> ARTICLE
[CDR2](/s "The videos that show him as the cart driver are sketchy. One thing to point out is that there's no watermark when his face is shown and that there are at least two different version of his face being shown. Also, the creators of the anime have confirmed that he is in fact, dead.")

EDIT: fixed spoiler formatting, sorry.
>> ARTICLE
[CGR2](/s "It should be more than enough evidence just to realize that Lelouch's sister saw his memories when she touched him. I mean seriously, do people just forget that? That only happens to people with the code. And there's more than enough evidence to support the claim that he's still alive in the end to justify that happening.")
>> ARTICLE
[CGR2](/s "Lelouch: Say, Suzaku... Geass is like a wish isn't it? Its a request to someone to give you the power to achieve what you can't do on your own.
Suzaku: A wish, huh?
Lelouch: Yes. I'm going to cast the Geass called a wish on people. For the future of the world.
Lelouch: The only people who should kill are those prepared to die themselves!")

[CGR2](/s "Nunally is known to at least be able to tell when someone is lying by a mere touch, she's probably able to tell someones feelings. She reacted probably because she was surprised that his beat was calm and realized that he expected this to happen. Since she came up the same general idea as him - to make the world unite with hating something - she could easily have figured out his intentions. She didn't see those scenes, the show was reminding us about the main point.")

[Lastly](/s "He commonly says, throughout the series, "The only ones who should kill are those who are prepared to be killed." Do you honestly think he wasn't prepared to die? Do you think he'd run away after all that's happened despite that belief he holds?")
>> ARTICLE
[CGR2](/s "Yes, he says he is prepared to die several times over during the show. That's got no influence over the actual outcome. I don't doubt he was willing to die, and I don't think he actually planned on stealing someone's code in the process of 'fixing' the world, but again, it really doesn't actually mean he does die in the end. Or rather, he dies, and then is brought back as a code holder.")

[CGR2](/s "And Nunally can cold read people using pulse to detect lies. But that's MILES away from what actually happened, when she went through all the flashbacks of all the plans Lelouch had come up with, and immediately realized the entire thing was set up for her. You can't claim she developed the ability to tell someone's past from that person's pulse.")

[CGR2](/s "He absolutely does not run away in the end. He needed to become the leader of Britannia in order to destroy it. He dissolved all aristocracy and re-distributed wealth. He made sure the command chain was entirely controlled by him and only him, and that everyone else was just a brainless puppet. And then he died as the leader of Britannia, allowing all countries to simultaneously push back. Since there's no structured command chain, it's plain to see that all conquered land is going to be conquered back. He had to disappear to make the power of Geass remain a mystery to most people.")

[CGR2](/s "I'm also pretty certain he gave Suzaku an actual Geass power in the end. But I could be wrong.")
>> ARTICLE
[CGR2](/s "Fine he was prepared to die but that doesn't mean it's happened. I said that Nunnaly didn't actually see the flashbacks, it was an animation tool to give us an idea of what happened, if she just gave a little gasp it would have been confusing.")

[CGR2](/s "The end is what happens after he 'faked his death' as you say. The end is that he got away, not what happened a little bit before. At the end C2 said that Geass leads to a life of solitude, but that's not quite correct, right Lelouch? If he did fake his death he'd have to go into hiding for a long time. Sure he might be able to live with C2, but not really anyone else. This also isn't mentioning that C2 would probably want to experience her newfound will to live instead of staying in hiding with lelouch until his face is forgotten.")

[CGR2](/s "What makes you think that lelouch gives Suzaku geass? Even if he did have a code it wasn't activated and we've seen that they need a contract to give someone a geass. I guess they don't need to kiss or anything, but gess can only be given with a code, which lelouch didn't activate at this point.")
>> ARTICLE
Ah, whatever. It's not worth bothering to try to convince someone who's dead set on believing something, because even when faced with overwhelming evidence they'll just ignore it.

Fair enough. I'd be lying if I said I didn't come in here looking specifically for Platinum Disco, even though I'm already using the one I linked.

On that note, any of the other Monogatari OP/EDs would be awesome. I especially like Marshmallow Justice and Ambivalent World

Definitely, all of these would work great.

If you could do "only my railgun" or "sister's noise" from railgun, that would be great. (main parts)

There is an [Only My Railgun mallet arrangement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tpdDPoPXtY&ab_channel=AnimeMalletArrangements) that someone recently posted here if OP doesn't deliver/you want to use that.

Edit: There are also several 8 bit versions already out there, so you could look through those and see if you like the sound of any of them.

Can you do "Happily Ever After" by Nakagawa Shoko? It's one of the insert songs from Gurren Lagann? Thanks btw <3 
>> ARTICLE
Could I possibly request the intro for [Gundam 0079 opening please?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPB54YaZu5I) Just between 10 and 28 seconds in the video. It's already kind of retro so I think it'd fit perfectly as an 8-bit ringtone. The ones you did are really catchy, there's just something about 8-bit sounding stuff. Is there a word for it? I've always heard it been called chiptune.
>> ARTICLE
If I used any of these as my ringtones I wouldn't answer calls ever again.

These are great! If you have the time/like it could you do the ED for [Kyoukai No Kanata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwl6Polwq4Q)?

[Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI4dOUQ1xaU)

The song from Bakemonogatari in 8 bit would be godlike.

If you decide to do this you can feel free to PM me if you need a 320kbps mp3.

Awesome pieces btw, am using the Gurren Lagann one atm.
>> ARTICLE
I would totally love a [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHDfeZqLA5I) version if possible! I think either the intro portion, or the chorus would be awesome.

The parts I'm thinking are the first 13 seconds, and the section from around [0:48 - onward](https://youtu.be/YHDfeZqLA5I?t=48).

You're right -- and I found a couple more. But I'd like to hear OP's take on it as well, as these others sound, dare I say it... a little bland?

edit: Bland may not be the right word, but perhaps just a little too true to 8-bit style. I like the chiptune sound of OP's tracks more.

I liked the SAO one. The sound font seems different.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah me too. These are all cool but the one that actually appealed to me was the SAO. I'm not even sure how to put it in the words but the others felt a bit too electronical.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's mostly just that it's simpler. Didn't recreate all the different instruments/parts, and only used one waveform for the 2 layers I did use. Wasn't sure if people would like them more barebones, or more faithful to the originals. I'll try to use a variety of styles in the future!

DONT LOSE YOUR WAY

Do you think you could make versions of these without all of the slides? To be honest I think you used sliding notes a little bit too liberally.

Edit: the Sorairo Days one is really good
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I noticed that too on a few of them (especially the ones I did first). These were my first attempts in 8-bit stuff, so I'm still kind of tuning things :P . Should be more balanced in the future! If there's a specific one you want I can edit it real quick and shoot you a download link.

No offence to you but this doesn't sound 8-bit at all because of all the chords and reverb. It sounds like someone's dragged a VST or two over a fan MIDI.

These are nice. I think they need a bit more 'pop' I think? Like a way to make them more attention grabbing for something like a ringtone.
>> ARTICLE
I agree I think! Still trying to find a good balance between loud and complex. If I have too many different parts, it's super faithful to the original, but not great as a ringtone. Of course, I don't wanna make it too simple either. I'll continue to tune things in. Thanks for listening!
>> ARTICLE
Lost Heaven from Fullmetal Alchemist, I think it's from one of the movies. Either part. Into and chorus, or the chorus medley at the end.

I normally look for these on Zedge, but u have an Android phone. On iPhone (someone asked) I think you can import as ringtone with iTunes on your PC? As for getting them, a few are on YouTube, look for a downloader. If it's only on Zedge, and some are, someone with Android can get it for you (they download as mp3) or you can run the Android emulator in the SDK I suppose.

[Cream Soda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgyPB84fGsQ) from the Parasyte OST. 1:45-2:15 probably suits the style the best.

I second a redo of the SAO opening, it feels like it kinda loops and just doesn't have that individuality to it. And maybe the end opening of the second season, Courage, dunno why but that really resonates with me, from the 50 second mark, that little section which might be the chorus?

HELLO THERE. Month late reply, because I'm a terrible person.
I'm working on Vol. 3 of the Ringtone collection now, and I wanted to do the KnT OP you mentioned. I just listened to it for the first time and IT'S QUITE DOPE. Would you prefer to have the part near the beginning (where the drums start), or the chorus? Both sound cool I think, but doing the whole song would take forever. I'll also have to find a good mp3 but I'll figure that out somehow xD

Thanks for listening :)
>> ARTICLE
Haha. All good. Just happy you saw the post, and listened to the song. 

I suppose the chorus has more going on for it, but it's truly up to you, as you are making them. 

Thank you.

Oh god, Episode 116. That gave me chills watching that
>> ARTICLE
Killua barely breaking down into tears is brutal to watch
>> ARTICLE
Jumping in to say that 116 is one of my favorites along with 126, 131, and 135 as just being perfect. Gon's reaction is just so chilling. 
>> ARTICLE
I never knew watching three people talk for 20 minutes could be so intense. Both the first and second times I watched 116 I was at the edge of my seat (literally) with my eyes glued to the screen the entire time.
>> ARTICLE
Episodes 112 and 116 are basically perfect to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I personally like 111 a lot. Dedicating a half an episode to explain how hard Pitou got bitchslapped was really satisfying.
>> ARTICLE
Was that one of the all slow motion episodes? Been a while since I watched.

>> ARTICLE
The stretch of episodes that starts here blew me away completely when I first watched it, and still remain my favourite episodes of the whole series. HxH has loads of more conventional action scenes and episodes (with plenty more still on the way), so I don't mind at all that these episodes are so different. Other shows have done the freeze-frame thing too, but they've never taken it this far, and it does it with good reason too. It's not just about stretching things out for a character to have an internal monologue or to show intensity and build up the action. It does do all of those things but it also adds in a ton of character development for every character, builds many of the themes of the arc to a fever pitch, and consistantly subvert's your expectations.

It's like the entire show goes into "bullet time" and you get to soak in every single thought and action that every character makes. It makes every tiny development feel like it's the most important thing in the entire world. It's one of the coolest executions of an action sequence I have ever seen.

I'd love to see someone edit together a "real time" version of these episodes (and next week's as well). It wouldn't work at all but it would probably be pretty hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people really hate the narrator parts, but I actually enjoyed them more than a lot of the real-time action. However, I'm a massive LotGH fan so I'm massively biased towards heavy narration.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually a good point.  I watched (and loved) LOTGH a few months prior to HxH so I was completely open to grand narration in this show. 
>> ARTICLE
God, as many problems as I have with the way this arc was presented, there are just some absolutely *killer moments* during it. Especially anything with Netero.

[Spoilers For Next Week](/s "And next week is ending with Meruem versus Netero. Perfect.")
>> ARTICLE
I arranged the schedule so that every week would end with a standout episode. The next couple weeks will be a lot of fun.
>> ARTICLE
I can't help but want to dub over Gon's rage scene with Game Grumps' own scene when playing Sonic '06.
>> ARTICLE
Please actually do this though?
>> ARTICLE
[One of the most underrated scenes of the anime.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86MoueTiBXE) I barely see people mentioning episode 111.
>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest I enjoyed this week's episodes, but they could have been a lot better.

In terms of content, this is what I was expecting, the King is continuing to develop a sense of empathy, his king's guard are reacting in accordance with their previous characterization, and of course there are lots of epic fights going on. Gon's outburst at Neferpitou was understandable and doesn't really advance his character. Gon continues to be unusually amoral for a shounen protagonist, but even in contrast with his archetypal naivete and stubbornness that hasn't made him a compelling character. Since all the ~~good guys~~ hunter's forces are all split up, I can't begin to understand why they didn't bring more people with them it just seems like lazy writing to make the fights more meoldramatic.

In terms of delivery however I can't call these episodes anything but a failure. While I don't agree that the maxim, "Show don't tell.", is universally applicable, this is clearly a case where a visual medium is being misused. It's not just that there's a lot of narration during these fights, there's way too much especially consider that for the most part the visuals did a good job of explaining character's actions. While it's often dramatic to see a second stretched into a minute, it loses its appeal when that happens over and over again in a row. I simply don't understand why Madhouse did such a poor job of translating these fights into anime, especially considering how good some of the shows action sequences have been.

I hope the fighting shifts towards, what anime is good at delivering, kinetic action, instead of frozen frames of reaction. I wonder who they'll kill off and moreover why, the deaths could be presented as anything from heroic sacrifices to superior beings absent minded crushing insects underfoot. Above all I'm curious as to when the King will kill Netero, it seems pretty certain at this point that he will, and how that will effect him. Ideally I would like if this arc ends with reconciliation and character growth instead of violence, that would help Hunter x Hunter have some thematic depth that it has been sourly lacking.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you on most of this. That said, I don't think the writing is so much the problem for this part as the presentation, because *fucking hell does the constant narration just bore me to tears.* The story feels like it's never allowed to build and flow naturally--it's like starting a car and then turning the key back the *moment* before the engine really gets going.

The story is fine, I just wish they'd let it live and breathe on its own rather than strangling it with exposition and constant pauses.

Madhouse should have definitely taken some more initiative in changing the flow of these fights. The added narration and time stretching was present in the manga as well, so I guess you could call this a case of being faithful to the source material to a fault. 

However, I disagree with you on Gon's outburst not advancing his character. If this arc does one thing for Gon, it's that it shows how hypocritical his simplistic idealism is. In Yorknew Gon voiced his concern on Kurapika's quest for vengeance and was saying that he felt Kurapika shouldn't be going down the path he was. Gon was quite adamant on this point as it was the reason why he didn't just run from Pakunoda when he had the chance. However we see in this arc, especially in episode 116, that this is all actually bs. Gon can dish out his idealistic views, but he can't follow through with them in his own life when the same kind of things affect him. It shows that deep down Gon is quite the hypocrite which I think is a good advancement of character.
>> ARTICLE
I see where you're coming from, I just consider it obvious that idealism is always at some level hypocritical, nobody can live up to the standard of an ideal.
>> ARTICLE
I know that, but I think there's something to be gained by showing it out right, especially in the case of Gon where such an angle hasn't been expanded on prior.
>> ARTICLE
> Gon can dish out his idealistic views, but he can't follow through with them in his own life when the same kind of things effect him. It shows that deep down Gon is quite the hypocrite which I think is a good advancement of character.

Gon is basically what happens when you take that pure, childlike attitude of Goku and *portray it realistically*. It's not some magic thing that makes everyone better or solves all the problems in the setting, it's a flat out terrifying attitude that's built on contradiction, selfishness and ignorance.

Meh everyones ahead of schedule

I..I...I finished it yesterday, I'M SORRY GUYS

I'm still behind (watching ep20 right now). But when Yorknew City arc comes around... oh boy.

Yeah, a show like this with cliffhangers and all isn't really suited for a rewatch. I'm still not ahead of schedule, but that will probably change pretty soon.

But that's even more of a challenge! I'm testing myself.

I didn't even realise this rewatch was going on until about a week ago. I've stopped at the end of Greed Island so the threads can catch up to me.

Ahhh, the Zoldycks are such a likeable bunch of psychopaths.

I think next week we should take a break for a few months, you know to get into that hunter x hunter feel
>> ARTICLE
**IMPORTANT**

Seeotter just bought a WiiU. The HxH rewatch will be postponed for an undetermined amount of time, please understand.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I love pretty much all the endings for Hunter x Hunter. I'd have to say I like this and Hyori Ittai the most.
>> ARTICLE
Finally I can start watching again. I started rewatching last Saturday and caught up to ep 26 by Sunday. Had to fight hard to prevent myself from watching more.
>> ARTICLE
Kilua's mother is so damn creepy. Also you would think a family of assassins would be secretive of their residence. These guys home is a damn tourist attraction! 

I hope Lerio and Kurapika aren't gone from the story for too long, love those guys.

Gon is freaking nuts wanting to punch Hisoka. I wouldn't want to be any where near that guy ever again.
>> ARTICLE
The Zoldycks don't really care if people know where they live.  The amount of people who can get past the help, let alone actually kill one of the family on their own turf could be counted on both hands.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't realize this rewatch was happening. But a chance to experience HxH again certainly isn't a bad thing.

Anyway Zoldyck arc. If Hunter Exam is the arc some people are indifferent towards, this is the arc most people seem to forget exists.

Not that it's necessarily bad, in fact i rather like the story it tells within it's comparatively brief run time. But anyone who expects Gon and his friends to storm the mansion, and have an epic fight with each family member to reach Killua, might be disappointed. But then again, HxH is known to play with the conventions of a typical shonen storyline. In this case a rescue arc.

Honestly this arc serves three purposes IMO.

1. To introduce the rest of the Zoldycks as characters, and major players within the story's world.

2. To show that the family dynamic is somewhat split, between the mother wanting to imprison Killua, and the father wanting to let him go off on his own.

3. To show that Gon and Killua's friendship has advanced to the point where Gon would go looking for him, even in the death trap known as the Zoldyck estate.

And for what it is, i think the arc serves it's purpose well. Next week is the start of the Heaven's arena arc, which should satisfy anyone craving more action from this series. 
>> ARTICLE
Glad you're joining the rewatch!

To be honest, half the reason I started this was to see more people react to [](/s "the end of York New and the Chimera Ant Arc")
>> ARTICLE
I'ts sad to see Leorio and Kurapika go. They'll return for sure but I'll miss their wacky fights.
>> ARTICLE
The hunter exam arc was very enjoyable, the characters are great and likeable and the story is really well paced.

 I think I would marathon it easily but I want to take it easy and stick to the schedule,  a l'aise 
Well  I  guess you could say I'm marathoning the scheduled  episodes  since I  just can't  have enough with just one episode.. 

>> ARTICLE
I always loved this ED. Then, I learned why. Masatoshi Ono (you know, the performer of the OP) is the one doing the vocals with Galneryus. Now you know why it's awesome.

Also, I would like to point you to Galneryus' cover of [Departure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUPB62s9IXc) which is even better than the original imo. You are welcome people.

**P.S.** I might try a write-up for the next week because I want to keep these discussions alive and as active as possible. Hunter X Hunter is love!
>> ARTICLE
Another set of pretty bad episodes. The Zoldycks are a colorful bunch, but none of them were particularly fun or interesting as characters at least not so far. My bigger issue was with Gon's actions, I simply do not understand why he's written to be such a ridiculously idealistic character, and yet never punished for his stupidity. Does anyone actually enjoy seeming Gon triumph in such absurd ways?
>> ARTICLE
You'll understand Gon a little better later. He's not as idealist as you think and his actions have consequences.
>> ARTICLE
Gon's idealistic personality is intentional and very crucial to later parts of the story. Saying much more would be spoilers, but the story is definitely aware of your critique on Gon's actions.

I don't think I ever would've watched Bakemonogatari back in the day if this sub hadn't recommended it to me, and now it's in my top 3.

On a more recent note, I never would've picked up KonoSuba if /u/BanjoTheBear hadn't recommended it in his seasonal thread. I'm really glad I picked it up because it's one of the best things airing this season.

That makes me really happy to hear! :D

KonoSuba *is* awesome. It is still a bit early to say, but KonoSuba is one of the best comedies to come out in recent years. All of the characters, the comedy, and the construction of the show make KonoSuba into a powerhouse of an anime. :3

ERASED and it is soooooooooo good

I didnt start until the 2nd episode came out, only because the image on sites that list anime by season show some lame looking kid holding hands with some girl. And it looked like a little older fashioned art.
I have a strong bias against older art styles (ttgl, nge), but then I started watching it and it was pretty good.

Hanasaku Iroha (loved it)

Shinsekai Yori(epic)

Gintama (epic)

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 (not that amazing as this sub says)

I don't remember much of others.
>> ARTICLE
I ended up dropping Iroha at like episode 16. Is it worth finishing?
>> ARTICLE
I watched it 1 to 2 episodes a day.  IThe had a nice ending. A really good sol anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you didn't like Iroha by episode 16, you probably wouldn't like it very much even if you did finish it IMO, though I found the ending really well done. It is a very consistent(ly good) show personally so I doubt you will enjoy it a lot in the later episodes unless you want to see how they wrap up the series.

Gintama indeed, was on the fence about it and came here to be convinced. was not disappointed :)

One Punch Man. It sure was about one man who punched things, I guess.

Since you liked both gundams, i highly recommend you watch Gundam 00 i found it way batter than the two above.

I think Orphans is on track to be better than 00, I like the themes it deals with more.  Gundam 00 got sort of lost in the way it dealt with the themes it introduced once the Innovators became a thing, but I won't be able to compare them 'till IBO is done!
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, are you reading the manga for Yamada?  If not,  start from Ch 1 since the anime tones down on character interactions and so on which makes you appreciate the characters less.  The manga is so good at least imo

I also loved the anime. Is the manga so much better?

they condensed like 90 chapters in 12 episodes so the manga is a lot more fleshed out (and is still ongoing, though the latest arc started to drag a bit)

High production value. Little fan service. 3 dimensional characters. But I think probably a lot of people would relate with the main character. Similar to snafu. Whether that's good or bad isn't what I'm saying, just my assumption.

oh fuck man, you just motivated me to watch it right now. It's hard for me to binge an anime because of some school stuffs. Haha. So are you enjoying it? I've heard so much about it from this sub.

Madoka Magica.

One of my favorite anime of all time, thank you so much /r/anime for showing me the light.
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Were you that one guy out of 300k who was able to watch the show without being spoilered and knowing what's it about?")
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't super spoilered when I watched it. I expected to watch it as a joke, sorta like how I watched Princess Tutu and suddenly found it enjoyable. Turns out, [](/s "Madoka was more than generic Mahou Shoujo.")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "I know I was. I was fortunate enough to not have any clue what the show was. For all the talk about it online I guess I never saw more than people talking about it being good.")
>> ARTICLE
For what it's worth, this subreddit is pretty good at handling spoilers.

I was also one of those who didn't watch Madoka until very recently, and all I knew going into it was that "*Down the road there was a jawdropping twist*". I am also in the dark about Fate/Stay, Clannad, and many others (just waiting for the riiiiiight moment). All I know is that there's some dude called Gilgamesh that wrecks havoc & that "Tomoyo is love" (whatever the hell that means).

So yeah, thumbs up for /r/anime!
>> ARTICLE
Me too (am I special now?). Though in my case, I read volume 1 of the Manga adaption, which covers the first four episodes [early episode spoilers](/s "Mami's corpse is portrayed in a more bloody way"), at my friends house. We were kinda bored and he gave me Madoka and I knew nothing about it at that time (didn't even watch much anime back then)
>> ARTICLE
I watched it without being spoiled either, though I was an idiot and ignored recommendations because I took one look at "magical girls" and lolnoped right outta there.  Boredom and looking through a list of Gen Urobuchi writing credits eventually reversed that.  [MM Spoilers](/s "Funny thing about getting spoiled is I even looked at the Butcher Bingo meme image repeatedly and never connected the Early Deaths (Mami) square to the series until it happened.")
>> ARTICLE
The funny thing is that they tried to hide Urobuchi from the writing staff, but failed when it leaked.  Cue the earliest Madoka jokes.

Ahh, studio-level trolling.

Steins;Gate

I hate all of you
>> ARTICLE
I decided to start watching it after hearing all of the praise for it, but after episode one I have no real clue what is going on. Haven't started the second episode because I'm already finding it hard to stay interested. :-/
>> ARTICLE
Like c'mon dude, just trust the show to explain things to you because it DOES, and very well at that. 
>> ARTICLE
Im currently watching it right now, on episode 6. Apparently the 2nd half of the show is the good part, so maybe try and stick with it to then.


>> ARTICLE
I suppose I can watch a couple more episodes, maybe something will spark my interest. I'm really just killing time until the next Erased episode airs anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
So... have you tried watching more?

Steins;Gate has these weird but common tropes people call "mystery show" and "plot" where they don't reveal all the information in one episode but slowly feed you pieces of information over time that puts the story together.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is when I watched other mystery shows, I found myself watching more because I wanted to know what was going on. I started some of episode two, but lost interest again. 
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact i watched up to episodes 6 2 years ago then dropped it cos nothing was happening, with all the praise its getting i tried it again 2 months ago. Its now my favorite anime of all time. episode 7+ is where things start to becoming interesting but the real "fun" start at episode 12 i watched 7-23 in one day, was worth it. (24-25 the next morning and the movie the night) 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I think if you have to get through to episode 7 to finally get some entertainment out of it then it's flawed as a series. I'll try and give it another go but it's not great you have to get through 7 episodes before it gets interesting.
>> ARTICLE
For some (me) it was enjoyable all the way through though. Specifically, it is great for people who really enjoy a tense atmosphere and a sort of ominous tone that builds over time.
>> ARTICLE
this is the only bad point of the series for me, yes if u need to be bored the first 6 episodes before it become good, its a flaw for sure, i will not say otherwise but i don't regret it. The end of the series is so worth it in my opinion (and the opinion of a lot of people if we check the mal page )
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same way at first but its definitely worth the watch.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate is actually a bit unique in that sense. The events of the early parts of the show is basically dropping you in the middle of developments already in progress. Without spoiling much, the story structure is wacky on purpose where viewers will probably understand the first half better upon rewatch. Kind of like a certain other show popular show that does this.
>> ARTICLE
There are some shows that I dislike, but I can see why other people might like it. With Steins;Gate, I have no idea why it isn't universally hated. I despised literally every moment of the 17 episodes that I watched, and it wasn't because of anti-hype backlash. At the time, I had no idea it was popular.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't think you'd give in.
>> ARTICLE
"Steins;Gate is time travel done right"  
"No I swear it gets better"  
"The character development is fantastic"  
"It's different than [x time travel series] you didn't like"  
"Okabe is better than [y chuuni-type character]"    
"You can't drop it until you are halfway, and by then it just keeps on getting better"  
"You *need* to watch it"

How could I *possibly* deny such sweet sweet ~~lies~~ statements that /r/anime has whispered to me
>> ARTICLE
I take it I *shouldn't* watch Steins;Gate?
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts are as follows: S;G is one of the like four stories in existence where the time travel makes perfect sense. Outside of that it has one great character and everyone else is a bit bare bones. If you like the MC, you will like Steins;Gate. If not, odds are you won't. There's also another character that a lot of people really like, but I just kind of found her to be ok. Regardless it'd be pretty hard to argue the show as anything worse than well above average, and it's a lot of people's favorites. Well worth at least checking out.
>> ARTICLE
It's a great show IMO. People overhype the shit out of the show and the first few episodes are kind of a drag but the story is pretty good.

A lot of people hate it because the time travel trope is a shitty narrative and a convenient excuse to drive the plot. Like DasTales or ThatAnimeSnob. However I genuinely think that this show is quite enjoyable even for some that don't like time travel themes.
>> ARTICLE
Worth watching. Hardly my favorite but it's good. There's a sizable fanbase which claims it's the best thing ever and then point to its ranking on MAL as proof (lol) and as a result a counter-jerk starts up and the people who hate it or are on the fence feel the need to be vocal about disliking it.




>> ARTICLE
Its one of my favourite anime of all time, you should at least give it a try, but it is a bit slow in the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
You definitely should. Tales hates time-travel and chuuni characters so there was a 0% chance he'd like the show no matter what. 
>> ARTICLE
The fact that its ranked #2 on MAL shows that most people who watched it loved it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm getting mixed messages here.
>> ARTICLE
From a loud minority...

Even those who have major complaints about the show usually agree that it was very good overall. A really stellar series like Steins;Gate will be way more scrutinized and nitpicked at than your average show that is just decent.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much this. Largely because it's so often listed as flawless, I'll be the first to point out exactly what problems the show has. That said, it's still a good show and it's pretty hard to make an argument that it isn't at the very least more than a few steps up from most things that you see coming out. The one caveat I can really give for watching it is that it rides on one really well written character, and if you don't like him you probably will take a large issue with the cast as a whole.
>> ARTICLE
It's widely regarded as very good, but a few people dislike it.

A few people dislike everything, some people just hate everything.

 Most people like it, you're probably going to feel the same.  You should watch it.
>> ARTICLE
man you are reading DasTales comment about steins gate.. He hates the show with a fiery passion, i would say its worth the watch most people like it
>> ARTICLE
Huh.

So that's what hating on a show looks like from the outside.
>> ARTICLE
Is the grass greener on this side? 

As far as Steins;gate is concerned, it is definitely a well executed show. It does have problems but nothing too egregious. Probably the best VN adaptation in the anime medium.

The girls are nice but the MC is just too unlikable :(

And also in  [SS+](/s "They backtrack on some character development, which is really stupid - It's more than heavily inferred that at the end of  Morishima's route he sleeps with her, but in SS+ l they act like that never happened and felt super weird when watching it") That being said it wasn't bad, it just had some annoying flaws that kept it from being amazing.

I was excited long ago when I saw Rakudai had an action and romance tag. I was hoping for something along the lines of Akatsuki no Yona, with maybe a bit more romantic progression.

Instead I got a ecchi filled battle school anime with a shit ton of cliche tropes and scenarios.

>> ARTICLE
Seeing as I only started watching anime a little over a year ago, I'd say nearly half of my choices can be credited to this sub.

Stand out series include:

 Clannad + AS

 K-On and Yuru Yuri
 
Psycho-Pass and Fate/Zero / Unlimited Blade works
 
 Code Geass
 
 Kokoro Connect



>> ARTICLE
Yuru Yuri : It was amazing, the yuri element  kept me away at first, but after reading the discussion the yuri seems to be just undertones, so i give it a try and now its become one of my staple moe rewatch :)

FMA Brotherhood and One Punch Man: I tried, but cant get into them.....I dropped those, sorry...

>> ARTICLE
Yuri Yuru :)
>> ARTICLE
Madoka Magica. Meh, it wasnt as good it was hyped as.  
Nichibros. Loved it.  
Hataraku Maou-sama. I liked more the story than the comedy.   
And a lot more, but I cant remember which right now.


>> ARTICLE
23 episodes into **Legend of the Galactic Heroes**.

I like it now, but it was hard to make sense of anything for the first ~10 episodes, and I was laughing my ass off reading last year's rewatch discussion threads, with how you love what seems like random characters to a first time watcher straight from episode 1, or your debate about corridors, you bunch of pretentious fucks you.

No hard feelings yo.

I'm a Jojo fanboy (almost done with the manga and currently rewatching) and I enjoyed LotGH more than Jojo. I'd recommend finishing both though.
>> ARTICLE
Amagi Brilliant Park. Amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter 2011 for me too. It was probably my favourite anime until chimera ant arc then it kinda got boring. Still really loved it.
>> ARTICLE
One-Punch Man because it was hyped around here a lot. Loved it, read the entire manga and webcomic, would recommend, ty r/anime

Puella Magi Madoka Magica was getting a lot of praise and I didn't understand why ("magical girls lolwtf" - me), but watched it on impulse one day. One of my 10/10 shows now. Thanks fellow weebs!

Pung Pong the Animation and Tatami Galaxy in a tandem. PPtA is now my 2nd favorite anime (Cowboy Bebop production value too high, both are art), made me pick up the paddle again and otherwise motivated me in my life. Tatami Galaxy is one of my favorites as well, also my primary wallpaper theme. I love you guys!

Kids on the Slope is something I haven't heard a word about outside of r/anime, but once I started it I quickly fell in love. Best bromance of all time.

Fate/0 and UBW, as well as Kara no Kyoukai because people kept posting these sick looking gifs and I knew I'd have to watch all that stuff one day. Turned out neither of the stories really fit my taste, but watching all that eye candy sure as hell is satisfying.

Neon Genesis Evangelion is a rare case where r/anime's has let me down. Last 8 episodes don't make up for first 18. It gets a lot of praise all the time + it's a classic, but I know it's fairly polarizing, so I guess it's ok. I'm glad to have it off my list at least, it being a culturally significant show and all.

I think that's all. Usually I take recommendations from friends, but there's definitely several cases where I'll listen to te online community and give something a shot.
>> ARTICLE
Uhm did you watch End of Evangelion ? It's not in your anime list.
It's kinda weird how so many people don't watch EoE.
>> ARTICLE
I did, I just don't update the list often and when I do, I usually forget the movies. Pretty sure I didn't add a single KnK film to the list yet either and I've watched them a month or two ago.
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. I didn't like it at the beginning since the MC was really annoying, but after a few episodes when Mirai (MC) stopped being such a bitch all the time it became pretty good
>> ARTICLE
Mawaru Penguindrum.. And I found my love for surrealism. 
>> ARTICLE
Should check out perfect blue if you havent its probably my favourate surrealist anime
>> ARTICLE
Akatsuki no Yona was recommended heavily a while back, so i gave it a shot. I'd been in a slump lately in regards to being able to binge anime. So to my surprise i binged the series in a day and a half. 
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ravens <3

Just finished marathon-ing Tokyo Ravens over the course of 3 days.  I decided to watch it because I was craving my dose of romance and my friend and the subreddit recommended it to me - and just as everyone promised,  I thought it was very pleasant.  Cute female characters - [Kon](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f0/b4/9c/f0b49c55bacc06ffd33b03a0f8a4ab9d.jpg), [Suzuka](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/tokyo-ravens/images/d/db/Dairenji_suzuka_9967.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140401215217), and best girl [Natsume](https://animeappraised.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/horriblesubs-tokyo-ravens-01-720p-mkv_snapshot_10-08_2013-10-10_06-58-28.jpg) ~~~~  and an MC that actually has some decent character progression.  Sure Baka-tora was pretty dense at times, but he made up for it in so many ways.  The romance aspect, for those who haven't watched it, is well developed and actually has some closure.  

This is an anime best watched in marathon format imo as it can get slow at times; I can totally understand why some people who were watching Tokyo Ravens while airing might have dropped it. Really hoping for a Season 2 in the future even though the sales were apparently poor in Japan and there isn't enough source material for 24 ep, let alone 12 ep, season.  Can't stop me from hoping though!!!
>> ARTICLE
Have been told to watch Kekkai Sensen and the Fate Series, both were incredible (except for fucking Fate/Stay Night ugh)
>> ARTICLE
I have seen 3 things because of this sub that I wouldn't have considered otherwise (or at least, not up until the point I watched them):

Redline, which I loved.

Katanagatari, which I thought was pretty good but didn't impress me that much

Oregairu, which is in the same boat as Katanagatari, I thought it was alright but it wasn't really my thing. I hope Zoku will change my view of the series though, as I'm still planning to watch that.
>> ARTICLE
A surprisingly large amount

Berserk, Welcome to the NHK, Gurren Lagann (I had started it on my own, dropped it, and then started it again thanks to this sub), Bakemonogatari. All of these I mostly watched because of this subreddit and I enjoyed all of them.

On the other hand Code geass, Kancolle, Ore Twintails, SAO, and Monmusu I watched because of the sub (either discussion threads while airing or general hype) and didn't enjoy as much.
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori, now one of my all time favorites.  Other include JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Mushishi, and Katanagatari, each of which were amazing.
>> ARTICLE
School days. Turned out better than expected. Def could of skipped ep 8-11? 

Kuroko no basket. Loved it! It was my 1st sports anime. I'm more of a mystery fan, so they did a great job with the intro since it got me hooked instantly. 
>> ARTICLE
Aiura: eh

Amagami SS: pretty cute

Monogatari series: wasn't bored like I expected to be

5cm/second: boring as fuck

Date A Live: came out with a different best girl then expected

Katanagatari: worth

Nisekoi: only care about it for the waifu wars

Non Non Biyori: got boring after season 1

Your Lie in April: I couldn't give a fuck

Oregairu: it was pretty good
>> ARTICLE
Hanasaku Iroha. 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Mobile Suit Gundam/Gundam 0079 - only 11 episodes in but.... SEIG ZEON! 
>> ARTICLE
Series I've seen for /r/anime rewatch groups alone:

* Gintama  epic comedy, one of my favorites now.
* Kimi ni Todoke  cute story about an awkward, shy girl.
* Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo  Nanami was the best part of the show.
* Sakura Trick  physics-defying yuri, cute but not a whole lot else.
* So Ra No Wo To  fantastic setting, started as cute girls doing military things but got more than I asked for. Love the music.
* Shinsekai yori  amazing dystopian series that builds up over time.
* Code Geass  not a fan.
* Nana  great drama but becomes soul-crushing over time.
* Kaichou wa Maid-sama!  shoujo series that's horribly misogynistic.
* Mobile Suit Gundam  the start of a massive franchise... so far, it's entertaining for being over 35 years old.
* Macross  idols and mecha, unfortunately not as good as it could be and I have to turn my brain off at times to enjoy it.

...maybe I should get off the subreddit sometime.
>> ARTICLE
Most of my shows have been recommendations from /r/anime. So I'll talk about the latest one that I watched- Jojo's bizarre adventure.
I completed it last month. My favourite was the second part(battle tendency). I also the Egypt arc of Stardust crusaders.

Loved the OPs as well! And Roundabout has become a personal favourite!

Overall loved the show and am waiting for Part 4 now! Thanks Reddit!
>> ARTICLE
Oregairu and TTGL. I only watched them because this sub likes it. Now I understand why XD
>> ARTICLE
**OreGairu**: I loved it, and Zoku even more

**Spice and Wolf**: I really liked Holo and Lawrence but I didn't enjoyed all the economic stuff I think. It was amazing overall tho.

**Railgun**: First I tried Index and I dropped it because it was pretty mediocre; but I watched Railgun too and I liked it, but I hate Kuroko.

**Monogatari**: First this sub made me hate this series but then I gave it an opportunity and it became one of my favourites,
>> ARTICLE
Yozakura Quartet because of a specific adorable gif.

Fantastic!

Hunter x Hunter 2011 because it was so discussed and praised, best decision I've ever made. One of the, if not the, best anime I've ever watched.
>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari, loved every bit of it. 
>> ARTICLE
Encouragement of Climb

It's a good short anime.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's pretty great. I just wish the first season wasn't taken down from Crunchyroll.
>> ARTICLE
Oregairu. Didn't enjoy it. The MC and main girl were way too cynical. 
>> ARTICLE
**JoJo** - It was different from what I expected in some ways, but very, very enjoyable. Seeing how I initially thought it would be a show I'd drop, this is a rather good outcome.

**Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei** - Enjoyable, provided you don't take it seriously. I've rewatched it, which in general is something I do rarely.

**Steins;Gate** - Had dropped it at episode 5 (I didn't mind the slow pace, but Okabe's "Hououin Kyouma" persona grated on my nerves), but picked it up again after reading some comments here. Good series, but not in my Top 10.

**Nichijou** - Currently on hold. I liked Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou much better.

**Spice & Wolf** - Not bad, but on hold all the same. By this time I'd actually have to watch it from the start. There was something about Holo's personality that didn't sit quite right with me. 

**One Piece** - Dropped. Gave it a try. Didn't like it at all. Same with **Fairy Tail**.

>> ARTICLE
I started Nichijou 13 months ago, i.m still only at episode 22.....
>> ARTICLE
Whenever I'd ask for recommendations I'd always see Code Geass, but never checked it out since it was a long-ish series. 

Well I finally got around to watching it and really liked it a lot. It reminded me of Death Note in many ways which is one of my favorite series. I rated Code Geass 8/10. 

It's definitely in my top 10 now, but I'm still a rookie. Pretty much everything I watch is recommended from you guys and it usually works out since I still haven't rated any of your recommendations below a 7.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much everything I've seen for the last year.
>> ARTICLE
Never really watched something just because I saw it here but sometimes I saw anime that was already on my plan to watch list because I saw someone talking about it here. The latest example was Koi Kaze, it was good, it made me feel like shit but the themes were really well presented.
>> ARTICLE
This sub pretty much made me start watching anime again since 2010 (at which point I had/was only watching Naruto until I dropped it) so in a sense 99% percent what I've watched in the past year while lurking here is credit to r/anime.

And boy what experiences I've had from watching Full Metal Panic, D-Frag!, Seitokai Yakuindomo, Spice & Wolf, No Game No life, Nisekoi, Fate/Stay series (including the VNs), Amagi Brilliant Park, **Steins;Gate**, To Aru Index/Railgun, Toradora and many many more.

This sub reignited my love for anime. Thank you, r/anime.
>> ARTICLE
just about everything i've seen in the last 6 months. most recently, it was prison school. like most anime i hear of on this subreddit, i really had no idea what it was about. i looked it up on MAL like i usually do with other anime, and i saw that it had a good score and that it was a comedy. i ended up watching it in a day and a half and i absolutely loved it. every episode made me crack up at least once and though it was extremely perverted, it was all done in a comedic manner. 
>> ARTICLE
K-On: Watched season 1, enjoying it so far! 8/10

Byousoku 5 Centimeter: [Minor spoiler](/s "Congratulations /r/anime, you rekt my feelings")

Plastic Memories: After reading one of those threads about tearjerkers. [](/s "Was not disappointed")

I'm thinking about watching Railgun / Index now but I'm still not sure about it... Maybe soon^tm
>> ARTICLE
> Railgun / Index

Definitely do! That anime has one of the best fictional universes I've ever seen. Anime is not as good as source material, but still is very good in my opinion! [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3ywe9a/wt_raildextoaru_series/), the [WT!] I wrote about the series. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually read that earlier today! Was a nice read.

There are a few things that keep me away from the series, though:

* It's unfinished / people seem to long for S3. I wouldn't like to watch an anime without a proper ending

* Fillers, god no.

* the translated LNs are unavailable where I live and I will probably want to read more after watching the Anime. + They aren't even fully translated yet

* The overall hate on MAL, what's the reason for this? unfaithful adaption?

So basically, Raildex has my attention but I can't really get myself to start watching it.
>> ARTICLE
K-ON because of the WT! thread.

Introduced me to moe anime and now KyoAni is my favourite studio.
>> ARTICLE
So Ra No Wo To and YuYuYu weren't as good as I expected

WA2. Would give more than 10/10 if I could. By far my favourite anime, and I don't even consider myself a romance/drama fan. Watched it 1.5 years ago and thinking about it, as well as listening so songs still make me somewhat depressed and tear up. 

Classroom Crisis. Probably one of the show that improved the most over the season.

Hanasaku Iroha was a great SoL show, very enjoyable and simple but well-executed.

Currently on ep 3 of Amagami. Still have no idea what to think of it... it's such a dumb show but I was giggling, smiling and squealing internally the whole way through.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero. It was very good. Animation quality was top notch, and Gilgamesh and Broskandar are some of the best characters I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate Shinsekai Yori, Parasyte, Death Parade, Zetsuen no Tempest... All of them in my top 10
>> ARTICLE
Baccano

It was so damn delightful.
>> ARTICLE
Mostly everything I've watched is because of this sub to be honest. I watch stuff I see mentioned pretty often so that I'm not left out of any conversation.

That being said, most of what I have watched is pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
Your Lie in April. 

I had seen it mentioned many times but I didn't know what it was about. I'm a pianist so I latched on but I could write a 5 page essay on why the ending ruined the show for me.

And no it's not because of the main thing that happened in the last episode because I anticipated it (who didn't) and I was fine with that, but because a scene or two that I thought were critical to wrap it up correctly from a storytelling standpoint were missing, considering everything that had transpired up until the finale.

I won't say more about it because I could go into quite a bit of detail, but without that "missing" scene I felt like the entire show had ultimately led to nothing.
>> ARTICLE
AKB0048 was recommended to me a few days ago, and I'm loving it.
>> ARTICLE
toradora ...had originally droped it but the Christmas club brought me back ..glad i stayed with it
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori and it was damn great. Maybe I'll start up psycho pass as well but for the most part the names that are thrown around here are just stuff from the last ~6 months that were fotm.
>> ARTICLE
Picked up Nisekoi because it's got generally good praise from the sub. Almost finished season 1 and enjoying it a lot. HanaKana and Nao Touyama help in that regard.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much every series I have seen up to this moment besides TTGL, KLK, and One Piece.

Loved every single one.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata because I saw a gif of the blood sword in action (a gif I, sadly, can't find anymore). It's now my favorite show (and sequel movie) ever. 
>> ARTICLE
same as op,  it is amazing
>> ARTICLE
yorozura quartet: actually quite enjoyable
>> ARTICLE
FLCL which was good but bizarre at the same time.
>> ARTICLE
This sub has finally drove me to watching the first recommended anime ever: Index s1

Currently starting ep 3, really loving Misaka Mikoto so far, her powers are just cool as fuck. Touma's character design is total crap but eh I'll forgive it.
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori, and it was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. I actually dropped it around episode 6 or so for a month, then tried it again and absolutely loved it. 11/10 I still pose too much months after finishing it.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka Magica: It was okay but eventually dropped it because I just didn't care about any of the characters.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: I see why others like this show but it wasn't my style. Dropped

Hunter X Hunter 2011: It was a solid shonen but nothing special except for 2 arcs.

Silver Spoon: One of my favorite slice of life series. Highly enjoyable and a good coming of age story.

Golden Time: Pretty mediocre. Only really good part about it was Kouko. 

Plastic Nee-San: Watched because of gifs. Found out the only funny parts of the show were the gifs. Disliked a lot.

Seirei no Moribito: This one was phenomenal and one of my favorites. Excellent all around series and Balsa is among my favorite characters now.
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka and Gintama. I watched 5 and 10 episodes respectively so far, for some reason i found them very boring and dont get the hype around them. At least with Gintama comedy is subjective but i couldnt get hyouka despite liking previous Kyoani anime. I guess those two are exceptions because i enjoy most of the things that are popular in this sub, im open to more recomendations.
>> ARTICLE
Psycho Pass and Kill la Kill. Both were really good. After I finish Devil is a Part timer and Deadman Wonderland it'll be on to Akame ga Kill and One Punch Man.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama. Watch the whole thing and caught up. No regrets lol
>> ARTICLE
Tatami galaxy and it was boring af, could have cut 3-4 episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf - friggin fantastic, one of my faves now
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop.

I'd rate it ~~5/7~~ 8/10. Fantastic soundtrack and good plot, but I don't think episodic anime are for me.
>> ARTICLE
Nagi No Asukara (even though I wanted to see it before, it was sitting in my PTW for months) and I absolutely loved it.

FMA:B (also because of a friend) and I didn't really like it.
>> ARTICLE
Currently watching, but I was influenced to watch Death Note. It's exciting, and I'm liking it a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
Samurai Champloo, and it was bloody great!
>> ARTICLE
Kill la kill

I really thought that i would hate it since i really disliked TTGL but i was pleasantly surprised (OP 2 is 10/10).

Ore Monogatari.

If you like feel good, comedy/love stories, this one is great for you.

there's a few others that I'll post when I remember them
>> ARTICLE
Gintama, fking Gintama
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou. It translates to my ordinary life and [light spoilers]( /s "A nuclear explosion happens in the first five minutes" ).

I still don't know what to make of it.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka and Hunter x Hunter: Two of my favorite shows, I love them.

Code Geass: I hate literally every character, and not in the "love to hate" way, I just wish I didn't have to watch anything with them in it. Lelouch and Spinzaku are at the top of that list. I found the "deep and profound characters and philosophy" to be shallow and childish. And it managed to be the only anime where a shoe-horned school setting actually bothered because it was that unnecessarily and poorly implemented. I consider the show to be average and nothing special, but the endless masturbation for it that goes on in this sub has fostered an intense loathing for the show in me.

Now the question is, do I get upvoted because I like two popular shows? Or downvoted because I hate one popular show?

Edit: Oh ya, I just want to add, the best part of Code Geass is the part where the fanbase come up with increasingly absurd explanations as to why Lelouch not knowing how to play chess is a sign of his genius (hint, the actual reason is because the writers didn't know how to play chess).
>> ARTICLE
Gakkougurashi: OK

Anohana: Terrible

White Album 2: Awesome

Unlimited Blade Works: OK
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari series! I'm currently watching it and I think it's very good, it's selling point IMO is definitely all the characters for sure though. Araragi's interactions with the other characters are so well done and so varied that the show never really gets repetitive or boring, definitely a good choice to start it. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched couple of them.

* Anohana - each time I think about it, I start cutting onions.
* Mushi - Very interesting but confusing at times.
>> ARTICLE
ERASED. Because of you lots.

My heart still weeps from previous episode.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama: definitely one of the best. Too bad it's ongoing, now I have to wait

Oregairu: It was fine. I feel like people are way over analyzing the series - I don't think it's that unique. I really liked some of the characters like Komachi and Yui but overall the show was pretty normal imo.
>> ARTICLE
I watched [Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/Gekkan_Shoujo_Nozaki-kun) after seeing it discussed a few times on this sub. I liked it a lot, purely for the comedy elements. As a romance though, or even as a story in general, it's very lacking.

[Spoiler](/s "Also, I was really letdown that we never get to see Hirotaka discover Lorelei's true identity.")

Edit: Fixed spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
Hibike  Euphonium

Wanted to try out a moe SoL since I've never really given the genre a chance. I enjoyed the moe stuff and goofy comedy, but was cringing every time one of the moeblobs suddenly had "depth" and gave some motivational speech or teary sob story, then went back to 15 minutes of moe fluff. Couldn't take any of it seriously and dropped it around ep 9
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari Series. Just can't get into it
>> ARTICLE
Jojo's a few weeks before the rewatch was announced. It's pretty damn good, starting Stardust Crusaders and I think I'll like it more than part 1 and 2.

Also HxH and god fucking damn it I love it, went straight into my top 3 anime of all time.

Shinsekai Yori (very good)

Berserk (perfect)

Spice and Wolf (took me by surprise)

D-frag (nothing fucking happens)

Wolf Children (don't make me feel these feels)

Danmachi because of a post named: Best anime bathing scenes'. The moment I started watching this anime I completely forgot why I was watching it in the first place and I really enjoyed it.

Stein;s gate and I've never regretted anything more in my life. 

Thankfully I also watched Berserk because of this sub and it was amazing.

School Days. You are all trolls. 1/10. I dropped it at 3 episodes but tried it again because I kept seeing people here say it was good, so I watched the rest.

White album 2 : ive been trying to avoid this show for a long time, but r/anime convinced me, now i wish i never saw it, people whove seen it will understand ( seriously DAT ENDING, besides its now in my top 5 anime with setsuna being my favorite girl in fiction )

well tbh, I used to watch many anime but i didnt really know much about the anime world. so I couldn't really know which were the good ones or the bad. now im in this community I see what is the real anime world and how amazing it is

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and the first episode of Bakemonogatari...

I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that you watched between 1 and 8 episodes of JoJo?

The Tatami Galaxy

Thank you

* **Hellsing Ultimate** - It's shit.
* **Shirobako** - Confusing and boring.
* **Ore Monogatari** - Surprisingly great.
* **Nanatsu no Taizai** - Entertaining, doesn't go much further than that.
* **Haikyuu!!** - Holy fuck that's awesome.
* **Spice and Wolf** - First time I'm considering buying a light novel.
* **Death Parade** - Just watched the pilot short and the first episode. Got bored as fuck, dropped it. And I don't like episodic shows.

>> ARTICLE
So we've reached the end of Greed Island. G.I. is a decent arc, but it's certainly not my favorite. To me it's 4th or 5th. I guess this also means you all will be heading into the Chimera Ant arc next. Get comfy people, cause she's a long one, but imo it'll all be worth it in the end.
>> ARTICLE
Okay so I don't really watch to much anime but I've been watching this show.  I have finished everything on Netflix and I was wondering why they are missing almost 50 episodes!?!  Do you know if  they  are getting the rest? 
>> ARTICLE
There is no news when or if Netflix is going to get the rest of the series. Watch the rest of it on Crunchyroll instead. It's free.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the reply!  I  thought crunchyroll cost money.  Okay I'll do that.  Also do you know of any other anime that is a must watch?  I really am new to the genre.  Other ones I have liked are Code geass,  Gurren Lagann,  FMA brotherhood and clannad
>> ARTICLE
Most things on Crunchyroll cost money, but Hunter x Hunter does not. As for recommendations, if you liked Code Geass you'll probably like Death Note. I'd also recommend Fate/Zero as well as Monster.
>> ARTICLE
I consider Greed Island my least favorite arc in the show, aside from the Killua Retrieval arc, which is so short it barely counts anyway. It's good as far as training arcs go, and the final fight was spectacular, but the general lack of development coupled with the decidedly fetch-quest-esque storyline just didn't give it as much punch as the other arcs.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Do know that this arc doesn't get any brighter. In fact it only gets darker and darker.

I do. I followed the manga years ago back when the author was able to write it out consistently every week and when i watched that bit i remembered things only get worse

Just a warning... The beginning of the chimera ants arc is not great guys.. I remember being extremely confused by the hype.

Stick with it though... In my opinion this is the best arc in any anime. No arc has ever ended so perfectly. It's a beautiful story with some truly amazing characters. Be grateful you don't have to wait a week between episodes and enjoy the ride.

The dodgeball game is definitely the highlight of Greed Island imo. Things do go uphill after a couple speed bumps.
>> ARTICLE
Buckle up guys, Chimera Ant arc is here. Our [](/s "  King  ") is on the way and he doesn't take shit from anyone. I really want to see reactions of newcomers in the weeks to come.
>> ARTICLE
A marked improvement from last week, but still not very good. The dodge ball game was the best part of the arc despite being drawn out, which is unfortunate in that it overshadowed the conflict with the bomber. It didn't help that they decided to throw in yet more training before that fight which felt like build up to nothing, I can't understand why they have the story structured so oddly, normally rising action leads to climaxes instead of lulls in the middle. All of this really crystallizes one of my biggest issues with Hunter x Hunter its tone. It has rather a lot of dark content such as people's hands being torn off by explosions being played completely straight, and at the same time has pirates playing over the top sports and Gon as a protagonist. What results is that it's hard to take the anime seriously, let alone get emotionally invested in its events. Finally, the choice to keep accompany was a good one plot wise, but I can already tell Gon's father won't be worth it.

Out of wonder am I the only person who is not enamored with this anime still watching it?
>> ARTICLE
Just because Gon idolizes his dad doesn't mean Gon's father has to be "worth it". I honestly never assumed that Gon's dad is going to be some supreme person. Sure, he may be a great hunter and all that stuff that keeps being mentioned about him, but that doesn't mean anything really.

For example, look at Chairman Netero and he's supposed to be best hunter there is and as a person, he seems pretty regular. No one is currently hyping up his ability or power. It's just that we see the show following Gon mostly so everything around him and his father are kinda hyped up.

Just don't think that Gon's dad has to be some one of a wonder really just because he inspired a bunch of people and is supposed to be really powerful.
>> ARTICLE
I see where you're coming from, I just think it will be underwhelming to have Gon's character motivation up until now lead to little of interest.
>> ARTICLE
Your issue of plot structure is addressed in the beginning of the arc.

* Ging's message confesses that Greed Island has no clue to his whereabouts, thus inclining us to believe that Greed Island is not pertinent to the overarching plot. 

Similar to Heaven's Arena where our heroes grow stronger in a structured setting before moving to the more harsh and lawless setting of Yorknew, **the Greed Island arc embodies the theme of being a "game".**

1. The story is meant to be a reprieve from the intensity of previous arcs and introduction of new elements
2. The emphasis on training mirrors games' core concept of teaching and challenging players, the elements of which are more emergent rather than smooth build-up and climaxes of traditional storytelling.

----

The trio also addresses your issue regarding clashing themes at the end of the arc when speaking to Goreinu. 

1. The possibility of death is one of the hardset clauses of the game 
2. Due to 1, everyone who enters the game implicitly concedes to the possibility of dying and the permitting of violence
3. Taking that "metagame" into consideration, our heroes conclude that the Bomber's actions, however heinous when interpreted by real world morality, is fair play and deserve no ill will for it.

**This juxtaposition of cheerful innocence and gray morality is considered one of HxH's best elements**, as it allows HxH to simultaneously occupy and defy traditional shonen tropes. *For me personally, this juxtaposition is something the 1999 adaption failed to portray with its emphasis on darker colour tones and why I adore the 2011 series.*

----

If, even with all the above taken into consideration, you still cannot enjoy Greed Island for what it is, I have nothing else to tell you. Togashi can't please everyone.

why aren't you posting to the hxh sub anymore? you were one of the best contributers.
>> ARTICLE
I got shadowbanned presumably because one of the mods doesn't like having their wording and reasoning criticized. *I think he/she saw me as a troll.*

In hindsight, that worked in my favor as the size of that subreddit community is somewhat restrictive in unexpected ways.

* e.g.: The regulars there are biased towards relating Alluka with real life transgender politics and too easily neglect how gender works in a fictional landscape.

I have found /r/anime is a fairer and stronger platform for sharing my fascination and admiration for the series, even if in-depth discussions are more scarce.
>> ARTICLE
Fair point but it might be worth checking it out again. The sub's gotten much more active and there are lots of discussion threads. 

Are you still shdowbanned? Is it possible to make an appeal? It's pretty shitty to ban a user who's contributing so much not to mention shadowbanning in general being a total dickmove.
>> ARTICLE
> shadowbanning in general being a total dickmove.

That about sums up how I felt about it, but I'm not inclined to make a fuss where I'm unwanted. 

Thank you for the praise and sympathy. edit: Really, it is always comforting to get positive feedback.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that Gon comes across as shockingly amoral especially since naive characters are typically unreasonably justice driven, but as a result he comes across as one of the most unrealistic characters I've seen in anime. Compare him to some of the child soldiers in Now and Then, Here and There and you'll see how weak his characterization is.

As for Greed Island's game like nature I agree that it provides emotional relief (if anything 20 episodes is way too much emotional relief)  because the life and death conflicts didn't feel as real and as such weren't emotionally compelling. You're also right that it mimicked the staccato storytelling of many games, but that's a bad thing.

I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy it at all, but I brought me very little enjoyment given how long it was.
>> ARTICLE
> I agree that Gon comes across as shockingly amoral

I referred to all three, as a trio, as the decision was made as a group. If Togashi had the idea originate from Gon alone (with possible debate from Killua/Biscuit), I would agree with your concerns, but that's just not the story we're looking at here.

Gon's characterization has explanations too, but too much to cover in the scope of this topic.

> You're also right that it mimicked the staccato storytelling of many games, but that's a bad thing.

It's not bad at all from a gamer's perspective; literature that accurately embodies gaming is scarce. 

...It's also fine when the HxH anime is viewed as a whole. In my opinion, looking at "Greed Island" as a stand-alone arc is a flawed approach. HxH is best served when one has the endurance and attention span to watch its entirety.

That's my final two-cents.
>> ARTICLE
Usually, the next arc changes people's minds. It's a looooong arc, though, so buckle up. 
>> ARTICLE
The Chimera Ant arc seems to result in very polarizing opinions, I hope I'll fall into the fanatic camp as well.
>> ARTICLE
For me the first section of this arc has so much momentum. And then instead of a climax there's a lull. But it gets back to a climax eventually, so I guess that makes it worth it? But you're right if HxH pushed through those rising action sequences it'd be so much more powerful. 
>> ARTICLE
The criticisms you've laid out in the above post continue to hold true for the majority of the Chimera Ant arc. People just enjoy the climax and denouement of the arc enough to forgive the clunky sections that came before it. 

I mean, I love the end of it too, but don't go into it with any kind of hype or expectations of the storytelling to reinvent itself.
>> ARTICLE
It's hard to tell. From your criticisms I can't really tell you how it'll effect you. The main problems people had with the Chimera Ant arc were its length and the overuse of the narrator. Both of which were admittedly very real problems with the arc. If those sound like irredeemable problems to you then you might not fall into the fanatic camp. Most people liked the Chimera Ant arc, but those that didn't REALLY didn't like it.

>> ARTICLE
After all that build up... damn that was NASTY. Gon annihilated Pitou, even busted up her face. Definitely one of my favorite scenes in anime I've seen to date.

It's a shame me and others have already caught up and finished the anime though.
>> ARTICLE
I usually don't like one-sided beatdowns, but that was one of my favorite "fights" in anime.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mind it because of how everything played out to get to that point. While I would've much rather preferred a more balance fight, seeing Pitou get absolutely destroyed like that was satisfying. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the Netero/Meruem fight covered that aspect. What we saw here, however, can't really be classified as a fight. More like an assault against a powerless victim.
>> ARTICLE
The Netero/Meruem fight wasn't exactly anything close to even.  If he wanted to, Meruem could have vaporized the Chairman from the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
He really couldn't have though. He was giving it his all the entire fight and inevitably won, but Netero's skills were clearly great enough to at least pose a challenge to him. If Meruem had the ability to beat him from the start, he would've done so.
>> ARTICLE
Meruem didn't want to kill him.  He was attempting to get him to stop fighting without having to kill him.  
>> ARTICLE
Meruem had two opportunities to end that fight before Netero used his zero hand. Had he been trying to earnestly kill Netero he would have simply taken off his head instead of his leg or his arm, but if he had he wouldn't have learned his name.
>> ARTICLE
True. Still though, the fight lasted for quite a bit before it even got to that point, and he was only able to do that because Netero accidentally hit them down into some random catacombs. Out in the open where Meruem wouldn't have anything to bounce off of, he'd have to find a different, probably less efficient tactic to use against Netero. He would still win, but it would take *a lot* longer. He was able to ping pong around and gain a shit ton of speed instead, which gave him a huge advantage.
>> ARTICLE
True, but above ground would be just an ineffective for Netero. He'd knock him away outside of his own range and would have to wait for Meruem to come back or chase after him. Either way he wouldn't be able to land as many hits as he would in the catacombs.
>> ARTICLE
True, but Meruem wasn't going down no matter how many times he hit him. From Netero's perspective, sure, you're right; but from what we know was actually the case, he was going to die no matter what happened. It was just a matter of time.
>> ARTICLE
Considering how badly the "winner" got wrecked, can you really call this beatdown one-sided?

>> ARTICLE
Oh god that Gon transformation. Chills everywhere on my body. 
>> ARTICLE
The build up to this point was great. Like most shounen protagonists, Gon always placed his friends first without caring for his own well-being. The show took it to a whole other level by having him lose his friend and Gon fighting to avenge instead of fighting to protect. Up until now, he was pure and innocent but became filled with pure hatred. This led to him sacrificing in exchange for power and revenge instead of unlocking some hidden power for friendship. Gon was punished and pained by the power instead of rewarded.
>> ARTICLE
Man I will never not feel terrible seeing Pitou get brutalized like that.  The whole situation Is just sad for everyone involved.  Sad for Gon, sad for Pitou, sad for Killua, just sad in general.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really concerned because I don't see any nice way this arc can be tied up in five episodes. It's reassuring that the king is still alive, but unfortunate that we haven't heard him reflect on the miniature roses and humanity's true power. Gon magically became a Jojo character, stylistically it was really awesome, but it feels like quite an ass pull.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I would be one of the few that agrees with you on the ass pull bit. Was entertaining to watch though. 
>> ARTICLE
Ahh yes, the asspull comment had to be here haha. Go back to YorkNew, ep 47.
>> ARTICLE
You're right that the show had established that characters can increase their own power dramatically through the use of limitations, but unlike in the York New city arc Gon's power up wasn't explained in advance let alone foreshadowed, and begs the question as to why other characters don't power up similarly when fighting with their lives on the line (which would justify any amount of sacrifice).
>> ARTICLE
There are a couple factors that made this transformation possible. First of all, it's been said that Nen is closely related to your emotions and mental state and Gon suffered some pretty harsh emotional trauma leading up to the transformation.

He also recieved the power he could potentially attain in the future due to his insane talent and potential. If someone like Netero were to make the same vow he likely wouldn't recieve any power since he's already reached his potential. Gon's only 14 years old so he's not even close to reaching his peak potential so the difference in power is quite dramatic.

If we're to assume that Gon "transmuted" his body similarily to Bisky and "enhanced" the transformation further by vowing to sacrifice his talent and potential then even his Nen category might have been a factor.

For someone else to gain the same power up they would need to have a similarily extreme personality like Gon, must have underwent the same amount of emotional turmoil, have the same amount of exceptional talent and potential and must not yet have reached their potential. Not to mention, feel the same hatred for their enemy and have the same resolve to kill them.

I also don't think the power up needs to be explicitly explained or foreshadowed if we have to knowledge to explain it ourselves.

Sure, it might feel like an asspull because it seemingly comes out of nowhere and the power up is somextreme but Nen is set up in a way where we can use all the little bits we've learned about it to find an explanation for the transformation.

Whether that explanation is satisfying or not is up to you. There will be a little more explanation in the series itself regarding the transformation in the next arc but nothing explicit.
>> ARTICLE
Most of the time it isn't worth it. Gon didn't only put his life in the line, he vowed to never use Nen again. You have to think, what is Gon's life wihtout Nen? Nothing. All he pursues has to do with Nen. He can't meet Ging wihtout Nen, he Can't be around Killua wihtout Nen, he can't be around his friends wihtout Nen. Apart from that, he sacrified his future, all that he could've been was lost because of that fight.

Others characters can do the same indeed, but what are their motivations? How strong is their resolve? Most of them would only put his life in the line, which is not strong enough to gain Gon's power. 

Also, what's the problem with the power not being directly foreshadowed or excplicitly explained?
>> ARTICLE
It's not an asspull at all. From the very moment they introduced nen, they said the more limits you put on it, the stronger it will be. Essentially, the greater the sacrifice, the greater the power. The chimaera ants are an incredible threat and to actually defeat one Gon sacrificed so much that he literally aged to the point where he could defeat one. Fuck dude. 
>> ARTICLE
I can understand that this may feel more like an asspull because you don't get to see the immediate aftermath, but trust me, Gon's few minutes of power came at a ridiculously hefty price. Powerups like this don't come cheap with nen.
>> ARTICLE
Even though there are drawbacks it is still an ass pull. I guess that's what happens when you create such strong villains and have your MC be a rookie fighting one of them.
>> ARTICLE
I think you need to learn the definition of an asspull. Vows and restrictions have been a staple of nen since Yorknew City. Gon's transformation implements no new mechanics of nen that weren't established prior.
>> ARTICLE
Plus Pitou knew Gon could fight the King, he'd have beaten it anyway regardless, it just would have been less satisfying.
>> ARTICLE
Prepare to cry

Finally, the York New City arc. This arc one of my 2 absolute favourite arcs in any anime. It not only focuses my favourite character more, it also introduced the awesome phantom troupe. 
>> ARTICLE
This arc & Chimera Ant are definitely the two best in HxH. 
>> ARTICLE
I really, really did not like [](/s "how drug out the Chimera Ant arc was.  There were so many random subplots and so much character development for minor and utterly boring characters.")

>> ARTICLE
Ah, a fellow Kurapika fan? My favorite character by far.
>> ARTICLE
Oho! I did not know this rewatch was underway! I am overflowing with excitement! \*u*

--

During my more personal viewings alone and with friends, I was fixated on just how beautifully the adaption matched my internal perception of the series. Now, after many threads of discussing HxH, I can appreciate how well-planned the series is.

----

Nen is my favorite part of the series, so I like to angle my approach on how Togashi builds up to the most epic moments between nen-users. For this section of the series, that is obviously Uvogin's one-man show in the wasteland.

* In the Heaven's Arena, Gon and Killua were introduced Nen, but are limited to the basics. We don't get to see much beyond some parlor tricks from Hisoka and even Kurapika's new co-workers.
* The Phantom Troupe and an newly overpowered Kurapika being introduced in the following arc is the perfect segue into the deep end of Nen without endangering the boys.

In 43-44, we get to see Uvo SLAUGHTER a small army and overcome supposedly renowned underworld nen users. 

* When Uvo unleashes his [Big Bang Impact](http://i.imgur.com/K7retyD.jpg), the scene is reminiscent of Dragon Ball Z where everything is bathed in the light of his power. For a short moment, everyone is captivated, even the viewers I like the imagine, as this is the first time power of that scale is shown in the series.

That level of destruction sneakily serves a secondary purpose of foreshadowing Gon potential future as an enhancer! One cannot help but be stoked for future development on multiple levels!

----

Working backwards, you can see how meticulously Togashi planned for events to build up to this moment, without sacrificing the momentum needed to transpire to bigger things. 

Any more-compromising mangaka would have glazed over things like Kurapika's entry into underworld employment, Gon and Killua's ploys for money, and the early introduction and development of Uvogin as a handful of Spiders meetup on their way to Yorknew.

So we finally arrive in the fan favorite arc: Yorknew City. I'll save my general impressions of arc until next week, but for now i would like to point out a few things i enjoyed while watching.

1. While most people remember this storyline for it's fast paced action, the first two episodes with Gon returning home with Killua, provides excellent character development for both our heroes. 

2. The Phantom Troupe itself contains some of my favorite characters in the series. The entire dynamic between all the members sometimes seems more like a family, than a group of criminals. One which, while they may not admit it, truly do care for each other

3. While i certainly liked Kurapika during the Hunter Exam arc, i feel it's here he truly comes into his own as a character.

4. I also feel Hisoka is at his best in this arc. Acting for two different groups at once, while still working towards his own ends. This makes him an unpredictable wildcard, and an outsider to the otherwise close knit Phantom Troupe.

that's spoilers for next week

Oh holy crap, you're totally right, i read that title as episodes 37-47.

Edited, sorry about that.
>> ARTICLE
Kurapika... I missed you so much...
>> ARTICLE
Didn't know this was a thing. Don't mind if I tag along for the rewatch. I already rewatched up to episode 40 when I got my brother into HxH a couple months back so it seems I found this at the perfect time.

&nbsp;

EDIT: Caught up to ep. 46 so some impressions from 37 onward.

* Ging is such a tease, he's a bad person, he said it himself.

* We get introduced to the bodyguard group and the Phantom Troupe, I guess we can start making up fight pairings as in any other shounen battle anime. --- Or not, half of the bodyguards are dead by episode 46... The show gets a lot darker quite quickly and the [Phantom Troupe's epic theme] (https://youtu.be/0jY0sv1hwJw) just adds to the darker mood.

* Uvogin is even more of a badass than I remembered, that Big Bang Impact is just too much.

* I love all the weirdos of this show: Hisoka is my favorite character and Neon's reaction to all the people killed and the mummy she didn't get is just too much.

* Kurapika's determination to hunt the Spiders and only the Spiders is admirable. The ability to put such extreme conditions on yourself is one of the reasons I find the Nen powers so great.
>> ARTICLE
In a shocking twist my usual negativity is replaced by optimism since these episodes were decidedly better than everything up until now. The reasons as to why seem to be threefold. Firstly, Gon is playing a more minor role, which is good because he's been badly characterized and tends to put himself in fights that he has no reason to expect he should be able to survive. That's not to say we're given any reason to believe that Kurapika could possibly die, but the same can't be said for her comrades. Second, there's much more interesting motivation. Kurapika's thirst for revenge is simply more compelling, than Gon's search for his father, Killua's desire escape his life as an assassin or the goal of becoming a hunter. Third, an actual plot is developing. Unlike the previous arcs we're seeing larger scale conflicts as opposed to single fights, and real fights instead of games and tournaments. I can't honestly say that those changes are enough the make the show good, but they're leaps and bounds in the right direction. I look forward to this anime improving more.

>> ARTICLE
For all the Greatness of the 2011 HXH  there is one thing they crucially FUCKED UP

Kite 

Yes Kite the anime failed to mention/changed that Kite is the reason why Gon wanted to become a hunter . 


In the 1999 version and the manga, Kite informs Gon that his father did not die in an accident  but that he is a professional Hunter and is Kite's mentor. He leaves Ging's Hunter License in the boy's possession and then leaves to find Ging as a final test claiming that it is the most difficult hunt in the world. And so starts Gons journey to becoming a hunter . 

Mind you This all happened in the first episode of the 1999 and first chapter of the manga and not just a flash back in chimera ant arc like 2011

Edit: Thats why Gon is so angry on the ant arc. [Spoiler](/s "Gon giving up on everything againts Pitou") was much more understandable if they mentioned Kites history with Gon like in the manga . Some watchers of 2011 might be thinking why is he so mad and care for a guy  he just met.  Well now you know 
>> ARTICLE
TL;DR

>I liked a thing that happened in the original incarnation better than the show.

Nothing to see here.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing to see here except a Big information of the series  that got cut 

Considering the 2011 is a faithful adaption of the manga its only natural to wonder why it was changed .

That is like full metal alchemist NOT showing and explaining why Edward and Alphonse became a Alchemist ( meaning the mother scene getting cut from the show can you imagine ? )




>> ARTICLE
It's more like, an important plot point was left out. If they decided to manipulate the source material and take a different route, whatever. But I feel like if they had just given like 30 seconds in one episode to have Kite say a few words to Gon, the plot wouldn't have changed at all but the story would be a lot more emotional. Personally I didn't care about Kite at all, and thought it was weird that Gon did so much. Maybe they reached a maximum feels capacity for the chimera ant arc and had to omit some, idk.
>> ARTICLE
>If they decided to manipulate the source material and take a different route, whatever.


Did you watch the show? Thats exactly what they did. Everyone here has either a selective memory or a terrible one. 
>> ARTICLE
I think you misunderstood what I'm saying. It's clear they did not omit that scene because it was incompatible with the version of the story they wanted to tell; I feel that if they had added that bit, little to no rewriting would've had to be done. Also I'd like to add that I have neither read the manga nor watched the 1999 version, I am commenting purely under the assumption that the information in that first comment is true.

Also the reason why I feel it was an "omission" is because Gon appears irrationally attached to Kite after a short time. It seems that they wanted to keep the epic scene from the manga, even though a lot of backstory leading up to that encounter was not established.
>> ARTICLE
>It's clear they did not omit that scene because it was incompatible with the version of the story they wanted to tell

That doesn't matter? Changes happen in every story retelling or story adapting. It wasn't at all game changing.


I understood you saying. 


>It's more like, an important plot point was left out.


And it wasn't. 



>I feel that if they had added that bit, little to no rewriting would have to have been done.

So what? 


>Also I'd like to add that I have neither read the manga nor watched the 1999 version, I am commenting purely under the assumption that the information in that first comment is true


Then how do you know it would be more emotional? I haven't seen it either, but I read the manga. (after watching the 2011)


And I think the 2011 beginning IS BETTER. The old one has Mito lying to Gon about Ging's death and Gon making a spur of the moment decision to follow in *Kite's* footsteps. 


I like it better, that he was always thinking about how awesome hunters must have it (or else why would Ging devote his life to it? He wants to understand).

 And he knew his dad could catch the giant fish at his age and all that, it just felt way more "feel good". Which was the tone they were going for. 


>> ARTICLE
I guess I understand that. Changing the role to Mito did help the first episode set up the story well. I guess, what I really would've liked is if they made Kite just a little bit more significant in Gon's life. I realize he saved his life, but in the show it seemed like Gon had totally forgotten about him until Kite reminded him. You can tell me I'm wrong I guess, but personally I remember being confused by Gon whenever Kite was involved. He totally broke. Like everything that was Gon up to that point was betrayed. Over some guy he seemed to hardly know. It wasn't enough to totally break immersion, but that kind of reaction is what I MIGHT'VE expected if someone like KILLUA was killed. but some random supporting character that was just introduced?
>> ARTICLE
> but in the show it seemed like Gon had totally forgotten about him until Kite reminded him.

Yeah, he met him 9 years ago, thats understandable. But when he reminds him and tells him he's also searching for Ging, it blows his little fucking mind. He feels a special connection to Kite. 


Also, everyone here is completely ignoring the fact that, Gon felt responsible for Kite's death. Thats why he broke down. 

Look at the thoughts going through his head, when he learns Kite is actually dead.


http://www.mangastream.to/hunter-x-hunter-chapter-305-page-3.html
>> ARTICLE
Wow yeah that's really intense. It makes sense that it wasn't so much the character's significance, as it was the role Gon (believed he) played in his death.
>> ARTICLE
>It makes sense that it wasn't so much the character's significance

Sorry, I know you're finally agreeing with me, but I think Kite was also particular significance to Gon. He was the only one who shared a similar connection with Ging, which is why they became so close, so fast.

>Some watchers of 2011 might be thinking why is he so mad and care for a guy he just met. Well now you know 


I remember them interacting though? They had a flashback to it.



>At the age of 9, Gon Freecss is attacked by a foxbear mother protecting its cub. Kite saves Gon by killing the mother and then chastises the boy for making him kill it. He punches Gon in the face because of the boy's ignorance. He then tries to kill the cub, claiming it will grow up hating humans and will therefore be a danger to them. However, Gon stops Kite and vows to raise the cub.


this was in the 2011. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes you are right they were interacting on the flash back in 2011  He saves gon from a monster Bear just like in the manga and 1999  but thats it . He did not give Ging's Hunter  license to him or tell Gon anything about Ging . And this scene happened in the first episode of 1999 unlike 2011 which is only a flashback in the chimera ant arc


>> ARTICLE
Right. So they clearly didn't "crucially fuck up". 
>> ARTICLE
Actually for me they did no matter how much I like the 2011 version.

Kite is THE hunter he is the one who told Gon to become a Hunter, He is the one who told Gon to look for Ging , He is the main reason there is a Hunter x Hunter since Gon is the protagonist . He sets The path for Gon to become a Hunter in the first episode of 1999/manga 

Kite is very Important in the manga/1999 he is up there with Ging on the importance of the whole series .

If you have this knowledge that Kite is this important to the series and not just a new character from a new arc like like Bisky in Greed Island (in the watchers eyes) then I feel that the whole experience would definitely  improved and you would feel sorry for Gon much more .
>> ARTICLE
>Kite is THE hunter he is the one who told Gon to become a Hunter, He is the one who told Gon to look for Ging , He is the main reason there is a Hunter x Hunter since Gon is the protagonist .


And they rewrote that, for a more believable and feel good beginning.


I *much* prefer, Gon always knowing about Ging being a hunter and wondering what being a hunter is like. He wants to know why Ging devoted his life to it, he wants to understand. I also don't like the Mito lying to Gon part, it messes with the tone they're going for. 


>If you have this knowledge that Kite is this important to the series and not just a new character from a new arc like like Bisky in Greed Island (in the watchers eyes) then I feel that the whole experience would definitely improved and you would feel sorry for Gon much more .


They *did* do that imo. Kite definitely felt more important to Gon than Bisky or Knuckle. 


You're  also glossing over the fact that one of the biggest reasons for his breakdown, was that he wholeheartedly believed, it was *his* fault. Just to fit your notion that 2011 fucked up. 

>> ARTICLE
At the end of the day its all opinions and taste . 

If you feel the 2011 chimera ant has been improved by changing  Kites history with Gon and first episode of the series  then Its fine by me .

Also Im not denying the fact that Kite definitely feels more important than Bisky and Knuckle but for me His Impact could had been much much more if they did not change things especially on a faithful adaptation to the manga such as the 2011 version .

But for me and some people its better if they did not change or removed anything  anything that big in the series . 

Edit :Also not ignoring that I know that Gon knows its his fault for kites ****  but it would be more emotional and impacting if that happens to his Idol ,Inspiration and a Old friend  instead of just a Old friend that knows ging

>> ARTICLE
Do you think its better having Mito lie to Gon about his father?


Do you think its better having Gon *adopt* Kite's goal or to have his own goal and happen to bump into kite later? Then Kite can reveal his goal and blow his little brain open. It makes perfect sense why Gon feels a special connection too, he doesn't have anyone else to talk to Ging about.  


>**You're also glossing over the fact that one of the biggest reasons for his breakdown, was that he wholeheartedly believed, it was his fault.**


"oh you're right, I forgot about that! I guess nobody did fuck up after all!" -What you'll never say. 
>> ARTICLE
Thought I'd give my opinion.

> Do you think its better having Mito lie to Gon about his father?

Yes, that sounds exactly like Mito. Does the 2011 version expand on her character when Gon and Killua go back to Whale Island or at some other time? Because she doesn't really do anything at the beginning of it. (I've pretty much only seen the first few episodes and the last 50ish so I don't know what happens in between)

>Do you think its better having Gon adopt Kite's goal or to have his own goal and happen to bump into kite later? 

He doesn't adopt Kite's goal. Gon wasn't looking for Ging because Kite was doing so when they first met.
>> ARTICLE
>Yes, that sounds exactly like Mito.


Umm what? Why? Mito is depicted as nothing but a caring guardian. 
It totally doesn't fit the tone of the first few episodes. 

>He doesn't adopt Kite's goal. Gon wasn't looking for Ging because Kite was doing so when they first met.


Okay but he was looking for him just to find him. And its thats the case, why doesn't he also search for his birth mother?


Because he doesn't just want to find him, he wants to understand him. Their final conversation (Gon and Ging) is so much more meaningful this way. 
>> ARTICLE
I think you just missed my edited post my apologies  here is is :

''Edit :Also not ignoring that I know that Gon knows its his fault for kites **** but it would be more emotional and impacting if that happens to his Idol ,Inspiration and a Old friend instead of just a Old friend that knows ging''

As for you questions As I said we got different taste and opinion on how Hxh should had started up and the meeting of Kite . 

I can see where you are coming from since I also like to have my own Goal but for me I prefer the manga /1999 version where Kite was Gon 's Inspiration since they share a common interest on finding out what happen to Ging  not really telling Gon to '' kid Go do this because its my goal '' Because Gon can always refuse to be a hunter or refuse to look for Ging
>> ARTICLE



>Because Gon can always refuse to be a hunter or refuse to look for Gings


Then there would be no story. 


I believe they changed it, because they realized the motivations made more sense this way. Gon doesn't need two idols or two inspirations. His dad is his idol and the story is better because of it.


The final scene between them, is sooooo much better, infinity more satisfying. Gon finally understands why Ging became a hunter and is always on the move. 


Its not just, Hey look you're alive! I found you! Okay later!


I personally see zero reason to transfer Gon's admiration for Ging towards Kite. Maybe Kites death would've been more meaningful but the whole driving force behind the series is lessened. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow that sort of makes the whole ant arc signifigantly better. Gon doesn't just tag along on the hunt of some guy he just met this was the guy who inspired him to be a hunter there is so much more of a relationship there. My biggest complaint about the anime was the ant arc felt like filler even though it wasn't, there was so little reason for gon to do what he was doing but now it makes a lot more sense. I still think the arc in the anime is a little elongated but at least it doesn't seem like just some random story for no reason.

I never actually realised this. As I watched the first 20 or so episodes of the 1999 version then changed to the 2011 version. I'm glad I did that now. :)
>> ARTICLE
Huh, that actually did matter to me quite a bit as I felt like Gon seemed rather unjustifiable mad, so that even for being as good hearted as he is, I thought it was out of character. 

I mean his emotions towards kite pretty much encompasse most of Gon's involvement in the Chimera arc, so it wasn't just some negligible bit that I could ignore.

Do you remember that flashback? He's known Kite most all his life in both instances. And he's spent the last few weeks looking up to him. 


If Killua got murdered right after the Hunter exam, I feel like Gon would respond similarly. Same with Nettero or any of his friends. Gon *really* cares about his friends. 
>> ARTICLE
>He's known Kite most all his life in both instances.

That's not really the problem. The difference is when this is revealed to the audience. Knowing how important Kite is to Gon from day 1 vs. finding out in a flashback after the CA Arc begins is totally different.
>> ARTICLE
Its the same thing, even better in the 2011 version. You can read my other comments if you care how i feel. Or i can copy paste them for you, i'm kinda done convincing people that it was better in the 2011 version. 2 for 2 is good enough for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Knowing that would help understanding Gons emotions towards him better so I am kind of upset that they didn't put it into the anime. On the other hand though I was able to understand Gons emotion nontheless, so it was nothing crucial they left out.

Is there anything else that they changed from the manga that was rather important?

Another problem I had with Kite is that he felt significantly different after [spoiler](/s "he became an ant, but it didn't feel intentional. It would make sense but because everyone treated him as the same person it bothered me. I am uncertain though if I just didn't grasp his character completely and I am just wrong though, because I don't have much confidence in my ability to analyze characters.")

I have a feeling, regarding your spoiler, is that it was not completely him, thus the difference.  The same way the captain was not the same as the kid.

>They often are NOT the deciding factor in which side prevails during any of the central conflicts

And there it is. This, I think, aside from the strength of the antagonists' characters and Togashi's ability to develop a character, is the real reason I enjoy the show so much. It's not that I don't enjoy watching a main character play a central role in a conflict, but the way Togashi presents this is so unique it's refreshing in a way. In almost every story that involves conflicts like these, the main character is the deciding factor, the person who falls into the "chosen one" trope. We rarely get to see our main characters play a side role to the main conflict, and I've always felt that was a huge factor in what made HxH so good.
>> ARTICLE
That was actually much more intentional than expected. Togashi, when creating the final parts of Yu Yu Hakusho, [tought he had developed everything in the main cast and didn't want to milk the franchise like many other authors.](http://mangahakuran.tumblr.com/post/24322952420/from-an-interview-with-togashi-shortly-after-yyh) So, he made Hunter x Hunter trying to focus on the side cast, making the central characters weaker and simpler, hence two little kids.

I think this is why he asspulled Gon's revival in the show. He realized Gon's determination and optimistic attitude would end up in him killing himself for vengeance, but Shonen jump again wouldn't want him ending it, and he himself made it for this purpose.
>> ARTICLE
He has also, apparently, gone on in the manga to make it less of an asspull. From what I hear [Manga and Election Arc spoilers](/s "Alluka/Nanika are (currently) inexplicably tied to the Dark Continent, which contains a number of things on the same order as the Chimera Ants in terms of potential and threat level. So currently, it seems like an asspull but may very well play a much larger role in the grand scheme of things.")
>> ARTICLE
Good to know. But it is still hard to believe the boy everyone thought spent his whole life training to be an assassin, being able to rip hearts out with his bare hands in a flash and resisting all kinds of torture, had actual time to spend playing with his little sister. o - o

I mean, it can make sense in that universe. They could have trained him with some sort of well developed nen technique. It's just so unfitting, with all that bloody and cold image of his life they tried to build.

Have they already explained how did she fall in the family hands? Were they on a mission and brought her home or something similar?
>> ARTICLE
> had actual time to spend playing with his little sister

The show makes it abundantly clear that the Zoldycks, despite being brutal assassins, look out for their own. That means allowing the kids time to be kids as well as training them.

> Have they already explained how did she fall in the family hands?

It's been explained that Alluka is Killua's biological sister. She was born of the same mother, it's just that somehow, she became tied to Nanika.
>> ARTICLE
> Have they already explained how did she fall in the family hands? Were they on a mission and brought her home or something similar?

What do you mean? I think we can infer that Killua's mother gave birth to Alluka, but I don't think Togashi ever explicitly stated that.  She could be given birth and obtained a crazy power, or she could have been invaded by something from the Dark Continent as a fetus or w/e.  
>> ARTICLE
Kinda rubs me the wrong way hearing him call Hisoka gay. After all Hisoka's arousal seems to stem entirely from sensing a great fighter's potential or looking forward to especially tough opponents. 

Other than that, the Phantom Troupe arc was my highlight of the show. I couldn't stand the Greed Island arc much, since neither the 'game' nor the characters were interesting, nor did I enjoy the majority of the Chimera Arc due to its pacing and change of narration style later on. It has some wonderful themes, a bunch of decent and even great new characters and action sequences. However, it's all padded out so, so badly. If nothing else I would've really appreciated it if they cut some of the less important ants screentime down dramatically. I binge watched that arc and still got furious about the very slow *overall progress*. I think I would've imploded had I watched the show on a week to week basis.

I feel like people who call Hisoka gay are idiots who never actually watched the anime but just watched clips of him. He gets aroused by strong opponents or possible potential which Gon had.

They think he's some pedophile when in reality I guess you could call him a battlephile. He's attracted to especially strong opponents, which is why he is attracted to Gon and Killia, because they have incredible potential, not because they're kids.

hisoka a gay for gon
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to say you're wrong. What makes a pedophile is that they love and are attracted to children, because they're children. Hisoka couldn't give two shits if they're 12, 18, or 57 as long as they were still as strong.

This is not hard to understand. If you still disagree then I will choose to agree to disagree and end it here.

Gonna be that guy and point out some things he gets wrong.

* Gon didn't want to find Ging to ask why he left him behind. Gon wanted to discover what it was about being a hunter that was that important, and to meet this seemingly mythical figure that was Ging.
* *Kill-you-ah*
* Hisoka is a magnificent magician, you casual!
* I didn't find most of the character development to be cheesy.
* I have never understood the criticism that "the arcs don't connect properly". Seemed to me like the story progressed perfectly naturally. Gives it a bit more realism. It's not like life has a solid, clear conclusion for everything.
* It's a shounen. There can't be *no* training arcs/montages at all...

He was completely on the mark about how fights are hard to predict and the main cast are usually weaker than all their enemies and failure is common, which is one of the best qualities of HxH. Also the fact that every character feels like a real person, with unique and distinct personalities and multiple dimensions. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
You probably get downvoted because you don't know what you're talking about.

* I'm not the one who doesn't like training arcs. Digi is.
* I don't think you understand how Gon felt. To say he was just "really mad" is criminally underrating the turmoil he was going through. I don't know how the show could have made it anymore clearer. Gon was **broken**.
* His powerup was not an asspull. And it contradicts nothing said so far. Restrictions/limitations were clearly explained in the Yorknew arc. That's how Kurapika gained so much strength against the Phantom Troupe in such a short amount of time. The stronger the restriction/limitation, the stronger the increase in the power of your Nen/Hatsu becomes. Gon gave up everything. As in the rest of his life. Just for a power boost for a few minutes. That is a pretty heavy Vow/Restriction so it's no surprise in the power boost he received. Also, bear in mind that humans in HxH can become pretty frigging strong. Netero, as strong as he is, was twice as strong when he was in his prime. And there were many others who were around his level.
* Pitou did not say Gon would kill Meruem. She said his claws could reach him/he is on the same level, but never said anything about being stronger. Which means she thinks there is a good chance Gon could kill him, not definitely.

To be fair Luffy is OP as fuck from the start, whereas Gon starts off as a skilled but comparatively weak protagonist.

I mean, Luffy 1 mans an entire pirate crew on episode 1...

Thats incorrect man, do you read One Piece? (thats sounded more dickish than I meant it, genuinely curious if you read it)


Luffy trained for 18 years on the Island. his childhood flashback might be considered partially trainingish arc, now that I think about it.


But Luffy gets his face smashed in, all the time. He left his island, being the strongest person in East Blue (save Mihawk, or any other crazy strong passersby, but he was strongest East Blue resident) and didn't get that much resistance until he fights the second strongest East Blue resident (Arlong). 


But once he hit the grandline, everything got bigger. He's still not that strong (post time skip) because he just hit the New World. Things are getting *even bigger*. 


tldr: I love One Piece.

I don't read One Piece, just watched a few eps and came to give an opinion which I think I have proven correct. One Piece does have a "trainingish" arc which means that you comment stating that it didn't is false.

This response may seem a bit dickish but I'm just pointing out that all shonen has some phase where the MC recieves some for of powerup be it through training or other methods so you can't claim OP to be above HxH in this aspect.

Yes, I do think you're being a bit douchey now. I never claimed OP was better than HxH (it is) but OP does NOT have training arcs. 


>came to give an opinion which I think I have proven correct.


You have not. I mentioned that Luffy and Ace did train occasional y during the Luffy's New family arc, but its not a training arc. It depicts his life on the island and during that time, he would spar with his brothers, steal treasure, rob thugs, get captured and get rescued. but its not a subsection of the story devoted to getting stronger or learning techniques, they don't do that. 


Similar to how we just see Zoro lifting weights in the background sometimes, he's training but its not a training arc. And thats not better or worse, training arcs don't feel appropriate for the base of One Piece. They're never preparing for a big battle, they're just cruising. 

I'm glad I helped you feel all right and superior about something you've never seen though. 



>> ARTICLE
Even after all that, the show makes it fairly evident pretty early on that there are still enemies way above their level. It was teased with Mihawk vs. Zoro and comes full circle (Water 7- present). They do nothing but loose until TS.

They will still get pushed around a bit sometimes. They still stand practically zero chance against to Admirals/Yonko/Some Shichibukai/Some Vice Admirals.

Yeah, fights were one of the strongest points. The fact that Hisoka is one of the strongest characters, yet his power is so "small" compared to others is one of the best examples of that.

mind you we never saw Hisoka being serious in a fight, ever.
and Hisoka wanted to pick a fight with Chrollo.

>Gon didn't want to find Ging to ask why he left him behind. Gon wanted to discover what it was about being a hunter that was that important, and to meet this seemingly mythical figure that was Ging.

At a couple of points Gon very clearly says "Being a hunter must be pretty great if he decided to do that instead of being my Dad" linking the two. The reason he sees being a hunter as so important (as you point out) is directly related to it seemingly being more important than himself/his upbringing to Ging, who he learns about through Kite. This is another reason it's a shame 2011 didn't include Kite stuff at the start.

>I have never understood the criticism that "the arcs don't connect properly". Seemed to me like the story progressed perfectly naturally. Gives it a bit more realism. It's not like life has a solid, clear conclusion for everything.

I agree with this too (and all your other points). *Maybe* excluding the very early arcs, prior to when Yorknew kicks into gear. Those seemed more haphazard, but it's only like 40ish episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I imagine experiencing the life of a hunter is kind of an act of self-justification for Gon. Since Ging left Gon to live as a hunter, Gon's own experiences as one can be applied to his self worth in a way. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it was more Gon being curious and fascinated by how great being a hunter must be to make a guy leave his kid, rather than what Digi implied which was sort of "why did you leave me, Dad?". He explains his feelings fully to Mito.
>> ARTICLE
Originally in the manga gon left to find his dad. He admired him by the tales kite told him, kite also mentioned that the final task he had was to find his father. Gon was curious to find out what his dads work was like and left and made it his main mission to find his father which was always his goal through out the manga.

In Japanese yes, but when you want to ~~basterdize~~ Americanify the name, it should be Kill-you-ah or Kee-Loo-ah
>> ARTICLE
Great video. I do have a few things that I think are worth mentioning that Digi left out.

In regard to the comparative strength of Hunter x Hunter's respective arcs, I agree that they are definitely not all equal. *However*, one of the things that makes the show so good later on is that it takes its time to mature, so that the emotional appeal of the Chimera Ant arc is definitely earned. Digi kind of touched on this with his thoughts about the complex emotions that Killua faces in his relationship with Gon towards the end of the arc. I only give 10/10 scores to shows that I believe are good all the way through, and the Greed Island arc really lost me. I definitely consider it the show's low point, and overall I thought that it was honestly pretty bad.

The second thing I thought was worth mentioning is Togashi's strength in writing antagonists. With the exception of the Greed Island arc(and this is probably part of the reason that I don't think very highly of it), Hunter x Hunter has some damn good villains. All of them are made likable and interesting to some extent(with the exception of a lot of the ants. this is all forgiven by the development of you-know-who), to the point where sometimes it isn't even clear what side you should be rooting for.
>> ARTICLE
What's wrong with Gensuru? Sure, he's no Hisoka or [CA Arc](/s "Meruem"), but he's still a cool villain.
>> ARTICLE
He's just so boring in comparison to every other antagonist in the series. I'm talking about the comparative strength of the arcs here, so in comparison to the rest of the villains I just thought that he was boring.

I guess in comparison to the other HxH villains I'd call him the most "plain" and "boring", but personally I don't think that's a bad thing. I also found his nen ability to be quite interesting.

I liked Greed Island, but for me the low point was the first 10 episodes of the Chimera Ant arc. I'm glad they went somewhere better with it in the end because at first I thought the arc was going to be *terrible*. Glad I was wrong about that though. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it takes awhile to pick up steam but the reward sure is worth it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Chrollo is still probably my favorite character from the entire series and York New stands as my favorite arc. I wasn't a fan of Greed Island or CA, but I thought the rest was pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
I think that he left out the Chimera Ant Arc on purpose because he wanted others to have the full experience without spoilers, and only indriectly mentioned(don't know if that is a word in english, hope so though) the consequences for the characters and their relations to each other for the sake of better explaining the focus of the show and why people think it's so good.

Do you have certain criterias or certain words fitting for certain scores? For example the way Mal put a descriptions for each number, 10 being a masterpiece, 9 being great etc..

I don't really like the idea of a show needing to be extremely constistent to be able to reach a 10. If something manages to impress me on multiple levels, reach me as a person and makes me think about the themes or other things which I regard highly, it deserves to be a 10/10 for me. If the some parts are incredibly good (like the chimera ant arc), they can outweigh parts which I didn't think of as incredibly good, but good nontheless, especially if they were neccesary to set up for the really great stuff. Which brings me to myn ext question.

Would you mind going more in depth about why you didn't like the Greed Island arc? In retrospective all I can really complain about are the rather boring antagonists and the world and the mechanics of the game being rather simple.
>> ARTICLE
> Do you have certain criterias or certain words fitting for certain scores? For example the way Mal put a descriptions for each number, 10 being a masterpiece, 9 being great etc..

For me, tens are generally the perfect storm that just do everything they try to do perfectly, and never leave me bored or disinterested. Presently, this is limited to Ping Pong, Katanagatari, FMA:B, and EoE. This is not to say that I think these shows are flawless, just that they come really close.

> Would you mind going more in depth about why you didn't like the Greed Island arc? In retrospective all I can really complain about are the rather boring antagonists and the world and the mechanics of the game being rather simple.

It's just such a low-note coming off of the brilliant Yorknew arc. The antagonist is generic and boring, there's a ton of training montages, and outside of the dodgeball game I don't think I was even intrigued by a single aspect of this arc. I guess it was kind of cool that Ging had planned all this out in order to help Gon, and I didn't necessarily hate the arc, but it just felt so poor in comparison to the rest of the series.

Please don't be offended but I don't really like your rating system. Wouldn't that mean that a show like Kill la Kill which is (at least from my perspective) mindless fun with fanservice be a 10/10 because it does what it is supposed to pretty much perfectly?

Making you a bit bored can also be the goal of a show for a certain time for a purpose the viewer may or may not know at the time of boredom (I would argue that the second season of Haruhi does this extremely well). It can also work as a part of atmosphere.

I guess the points of the Greed Island arc you mentioned just didn't bother me much. I also think that the training montages were done well, neccesary and serve a bigger purpose than just showing of how hard they train as it is also part of the grand narrative. The antagonists were certainly generic and pretty boring, but they still served a purpose and they were people Gon and Killua should and inevitably have to meet. They are (at least as far as I can remember, might be wrong about both antagonists and the other part) the only people that only care about money and do everything in order to get that money, compared to the other characters, that are antagonists from Gons and Killuas perspective, who have their own, more relatable reasons, from a viewers perspective. (Damn, my sentences get way to long with way to many ","...)

Maybe I am getting a bit protective of this show though because I am a bit biased and might only remember the good parts because of how awesome I think the show overall is, and find excuses for the bad parts to make them seem good. I am kind of unsure because I can only make arguments based on what is left in my memory.

It wasn't a fun ride all the way through. I love Kill la Kill but I thought that it really struggled during its middle arc with the conquest of the other schools. Even if it was during this arc that based Takarada was introduced.

> Making you a bit bored can also be the goal of a show for a certain time for a purpose the viewer may or may not know at the time of boredom (I would argue that the second season of Haruhi does this extremely well). It can also work as a part of atmosphere.

I don't think that this was the intent with the Greed Island arc. Digi even said something to the effect of it being a short arc because Togashi realized partway through that it wasn't very strong and that he wanted to move on quickly.

Maybe. The show certainly leaves off on a strong note.

I thought he was talking about the Zoldyck Family arc. He was showing pictures of it at the time in the video.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I just misinterpreted it because I was hearing what I wanted to. I don't really consider the parts about the Zoldyck Family to be its own separate arc.

It is super short, but it's still technically considered its own arc. I think that might be what Digi meant by Togashi deciding to end it and quickly move on.

I don't usually read usernames or only do it accidentally without any reason, unless I have a reason (like know). So I didn't read your username before.

>I don't think that this was the intent with the Greed Island arc.

Dammit. Every time that I ask myself "will people misunderstand what I mean by that?" and I decide that they will probably understand it they get the wrong idea. I ment it more as a general point against your rating system, not to defend the Greed Island arc. I totally agree that the purpose of the arc wasn't anything like that, even if it was supposed to be a bit slower and less grant in multiple senses, it shouldn't make the impression of boredom.

Well guess our opinions just differ, I don't think we will get to any conclusion about it, our priorities are just a bit different in that matter. Was fun though!
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed Greed Island .  For me the weakest arc is the last arc of the anime the Chairman election arc because The Zodiacs is not really interesting for me . but I like we see leorio greatness again .

For me the York New Arc is the pinnacle of Hxh everything there was just near perfect for a shounen series . Chimera ant arc is great but mostly the second part of the chimera arc .

York New for me is my favourite arc in any Shounen series along with CP9 arc of Onepiece
>> ARTICLE
Im gonna say I really did not enjoy the yorknew arc. Karapika just isn't one of my favorite characters. But I honestly didn't find the greed Island arc so bad. The chairman arc felt a little short and out of place didn't really care for the characters but it was necessary in a way. :)
>> ARTICLE
chairman arch feels like is mostly a introduction arc for the next one which feature heavily most of the chairman arch characters... or featured till Togashi went on hiatus again
>> ARTICLE
i stopped the manga where the chairman arc ended :)I did not wanna be left hanging in a whole new arc although its tempting.. im just going to pretend like thats the ending of the series for a whole ten years :p

>> ARTICLE
Yorknew arc is probably what I enjoyed the most. Maybe it's because I like Kurapika more than you do, but it's more because it kind of highlights the Phantom Troupe. I already found them really interesting at the beginning, and as some of them got more fleshed through the arc the group ended up being way more interesting, and were really the one that got me so hyped my sweat ducts were clogging when I was watching the arc.

On the other hand, I didn't like Greed Island that much. I mean, it's good to see the two improve and to meet Bisky, but over all it was a little stale for me (probably because the Phantom Troupe wasn't being hyped lmao). I also thought the antagonist was a second rate Hisoka lol, but he wasn't bad.
>> ARTICLE
The Chairman arc is more of an introduction arc in a way. Yes there's the whole Killua/Nanika plot point but as for the characters introduced, they're more relevant in the coming story. I admit that I didn't feel much for them but after being introduced I've found that they're much more enjoyable in the next arc.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure why you were voted down for an opinion.  This is what makes the show so special; it appeals to just about everyone in different ways. You may like/dislike a character but there's always something enthralling about this series. The Yorknew arc was my favorite event and didn't like the Chimera Ant arc. 

Great art is something that everyone can enjoy for different reasons.

I actually really loved the chairman arc. Maybe because Leorio is my favourite character, but I just felt really strong emotionally during a large part of it.
>> ARTICLE
I loved every arc. Yes, some were much stronger than others, but each arc was incredibly important in my opinion. 

(I kind of go over what I think of each arc, spoilers.)

[The Hunter Exam](/s " was great at introducing Hunters and the other characters, putting them in interesting situations.")


[The next part of the series that focused on Killua](/s "I kind of call it a mini arc. It was good at showing his relationship with his family, as they later become important a number of times.")


[The arena one,](/s " obviously pretty huge because it introduces Nen.")


[Yorknew](/s " was great because it started to show a more mature side to the show and put Gon in harder situations that he had never faced before.")


[Greed Island,](/s " the characters get stronger, okay, but I think it was a great way to really see Gon's personality and his selfishness in how he fights Gensthuru. In fact, it's one of my favorite fights. Gensthuru might be a pretty simple villain but I felt like he was a perfect representation of pure greed, which was the whole point of the arc.")


[Chimera Ant Arc,](/s " my absolute favorite. It's huge, it's beautiful, and it adds a lot of depth to the series. A lot of stuff happens. We see one of the greatest villains and the greatest character development with a side of great animation and voice acting. It also connected a lot of stuff from the previous arcs, like Kurapika's restrictions and Bisky's transformation. It really did a good job of showing the evolution and malice of humanity in the choice to use a bomb to decide everything.")


[Finally, the last arc](/s " was really interesting in seeing how Pariston manipulates things and the adorable and suspenseful relationship Killua has with Alluka. Seriously, it was super cute.")

I have watched both versions of the anime, and I must say I liked the 2011 version the most. Kind of in the same way I liked Brotherhood more than the original FMA, as both originals felt more drawn out as mentioned in the linked video. Some say this creates the setting and character developement, but personally I like shounen to be abit fast-paced whilst still keeping the characters development high tier and stable. And by stable I mean no sudden jumps in character that doesnt make sense.

The fact that he calls this show "Hunter hunter" really bothers me lol. I always thought it was "Hunter x Hunter"

the way he said Killua was even weirder. Said it like the alcoholic drink.

Apparently the x is never pronounced, same as with the episode titles. Because Hunter hunter is what Gon is, where others hunt gourmet ingredients etc, Gon hunts a hunter.

I seriously don't remember anymore lol, that was a long time ago when i started watching anime. I guess i said that because there are animes that i would watch rather than Bebop. It's really great, but not that "holy shit" great. I have to watch it again some day, wish it wasn't episodic.
>> ARTICLE
I see lol I have anime that I would rather watch than Bebop but I still think it's one of the best out there. Different perspective I guess.

[](#whowouldathunkit)
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, while it's a great classic, a classic shouldn't be held to a higher value than newer anime simply because it's a classic. That's called being biased.
>> ARTICLE
But how did Bebop come to be considered a classic? It has an interesting, compelling story with a fantastic ending, unique characters, fantastic animation that still holds up to newer animation and it has one of the best soundtracks in all of anime. All of these contribute to why it's considered a class and are why it should be in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it does have all of that, and that's exactly why I call it a great anime. However, putting it in the top 10 of all anime isn't as cut and dry as that. There are plenty of anime that are as you described, certainly more than 10. A top 10 list simply cannot be anything but subjective. So it's not a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10. The top 10 on MAL is simply a popularity figure, it's not objective at all. It's a rough approximation of an anime's true worth at its best.
>> ARTICLE
That's true and since it's all subjective and this is all based on my opinion, *I* think it's a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I strongly believe it doesn't deserve top 10.

 Bebop is great, but it's episodic, and many people prefer a coherent story over a series of short stories, even if the characters and settings are interesting

Downvotes for not believing a show is top 10? I even think it's good, just not top 10 anime of all time... wtf.
>> ARTICLE
So much this yes. I watched Bebop only 2 days ago after my 3 years of Anime watching only to see that it is damn overrated. Characters were great, sound was amazing, stories were entertaining and execution was top notch. One of the best shows I have watched but it seriously lacked a plot. You can easily make connections with characters but events were so unrelated you never feel the show as a whole to like it so much. Just look at  [Cowboy Bebop](/s "what happened to Julia after all that hype? She just died."). You are exactly right about the show being episodic. Thus there is no room for Bebop at top 10. 

When I see people claim Bebop is one of the best shows I think that people are trying to show off that they pick a classic old show as their favorite to feel somehow superior against the people who like new, popular stuff. It is the same as people hating on SAO for no apparent reason other than it being popular. I didn't watch the second season but first season was definitely a good entertaining normal show. Same hate on Kirito too. Kirito is not some outstanding character to be the favorite character for anyone but he is not that notable as a bad character to become anyone's most hated character either. Just because he is popular, no reason to hate on him to show off your *unique/s* and *mature/s* taste.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry but I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial. It's kind of like saying a SOL show is better than an action/adventure show just because it fits into the SOL genre and a certain group of people like SOL more.

People having a problem with the actual content of an episodic show is one thing but saying it's not great *because* its episodic is completely different.

>> ARTICLE
If you're issue is being invested in the fate of the characters, because at the end of the episode everything reverts back to ~ status quo, and there's no longer arc to get heavily invested in the characters.




>> ARTICLE
This isn't necessarily true.  Certain episodic shows have more development per episode than others.  Not all episodic shows are law and order.
>> ARTICLE
That's a different issue that has to deal with the actual content of the episodes including the characters.

Also, Bebop does have an overarching story that's highlighted in specific episodes that helps you feel connected to the characters. If Bebop was really a completely episodic show with no main plot then the ending wouldn't have hit as hard as it did.
>> ARTICLE
>I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial

If a work from of a medium tailored for storytelling falls short on storytelling, it's a pretty legitimate argument to make.
>> ARTICLE
I agree but that comes down to the actual story being told not simply the format of storytelling.

Never understood the hype. Watched it a few years back because it's supposedly divine and untouchable, but it looked rather bland to me.

It's episodic nature isn't for everyone. I could defend it all day long as my favorite anime but the most recent rewatch thread had really great write ups and does a much better job. If you read some (episode 5 and the last few are probably the better ones) you may find some appreciation for it.

2015: 5  

The median year is 2009, and 74% are from 2006 or later.  The most recent year without at least one entry is 1994.

To be fair, 2006 might have been one of the greatest anime year of all time.

Yeah this really shows off myanimelist's recency bias which I honestly think is not as bad as this sub's.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've rated some of the old shows I've watched quite highly, but if they came out today I'd have rated them lower.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe newer shows are better
>> ARTICLE
Irionically I feel that after signing up to MAL back around August 2015, I've rated some of my favorite shows of the past with rose-colored glasses.  Like, I'm pretty sure if I rewatched R.O.D. OVA now, it would no longer be 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I go back maybe once a year and re-rate things to more match what Im feeling over the long term.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously look at the numbers for 2011-2014 3/4 years have 9 entries and 2013 must've been a pretty barren year to only get 5. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, Japan produces ~5x as many shows a year these days, so you might want to take that into account.
>> ARTICLE
Also the fact that (just like movies, books, music 
, etc.) people and generations change - thier interests and perceptions shift, tropes go in and out of fashion. It's fine not to like something classic because it was made by different folks for different folks. Things that transcend that are very rare. Worst case scenario - this shows that the average MAL user is around 20. Maybe even not because there are less older users but because in the past decade or so, popularity of manga/anime in the west has exploded.

More often than not, we just have something very dear to us and we can't accept that stuff we don't like surpass it in quality and popularity. Because we want to think that if something is good, we will like it and by extension - if we like something, it must be good. Thus - recency bias explains that away really well for us.
>> ARTICLE
Also animation quality is going up. I don't really care if you think the older style is more appealing; recent shows have been pushing limits with [backgrounds](http://i.imgur.com/aqnN7Zp.gifv), [foregrounds, and effects](http://i.imgur.com/i5pRxBN.gifv).

The only show that really feels like the old cell animation fits better than digital imo is Trigun. I love the graininess, but new animation is definitely higher quality.
>> ARTICLE
I think there is something missing for very specific types of show, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and especially the absolutely gorgeous Ghost in the Shell movie all benefited from either the grittiness and colouring/shading styles of older animation.

I feel its a similar way to how Noir films benefit from being black and white.

[Have you wanted to watch one of the top 10 shows on MAL, only to realize about half of it is Gintama? Have you ever been annoyed how the top has always been cluttered with second seasons or shows split up into around 5 different entries?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ALwKeSEYs)

Did you combine FMA and FMA:B? Or is it just legitimately not in the top 100? I'm not sure which option is worse.
>> ARTICLE
The original is not in the top 100.
>> ARTICLE
That's a shame, the original gets so much flack even though it has better early character development, a better OST, and the better movie. I also like how [](/s "it takes more than 10 people to make a philosopher stone")
>> ARTICLE
There was always certain things that bugged me about the original. I wasn't a fan of how the homunculi were handled, I liked the idea of the villain in the original but I thought Brotherhood's was more interesting, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I love father way more than Dante, but at least there was consequences in the original. Everything seems to convenient in brotherhoods end game. There is also the fact that everyone just kinda watched as greed died. Everyone holds brotherhood way higher than the original when in reality they are pretty balanced in their strengthens and faults, but if you have watched the 2003 previously brotherhood becomes a lot better. Where as the opposite is not true. 
>> ARTICLE
I imagine watching Brotherhood first is a bit like watching DBZ and then going to the older original Dragonball when it wasn't all about the fights.
>> ARTICLE
This is better. Evangelion not being in the top 200 was giving me serious buttpain. Also glad to see Disappearance closer to the #1 position it once upon a time righteously held.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually disgusted by the fact that everyone keeps mentioning evangelion like it's the greatest masterpiece ever and then I look at it's myanimelist rating and I think it is where it should be, similiar about the mentions of madoka magica.

And then there is Hajime no Ippo, a show that is so damn good, yet people won't try it cause there is some "pact" that people don't want to watch sports anime, and only mention of it is when someone asks other good sports anime in a haikyuu!! (great anime though) thread, and it gets mentioned afterwards fucking baby steps...

smh.
>> ARTICLE
Well, NGE is one of the (very, very) few anime i would consider a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Le 8.3 average rating, what a masterpiece.

Just wondering, why did you rate Death Note a 10 if you dropped it?
>> ARTICLE
Death note to me is Light vs L. That's where the anime ends.
>> ARTICLE
[But](/s "didn't L die in episode 25, not 18?")
>> ARTICLE
L vs Light, not L *with* Light
>> ARTICLE
NGE is either the most impactful anime on art in general or the third msot impactful ever. I mean, we're talking about *an anime* which influenced the *Western film industry* more than a lot of actual Western film masterpieces ffs. NGE is like 100x more important to science fiction than GITS is for any **real** sci-fi fan and sci-fi is a lot bigger than just anime! You seriously have to be like 15 if you don't understand how big of a fucking deal NGE is, when in just anime alone it popularized (didn't originate, necessarily) huge swathes of standard tropes and is at most the second most impactful show for the industry (after the original astroboy ofc).

EDIT: You're like someone who is insulting the position of Diablo 2 as possibly the most influential video game that will ever be produced after, like, the early 80's.
>> ARTICLE
That is of course one way of looking at it. Again, it is a good anime - masterpiece? I don't think so.

By that, I'll put Dragonball and Z as a masterpiece, even though it had it's flaws. I even rate DBZ higher than evangelion  as an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not a masterpiece. If you really can't recognize that it was a masterpiece and one of the most impactful works of anime or science fiction of the 90's, [you've got a serious disease for which there is no cure.](http://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarCHcNNbZRIpsyY/giphy.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Are you serious? How can you say it is even a masterpiece by todays standards when it is rated low compared to other anime... the point stands that its only 8.3 and maybe higher/lower in other forums. I agree with that rating. That rating shouldn't be called a fucking masterpiece.

What does it matter that it was influential in anime. Do you think Survivor (still a great show) is also a masterpiece cause it greatly influenced reality tv shows? 
>> ARTICLE
Um, It's got a low rating because it's actual art and a lot of people can't handle the concept of anime as art, not because it deserves such a shitty low rating. Just take your shit opinions and go troll somewhere else, mate.
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding me? How is my opinion troll? You are the one being ignorant here that you can't understand that people just don't think it's that amazing.what does actual art even mean? Are you some kind of snob who thinks their opinion is better than others?

Well, nothing else to say than I am sorry that you have grown up to have such a big ego.

It is not a masterpiece in my eyes, and according to ratings and comments, a lot of people have the same opinion, so fuck off.

So apparently some* people think OPM is bad now. 

http://i.imgur.com/ZAfVGax.gifv

Edit: No this is not about the people who think it isn't top 10. There's a lot of anime out there so odds are there are 10 other shows you enjoyed more.

I've just noticed a lot of people who are disgusted by OPM even being on the list. Even if you don't enjoy the action or comedy, it's confusing that people can think it's not objectively a well made anime, even with all the praise it has earned.
>> ARTICLE
We're not saying it's bad it's just not top 7. I think top 15-25.

OPM isn't even my favorite from this year.
>> ARTICLE
There's a difference between bad and not top 10 material.
>> ARTICLE
I think it deserves top 10, there's a reason why it's so well loved and famous.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. You're absolutely correct in that there's a reason it's well loved and famous. It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

/u/icedino said (implied, rather) that OPM isn't top ten material. To be fair, that's his own opinion and he's entitled to it, just as you're entitled to your own. More people than not found it to be top ten material, so by definition it's top ten material, assuming it holds its place in the coming months. It's just not necessarily in EVERYONE'S top ten.
>> ARTICLE
> It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

Also hype. Let's not kid ourselves, there are so many anime series that can be considered better but simply don''t have the amount of mainstream hype OPM does. Hell even in the top 100. Do you think the average mainstream anime fan has heard of LogH or Cross Game? They're still in the top 100 for a good reason. The reason why CG or LoGH don't have a huge anti-movement is *because* it hardly ever gets talked about (respective to huge hypes like SAO/AOT/OPM that is).
>> ARTICLE
I think it's too soon to say whether or not OPM is top 10 *of all time* material. A few seasons from now we'll be able to tell whether it's high rating is because of it's recent hype or because everyone truly believes that it's the 7th best anime of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
It's lost like .05 points over the past two weeks.

Dropped from 10 to 11, giving the first season of gintana its spot back.

Yeah but there's also a reason why the current top 10 were loved. Besides, they're always be people who just like to shit on anything main stream. It's really good but still over hyped.
>> ARTICLE
> There's a difference between bad and not top 10 material.

Who gets to decide what's top 10 material though? Wouldn't it be the collection of MAL user scores rather than just a couple of people who don't think it's top 10 material?

It's just my opinion that the show doesn't deserve as much praise as it is given and definitely not to be the seventh best anime of all time. Would still put it in my top 40 or something.  
But hey, your opinion is different - that's fine too.

I don't think it should be seventh either but I'm not surprised about it. People like it because it's funny and easy to get into and they're gonna give it 10s and 9s. Nothing to be surprised about.

Recency bias coupled with the fact that it went mainstream is correlated with this, makes complete sense.

I know you're most likely using the term "recency bias" to fuck with me again, but that doesn't apply here *at all.* 

People aren't choosing between two different anime, you're just scoring them separately. You don't have to choose between Cowboy Bebop or Hunter x Hunter for 10/10's, it's not a contest like that. And it's not as if people are saying "Oh wow, this anime just came out in 2015! That makes it automatically better than this 2001 anime." nor is it the case that because recent anime are going to tend to be more popular (OPM is at #91 in popularity anyways) that they'll automatically rank in the top 100 as Ashita no Joe, Ping Pong, and LoGH have proven.

I wonder if OPM didn't get that much hype that it could take a higher spot. I mean before the anime was announced the One Punch Man community was at least average in number but still a little unknown. /r/OnePunchMan didn't even have their own subreddit style and I'm happy just to see a reference out of nowherein reddit. It was one manga that if you read before the adaptation, you couldn't imagine to be animated just because of the art(of the manga).
>> ARTICLE
If they animated it in ONE's style it could have become another Ping Pong :)
>> ARTICLE
Very likely.  People would have regarded it as an underrated gem with the quality of its animation.  Personally, the show was extremely entertaining and interesting from start to finish and I think it deserves all the praise it gets.  It's definitely not a perfect show, but that's not really saying much when talking subjectively.  In another time and place, the detractors of the show could have been its defenders.

The Kyoukai no Kanata entry confused me at first because I knew the series was a lot lower, and it's seem like the few fans that liked the series are the ones who voted high on the film...But with the exception of that (can't find another in a similar case), it seems like a good job with the listing. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for others, but the film is probably higher because it provided a satisfying ending, which the original series was seriously lacking.
>> ARTICLE
When you say you combined series, do you mean you averaged the scores or did you just take the highest ranked entry in the series? It looks like you did the latter, but that can be pretty misleading since later entries in series almost always receive higher scores due to people who disliked the original not bothering to continue.
>> ARTICLE
The list is intended to be relatively useful, not an absolute ranking.  It helps to remove half the list because of duplicates / semi-duplicates.  I know whenever I looked at MAL for "top x" in order to check out stuff I may watch, I've always been super annoyed that I have to scroll down pages to avoid Gintama repeats, etc.
>> ARTICLE
True, but I think there can be problems with either approach: there are franchises where the first one or more installments are well-received and then things go downhill. Kind of damned if you do and damned if you don't...
>> ARTICLE
I did the latter. I'll probably make another one that averages as well in a week or two. There is a problem with both options though. Due to the rating that MAL ratings work, long running shows like Hunter x Hunter or One Piece only have the ratings of people who have seen most of the show are counted. I'll probably be making more of this with different methods to try and get a more general idea in the future.

So far I'm thinking of making top 100 lists that:

1. Average everything
2. Only includes the initial/first aired season
3. Only includes the most recent season

>> ARTICLE
Oh, I didn't know that long runners only counted ratings from people who've watched most of the show. No wonder so many of them end so on high on MAL. That'd complicate this kind of ranking even more.
>> ARTICLE
1/100

Do I have bad taste? No.. No. It's everyone else who's wrong.

If I ~~have enough time~~ stop being lazy I could make one which takes the averages of each entry and its sequels/whatevers.

Wow, is FMA:B really that good? Why have I delayed watching it for so long???

What I really enjoyed, is that it's a longer show that really pays off in the end (character development etc...). And its a pretty wild journey (I knew nothing going into the show).
>> ARTICLE
All anime is subjective just like movies and any other medium.  Honestly, I found it to be good, but not amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was a gateway anime for many, so that could be a factor. To me it just seemed like an above-average shounen battle show, but I don't generally enjoy that genre so I didn't care for it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely wasn't a gateway series for me, but I'm a huge fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I felt FMA:B to be equally good, or better. I wouldn't call it a battle shounen, but I would call it a family adventure show. Pretty much just Avatar.

I don't know if it's harder to accept mediocre shows being so highly rated or great shows barely making the list.

from the top 100 any romance/harem  in there?

Ouran High School Host Club is the only harem anime in there.

Romance has a lot. Clannad:After Story, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Ruroni Kenshin, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, the Monogatari Series, Bakuman, Howl's Moving Castle, Kara no Kyoukai, Hotarubi no Mori e, The Tatami Galxy, Major, Nana, Cross Game, Nodame Cantabile, Romeo no Aoi Sora, Sakamachi no Apollon, The Girl who Leapt through Time, Toradora, Spice and Wolf, Tsubasa, Ouran High School Host Club, Sakurasou, Rose of Versailles, Welcome to the NHK, and Honey and Clover.
>> ARTICLE
thanks for that, ,gonna check them 
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is also a harem, even if mal doesnt say so (at least by defenition).
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari and Clannad (first season) are technically harem anime, they just aren't labelled as such by MAL for whatever reason.
>> ARTICLE
You missed Kyoukai no Kanata in your list - very strong romance subplot in that one, overwhelming the action/youmu stuff really.

>  Ruroni Kenshin

Is that really considered a "Romance"?  I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a *small* subplot IIRC.  Though I only watched through the Shishio arc so dunno if it gets more emphasis later on, but from what I recall the romance aspect wasn't much stronger than Naruto's.

Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance, but I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series since they are 1000% different in just about everything.
>> ARTICLE
> Is that really considered a "Romance"? I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a small subplot IIRC.

Nope it is not, RK cannot be considered a romance anime. It might involve romance in it (which it doesn't really btw but that's another topic) but RK is not a "romance anime" as the focus is completely different.

> Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance
It had more but even then it is still minimal considering the story in general. The things it focuses on is much more different. 

> I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series

OP made some huge mistakes in the list. Some shows still have more than one entry with different adaptations and movies like Fate/s Evangelion but made some omitting with others. I understand that he merged 3 seasons of the Gintama and Benizakura movie was a recap but why add Final Chapter as well. RK suffers from this the most because the movies and the original series are too far away from each other many people wouldn't believe they are the parts of the same series. '96 TV series of Rurouni Kenshin and Star Wars are more similar to each other than   original series and Trust&Betrayal OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
Mind you, Ouran is a reverse harem. A great one, and really funny, but the MC is still a girl, which will probably put some people off.

Ouran is like one of the best comedy anime I've ever seen. it's very good to pass the time and be relaxed while laughing your ass off

In case anyone is reading this, hasn't seen it, and thinks they might be put off by the reverse harem bit: try it anyway. Please. It's a good fucking show.

Well, I greatly enjoyed both the manga and anime, like I said it's great, but some people will(sadly) be put off by the fact that it's a reverse harem, even though it's nothing like say Diabolik lovers or Dance with Devils. I can recommend it to everyone.

Great effort, thanks!

What's interesting about a consolidated lost like this is that the upward push of Eva 2.22 (which was highly received by fans) carried all the Rebuilds 47 spots ahead of the original series.

Obviously the original show is > than the Rebuilds but it's interesting to see how a superior movie/episode in a set of OVAs can influence the whole.

Anyway--great job on the list, OP this helps me know more of a real top 100 I can pick and watch from!
>> ARTICLE
Well that's because the OP just congregates EVERY spinoff and sequels and prequels while compiling the list. He did NOT average scores. As someone else said, franchises with multiple seasons that people would have dropped cause they didn't like the first ones are bound NOT TO watch and berate the latter ones. That's how you get Aria who's only got one really high rated season (Origination) while the rest were 8/10 or lower. That makes this list a bit misleading.

>> ARTICLE
Well, there are so many more shows I like outside of top100 than within it. Polarizing shows are not neccessarily bad, but get mediocre scoring by definition. Long-running shows also have a higher scores because only fans stick to watching it. And just as newer shows start off with high ratings, that decay over time, really old shows are rated higher than they are worth because of nostalgia. I would most definitely rate DBZ higher than if I would watch it now for the first time. I think most people don't really take the top100 seriously.
>> ARTICLE
34/100. It's sad to look at this and realize some amazing anime aren't on the list while some really bad ones are. A good example would be that Haibane Renmei is not on the list while it's much inferior rip-off, Angel Beats is...

It also lacks Berserk, the original FMA, GiTS movie, Princess Tutu...

in the end it just comes down to taste :/

Well, the manga is SUPER popular. Haven't found the time to watch the anime yet, but the story is really good if you enjoy HxH, One Piece and shounens like that.
>> ARTICLE
I was the same but I started watching again and finished it all in one go pretty much, it does get better but I am still disappointed i nsome stuff.
>> ARTICLE
The anime is basically a generic action shounen, but it is *very good* for an action shounen, comparatively.  The pacing, action, characters are all fairly tight.  I'd rate it among the top 5 generic action shounen quite easily.

I've always preferred lists to be this way. It makes more sense to judge/give marks to a product as a whole, not season 1 and season 2 etc. - that's what reviews are for.

I've only seen one anime in the Top 5, and only about 27 of these completely all the way through. I'm officially no longer a fan of anime.

See you guys.

I watched 22/100 shows
I think it's not bad cause I don't consider myself as huge anime fan.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for doing this.  Do you have any plans to keep this updated in the future?
>> ARTICLE
Yes I do. I'll post an updated one either once a year or at the end of each season. It's easier to edit one the original list is made.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I've seen 43 of these shows. How many shows on the list have u guys seen?
>> ARTICLE
34/100. I dropped about an additional 5 shows from this list on top of that though.
A lot of these titles feel very over inflated with their list placement due to sheer popularity. Your Lie in April seems like the most overrated anime of the past few years to me; it wasn't bad though. I'm happy OPM is pretty high on the list. I don't know if it deserves top 10 but it's definitely had an impact on the anime medium. Probably for the better.

Nice it has a lot of my favorites on here. FMA, Steins Gate, Space Brothers, Welcome to the NHK, Haikyuu, Sakamichi no Appollon, Beck. Only one missing from my top 10 is Baby Steps. 
>> ARTICLE
Good to see Aria rise up to 31, although I'd like to see it in the top 10 :P 
>> ARTICLE
Why can't we do that? I mean when I want to put a series in my PTW, it would be cool to like put the whole series in it, not just the first season, everything, OVAs, films, extra episodes everything, together with an watch order if possible. It would be a whole lot simplier to sort through my list of 4 different fate seasons/films/OVAs or whatever, not to mention you don't miss an OVA or film when you were looking for an series to watch because you didn't see the others adaptions/sequels tab in the info page.

25. Not bad. :3

I think this will need a redo once current season hype dies down. Noragami, Shokugeki no Souma and OPM have inflated scores, and will take a couple months to settle.
>> ARTICLE
for the curious, check out legend of the galactic heroes. it's a very good scifi anime. it's dialogue heavy with a lot of political intrigue, but there's enough action to satisfy. if i were to compare it to a live action show, i'd say it's like a grittier battlestar galactica.

Only 8 of these have I seen at least an episode of..

28/100, though to be fair, about a third of the list doesn't deserve to be there.

WOOT, Detective Conan!!!
>> ARTICLE
"6- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (1988)"

Any advice about this anime? is it worth? is it better than newer shows? or maybe its just more nostalgic points.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very talky space opera. It's by no means perfect: the animation is often quite limited and sometimes error prone (both problems are most common near the show's beginning), for example, and the animation and direction don't always convey the scale and details of the battles that well. And leaving aside actual problems, it's not something which everyone would enjoy watching. As I said, it's talkative, plus it's very sincere and not terribly interested in being hard science fiction.

That said... if you do have any appreciation at all for space operas, or dialogue-driven political/military stories, it's worth a shot because it is very satisfying to watch. It's unique in anime for the size of its cast and kind of unique for the ambition of its storythere are longer anime, but there aren't many which can do 110 episodes of continuous epic narrative with no filler. It's pleasingly capacious in its ideas: it doesn't necessarily get very incisive about any one ideology or behaviour but it includes so many ideas and arguments and incidents. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is certainly 'better than newer shows' in the sense that nothing since has done, or has even really been able to attempt to do, the kinds of things that it does.

So I'd say it's worth giving it a try if it interests you, though you shouldn't feel obliged to watch it and if you do try it and dislike it that's fine.

> nostalgic points

This is unlikely, because the show was only made widely available with an English translation in the mid to late 2000s. I'd bet that a substantial majority of the people on MAL who've seen it saw it within the last decade. From my memory it was almost unknown among English-speaking fans until 2007 or 2008, when it gradually took off.

There is a clear(and unsurprising to me) recency bias. It also seems several genres are more in the list than others, i.e. shonen, romance, supernatural and action, whereas harem seems underpresented(Monogatari and Ouran?). Theres also a distinct lack of cute girls doing cute things - anime

Great work OP

Demographic bias.

fucking Katekyo Hitman Reborn? seriously? jesus people, i don't really like some of this show but i get why they're so popular, but reborn? that's just wrong, it had a good premise and the first couple arc were good, but after that it became just complete trash, its one of the most generic, repetitive, stereotyped, poorly written shonen i've ever seen

i just don't get it


>> ARTICLE
Well you obviously won't agree but what I loved about it was that it was just a fun show. The characters were fun, the action was fun, the plot was fun, etc. Characters like Gokudera, Lambo, Hibari, Squalo...they really did do a great job of making them feel like a family. I started to love the characters so much that I didn't even mind the "daily life" episodes and began to miss them a bit

Plus it was amazingly creative. Small touches like the ten-year bazooka added so much flavor to the show for me. Not to mention the abilities that each character had and some of the really spectacular fight scenes (Yamamoto vs Squalo, Gokudera vs Gamma, Hibari vs Genkishi, Tsuna vs Xanxus, etc)

I won't deny that the show has more than its fair share of problems (sexism, Tsuna constantly realizing his resolve comes from protecting his friends, filler arcs) but it is pretty special to me 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm ... KHR was pretty generic as a shounen but it went beyond generic a bit with the expansion of its scope through the middle of the series.  So, I felt it "ramped up" then stayed in good, high gear all the way until the very end where they rushed the last few episodes pretty hard.

At the end of the day it still remains a "shounen+" to me, so nothing super outstanding, but I rate is as definitely a step above average and "100"th place isn't really overrating it, IMO.

Watch 43/100

Only completed 25/100

6/100 dropped because of too much episode (and already read manga) (FMA, Gintama, One Piece, Chihayafuru, Monster, Hunter X Hunter)

12/100 Dropped because no enjoyment and bored when watching, some of it I just skipped to read the ending (Steins Gate, Shigatsu, Ping pong, Jojo, Kuroko, Noragami, Fate UBM, Shirobako, Toradora, Katanagatari, Bakuman, Psycho Pass)
>> ARTICLE
I can understand dropping shows when they're too long or you've already watched the manga... But just skipping to the end of shows is strange. 
>> ARTICLE
Because people says its has good story, but I'm not enjoy while watching it, so I ended up reading how it was ended to see what happen in the plot.. You didn't waste time on something you didn't enjoy right? :D
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the show is great and it's filled with magic. My only complaint would be the character designs, they all look the same every episode except for Ginko. Though I suppose it's not a huge deal given it's episodic.

Still one of my favorite anime
>> ARTICLE
Still have a bunch of episodes left but this will probably be my first 10. 
>> ARTICLE
Savour them like fine wine.
>> ARTICLE
That is exactly what I'm doing.
>> ARTICLE
That's one of my most obvious full scorers too. The prime counterpoint to anyone claiming episodic is a bad thing. It sets out with this simple premise you probably could describe pretty well in just one or two sentences and just keeps delivering complete magic, episode after episode.
>> ARTICLE
It's not really the fact that it was episodic that sort of ruined it for me, but that each episode was so similar. Go to place > find problem > explain how it's mushi causing problem > get rid of mushi. Rinse and repeat. I just got tired of it after around 15 episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
As I got further into the episodes I kept expecting the quality to drop a bit. But nope. It was consistently magical, episode after episode.  Not many anime can actually pull that off.
>> ARTICLE
Aria: The Origination. It built off the last two seasons perfectly and the ending destroyed me.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka Magica is my all time favorite and nothing has ever come close.

The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is just. Well. Go watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu!!
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu!! is one of the only shows where I actually get hyphy in my chair and pump my fists while I watch, I even get up and pace around my room sometimes because of how hype it is. Not many other shows have done this for me (can't really name any off the top of my head that is).
>> ARTICLE
Same here! 
>> ARTICLE
I really didn't want to give it a 10 because the plot is literally just high school volleyball team wants to go to nationals. But it's just so enjoyable and every character is so lovable and so much hype. I literally watch the new episode the rewatch it right after. I haven't cared about any characters in anime as much as I do the ones in Haikyuu, including the opposing teams. Usually a week or so after a show finishes airing, if I forget about it then I might knock its rating down a bit. Haikyuu is the only show that weeks after I finished watching I realized a 9 doesn't do it justice
>> ARTICLE
You really gave Haikyuu a 10? That's some seriously [](/s "excellent") taste you got there.

You have to admit, for a sports anime that it was ridiculously well done and not over the top, I gave haikyuu a 10 and baby steps a 10 as well

Ping Pong was the only show that i thought was definitely a 10 from the first moment i thought to rate it.

SSY and Tatami Galaxy became 10's because of their fantastic 3rd acts for me, but they were wavering between 8-9 up to that point.

Yeah this and HxH are my favorite by a long shot.

I think I like your taste of anime, it seems similar to mine, even though I didnt watch as much :)

If it holds up until the end of the season, probably Boku Dake ga Inai Machi. There's just something about it that draws you in.

Out of finished shows, probably Shirobako and Hanasaku Iroha.

Definitely Shirobako, I didn't hesitate at all to give it a 10.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck yes Hanasaku Iroha is amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't finished it yet, but assuming Legend of the Galactic Heroes doesn't murder my firstborn it'll be the easiest 10 that makes every other 10 I gave out pale by comparison.

^(If it *does* murder my firstborn it'll probably still get a 10 because it will likely go to great lengths to show why it would feel justified in doing such a thing.)

How far are you? Because there are points where it *feels* like it murders your firstborn.

Around episode 30, so not too far in but far enough to know that certain things have gone poorly.

Seconded... By the time episode 23 rolled around, It was a surefire 10, no questions asked.

Probably the only premature score I've ever chosen.
>> ARTICLE
Can you help me out with Shirobako? I've watched the first 4-5 episodes, and while I enjoy it, nothing about it is compelling. Nothing propels me to watch the next episode. Is there a point where it becomes impossible to stop watching?
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the first episodes are slow so that you can familiarize yourself with the large cast. Nevertheless, the show starts going soon enough.
>> ARTICLE
If the show didn't suck you in completely, then it's probably not the kind of show you would rate 10/10. But since you still seem to enjoy it, I suggest you keep going, it is the kind of show that improves incrementally. Even a 9/10 score isn't too big a blasphemy.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, wouldn't be the first show that I appreciated much more after seeing the entire series. It's hard to appreciate many series from the get go until you have a better handle on the characters. The Wire for me is one of those shows. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, well in that case, definitely keep watching. It's absolutely the kind of show where the characters grow on you. Not even characters you'd expect. You'd think, it's all about the MC and her friends, when suddenly, *BAM!* you are now invested in Random Animator Girl #2. Or Aoi's awesome production assistant senpai. Or Mr. Old Guy. Even Taro has his moments.

Of course, the main characters get much more exposure and Aoi is undisputed best girl ^^spreadtheword, but every show that gets even bit of screen time will have you feeling strongly about them. One way or another. ^Funny^story
>> ARTICLE
Shirobako is a show I gave an easy 10 to, and thinking back on it now, I can tell you that when it finally locked that 10 score was episode 23.  It had one of the most cathartic moments in anime for me.  So it definitely shone brightly in the home stretch.

Thinking back on it though, I do think it had to grow on me a bit.  At first it didn't seem all that special, but as the show goes on and you see the characters all grow and deal with workplace issues we all experience (if you are a working adult, it is a *lot* more relatable) you start to get more attached to them.  I know one of my other favourite moments was in [episode 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55C0Dc6k7Ts).  There isn't necessarily *one* moment that pulls you in, so don't expect that.  It's more about the journey and seeing all the highs and lows and going along for the ride.  By the end it feels like you're leaving dear friends.

It is definitely a bit of a slow burn, but imo worth it by the end, evidenced by the fact that it is one of only 3 shows I've ever given a 10/10 to.
>> ARTICLE
It sneaks up on you.  There's nothing that grabs you by the throat; you just slowly get emotionally invested.  By the end well, you'll see.
>> ARTICLE
I also found it hard to watch, until you get used to the characters and small drama start kicks in. You will care for them a lot.
>> ARTICLE
it's not supposed to be compelling. It's amazing because you just drink in how great each episode is. All of the plot elements are really immaterial. The show just makes you *feel good*
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly what compelling is, hah.
>> ARTICLE
I always took "compelling" to mean raring to get to the next episode. Which I never got from this show. I only really watched it whenever I needed a pick-me-up. There'd be days and even weeks in between every episode I watched, partly because I'd just feel so peaceful after each one that I never felt like I wanted to watch more.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the entire thing and it really doesn't change too much.  I'd say if you weren't that into the first 4-5 episodes then the rest will be no different.  I think it really depends on how much you can relate to the MC.  I happened to be watching it right when I was starting my first job out of college and got pretty sucked into it.  
>> ARTICLE
If you aren't hooked by Shirobako, there's nothing you can do about it. That's just how it is. It's a Slice of Life in a work environment. Unlike sitcoms with a similar setting, there isn't satirical or parody elements (or not that much of them) to make it funny enough to make you want to watch it just for the laughs. 

It's closer to a documentary than anything else, so you need to just let it do its thing and watch the anime at your own pace. When you have some free time, just watch an episode. Maybe there will come a moment something will click and it'll make you want to marathon the rest. Maybe nothing like that will happen. 

It's really just a 26 episodes love letter to the anime industry in a documentary-like manner with moe characters and funny gags references IRL actors of the industry. If you don't care about that, it's either not for you (unfortunately) or you just to really take your time and enjoy it for what it is : yet another SoL anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I think that's somewhat dismissive. As I said, I'm 4-5 episodes in. It's taken me longer to truly get into a series. My only question was if the show has a specific point where it becomes very interesting, or is instead gradual.

There are plenty of anime that have taken me equally as long, or longer to get into that I've loved after watching. I don't think I justified watching Madoka Magicka until episode 10. It's just the way I operate.
>> ARTICLE
>dismissive

Definitely not the intent there. It's just that I don't want you to waste your time trying to like and watching something you might not really like (and I don't want Shirobako to be disliked either!)

As I said, due to the nature of Shirobako, if you don't really like it after even just 4 or 5 episodes, it's either not for you or you just have to slow down a bit (if you're trying to watch it at a high pace)/watch it when you want to (even though you said there's nothing really compelling you to watch the next episode, yes). 

Shirobako doesn't really rely on any massive twist or anything to turn itself on its head and change the meaning of everything else you've seen before like Madoka Magika. As such, you could say it's more of a gradual thing. However, it's not a Steins;Gate kind of gradual where everything builds up on everything to end up in a grandiose finale. It's just people at work and what truly matters in Shirobako is its characters. If you don't care about them, it's good at best, mediocre at worst. Fortunately enough, the characters are all likable and lively (heavy bias) so it shouldn't be too hard. 

In the end, if you don't mind watching an anime for the journey, stick with Shirobako, and you'll be rewarded more than enough. If you feel like you will need a little humph at some point to keep your interest in Shirobako alive, there's not much to do and you will just have to not force yourself to watch something you don't really enjoy anymore.  

Edit : grammar
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I feel you, and I appreciate the time you've taken to explain your perspective. It just takes me a lot of effort to get invested in anything, which can be quite annoying. The way you explain it, it reminds me of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. Nothing about that show is particularly gripping, but I look forward to each episode. Very character driven, but really doesn't pick up until you really fall in love with the characters.
>> ARTICLE
>It just takes me a lot of effort to get invested in anything

Well, you can sometimes dodge bullets, but yeah, I guess it does get annoying sometimes, haha. 

>The way you explain it, it reminds me of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar.

Hehehe, yeah, I guess. Though Grimgar does have nice insert songs and nice visuals and some action scenes to balance things a bit, hahaha. But yeah, the idea is here : fall in love with the characters and this means you'll most probably fall in love with the show as well. Bonus point if you can relate to a character's struggle. 
>> ARTICLE
For me, it was right around episode 6 and 7 and then 11/12. The stuff around those points really brought it from "somewhat usual slice-of-life stuff" to "I **care** about these people and I don't know why!".

By the time I finished episode 24, I felt like I went on a journey and all the highs and lows it had- it was every bit as amazing.

Not less than one week later, I went on a rewatch and did not get bored once.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I expected it was one of those anime that seems a lot better early on with hindsight, similar to Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
This is the main theme of slice of life anime, though.

It's entirely possible this is not your type of show.
>> ARTICLE
I never said I dislike this type of anime. Just that, Shirobako seems to be off to a bit of a slow start. I was just checking to see if there is a moment that might reel me in, as it's hard to take interest in an anime such as this until there you have adoration for the set of characters. So far Shirobako hasn't shown me a conflict that necessarily has me interested.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I'm talking about though. You seem to yearn for drama, and that's not exactly a staple of slice of life.

Shirobako, in particular, is special. The cast is very well-rounded and definitely grows on you the more you watch. There will be some action and drama later on so you can always look forward to that.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's a very important part of story telling, to invest the viewer in the conflict presented to the characters. Almost all slice of life has a conflict of some sort that intends to reel the viewer in from the beginning. Not that I'm saying Shirobako is deficient in this department. More so, so far, I have yet to get reeled in, and asked if there was a specific point where most viewers do get pulled in. If you're familiar with Steins;Gate, I specifically mentioned it because it is also a series that has a very slow start, up until a certain episode (episode 9) where things begin to pick up, and the conflict seems to matter much more for the viewer and the characters they spectate.

I am sure this will eventually happen with Shirobako as well. My original post was to gauge whether there was a tangible point this occurs. I will be watching it anyway, I had no intention of stopping.

>> ARTICLE
Well then, have fun! I hope you find it as enjoyable as I did.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm definitely excited, as I tend to get really into character driven shows. I am considering making it something I watch weekly, as it seems nice in small doses. Gives a sense of longevity with the characters.
>> ARTICLE
I finished the whole thing, and tbh most episodes are pretty similar, there isn't really a point you get completely sucked in and have to marathon. At least for me.

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Is it the easy, "casual" pick? Sure. But that doesn't take away from the fact that I think it's one of the best overarching storytelling I've ever read/watched, and the way that it was able to so brilliantly handle such a large cast of characters and long-running plot without any mishaps (while still bringing back plot points from the first few episodes in the finale!) was just so... well, perfect.   
  
After that, I'd say Cardcaptor Sakura and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, too, especially for their influence on the medium as a whole.

It's the most emotional I've felt watching something. This show really broke me.

Yeah I watched it right after I watched Shigatsu so I was feelin everything man. Was super effective

I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it was Kishi Yusuke's idea.

End of Evangelion, I understood shit when I saw it but I was pretty confident what I saw was a masterpiece.

I loved EofE, but I preferred the original ending. If only the original series had the fight scenes and whatnot of EofE, but the ending of the original series.

For the longest time this was my only 10 on mal because it's just perfect. Recently I got a little more light hearted with the ratings tho.

This is my answer and once the credits rolled I couldn't imagine how someone can hate this movie at all. It's the perfect capstone to NGE and a masterpiece in it's own right.

I wasn't a fan just because NGE wasn't my thing in general. Like, I can see why people love it so much, I just wasn't very inpressed.

Steins gate
>> ARTICLE
I rate most shows based on impact and how long I keep thinking about them. Steins;Gate was an easy 10. I stayed up until like 3 am on a school night finishing it and couldn't stop thinking about it for days until I finally wound up playing through the entire visual novel. Only a masterpiece would make me do something like that.

That show has a vibe that I've never gotten before. No show felt like a more tangible journey to me like Katana did. Great anime.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka Magica was just completely spectacular from start to finish and around the halfway point I had no doubt that it would be a 10/10. Haven't gotten around to watching the movie yet and from what I hear it's just as good.

Code Geass R1 and R2 were an absolute thrill ride the first time I saw them and the finale made the 10/10 score even more certain. After rewatching it though I realized just how bad season 2 was in comparison to season 1 and dropped it down to a 9. R1 is still perfect to me though.
>> ARTICLE
I basically chose to keep them both 10's because that was my original experience watching them for a while.  May go back to that, when in the middle of watching R2 you eventually notice the power creep but Lelouch's character keeps you hooked that i didn't care as much.

30 episodes in, so many well-detailed characters and a whole bunch of great story arcs. If I rated show before I finished them, this one would be sitting at a 10.

The only complaint I have is that characters that are clearly villains are very generic ones. The rest, where the line is blurred... I love them. Even [LOGH](/s "Oberstein"). I'm just curious where the plot will go with this Terra thing, it seems like something that could be fucked up badly very easily.

* Monogatari Series: Second Season

* Carnival Phantasm

Watching Monogatari, thought it was pretty good, it was hilarious at times as well, considering giving it a 9.

Nadeko Medusa and Hitagi End, though. Holy fuck. 10 without question. ^^^^^^Kaiki ^^^^^^bestgrill

I only give a 10 if I don't hesitate and if at any time in the next week or so I question my decision then it moves down to a 9.  That being said the easiest was Haibane Renmei hands down.
>> ARTICLE
Haibene Renmei is truly brilliant, I wish more people would watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka. 
>> ARTICLE
All my 10's were without hesitation. That's why they're 10's. If I had any reservations about it, they would have just been 9's. Given 16 different shows that final score. Probably a lot more 10's than most people. None of them were difficult to score.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed! My 10s earned it 100% to the point where I'd feel bad not giving them a 10.
>> ARTICLE
The Tatami Galaxy. Finishing that show made me wonder if anything else I've ever seen was *really* a 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same way. I just stared at my list and wondered if there were some way to then rank my 10's amongst themselves. 
>> ARTICLE
After watching my favourite, I only have 1 10 to differentiate. Tatami galaxy was great just finished it yesterday! 
>> ARTICLE
Finishing that show only made me wonder why people liked it at all. I've read explanations online but still don't see what's so great about it. Glad you enjoyed it though.

Parasyte was mine, I would have given it an 11 based on the music alone, but the good character growth and dynamics with bitching action scenes didn't hurt either

For all of my 10s except for Kekkai Sensen were easy. I was on the fence for Kekkai Sensen until the end and just realized how chaotic yet cohesive it was, and how much of the show was just pure enjoyment--same reason I rated TTGL a 10.

*Millennium Actress*, quite easily. As for TV shows, *Shirobako*.

Stein's Gate and Clannad: After Story.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to NHK.  
It was too relatable to not give this show a 10. Yeah, the animation it self wasn't great, but it didn't bother me that much. 
>> ARTICLE
Steins Gate. After binge watching the last 10 or so episodes because I could not stop without knowing how it ended, it was a no-brainer to give it a 10
>> ARTICLE
I am gonna have to say Disappearance of Haruhi, what a hell of a wrap up for a series. 
>> ARTICLE
I wish kyoani would pick it up the Haruhi series again. I know it didn't sell well but some of the material in the light novels would make for some REALLY good episodes. Haven't finished all the light novels yet though.
>> ARTICLE
Jojo. Probably because it's so good, the score starts at 10+
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong.

I think it's the only one with a 10 on my list that I haven't considered changing, at all.


>> ARTICLE
If you want to reconsider, read the manga. That could change your opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm how so? I mean I'm curious, is it because they are different or because one is much better than the other or...?
>> ARTICLE
Because they actually managed to change the story so much, the fucked up the characters a bit here and there. Most notably Kazama.
>> ARTICLE
I might have to check it out, now I'm more curious. Thanks for the info, by the way.

Reminder that there's a re-watch going on, if you're interested.

Psycho-Pass easily.

My 10s are: Fate/Zero, Code Geass, FMA:B, Monogatari SS, Oregairu Zoku, and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. They were all easy 10s. If I have to deliberate then it probably isn't a 10. 
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagaan 

While I was watching it, it was riding around a 7 or 8. But when I was watching that last free episodes, especially the last one, I had to give it a 10.

Non Non Biyori. Both seasons.

I'm in the process of setting up a MAl account and the first animes i rated were my favourite 10's which are 
Gintama
Shirobako 
End of Evangelion

Personally, my easiest number 10 is Chihayafuru...  I recognize that there are some flaws in the show, I just don't care, its hands down the most enjoyable anime for me. I've watched it so many times and have so much invested in the characters. 

Haikyuu would probably be another easy 10 for me.

Steins;Gate and End of Evangelion

Ghost in the Shell (1995)

It just hit all the right buttons for me.

Shirobako

Oregairu Zoku
>> ARTICLE
Aiura. By and far the most authentic slice-of-life anime I've ever seen. It perfectly captures the mundane interactions between friends in a way no other anime I've seen can do. Most slice-of-life anime rely in some part on gimmicks to add entertainment, but Aiura hardly does, if at all. It's just three friends hanging out and shooting the shit and it is glorious.

~~I don't rate things on MAL, but...~~

This anime is still currently airing, but I give a 10 to Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (Erased). I love this show and if the remainder episodes are as good as all the other episodes have been, I think it'll stay a 10 for me.

Fate. Everything Fate. I'm just a Fate fag to the core.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;gate, Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu, Zetsuen no Tempest
>> ARTICLE
Full metal Alchemist brotherhood.  This was my first 10 I have ever given out as I believe 10 stands for anime that have something near perfect.  Not perfection as that is physically impossible but damn near it.  The story is great, the characters are not just fun, interesting and stand out but they are all useful to the overall plot.  The soundtrack is fricken awesome, and the animation while while nothing too special now was a spectral.  I have nothing else to say as this is the reason it was the easiest 10 i ever gave out.
>> ARTICLE
The Tatami Galaxy, I realized the show had changed my life when I was watching the last episode. Nothing compares to it.
>> ARTICLE
Either Spirited Away, because ever since I saw it for the first time in 2003, I still watch it several times a year. It's absolutely beautiful and still has the magic of when I first saw it.

Or

Akagami no Shirayukihime which was also amazing and since I saw it I've always been promoting it and absolutely loving it.

Bakuman easy. It had everything I wanted from it. I didn't dislike anything about it. I recognize that it has flaws, but those flaws didn't bother me. I loved all 75 episodes so much.

Nobunaga's Concerto. Enjoyed the different art style and the historical accuracy was much better than many other shows who try to do the same.

Millennium Actress. One of the greatest films I've ever seen, anime or not. Superb yet simple story, excellent animation, a gorgeous soundtrack that I ended up buying and of course the masterful direction of the late Satoshi Kon. Anyone who hasn't yet seen it should immediately bump it up their PTWs.

Cowboy Bebop- great story + great characters + 90s animation that has aged very well + **JAZZ** =10/10 for me
>> ARTICLE
EVA
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo, Death Note, AOT and most likely One Piece/Haikyuu!! werer all pretty easy...but, for me, the easiest to give would be AOT. 

I haven't been glued to my screen every week for an airing show like I was with AOT. I thought about it daily and nightly and couldn't wait for the next episode. I hear the gripe of "it's slow" but I loved everything about it; the pacing, the music, the characters, the animation, everything.
>> ARTICLE
I think Legend of Galactic Heroes was my easiest and fastest 10.

Oh, and Monster.
>> ARTICLE
* Shokugeki no Souma
* Amagi Brilliant Park
* Bakemonogatari
* Monogatari Series: Second Season 
>> ARTICLE
Probably Overlord, because of how hard it was for me to wait for the next episode every week.  Yes, I rate based on personal enjoyment.

Or possibly Usagi Drop because of the sheer amount of warm fuzzies there is no manga.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass, it's my favorite anime by far and the only one i've rewatched more than 3 times (lost count by now).
>> ARTICLE
Clannad (especially After Story) was probably the easiest 10. I don't think I will ever come across something that will ever come close to it. I mean... It didn't change my life or anything like that, but it sure made me think twice about parenting at the time. Whether it be me, in the future, or about my parents... 

And then of course, there's all the rest that naturally come with the name "Clannad". It was unexpected. Never in my life I would have expected to cry watching an anime (I did cry everytime THAT happened in The Lion King, but I was young, so it doesn't count for me). 

I actually can't even put into word what how I feel about Clannad. I just don't really understand myself. I know it's not *the* most perfect anime ever, but I don't know. There's just something about it that makes it perfect in my eyes. 

Another easy 10 was Gurren Lagann. I mean... That's the hypest shit I've ever seen. It's raw, unadulterated, unlimited amount of hype and spiral energy mixed together to form a beautiful anime that knows no limit. Call it dumb or whatever ; Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the best crazy/over-the-top action anime you could dream of. Its level of craziness increases exponentially over the course of its 27 episodes (well... 26 if you don't count the recap) but it never got old for me, nor did it reach levels of craziness so high it lost me head exploded by an overdose of stupidity. It's just a shitton of fun concentrated and injected directly in your veins. 

Ahhh... Goddammit. How I loved 2009-2011... Thinking about this, I really feel like it was the best years in my life so far, and it was nothing when you think about it... I really need to make things move in my life.

from the trailer I saw it seemed like there was no way I would not like the show.

I think I had given it a 10 piece by episode 6. I was sure that score would go down. . . .it didn't.


 
>> ARTICLE
TTGL for me, How often do you see robots bigger than universes punching each other?

No show ever increased the hype per episode meter like that show did
>> ARTICLE
Your Lie in April. It's just beautiful and perfect. It does that thing that so many other shows strive for where it's simultaneously tragic and uplifting - and it does that better than anything else I've ever seen. Plus it made me cry like a bitch for the first time in years which was incredibly cathartic and helped me relieve a lot of stress. 
>> ARTICLE
Madoka, Shirobako, K-On!!, Space Dandy. I routinely reevaluate my 10's because I have so many. But these ones I never hesitate to take it away from them.

FWIW, my criteria for a 10 is literally "will I hesitate to give it a 10?". Most of my 10's will fit this description.

Kemono no Souja Erin. In terms of main character development this is really second to none and it's due to fantastic storytelling and the fact that it occurs over a multiple of different periods in her life that it is possible to achieve that development.

Watched Kill La Kill right after Gurren Lagann.

I have never given an anime 10/10. I don't know if I'm too harsh or I just don't think anything I've watched has been perfect enough for the score. I have a couple 9's and a 9.5 but no 10.

I think the only 10s I have on MAL are Death Note, Code Geass, Gurren Lagann and Lucky Star. Love these shows dearly.

AnoHana. This was the only anime (and is the only anime) to have made me cry. For a show to make me that attached to the characters, I couldn't give it anything less than a 10.

And also Gintama

Gurren lagann. Forever and always a perfect 10/10.  If it was a woman then I would disappoint it so badly to the point i turned her off men forever.

I don't have a MAL, but Nichijou, OPM, and Kyoukai no Kanata are the first to come to mind if I were to give them ratings. It's embarrassing, but I'd need to rewatch FMA and Cowboy Bebop before giving them a real score. it's been too long. Erased and Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu are on their way for 10s as well.

I want to give the Haruhi series a 10 as well, but I can't with the way they handled the endless eight. Not counting that fucking spinoff from last year, of course.

FMA Brotherhood easily. I was not very convinced by the plot before starting. (Generic shounen battle with teenage protagonists? not my thing.)

Truthfully, the plot isn't anything out of this world. And yet, even though I thought I would not enjoy it at first, I thoroughly did. The show is a perfect example of how the power of something is in the execution. Everything is done so perfectly. It's not pretentious, yet full of emotion. It's longer than some other shows, but every episode feels necessary. The interactions and development of the characters is amazing. It doesn't pretend to be more than it is, adheres to the manga without changing too much yet uses the medium of animation to create a much better way of telling the story. The animation and soundtrack are perfect.

I don't rank shows on MAL, but Shirobako was one where by the end, I was like "This is a definite 10/10 for me." Just the sense of happiness by the end, and I realised then that I actually cared about the characters.

Eaaaasy 10.

One Punch Man.  Because it's the first anime that made me pick up a manga.  Never was interested in reading the manga versions of the anime I watch until OPM.

I gave Tatami Galaxy a 10 after its first episode, and never doubted my rating until I finished it. Still remains my favorite anime ever. Episode 1 was on an entirely different level than everything else I had seen at that point, so it was quite easy.

Steins;Gate. It was boring at first. Then shit got crazy. And it had a good ending. A good ending is an easy way to get a 10 from me.
>> ARTICLE
Last 2 episodes lowered it to a 9.5 for me honestly but it's an easy one.
>> ARTICLE
For me it was easily Sword Art Online. I was never so invested on an anime (looking up spoilers and everything). I love most of the characters and the action is too notch with some comedy thrown in. Perfect show for me!

On the opposite end (decision making wise) Steins;Gate took some contemplation! Pretty slow start that isn't appealing to everyone but damn! it's the best writing I've ever seen. Ended up giving it a 9 instead of a 10, but still one of my favorites all time.

Panty and Stocking. One of, if not the best episodic anime I've seen. Bright, flashy, and fun, with lots of hilarious moments. Not afraid to go break convention and go with really really gimmicky episodes. Soooo many references to western culture. And the "shitty clipart" style animation that plagued Kill La Kill works exponentially better for P&S's artstyle. And when the animation decides to to get going, oh man does it get going.

Only 10/10 for me and the easiest one for me to justify.

It's common for people to not like the first 20-25 episodes, so unfortunately, you kind of have to slog through them. After that, though, the writing got better and better, including the jokes. Then, after the main characters and side characters are established (there are a lot of them), it starts to develop some of the more serious stories that are shown in short arcs interspersed with the more humorous, episodic ones.

Gintama is one of those few anime that somehow managed to make me laugh out loud during some episodes, yet cry like a baby in others. When Gintama is good, it's *incredibly* good.

 [the start of r2.] (/s "Charles has lelouch go back to his same school because thats the ultimate punishment.  and he wants to catch CC but then CC is the one who frees him and they don't get close to catching CC.  Also at the end of the episode they drop a building that they are inside on the viceroy.  And Lelouch defeats charles mainly because charles wasn't fighting back but in season 1 charles was very much still interested in his empire.  so yeah those are the major ones in my opinion")
>> ARTICLE
The plot wasn't that bad in R2. It's just that it was far too ambitious in scope (the entire world instead of just Japan) and they had to hurry through all the secondary/tertiary plotpoints. That's why I think Code Geass has plenty of room left for future stories. While R2 is the definitive end to Lelouch's personal journey.

What the fuck is wrong with those anime? They're fun, they're entertaining, and as for Phantom, the animation quality is quite good. I'll never understand why some silly or CGDCT anime like Nichijou and K-On! get so much praise while others on that same category, and frankly, better, get so much shit. I know, i know, "different tastes" and shit, but come on!

Dagashi Kashi deserves a 'low' rating because it's not very entertaining.  It's sort of educational and good for Japanese candy history buffs and shit, but the level of comedy in the show is just *weak* compared to KonoSuba, for example.

Nah bruh, Nurse Witch Komugi-chan R is OBVIOUSLY a better show.

I don't get why a show that is well done like Musaigen gets hated on by the hipster community.  People kept trying to make it more than it is, a show about some protagonists experiencing weird and strange things and then getting disappointed for trumping up their own hype.  It's a well done show that is easy to watch, but nope.

Nurse Witch Kumugi-chan R is deep and involved my friend and Musaigen is far too shallow in comparison.  Such garbage.
>> ARTICLE
I don't see those as bad scores though. They're slightly above average, but there's this common theme on MAL where people turn away from anything below a 7.

I can't count how many good or even great shows I've found that were rated 6-7.

That said, I don't think Phantom World deserves to be as low as it is. It seems like a lot of people came into it expecting some big, overarching plot, and got mad when it turned into more of a SoL, problem of the week show. If you watch it for just what it is it can be pretty entertaining, and damned if it isn't a beautiful anime to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Dagashi Kashi is a glorified candy commercial.  I struggled to make it to episode 9, but I got bored and dropped it.  Or maybe it was 8, can't remember, that's how little the show made me care.

Phantom World, while pretty and with a great music score, is just... so, so bad.  I'm only watching it at this point ironically.  I have nothing against generic shows, I loved Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry after all, but if you're going to run through a generic formula, then at least try to be self-aware or different... or something, anything.  Phantom doesn't... it plays all the classical tropes straight and safe, and I'm also fairly certain whoever wrote the damn thing was on LSD the whole time, 'cause it is trippy as fuck.  It doesn't deserve better than average, and honestly it is lucky to get that.  I also basically hate every single fucking person in Phantom except for Koito, and only because she hates the rest of them as is deserved (and 'cause I'm a sucker for red/pink hair).

Shoujo-tachi, which I enjoy it very much, is really not that good of a show.  I tune in every week, but it just isn't that good.  It is pretty average compared to other offerings.  It isn't bad either tho, so 5-6 is exactly where it should be.

As for Phantom.... fuck, that's too damn high.  It's bad.  Beautifully animated and musical scored bad, but still bad.
>> ARTICLE
I should add that I'm basing this off the idea that most people here have 7s as their average since that's what I usually see, which obviously isn't the case for everyone.

What's wrong with Phantom?
>> ARTICLE
7 as an average of their completed scores doesn't mean that is what they consider an average show.  It just means that most people tend to watch things they know they will likely enjoy, which is only natural.  Ideally if you watched *every* anime released your average score would be close to 5.5, but it would still probably be higher I would guess.  6.5 average for Reddit is actually fairly good, and I know I'm at 6.8, which will probably drop as I keep up with more seasons.

> What's wrong with Phantom?

Aside from the animation and music?  Everything.  I'll put it this way.  SAO is landing around a 6-7 according to redditanimelist.  That makes sense to me, because most people consider the animation/art and sound to be top tier for SAO, and the story/characters fairly average or just below.  That would average the score out to around 6-7 logically.

Phantom world also has top tier animation and decent but not amazing music, but the characters are just so damn shit and the story so.... messy and unfocused and shitty that I  imagine most people would rate those aspects fairly low.  Average those scores out and you'll end up with a 4-5.

To me, that all makes sense.  Regardless of my personal views on the show, it makes sense that Phantom would end up around a 4-5.  With regards to my personal opinions on it, as I said, the story is just so fucking all over the place and unfocused and pointless that I'd give it like a 2/10 at best and maybe a 3 out of 10 for the characters.  Only because the characters are somewhat unique in design and talent though, otherwise that'd be a 2 as well because we really haven't learned much about them or watched them change with the exception of Koito, the only character I like.
>> ARTICLE
>characters are just so damn shit 

I'm quite a fan of all the characters really, they're all rather different and I like seeing how they interact with each other.

> the story so.... messy and unfocused

It's an episodic show with no real over-arching plot other than the school and their group. There isn't really a story.

Not to say that's bad. People don't say shows like Nichijou are bad either, as they shouldn't. In episodic shows you rate the story on a episode by episode basis, which I would say phantom has done pretty well.

It's pretty and it's fun to watch. Exactly what it tries to accomplish and all it tries to accomplish. Just because it's not what people wanted out of KyoAni doesn't mean it's a bad show. 
>> ARTICLE
Heh, we'll have to agree to disagree.  I don't knock it for being episodic nor did I expect anything from KyoAni (I haven't watched enough anime to even know what a "KyoAni" show would be).  I get that the episodic nature was intentional, but even the stories in individual episodes are just terrible to me.  I guess a few of them were kind of fun, heck, I actually liked the first couple of episodes, but most of them now have been so offensively bad to me that... ahhh whatever.  I don't want to rag on a show you like anymore man, you do you!
>> ARTICLE
I agree Phantom's not bad at all, but I have a hard to giving any light novel adaptation set in a magical high school anything higher than an average score, on principle more than anything. 

I think Kyo Ani's far and away the most talented anime studio out there today and I can't condone playing it safe like they are this season. Even if they *can* make the most generic bullshit goofy and delightful.
>> ARTICLE
People on this sub have *ridiculously* high standards. They are spoiled rotten. In no world is Phantom World "average." Maybe it's average for tier 1 studios in Winter 2016, but it's not average across the aggregate of all anime. It is an easy 7 and maybe an 8 depending on your taste.
>> ARTICLE
> have a hard to giving any light novel adaptation set in a magical high school anything higher than an average score, on principle more than anything.

Why? It's a setting that is used over and over again true, but it doesn't mean that a show can't do it well. 

Also if anything I think KyoAni didn't play it safe this season at all, as you can see all the hate the show gets. 
>> ARTICLE
>it doesn't mean that a show can't still do it well

Yeah, but those kind of shows are made with a certain audience in mind. They will almost always put preference on accessibility over quality or creative risks. I mean, there *could* be an awesome big budget super hero movie, but 99.999% of the time they'll end up being milquetoast crowd-pleasers, right?

To your second point, I think the show gets as much hate as it does *because* they played it safe. People have certain expectations for what Kyo Ani produces, it's disappointing when they produce lewd, generic light novel adaptations (however delightful they may be!) over something truly special (which they are clearly capable of!).
>> ARTICLE
>, but those kind of shows are made with a certain audience in mind. They will almost always put preference on accessibility over quality or creative risks.

That's a rather blanket assumption. I can't say it's wrong really, but just because they're making a show focusing on a magic high school doesn't mean they can't do something with it. Holding them to what others have done with the setting isn't fair.

>People have certain expectations for what KyoAni produces

From the makers of Chuunibyou, lucky-star, K-ON, free, Amagi Brilliant Park... They haven't exactly produced a non-stop "special" anime. Not to say that I dislike the shows they put out, if anything KyoAni is one of my favorite studios, but people getting upset because they aren't making another Suzumiya or Clannad is ridiculous. 
>> ARTICLE
>Holding them to what others have done with the setting isn't fair

I'd probably agree with you if Phantom World did anything besides make a largely reprehensible genre bearable.

> getting upset because they aren't making another Suzumiya or Clannad is ridiculous

I'm not saying every one of their shows needs to be a masterpiece. Just that since they're so clearly talented, don't you wish they'd strive to make projects a bit more ambitious than sexed-up light novel adaptations? 
>> ARTICLE
>don't you wish they'd strive to make projects a bit more ambitious

They're a studio that I have no control over, I'm not in control of what they make. I don't really "wish" for them to go one way or another. My choice is to either enjoy what they are putting out now or not, I choose to enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
It's much better than the average magical high school show though, and is definitely something that people keep actively seeking to watch.  I feel like they dropped the ball on character advancement and development, but each episode is one I look forward to watching.  I don't know why we can't all accept that it's good, not great, and give it a reasonable score, instead of aggressively tanking it...

Unless /r/anime really believes *Nurse Witch Komugi-chan R, Ooyasan wa Shishunki!*, and *Sekkou Boys* are better shows.  The hipster scoring is too depressing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm totally on board with what you're saying. Relative to overall mal scores, it gets too much hate, but for someone like me, who at least tries to use the whole scale, I think a 5 or 6 is a reasonable score for Phantom World. That's all I meant by my comment.

I look forward to watching it every week, but I probably won't give it a second thought after it ends. All the boobie groping and "Onee-samas"  keep me too self-conscious to recommend it to anybody, which is a big reason why it'll stay a 5 for me.


>> ARTICLE
I believe the director of Phantom World said they wanted to do something "fun" and not too serious, given all the other projects KyoAni is currently working on. Don't have a source but it is the same director (Tatsuya Ishihara) who's doing Hibike, so it would make sense. 
>> ARTICLE
Right, and if all they wanted to do was make a fun show, I'd say they succeeded. That doesn't mean it deserves anything over a 5 or 6, though.


>> ARTICLE
That was more in response to "playing it safe." I don't necessarily think they adapted Phantom World to "play it safe."

Personally it's around a 7 for me at the moment, but I put a lot of value into enjoyment and animation quality. That's my own subjective way of rating. :)

Depends on the scale. I generally see 6 as bad and 5 and below as unwatchable.
>> ARTICLE
Most people saying a 5 or 6 would leave me incensed, but I glanced at your list and totally agree that based on your list ratings, it's pretty easily a 5, maybe a 6 if they do something big for a finale.

It blows my mind that Oshiete! Galko-chan is even more disliked on Reddit than MAL.  I think it's the funniest show of the season and the best classroom-banter style SOL that I've seen since Yuyushiki.  It's also really well animated and the bright colours look great.

>2 Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu

Sometimes /r/anime has good taste.
>> ARTICLE
Should be #1.  Honestly, it's the best show that I've seen since Ping Pong/Mushishi Season 2 (not saying the better shows that came after it were bad, but nothing quite on this level)
>> ARTICLE
I mean, ERASED is also great, I couldn't really decide between the two of them.
>> ARTICLE
It should but ERASED is far too popular. 
>> ARTICLE
At this point in the season, Rakugo is my #1 but I can't deny that Erased had an absolutely tremendous beginning and was the better show for a bit. However, I think Erased has dropped a bit in quality lately while Rakugo has stayed consistently really good.
>> ARTICLE
Would love to see this when the season is over, as I don't (and I'm sure others) vote on a show until it's over. Also, those Luck & Logic and HaruChika (this one especially) scores are not warranted.
>> ARTICLE
Also when it's over MAL stops counting people who dropped it without watching a third of it.
>> ARTICLE
Who even votes on a show that they don't finish?

[](#chitogheh)
>> ARTICLE
Last week I watched [Mashiro-iro Sympony](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10397/Mashiro-iro_Symphony__The_Color_of_Lovers) and there was a review there of a 3 by someone who admitted to only watching two episodes of the show. Now it wasn't a masterpiece or anything, but I became irrationally fucking angry while reading it.

If you drop a show and give it a rating: Fine, whatever, I can accept that you found it unwatchable and rated it as such. But I don't feel you have any right to write a *review* of an anime when you've not even finished it, let alone watched *half* of. That anime in particular switches gears in the second half and was actually a decent harem/romance/love triangle with a cool MC that actually chooses a girl.

I wanted to comment on the review and tell him off.


>> ARTICLE
I'm not gona watch through 12 episodes just to vote if I find the show bad at 4 episodes in
>> ARTICLE
Then don't vote. You haven't watched the whole show, you can't give a proper score.
>> ARTICLE
Try to stop me! 3:^)
>> ARTICLE
I have watched enough to make me drop a show, how does that disqualify me from rating it? 
>> ARTICLE
You haven't watched all of it, which means you can't give a proper score for the whole thing, only the part that you watched. The score of the show won't be true. What if it became better? What if it became worse? Rating a dropped show might contribute to a great show becoming buried.

You've watched enough to tell that you don't want to finish it, but you haven't watched enough to give a score.
>> ARTICLE
I've yet to watch a series where watching the first four episodes and deciding if I'd keep watching it or drop it was a bad idea. It's not my fault if a series can't hook me within about 2 hours. 

I've felt like my time was wasted from staying with a series I wasn't enjoying to the season's end, so why would I keep doing that? 
>> ARTICLE
If the show is trash I'm giving it a crap score and *you can't stop me*.
>> ARTICLE
Thinking like that is exactly what causes the inflated scoring system on MAL. You don't have to eat through a plat of shit to tell it tastes bad, similarly how you don't have to sit through 3 hour movie to call it terrible or watch a 4 hour anime season to judge it

If the show is bad enough to make the viewer stop watching it then that's the show's problem and it deserves to get scored as such. Expecting someone to suffer through 4 hours of not-entertaining  entertainment just to score a show is idiotic
>> ARTICLE
Who cares about score inflation?
>> ARTICLE
That analogy isn't even comparable. It would eating a mystery dish that you know nothing about until you put a spoonful of it into your mouth. While I get what you're saying, it doesn't change the fact that it's inaccurate. It's not your fault, though I'm sure there solutions that satisfy both sides of the arguement. Weighted scores depending on amount of show completed, having two or three tallied scores (dropped, finished, both), or simply adding a prominently placed percent dropped with scores not counting because the drop acts as the qscore (in this case, percent dropped would act as another scoring metric; low score and high drop would mean a show is utter crap, high-high would make it very niche, high-low would means good or hype train, and other variations).

>> ARTICLE
Best example would be [Classroom Crisis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30383/Classroom%E2%98%86Crisis)
from 2 seasons ago. It was shit, until ep 5 came out, when it got good. Everyone voted because of the first 4 eps, and it got a shit rating as a result. It's rated 7.2 now, but back then it was more around 5-6
>> ARTICLE
You can see how much he has seen and what he rates those episodes, nothing wrong with that at all. Just use your brain and don't regard it as rating the whole anime but rather the part he watched.
>> ARTICLE
But this is what causes score inflation, because only people who finish a show vote, so you're not weighing the opinions of the people who didn't like the anime so they dropped it.
>> ARTICLE
I understand not wanting to go through the rest of the episodes (no need to waste your time on something you don't want to watch), but you're rating a show you've only watch a third of. If I did that for something like Classroom Crisis, I'd be misrepresenting the show because it's actually quite good, yet its first three episodes are horrible.
>> ARTICLE
If the 3 first episodes are horrible then the show deserves to get a lower rating from the people who don't wish to spend an hour just to get into a show

Common theme among the highest rated shows is that they are good from the get-go, only real noticeable exception I can spot straight away is Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
And if you rated all shows based on the first three episodes, shows like Sunday Without God would be much higher ranked than it should be. It is unfair to the rest of the show. For example, Tokyo Ghoul RootA was garbage but episode 8 and 9 were legitimately great and yet you will never ever see anyone give those episodes the credit they deserve.
>> ARTICLE
> they are good from the get-go, only real noticeable exception I can spot straight away is Steins;Gate

tfw you actually like the first half of Steins;Gate
>> ARTICLE
I vote on shows that I deliberately dropped because they were bad. If people don't do this, only people who watched it through rate it, which causes the score to be inflated.

There's a lot I could disagree with in your post (such as that there are a lot of reasons we should care about popularity contests, and that the present year doesn't really have a bearing on that), but the big one is that this isn't an example of a popularity contest.  There was 1 person voting, and it wasn't a person, it was a script.

Should I have put /s in my post? You missed the point anyway though.

MAL Rankings are just a popularity contest and the "2016" part is a joke about hove we should have moved beyond caring about rankings at this point. It was a shit post, but it whooshed over your head.

IMO shit posts can only be so shitty, they at least have to make some basic level of sense.

It's a little surprising how few people actually post here. On a given contest thread, for instance, there will generally be several thousand votes, but only a hundred or so comments. And the lurkers who bother to participate in the contest are probably the more active lurkers.

I feel like a couple hours after a contest thread has been posted all is already said that has to be said. Salt about every loser and a plea to vote for every person still in the contest are taken care of, so what more is there to say? More "wow, /r/anime has terrible taste because Duvet got voted out" is pretty unnecessary. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't comment often here on /r/anime because I'm fairly new to it (only 99 completed shows in MAL) and feel like if I just wait a bit someone more knowledgeable/experienced will come by and do a better job helping. Also when it comes to the contest stuff I don't enjoy arguing with people so I just vote and read the top comments to see if there's anything interesting there.
>> ARTICLE
99 completed shows is a lot. You're probably above average.
>> ARTICLE
Right? I feel like I have watched a decent amount of anime over the past decade, and it's probably somewhere around 40? I don't watch all of the time, but try to watch a few a year on the midst of my other shows/movies. Plus it doesn't help that o like longer series generally instead of 13/24 episode one offs. 
>> ARTICLE
IIRC from the last poll the average was over 200.
>> ARTICLE
So you brought up an interesting point and I had some data so I tried to find out the answer. To be quick I just calculated for percentage greater than 100 anime seen. The March 27, 2015 survey only had bins 0-50, 51-200, 200+. And I also included the survey sample size, less people could've answered this specific question.

So maybe my point wasn't the most correct. But, maybe what I meant was that 99 isn't below average. It's quite average and there's also a lot of people below it.

* Nov 17, 2015 - 278 - 54.5% have seen more than a hundred anime.
* Nov 9 - 3472 - 46.9% > 100 anime seen
* Mar 27 - 684 - 21.3% > 200, 77.9% > 50
* Jan 1, 2015 - 512 - 47.7% > 100
* Oct 23, 2014 - 2280 - 52.28% > 100
* Feb 13, 2014 - 1916 - 34.8% > 100
* Sep 25, 2012 - 420 - 30.3% > 100

only good think to come out of this list


>> ARTICLE
LoGH has a hugely inflated score, even on MAL- because only people who actually like it, and thus rate it highly, will reach the benchmark requirement for having a rating stick (which is 10% of the show last I checked), and when a show has 110 episodes, there's no way someone who doesn't like it will watch 11 episodes just to rate it lowly on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
LotGH has 110 episodes though
>> ARTICLE
Still a series long enough that the people who drop it won't have their scores listed, because who watches that many episodes of a show they don't like?
>> ARTICLE
But should the scores of the people that don't even complete even count? I mean, even if they didn't like it, they haven't seen enough to truly judge the show for what it is so I think this rating system is fair.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is when the benchmark is so high that the people who don't like it won't reach it. It's not a problem for most shows, which last 12-24 episodes, so the first few episodes is enough, but for a super long show like Gintama or LoGH, it filters out everyone who didn't like the show, hence why its rating is higher than it arguably should be. 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm that's a fair argument but I still think people who haven't watched at least half a show shouldn't really have a say in the overall rating.
>> ARTICLE
LoGH is a real freakazoid in terms of anime. Almost every one of its episodes have OVA level production and even OVA style release. It's made over a decade in its releases and it STILL has more re-tellings to go in the future. You can tell the creators really loved the project and was willing to forego the crunch of seasonal release.

In a way, it's almost unfair for other anime, because almost no anime gets this level of treatment.

Still, I'm happy for the show. I kind of wish Tytania was finished and got a 100+ episode show too.
>> ARTICLE
>OVA level production

What exactly are you referring to with this? At least animation- and direction-wise LoGH is absolutely nothing special, generally being acceptably mediocre with some occasional highlights.
>> ARTICLE
Remember to take into account that we are speaking of a title that started production in 1988. And for that era, LoGH is one of (if not absolutely) the best possible examples of art and animation. 

Does it hold up to the current 4K-upscale-60-FPS standards of today? Of course not. No title from the 80s can handle that, but neither can every title produced today.

I don't think you have seen a lot of 80s animation if you say that...Or know anything about animation in general, for that matter. "4K 60FPS" what...?

Hey, its me your /u/TyrantRC

I was actually trying separate show that I haven't watch from the ones I watched for a filtered list on animeadvice.me I believe, I was having trouble deciding on what to watch next and I was trying to make a list of plan to watch organized by their score on mal and release date. Not sure what was my idea behind the 1 score, I did it without remorse because I read somewhere on mal that if you haven't watch like 30% of the total show your score is not added to the general score database, so I decided to use it as a metatag in my list or something like that. Obviously this didn't work and I was just too lazy to put them all back to a blank score.

If someone knows a way to organize mal by release date+score. Something like show only shows with an average score of 7 or more from 1990 to 2000 please tell me how
>> ARTICLE
Haha, don't worry about it, I'm just teasing. MAL does indeed work as you're describing - you have to have seen some percentage ({1/5.2}%) of a show in order for your rating to count (unless the show is currently airing). But RedditAnimeList doesn't work that way, and I thought it was funny that you were the only person who scored the top show, LoGH, with a 1 :P

That being said, if you want to add an extra "organization system" to your list, it's generally easier to use the Tags column (which is not enabled by default - you need to activate it in your list settings page) where you can enter whatever custom text you want. There's also a 'Priority' column you can turn on for PTW that lets you divide it into Low/Medium/High Priority.

> If someone knows a way to organize mal by release date+score.

If you go to Advanced Search options in the anime search page, you can filter the results to specific values, but unfortunately not ranges, though you can also sort the results by each criteria. So, e.g., you could do an Advanced Search for all shows with a Score of 7, sort by release date and browse to 1990. Or do separate searches for Score 7 + Release Date 1990 (leave month and day blank and it will encompass all of 1990), then Score 7 + Release Date 1991, through all permutations, but I think that might actually be longer to do.

>> ARTICLE
>ERASED	-0.18

I imagine that score will probably drop a little more once the season ends, since that's generally what happens (people who score more critically tend to wait until the show finishes).
>> ARTICLE
Oh I'm sure it will drop, the ending is nice, but nothing breathtakingly amazing. So yeah, I'm definitely expecting a score drop to under 9.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even know Ring of Gundam was an actual thing. 

I wonder how would the rankings turn out if the silent majority who aren't as active in posting would affect the results. I imagine it'll be a bit closer to MAL's.
>> ARTICLE
> I didn't even know Ring of Gundam was an actual thing.

it's only 5 minutes long and has decent direction, visuals, and music (surprisingly getting scored by Yoko Kanno and directed directly by Tomino). nothing too stellar, mostly having to do with the short runtime, but it was something I really wanted to see get fleshed out into a real show cause the concept was all there. it was supposed to be what ended up becoming G-Reco, which is a bit of a shame that it didn't develop into a thing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I didn't remember that until now and assumed this represented the sub as a whole... 

I think the "active user" thing would definitely skew stuff towards vocal people, especially those who are fans of certain shows and talk about them a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Vocal opinion tends to differ quite a bit from what the silent majority votes on it seems. Taking contests and how popular discussion and upvoted shows are like SAO and DanMachi for instance vs. how much it gets bashed on by the vocal people of the sub.

Im happy that turn A gundam is gets the score it deserves, the MAL score is too low imo.
>> ARTICLE
It would be really good if you put the "prev" and "next" buttons at the bottom as well.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting facts from a first glance


1. Araragi won best guy contest, but monogatari is ranked 5-10

2. If you take into account that an average /r/anime user rates shows on average -0.50 less than Mal, the difference in scores isn't that significant for overated shows


3. Erased isn't as overated as /r/anime thinks it is , but the show is going on.

4. Most shows get around 50% certain viewership, so Im happy spoiler rules are stictly enforced


>> ARTICLE
One thing about Erased is that the people complaining about Erased are also probably in the set of people who complain about people rating anime while they're still airing.

(Personally, I'm okay with rating stuff while it's airing)
>> ARTICLE
Well everything that's really good or popular eventually becomes "overrated" on /r/anime.

>> ARTICLE
Fun concept and lovely execution! 
>> ARTICLE
Interesting stats. It looks like some of the big names like FMA:B and Steins;Gate didn't move much but they still went down. I suspect it's because most Redditors on here have watched a decent amount of shows whereas the MAL community is bound to have more new anime watchers watching them so the scores are higher.

Seems that since Redditors (especially the ones that comment) compromise of mostly anime watchers that have a decent amount of anime under their belt, the starter shows and the popular shows are rated lower. Meanwhile anime like LoGH, HxH, Aria, etc. are usually loved by the active community on here and may even be the reason they are active in the first place, which would explain why they either didn't move much or spiked up.
>> ARTICLE
How come your anime list looks so awesome while mine is a lifeless table?


>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't really draw that conclusion with such a low sample size.

Just compare the amount of voters

Number of votes for LOGH = 139

Number of votes for Aria TO = 92

Number of votes for FMA:B = 1296

LoGH and Aria are rated so high because those series are not popular and will be watched by people who will most likely enjoy them. 

>> ARTICLE
Oh wow!

I actually wanted something like this for a long time, and sometimes I've manually handpicked some "Post your MAL" threads to look at certain anime's Reddit average.

The average on Sakurasou and NGNL was higher, and SAO lower for example (sample size: 100)

I love statistics!
>> ARTICLE
What numerical score has /r/anime given Sakurasou? 
>> ARTICLE
(I accidentally swapped it. Sakurasou and NGNL were lower on this sample size, SAO was higher)

Sakurasou:

Taking into account every person who rated **Sakurasou** in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/39i0bk/post_your_mal_and_others_recommend_anime_based_on/) thread we get the following:

35 people who rated Sakurasou -> Completed/Dropped/On-Hold

Rating:

* 10: 3

* 9: 9

* 8: 8

* 7: 5

* 6: 2

* 5: 5

* 4: 2

* 3: 0

* 2: 1

* 1: 0

**Final Verdict: 7,34** 

Noticeable tags for Sakurasou-ratings below 6:

 *"Drama" "Cringe" "Cheesy"*

(I had a newer statistic for 100 people sample size, which resulted in 7.5 but couldn't find it)
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. On this list, Sakurasou and NGNL are both lower by 0.74 on reddit, SAO lower by 1.46 points.


>> ARTICLE
You have to keep in mind that the reddit score is 0.49 lower in general, so -0.74 is not that bad.

It's interesting to see how popular an anime is. Only 13 people completed **Iria** and the score of 6.7 is alright. On the other hand **Gauche the Cellist** was completed by 15 people and only got a rating of 6.86 and **Dennou Coil** was rated lower here than on MAL. This is shit taste.


>> ARTICLE
I don't trust the opinion of a subreddit that generally thinks Gosick was a good anime on what overrated is.
>> ARTICLE
Great stuff /u/Jimboom7, this is really cool!

Some technical bits:

1. Does your formula also discard results from people who haven't watched up to a certain percentage of a show (MAL uses 5.2% ??)? E.g.: there are people who have LoGH rated a 10 or a 1, but show 0 episodes watched so far - are those scores counted?

2. Some pages for shows are messed up if the show's name contains special characters. E.g.: any doublequotes (") and following text in a show's title is being cut out from the generated hyperlinks to that show's page, so a show like I"s Pure (#3955) links to a generic I page instead.

Great list! But I do have a question. It seems that I am not in this list and that might be because I wasn't active in the last weeks on this subreddit or is it because I didn't link directly to my animelist (don't know which one applies).

Now my question: Does it automatically add even more data from (other) users or does it stay this way now? I'm pretty curious :)
>> ARTICLE
Linking to your profile is fine, you probably didn't write anything in the last week.  
And I will update the list each sunday I think
>> ARTICLE
SAO is rated higher here then expected
>> ARTICLE
I wonder why works such as Spirited Away are rated so much lower than on MAL. It probably has to do with the demographics to a big extend, but still intriguing. The rest of that score also lines up very well with the general consensus of most of these shows. Expect One Punch Man, which I have not seen seriously criticized a lot at all.  
>> ARTICLE
And this only correlates for users whose Reddit username is the same as their MAL yes? Nobody here would know my MAL unless I gave it to them, since it's different than my Reddit name.

Otherwise, it's pretty interesting to see outright what Reddit prefers vs general MAL user.

Filtering out some columns according to some condition would be a neat thing. E. g.

etc etc

Shirobako at 17th place.  This list is already 5.882352941176471x better than MAL.  And I'm user 1471, wewt!

Also:

Average Score of Reddit:	6.47  
Average Score of MAL:	6.96

We apparently have a better understanding of how rating systems should work.... either that or we're masochists that watch more shit we don't like.
>> ARTICLE
This makes me almost regret not tracking mine. I started watching anime so long before I knew about stuff like MAL, though, that trying to remember and list everything I've watched would be a huge pain in the ass.
>> ARTICLE
It's not *that* bad. I started watching anime decades ago and only made my MAL years ago. The night of making it was a lot of going through other sites' top 100 lists and going, "yeah I saw that, yeah I remember that," etc, and then for the next few months occasionally going, "oh shit there was that one show with the robots, what was that?" and if I remembered its name I'd look it up, recall some arbitrary rating and put it up.   
  
By now I am pretty sure my list is complete without missing things.

Hey OP,

A deviant filter to show users who rated shows outside of a 95% confidence interval would be cool / dramas / lulzy.

I dropped some stats code in C I had lying around [here](http://pastebin.com/2MSH8z2x) which should be easily portable to any other language.  The entrant point is the function Demo() at the bottom.

I'm surprised that Elfen Lied is considered overrated by this subreddit.  I mean, I've seen a considerable amount of pro-Elfen Lied posts around, at least compared to other sites discussing anime.
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty "edgy" anime.  Like, I can practically picture the writers listening to a combination of Linkin Park and Neutral Milk Hotel and giggling at their own genius.

I enjoyed it... but... yeah.
>> ARTICLE
Seems to me like you're just projecting. Being graphic does not equal "edgy" and I'm not sure what Linkin Park has to do with anything in EL.
>> ARTICLE
I guess some people couldn't get through all that gore/nudity
>> ARTICLE
It usually gets panned here, but it's not really threatening enough to anyone's waifu to merit much downvoting.  

Elfen Lied has some weird kind of cult following on MAL.  People are convinced it has some hidden 2deep4u message whose subtlety rivals NGE and remains undiscovered to this day.

It does some things right, but it also does a lot of things wrong, and the quality is pretty uneven.  I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't call it *good*.

Other than its OP, Lilium.  That was good.

It would be nice if these lists would just combine sequels into one Franchise entry. That way we don't get a bunch of Gintama seasons and random movies/OVAs cluttering the list. 
>> ARTICLE
while thats an interesting idea how would you do that? Take FMA. You got 2003, Brotherhood, both movies, and ova/specials collections of both. Do you just take the sum of all of the entires average them to get the FMA value? Do you weigh the Brotherhood series more because it has more episodes/viewing time? Do you not count the recap/ova/specials like FMA Reflections because it's not part of the story? As cool as that would be, I think there are too many edge cases to to get something like that to work. 
>> ARTICLE
Very easy. Just weight based on viewer count. So the main series would most likely count for more than OVAs, etc.

> With the reddit API I scanned the latest posts and got all lists from the user flairs.
*Note that the reddit api can't get more than the last 1000 posts, therefore it's not possible to gather more users than those active in (around) the last week.*

do you have any link to this implementation of the API? Scanning through their git right now and cannot seem to find what you used to collect this last 1000 posts. Won't say I'm a legit career programmer or anything yet but I've got a few years of classes under me and can at least read/manipulate any given algo to some extent; hoping I may be able to at least help change the magnitude of that 1000 posts to give you a larger sample set. Or, worst case, find a way to build a db in 1000 post increments and just keep parsing repeats until you have a large enough sample space to run it again.

---

Side note, love this idea of comparing scores between here and MAL. Any chance you can make your current DB available (raw db would be awesome) as well because I can see a lot of cool stats you can pull from it that would be interesting to see on here. Things like 'biggest score fluctuation between reddit users', 'most watched, lowest rated show', some kind of weighted value for reddit-score:popularity & MAL-score:popularity, etc. I dont know, just love playing with data this large and if we can find a way to expand it we will have even more interesting stuff I'm sure.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't really find it in the api documentation either, I got most of the information from stackoverflow and reddit itself. Here is a (very short) thread that discusses the problem: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/2pvdfp/going_back_more_than_the_first_1000_posts_in_a/)  
So basically you call https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/new.json and that's it. You can get a maximum of 100 posts (by adding ?limit=100) per call and do this 10 times at max (using the after parameter which was in the previous json).  
I could obviously run my scripts again and again for every 1000 new posts and add new users to the existing ones. But I think having a "snapshot" of the current state every week is more interesting.  
After I clean up my code (Which is a total mess, lol) and restructure the database I might publish it if anyone is interested.

Pretty much every episode has over 1500 points on the discussion threads. Very very few anime do that every episode. 


This list is also going to favor newer anime more than older. This sub has a pretty young average age, and people just don't always get around to the classics (GiTS:SAC rating above the original movie is a crime).

actually every episode has had over 2000 and that is even more impressive

Erased is rated a lot higher than I expected. And than it should be. FMA:B still a very high average with a huge number of watchers.

Is this site going to update each week?

e: The downvotes? Really? I love the show and don't mind how the reveal was handled (I saw a lot of crying about who the killer is in the discussion thread), but for several reasons I don't think it's top50 material, let alone top15.
>> ARTICLE
> Erased is rated a lot higher than I expected. And than it should be.

I think we need to see how it ends first.  It has handled most of the story fairly deftly so far.  The amount careful attention to detail that has gone into ERASED is nothing short of stunning.  It could end shit and plummet or end really well and potentially dethrone the current #1 from where it sits now.
>> ARTICLE
That sounds like a lot of api calls, maybe monthly?

Updating it weekly is no problem at all. There is no restriction on the reddit and mal api, so I just have to start the scripts, wait ~3 hours, watch some anime and it's done.

It's difficult to say who's taste is more shit. A few good shows go up and bad shows go down, but it's balanced out by the opposite in other cases.

OP stated that the 'overrated list' came from what he had personally observed on the sub. Steins;Gate and Gintama are more often praised here than said to be overrated, but again it's just an arbitrary selection from what OP had observed.

>Difference of reddit and MAL score: -0.49

I'm a redditor with very high standards.  
I proudly use a full spectrum of ratings, and only rate when I've seen a work in its entirety. I can trust at least some others here are similar.
>> ARTICLE
I see only rating a show when you've seen it all as a negative, you should rate things you drop or they're artificially inflated because only people who at least like it enough to finish it will rate it.

I also don't really regard -0.49 and a mean score of 7.2 as "very high standards". I consider myself quite forgiving and I'm -1.17 and 6.2 respectively.

>> ARTICLE
At the risk of getting a huge amount of downvotes and hate from a lot of you but I just don't understand the hype around FMA. Don't get me wrong, it is an amazing show and I really liked it but it's not even close as good as the hype indicates. There are way better shows out there which deserve to be in that Top 5 list IMO. Just look at Toradora, Steins;Gate, Darker than black or NANA. Of course this is my personal opinion but I truly think even if you look at it objectively there is no way that FMA is better than any of these shows. But maybe it's just me being pretty disappointed by FMA after getting hyped and watching it with high expectations^^ (German here, so excuse me for maybe irritating scentences haha)
>> ARTICLE
This is actually a demonstration of why FMA:B is there, you're saying it's an amazing show. I say it's amazing, so it gets ranked quite highly. That's it across the board for FMA:B, simply put a very small percentage of people don't like it at all.

Meanwhile of your four suggestions, I dropped two of them because I found them boring and overhyped.

Looking at MAL and comparing Toradora to FMA:B, FMA:B is both longer and had more popularity (as in MAL watches), but Toradora still has 2000 more droppers. 

FMA:B's mass appeal is why it does so strongly.

Gon's character development always seems to escape these discussions. Also, loved the narrarator. We wouldn't know half the shit that was going on without it. 
>> ARTICLE
Concerning the narrator: at the end, it was a stylistic choice and it really differs from person to person. I really liked it, too.
>> ARTICLE
**Highs**

* Everything Killua does, and everytime he fights.

I actually really liked the Phantom Troupe episodes, mainly because they were fights and interesting. They just showcased how strong, and what abilities the members really have, even if it seemed like a filler episode.

For me personally I didn't enjoy Pouf's attempts to kill Komugi, and the way he thought and talkes was pretty obnoxious. Also the entire 2 episodes after Meruem was healed seemed so ridiculous (in a negative way)
>> ARTICLE
The hatred for the narrator episodes always amazes me because for me they were among the best episodes of the series.

Anyways I thought it had pacing issues in the beginning as well, but I also think every arc of the show other than Yorknew had equally as bad of pacing issues.  At least this arc had something that made the slow start worth it unlike say Greed Island or Heaven's Arena.
>> ARTICLE
Greed Island and Heaven's Arena were basically arcs meant to develop Nen concepts and Gon's and Killua's fighting abilities. There's barely any plot depth in them. 
>> ARTICLE
You said it perfectly. The narrator was amazing he described the emotions and the thoughts perfectly 
>> ARTICLE
When people say they hated the narrator, I always like to show them [this scene again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86MoueTiBXE) Holy shit, It would have been less amazing if it was purely soundtrack over inner monologues from characters.

*"The countless dragons that rained down were less significant threats than the humans in the sky"*
>> ARTICLE
The Phantom Troupe part wasn't filler. 

The narrator part wasn't too bad in the manga (although I still didn't like it too much) but it was intolerable in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Mine won't be as long or well-written.  I liked most of what you didn't, and the slow paced narrator-tells-all episodes (while ridiculously dragged out in hindsight) kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.

The anticlimactic death of two of the guards were part of something I actually really like about HxH: not everyone gets a flashy death.  Sometimes you're just snuffed out like a candle.  No fanfare, no bang, just a sizzle.
>> ARTICLE
I think the problem with the narrator is that he barely speaks in the previous episodes (two sentences at the beginning and at the end) and halfway through the arc, all of a sudden, out of the blue, he starts to speak more than the characters themselves. I understand what the show was trying to do with that, but it could've been done differently (again: using some scissors). 
>> ARTICLE

* Pacing during Hunters vs Youpi

* Palm's obsession with Gon

* Ikalgo

* The orgasms after Meruem's resurrection.
>> ARTICLE
Come to think of it, the Youpi vs Hunters episodes are probably the worst thing of the whole arc.
>> ARTICLE
What's wrong with Ikalgo? I can understand it with the part where he was too much of a pussy to kill brovada. other than that, he had some pretty smart plans.
>> ARTICLE
I think the problem with Ikalgo is that the show kind of forces you to care about him all of a sudden just because he's an ally Ant. At least Meleoron knew what his place was and kept a low profile. 
>> ARTICLE
Him screaming "PALM !!!" every or so scene, with such emotion and intensity when he never even met her before was quite annoying but,i understand necessary since he replaced the chatacters that woudve cared as much preoccupied with their own grief

Gon : Kite 

Killua: Gon

Knov : Scared shitless of being dissected to even try

Knuckle/shoot : Shoot/shoot
>> ARTICLE
People fail to understand the directors purpose for the narrator episodes.  It was a a build up to the eventual climax.  At the start of the arc a lot of things were happening simultaneously from the start, so the narration slowed the pace down in order to accurately depict the outcome of all the different settings.  it also allowed for a very in depth look into the motivations of the ants in particular along with Gon and the rest of the normal cast. i for one think the whole arc was exceptional. 
>> ARTICLE
The part with the Phantom troupe was not filler. Why do you even think so? Have you finished the whole anime? If not, [HxH](/s "it foreshadowed Allukas existence.") Also, the fact that Kalluto, Killuas brother is in fact a spider now, will certainly become relevant.

Also, you have to keep in mind that the hunters never wanted to kill the RG in the first place. Meruem was the main goal.


>> ARTICLE
I really liked how, just before the flow of time drops to glacial pace, they slip in that little bit with Zeno Zoldyck talking about how in those really crucial moments it isn't just your imagination that things seem to happen slower.
>> ARTICLE
Get rid of 80% of the narration, reduce Welfin and Ikalgo's screen time, and condense the episodes a little, and it would have been near or at the top of the best battle shounen arcs ever.

I'm one of the people who prefers how Meruem was killed as any method for a hunter killing him would have to be an asspull. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the Phantom Troupe episodes were an attempt to show just how strong the ants are going in. The fact that Zazan, a squadron leader, gave one of the Troupe's heavy hitters trouble (to an extent) makes the thought of the royal guards' strength scary. It was also just a cool opportunity to show off the Troupe's powers that weren't explored in Yorknew. 
>> ARTICLE
i burned through HxH in quick time, so i didnt get time to think through every ep, but watching it through, all i could think of was how it used up too much time to say so little. it was the "is this what dbz is like" anime for me.

the york new arc set out things, slapped em down and delt with them no worries, but the ant arc ... it just kept on going, and raising the staked to the point where all i could think of was that the fight tower guys were complete talentless pussies.

"oh this guy is stronger" "well now this guy is stronger" etc. i didnt like it.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Hunter x Hunter is obviously, strongly influenced by DBZ so maybe this arc was its homage to those DBZ legendary endless fights... Who knows! 
>> ARTICLE
Sure, some 20 minute long episodes cover three minutes of hxh time, but it's anime, it's a serial adaptation of manga, and sometimes what works great in print is a little wonky on screen in parts. 

>> ARTICLE
While I'm happy to see r/anime loves the Chimera Arc, a few things made it my least favorite season despite having some of the best moments in the entire show.


The Narrator as OP pointed out. Just aggravating to no end, and ruined what was some of the most intense fights in the series. I was SO hyped to watch those fight scenes after reading the manga, but when something amazing was about to happen the Narrator would draw it out to eternity. Probably knowing how the fights were going to end, killed any suspense, but I feel the manga was so much better paced during battles in that regard.


Second, was how ridiculously powerful the Royal Guard and Meruem were. I understand they are the result of many powerful nen users fused with powerful traits from many different creatures, but unlike some of the other powerful characters they had little to no drawback. That's what was cool about Nen, for every super powerful skill was a huge, sometimes arbitrary drawback that made it feel balanced and fair to some degree. The Phantom Troupe leader has to always carry his book, and keep the users he copied alive. The old man had to do a prayer before every attack. Afro guy had to have ridiculous accounting skills and patience with the power bot thingy. Gon had to more or less sacrifice himself to go super saiyan. Obviously not all characters nen were as deep, like the Zoldycks were just really powerful too with no downside, but we never got to see the full extent of their skill anyway.


Still some of the greatest moments in shounen history, but goddamn it was a rollercoaster!
>> ARTICLE
I agree with how what you say about how ridiculously powerful were the RGs and Mereum. I was expecting them to be extremely strong and difficult to beat, but the arc reaches a point where you're like: "Are these endless fights even worth it? Because basically nothing is happening" (Expect for Gon vs Pitou)
>> ARTICLE
I liked it but I don think the narrator needed to explain every single detail about what the characters were doing or thinking. It felt pretty excessive. People bring up artistic genius in defense of these episodes but at times it didn't really seem different from Endless Eight. 

Ikalgo and Welfin episodes were also a snore, as well as the significant amount of time dedicated to some of the squadron leaders. 

Still really liked it overall with Gons development and Meruem being one of the greatest villains ever, but yeah they could have cut 20 episodes without too much lost.
>> ARTICLE
This arc is very similar to the Heaven's Feel route in F/SN. It has a great start and the couple last episodes are off the charts, but it's slow for the most part. There's some somewhat episodes and somethings that you think maybe could've been skipped but in my opinion all of it was necessary. There's a lot of emotional moments throughout the arc and a couple other things that would've been nearly as good without all the build up those slow episodes provided.

Also, I'm probably in the minority because I think the whole "3 min for 10 episodes" was pretty good. It's not the best thing of the arc but it's not bad either. 
>> ARTICLE
I disagree with that comparison. The slow pacing in Heaven's feel was because of the massive amount of SOL/cooking in between plot events. When shit was going down at any point in the story, the pacing was rather quick.

The slow pacing in the chimera ant arc, on the other hand, was those plot events themselves being stretched out over a large number of episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I take those SoL/cooking to be build up on [](/s "Sakura's character and her relationship with Shirou, which makes her change way more impactful. Even Illya's scenes build up the end and Nine Bullet Revolver.") They could be toned down a bit though.

And I feel the same about Chimera Ant. Sure the arc could've been shorter and some scenes where longer than what they needed to be. I'm not denying the problems of the slow pacing it has, but a lot of it made me like the events that happened later on better

Waiting for this to go to /r/all and the shitstorm that follows
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I came here from /r/all and I have a question for the people here. Don't you find it kind of creepy that most of your animes **hypersexualize underage girls**? Doesn't the fact that underage girls are considered fanservice indicate that perhaps most of the anime you guys watch are for **teenage boys**? I mean that's why it's called a **Shonen** right? So I guess my question is, assuming most of you are over 18 and I don't mean any offense: **aren't most of you too old for the animes you guys are watching?** 

Edit: Also, I'm not generalizing all anime or looking down on anime at all. I used to watch alot of anime in the past as well. Outlaw star and Honey and Clover series were my favorites. But I only ask this because when I look at the anime today, they seem alot more pornographic than I remember.

Edit2: to clarify, I don't think anime is weird. I just think that the people in their 20's and 30s watching shonen, anime targeted towards teenage boys, are weird. 
>> ARTICLE
I, myself am 20 years old. I just started watching anime last year, actually. Watch something like Corpse Party and tell me it's for kids.
>> ARTICLE
Well that depends, is Corpse Party a Shonen?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, didn't see the Shounen statement. Watch Hunter x Hunter. Since you probably don't care too much about watching the show start at the yorknew arc. I think it starts around episode 50.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're overestimating the average age of people in this sub.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you are asking an honest question, so I will give you an honest answer. Do keep in mind that I am answering solely for myself and do not claim this to be the answer for all of /r/anime/.

Yes, most anime are aimed at teenaged boys, and those are called shonenen, they compose a large amount of anime released now a days.

Second of all, although most fanservice in anime is underage, it is highschool. Those girls are all fully mature and developed, and other than names, they do not display any of the characteristics of teenage girls (typically speaking of course, there are exceptions), because, and you might have guessed it, they are't real boys and girls.

Now, allow me to point out that although some anime have never ending fanservice (highschool of the dead comes to mind), in most of them it is moderated and used for humorous effects. Although this may ruin the moment if thrown in at the wrong time, from time to time it is fun. Not gonna complain for the occasional fanservice.

As for too old for anime. Aren't most people on /r/gaming/ or any similar subreddits too old to play video games? Yet they still do (and me!). Why? Because they enjoy it. Because it is fun. Because it takes my mind off the long day of work I have. I enjoy doing it.

Lastly I will bring up the point that shounen, action, and fanservice are not in my favorite anime. Unlike what most non-anime viewers I have met think **Anime is not just mindless action and loli fanservice**. There is so much more to it. Believe it or not, you can do much more with animation they you can do with live actors. It is great seeing all the forms of art. I view anime kind of like I view books, as a way to see what I will never happen in real life. Weather it be magic, dragons, super-powers, or the occasional fan service.

My favorite anime of all time doesn't even include any action scenes, fanservice, or aimed at teenaged boys. That anime is called [Charcoal Feather Federation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei), and it is beautiful, philosophical, and just overall amazing. It is also a great entrance anime for people who aren't into the action fanserviece kind of stuff. (not that I'm advertising it or anything *cough cough*)

One last note is that when people here discuss fanserviece, incest, lolis, or the recent bath thread that got into /r/all/, they typically aren't taking it seriously and more doing it as a joke on everyone, including yourself and me.

Hope that clears up all your qualms, if you have any more questions or arguments feel free to respond to me.

Some of the people here might be a little bit offensive, but that's because nobody likes it when other people insult their favorite activity, so please don't feel insulted by it :)
>> ARTICLE
Well I never said all anime were for teenage boys, I enjoyed Honey and Cover when I was 18 and loved it. I can definitely appreciate it as an art form and I think that it can be for all ages just like videogames. But I think it's kind of creepy when people in their 20s or even 30s are watching **shonen's**, which is targeted towards teenage boys with their endless amount of fanservice of teenage girls. 
>> ARTICLE
First: not all of the anime featured in the OP are shonen. Many are notable seinen and ecchi titles with clear R+ ratings. Also, not all shonen has "endless amount of fanservice of teenage girls" and just because a show has a *target* demographic doesn't mean people outside that demographic are forbidden from enjoying it.  This behavior isn't even exclusive to anime; American cartoons like Adventure Time, Sponge Bob, and Steven Universe have a ton of adult fans.

Second: just as with books and movies, anime is a medium with many different genres.  Yes, shonen is one such genre, based on an age demographic.  You, apparently, prefer josei titles like Honey and Clover.  There's nothing wrong with either preference.  

To be honest, I'm not into fan service, but you won't see me giving people shit about enjoying all their love for ecchi and harem anime.  *It doesn't hurt me for them to like it, and it doesn't hurt you either*.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually with you on that. The amount of never-ending fanservice in anime is really annoying, especially when it spills over to shows I actually like.

However after a long hard day of work, I can sometimes appreciate some mindless action and teenage girls. That is all I have in defense of fanservice.

Wild Card test

This is specifically for the people that didn't see the nomination thread. Basically, I'll be doing this for the rest of my threads. Each thread, I will have a maximum number of wild cards (for this one, it's 5). The top 5 (or other amount for another thread) will get a second chance and be in the final vote which will be held sometime after the end of the other polls, which is Wednesday, February 4. I'll probably end up posting it the 7th or the 8th. 

TL;DR, if you want characters added, comment them here.

Edit: forgot to add, I will include up to 5 for *each category*. So 5 girls and 5 guys.

Edit 2: someone just posted a girl for abs, so 5 girls (man boobs will not be counted, sorry :p) and 5 uh... sets of abs?

Edit 3: Forgot to put 2014 anywhere in this thread, only characters from 2014 are valid.

Exciting and creative asspulls do not a good show make.  "Oh no, I'm losing this chess match.  Better seduce the opposing player's queen.  Because that's a thing I can do, apparently."

Not to mention the characters are written poorly.

>> ARTICLE
They have no depth to them.  They're paper thin.  I don't see how it isn't obvious how poorly written they are.  They are literally *just* tropes given shape.
>> ARTICLE
A show being good is completely subjective. You may consider it bad writing and as such think its bad, but thats only because you are comparing it to other things you've experienced. Therefore it is only an opinion. You can only attempt critical evaluation and objectivity, but its completely impossible to actually achieve it. That is because whilst you may have some logical criteria that you use to rate a score, how highly you weight each criteria and score each component is 100% subjective. For example you might consider OP characters like Sora, Lelouch and Light as bad characters because they are tropes to you and it creates no intensity or tension in the plot. However some might consider it good writing because to come up with logical asspulls requires linear like thinking that has to make coherent sense throughout the show. For example Sora against Jibril, took an entire episode for his asspull to play out. Also some people might see depth in the tropes. I know I found depth in the trope characters of Date A Live as it made me think it was a satire, where some others disagree. Read an essay called ["The Author Is Dead"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkQsRVrWM6c) or just watch the youtube link. Its essentially stating that everything you come up with is an opinion based on your own experiences, the original authors intent is pointless and that there is no objectivity in your review of anything. Just because you think its bad, doesn't mean its bad to people like me and /u/Pozsich, and honestly if you think you can be objective when discussing things like this. You're more mentally challenged than myself.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the old "all opinions are equal so let people think what they want" argument.  There's no point in moving forward with that particular discussion if that's how your going to act.

Just got to point out though:

>I know I found depth in the trope characters of Date A Live as it made me think it was a satire, where some others disagree.

Projecting your own misunderstandings onto a show doesn't make that the author's intent for the show.  That's like saying "I considered Frankenstein a comedy" and telling everyone the author's intent for the book was comedy.  It's clearly not.  Speaking of which.

>Its essentially stating that everything you come up with is an opinion based on your own experiences, the **original authors intent is pointless** and that there is no objectivity in your review of anything.

That is straight up bullshit.  The authors intent is *everything* when it comes to a story.  One clear and *huge* hole in that theory is fucking Shakespeare.  What was his intent when he used the words he *created?*  Is it up to us to *interpret* these wholly original combinations and words?  No.  It's the author's duty to tell us his intent.  Saying that an author's work is borrowed from his experiences is only half the truth.  It's up to the author to organize those experiences into something *injected* with his intent.  To guide his reader/viewer along a preordained path *he* set up.  Different interpretations come from readers/viewers straying from that path and finding themselves at the end.  Sure, they made it to the end, but not the way the author intended them to.  If people had no intent towards their creations, we wouldn't create them.  The author's whole purpose when writing a story, or taking a picture, or painting a landscape, is to deliver a message.

In short, don't use a theory as some absolute truth when discussing subjectivity, objectivity, and opinions.  It looks incredibly silly of you.
>> ARTICLE
AH, the old "you are so incredibly misinformed that I pity you" argument. There's no point in moving forward with that particular discussion if that's how you're going to act.

>Projecting your own misunderstandings onto a show doesn't make that the author's intent for the show.

Authors never explicitly state the purpose of a show. With Date A Live it is under the impression of Poe's Law which states that unless the author purposely states that it is satire, it is both satire and not satire. It is up for the individual to decide. 

>One clear and huge hole in that theory is fucking Shakespeare. What was his intent when he used the words he created? Is it up to us to interpret these wholly original combinations and words? No. It's the author's duty to tell us his intent. 

Did you even study English, holy fuck man. Do you even understand why Hamlet is so famous? Its famous because there are so many different interpretations of what his words mean because it resonates a different aspect for different viewers. William Hazlett stated "it is we who are Hamlet", meaning that how we perceive Hamlet and his intentions is correct, because we see ourselves in his character. Source (http://shakespearean.org.uk/ham1-haz.htm):

>Hamlet is a name; his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage of the poet's brain. What then, are they not real? They are as real as our own thoughts. Their reality is in the reader's mind. It is we who are Hamlet. This play has a prophetic truth, which is above that of history. Whoever has become thoughtful and melancholy through his own mishaps or those of others; whoever has borne about with him the clouded brow of reflection, and thought himself "too much i' th' sun;" whoever has seen the golden lamp of day dimmed by envious mists rising in his own breast, and could find in the world before him only a dull blank with nothing left remarkable in it; whoever has known "the pangs of despised love, the insolence of office, or the spurns which patient merit of the unworthy takes;" he who has felt his mind sink within him, and sadness cling to his heart like a malady, who has had his hopes blighted and his youth staggered by the apparitions of strange things; who cannot well be at ease, while he sees evil hovering near him like a spectre; whose powers of action have been eaten up by thought, he to whom the universe seems infinite, and himself nothing; whose bitterness [75] of soul makes him careless of consequences, and who goes to a play as his best resource is to shove off, to a second remove, the evils of life by a mock representation of them - this is the true Hamlet.

Your entire point there is complete and utter bullshit. Texts are famous for having so many different interpretations, none of them are correct and none of them are wrong and none of them are correct. As long as it is correct to the individual that is all that matters. Different viewpoints from different things it what makes a text controversial and famous, however none of these viewpoints are correct. If people could reach an objective truth, then there would be no disagreement on anything. This discussion forum wouldn't even exist as there would be no discussion, just people agreeing with each other.

>In short, don't use a theory as some absolute truth when discussing subjectivity, objectivity, and opinions. It looks incredibly silly of you.

You realize you're doing the exact same thing right? Whilst there is no official name for what you are doing, its the exact same as mine but with the opposite meaning. You have come up with a theory and belief that the authors intent is law, and have argued as such. I have come up with the theory of "The Author Is Dead" and argued that point.

Don't be condescendingly retarded, it looks incredibly silly of you.
>> ARTICLE
> Did you even study English, holy fuck man.

Heh, it's been about 4 or more years since I studied English.  We didn't cover Hamlet for very long either.  In fact, I believe we only watched the Mel Gibson movie.  We did read Julius Caesar, Romeo and Juliet, and Taming of the Shrew.

I actually just found you and Pazzu's discussion a couple days ago about *the exact same damn thing* as we're doing now.

After reading through that and giving your position some more thought, I can see it's merits.  I will say that, when given, an author's intent trumps personal revelation every time.  Take Bradbury for instance.  His intent in writing Fahrenheit 451 was to illustrate mass media's (specifically television's) affect on people and how it makes them less able to digest complex forms of media, like books.  You probably know the story of the college lecture.  One interesting thing is that this certain debacle was possible thanks to personal interpretations.

I *would* like to probe your mind some more on this theory and hear some more of it's counter arguments on some ideas I've come up with in regard to measuring objectivity.  For instance, you mention this:

>thats only because you are comparing it to other things you've experienced.

When comparing opinions does one defer to the other when they have more experience?  That would seem logical, as with any field, you defer to those who have more experience (as I'm doing right now).  And how does this work with art?  Some artists are considered better than others, but if left up to the opinions of the masses, wouldn't it not matter?  I might have more to think on this, but I'll wait for your response.

Now this is in regards character writing specifically.  Say you and I have different opinions on Sora as a character.  I say he's well written, and you say he's poorly written (I think we likely have the opposite of these opinions).  What would happen if we took a character we *both* agreed was well written, and compared him to Sora?  Wouldn't we be able to quantify the characteristics that are well and poorly written between the two?  For instance, backstory, motivations, etc.

Two last things.

>I have come up with the theory of "The Author Is Dead"

[](/pointandlaugh)

Come now, we both know your name isn't Roland Barthes.

>Don't be condescendingly retarded, it looks incredibly silly of you.

Shit, that *was* condescending of me.  Sorry.  That happens when I get into heated discussions. :(
>> ARTICLE
Besides that all this is true, he's not even trying to be unbiased anyways. He says the characters are written poorly because they're thin tropes, but what's the line? Most anime characters are tropes or slight variations on tropes, few have the time to go deeper into the characterization than what is necessary for story progression. I don't see how holding a flaw that is extremely prevalent in anime versus a single one makes it outstandingly bad. Is it a good trait? No, I would agree not. Is it a bad one? No, it's a normal one.                         
Also to your points; we can approach being objective. Some people can come quite close to it. However, you are correct in that it is ultimately impossible to be unbiased in opinions of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Well like the video said every character is based on the authors own experiences and other mediums hes seen. Everything that is ever written is borrowing different components of different shows because nothing is a completely original idea, and has been taken from elsewhere. I agree with you here.

>we can approach being objective. Some people can come quite close to it. However, you are correct in that it is ultimately impossible to be unbiased in opinions of shows.

That is where I disagree with you. Its not that you can approach it, but you can attempt it. You will never get near a point of being objective, but you can attempt some form of a logical criteria. However what you use to deduce that a show is "good" is different from another person. I could say the only shows that are good are the ones that are entertaining. Others could say what makes a show "good" is it has to be pretty. Someone else could say it has to combine those two elements. There is no set standard for "good", its completely subjective. You can only sort out your own subjectiveness and explain your personal criteria for it, but it doesn't mean its any more objective. It is still utterly 100% subjective.

There are no official dakimakura's for Jibril from my knowledge, as well as no figures. On top of that the official dakiakura's are like 4x the price of those ones, and I just don't have the funds to afford something like that.

DFC = 'Disgusting Flat Chest' <3
>> ARTICLE
You are my mortal enemy.
>> ARTICLE
Okey dokey o u o Lol, you really hate big boobs.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so. I would hope not. Because even if I'm not attracted to large breasted women, and don't want to be large breasted. It would just be another kind of body shaming and body policing. 

Women can be large chested and still have wonderful, attractive, wonderful personalities. And being attractive isn't everything.

But I'm not attracted to breasts. And I'm tired of being expected to. 

I'm also tired of people treating large breasts like they're better.
>> ARTICLE
I was just making a joke based around my preferences, man. It seems like you're taking this really seriously..

As for people treating them like they're better - that's just their preference? Like subjectively they are *better* to certain people. 

But there are plenty of people who think flat chests are better... in my experience, more people who think DFC is better exist than people who think bigger boobs are better.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry if I was taking people too seriously.

And sadly, there are people who seem to act like larger breasts are *objectively* better. And try to make arguments from nature as to why. 

The whole flat chest thing is a bit like the fat acceptance movement. There's a pressure for women to be skinny, yet curvy. Not so much flat chested, or plus sized. So maybe some of us, including me, get a bit overzealous about that. Sorry.

A lot of us get loud and proud, because we don't want everyone thinking that "bigger is better". Maybe a bit too loud and proud.
>> ARTICLE
S'okay~

Lol, well, I wouldn't do that, it's silly. Nothing is objectively better, appearance wise anyway. 

I kinda get what you mean... um, I think? If you're skinny but flat chested people tell you to be curvier, and if you're fat but apple-shaped or whatever (aka not curvy), people tell you to be curvier, too. So really only hourglass shapes are being accepted on either end of the spectrum of weight.

I really think an opportunity was missed for Rin Matsuoka in the ab/muscle category.

>> ARTICLE
I'd agree with the Kurapika fight. Where as the atmosphere and animation were amazing for Meruem's fight I wasn't really satisfied with his fighting abilities (however his mental strategy was great). I found Kurapika's fight a lot more entertaining and the fighting mechanics a lot more interesting. 

Shout out to Killuas dad's fight vs Chrollo too.
>> ARTICLE
Don't leave out Killua's grandfather! :P
>> ARTICLE
I really liked Chrollo vs Zeno and Silva, even if it was really short.

At that point in time those sorts of abilities were so far beyond what Killua and Gon were capable of, it really highlighted what higher level Nen users could be capable of.

Hisoka vs Kastro did the same thing at the point in time it happened too.

The setting: a hospital, nowhere in particular. The subject: an old man of indeterminate age, although he is likely over 90 years old.

His body is in complete disarray. By all appearances, it should have failed him years ago. Life support keeps him hanging on, nothing more than a skeleton with an iron lung. His eyes wander lazily about the room, but with a sharpness that belies his mental state. The clock hologram floating over the wall to his right ticks over to 9:59AM. His eyes snap over to the hologram to his left, focusing on the black box in the middle of the screen. The Crunchyroll logo floats lazily near the top of the page, and in the middle of the window, in white block text, a message reads: "Hunter x Hunter (2110) Episode 200 will air in: 00:00:45." His family, seated around him, glances at each other with an air of excitement and uneasiness, as the old man's eyes glint with a fire unlike anything they're ever seen in him. For the next 48 minutes, he lies stock still, transfixed to the hologram as if hypnotized. 10 minutes in he begins crying, and blinks only to clear the tears from his eyes. His family sobs around him as he exhibits an unusual display of emotion. For the last 10 years, his body has been failing, and the doctors have repeatedly emphasized the importance of frequent visits, as the man's body is on the verge of critical failure of several vital organs, along with a host of already-artificial and outdated replacements. But despite it all, he has remained lucid and calm, remaining the rock of the family as he was in his youth, although he has a much less imposing air now.

As the episode ends, the old man moves for the first time. An emaciated hand moves to wipe the tears from his cheeks, and a smile crosses his face for the first time in years. Gon Freecss and Killua Zoldyck stand resolutely, now grown men. A peace sign and a grin from Gon and Killua, a callback to the beginning of the series, is met by the same from the old man in the bed, and his family laughs. The old man sighs with a contentedness and comfort he has not felt in years. There is no room for pain left in his mind. He clears his throat, and forces his now mostly-unused vocal chords to produce sound again. Slowly, he drawls out to the surrounding family members, a phrase kept close to his heart for the majority of his life - "You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because thats where youll find the things more important than what you want." His family nods solemnly, listening closely. He nods at the hologram on the wall, as a handwritten message from Togashi passes across the screen. His family turns to read it, and with a contented smile, the man closes his eyes, never to open them again. *"I made it."* He thinks. *"We all made it."*

You mean the arc that had the announcer spell out literally everything that just happened treating us like we are 5 years old? Or the unnecessary amount of air-time for Pouf's thoughts, we get it you dont like Komugi because she makes the king more human.

"The answer is that they are being true to the manga, where the author has a great amount of boxed narration during this arc. They are simply adapting the author's intent, and I mean literally they pretty much adapted every single narration box. This was the style that Togashi went with since there's not much dialogue and there's a lot of action that he couldn't portray in a limited amount of pages. See the manga from about 260 on for examples.
The beginning of the infiltration, where they run into Yupi while Dragon Dive is going on, is a good example of why the narration is necessary. Togashi is covering events that unfold in the matter of seconds. He even gives a timestamp of how much time passes. There's no way internal dialogue is enough to convey everything that is going on at once (for example, Gon's thought process to keep moving during Dragon Dive in case Meleoron got hit, and Shoot's subsequent emotional reaction)."

Aside that why didn't you enjoy episode 1?

I totally understand where you're coming from. The first couple of arcs are done way too colorful and cheerful, very unlike the first anime series. I have no idea why they decided to do that only to come back to dark-as-hell style later.

> The first couple of arcs are done way too colorful and cheerful, very unlike the first anime series. I have no idea why they decided to do that only to come back to dark-as-hell style later.

That's how those arcs are portrayed in the manga. 

You're correct about the first anime being darker, but in the manga there's an underlying tone of vibrant cheer in the artist style and humor that the 1999 anime neglected.

Togashi tries to strike a balance between cheer and dread, while it may have been a detriment for new viewers, the 2011 adaptation did well in capturing both sides of that duality.
>> ARTICLE
>Togashi tries to strike a balance between cheer and dread,

He didn't manage to do it well in the first couple of arcs then. The first adaptation puts the first few arcs, actually through Greed Island, in alignment, in terms of the comedy/seriousness balance, with the rest of the series. It gave the consistent tone from the get-go and was a good thing to do in an adaptation. It also provided some great world building in terms of the power scale and whatnot.

This is kind of like the FMA adaptations to me. I loved the first one more so than Brotherhood, despite Brotherhood being the more faithful adaptation. When animated, the style needed to be accented by some more dread to push the mix to the perfect point.

We're changing from print to animation here, and things need to be tweaked sometimes.

I cannot stress how good the final arc of this anime is. It's easily the best shonen if not top 2 because at times it feels so much more mature than a shonen would and some of the characters have so much depth.

Komugi and Meruem was all I really cared about throughout this arc.

It was clear to me very early on, and the further I got, the clearer it became, that Meruem was simply beyond human capabilities. I knew no one, not even Netero would be able to beat him in an actual fight. The fact that the hunter association thought that would work - and with, what, nine people involved total? - was ridiculous. I was right, too. It took what was clearly a representation of an atomic bomb to take him out for good. 

To end this single life, the most horrifyingly powerful weapon humanity has created to date was necessary, and the explosion wasn't even enough. It was the poison that finally got to him, and even that took a number of hours. Every scene with Meruem reminded me of his power; power that was so far beyond everything else that was shown, comparison was tantamount to insult. Then he came out of the explosion even more powerful.

And yet, Komugi. This blind, sad, pathetic, ugly little human being beat him. She beat him every singly time at their little game. This child, whose sustained multiple injuries from a pissed off crow, somehow, stood above the pinnacle of an entire species's evolution.

This story was so enthralling to me. It showed what a human being is, and what it means to be one. It showed that strength comes in many forms. Overtime, the ultimate being came to view a creature he would ordinarily have viewed as nothing but subpar livestock as an equal. As a friend. 

I didn't care about Kite. We'd had, what, 9 episodes to get to know him before he died? I didn't care about the hard-boiled octopus who didn't want to shoot the lobster-man. I didn't care about Youpi's budding humanity and respect for Knuckle's (completely idiotic and potentially extinction-causing) "resolve" to endanger the human race for the sake of one dude he looked up to.

I cared about Komugi. I cared about what she meant to Meruem, and what that meant for the human race. And for the non-human race. After Netero died and Meruem couldn't remember her, all I wanted was for them to see each other again. Even before it was revealed he was dying, I just wanted him to find her, so he could protect her, and they could play Gungi again. Somehow, I felt like he deserved that happiness.

I stayed up all night to get to that episode. It was 11:00 AM the next day when I finally got to see this scene. Of course I cried. It was beautiful and touching. It was the perfect ending. It was everything I wanted it to be.

[](/sp)

But there's still a bunch of episodes left. After calming down, I load up the next one and just what the fuck. Now that I've had my heart ripped out, torn in half, and shoved back in, here's 11 brand-fucking-new weirdos who have never even been mentioned before. You get to watch them bicker about politics! What fun!

I'm still a bit emotional after ep 135, but I've now just finished 139 and I just don't care. I'm interested in Killua's sister (who again, had never been mentioned before), but I just don't care about these fucking furries and their political agendas. Yeah, the rat guy seems like a dickface, and oh boy, Ging is there, but after the chimera ant arc, this just seems so petty. The human race was endanger of becoming livestock, but what stopped them wasn't a hand-picked squad of elite warriors, and I like to think it wasn't the weapon of mass destruction, either. The ultra-powerful being wasn't beaten into submission. He was only beaten by one tiny, insignificant human who happened to have a single skill he lacked.  How the hell do you follow a story like that? Why even try?
>> ARTICLE
I'd honestly suggest taking a break. The election arc is both a conclusion arc and a set up for what's to come in the manga. I truly believe and many predict that all the themes of humanity ect you spoke will definitely be revisited. Not to give any spoilers away but the current arc in the manga is definitely set up with the same sort of feeling the chimera ant arc carried and the tone of maturity and over all brutalness is amplified. Its a lot darker than the chimera ant arc already would you believe.

But yeah, I'd strongly suggest just look at the Election arc as a necessary transition for what's to come as it completes the main plots story line and sets up for something incredible.
>> ARTICLE
The manga's still going!?

I followed it years ago, back when the chimera ant arc was still running in the manga. I dropped it because, like I said, it was taking forever, and as I recall, there were *long* breaks between chapters as well. I gave up on it. 

With how intermittently it was updating, I thought the author was trying to wrap it up. It's *still* going, though?

Fuck, I might have to pick it back up now then. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, with this arc predicted to be the biggest yet. The main characters of this arc don't even seem to be Gon and Killua anymore [very mild spoilers for DC arc about main protagonist]( /s "the main characters involve in this arc are pretty much just the adults including Ging, Kurapika and Leorio as well as a few big game players"). I guess you could see this arc being Hunter x Hunter part 2. 

But yeah despite all the hiatuses it is still considered on going. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, that's good to hear, actually.

I was wondering what had happened to Kurapika and Leorio.
>> ARTICLE
I really think that this arc was really all about Meruem and Gon completely flipping to the other side of the spectrum. A monster and a human blurring the definition of what these terms mean, allowing themselves to abandon everything they had; their identity, ego, even lives, to become something they're not. Meruem had Komugi soften him up, and Gon had Neferpitou to make him snap. There just had to be something to make Gon hate Neferpitou, and I think that that's Kite's real function, not to evoke any feeling from the audience or anything.

God I wish I didn't watch this as it aired, man. Chimera ant would have been so much more emotional if there was no 1 week break each episode, and Madhouse tbh kind of stretched it a little thin.

By the way the last arc isn't really Togashi trying to tell a new story, but rather kind of a transitory arc for the next arc, the arc that's still on-going in the manga because Togashi only continues the story when Halley's comet passes the Earth.
>> ARTICLE
I know that Kite's purpose wasn't as a character, but as a plot device, but that's the problem I have. Not only did I not care about Kite, I didn't understand why Gon did. Okay, he killed a bear when Gon was a kid. He saved his life. I get that. But still, he barely knows the guy, and yet he throws his life away to avenge him? It's the entire central focal point of Gon's character arc in this story arc, and I just don't get it. Really weakens the story to me. If Togashi wanted me to believe Gon's reaction, it should have been Killua. I *know* how much Gon loves Killua, because I've seen where it comes from. I would expect at least the kind of emotional reaction to Killua dying.

But then the story wouldn't be able to continue because Killua's dead and Togashi, apparently, wants to keep this going as long as possible, even if the story suffers for it. That sound right? 
>> ARTICLE
I have been thinking about that too why Gon cares about Kite so much.
>> ARTICLE
We're talking about Gon, here. He's friendly and is easily attached to others. He didn't know Killua very well after the exams, but he went out of his way to mess with Illumi, and even go to the Zoldyck residence, get hit multiple times by Canary, and even accept Gotoh's challenge, just to meet Killua. He got pissed when Nobunaga cried over Uvogin because Nobunaga belongs to a bunch of killers yet shows that he actually cares about someone else's life. He even went out of line and *shouted* at Nobunaga *while* they were in the spiders' base. Gon even got pissed when one of the ants called a fallen ally "trash". Gon cares about camaraderie, and even life in general, very much. That, added to the fact that Kite seemed like an invincible mentor to him during those 9 or so episodes that they were together, and what's more is the fact that Gon couldn't do anything to save Kite even though he was right there, caused him to get really angry and try to become stronger.

The point where he snapped was when he realized that everything he did was all for naught, and his hope of saving Kite was just a dream that never had a chance to happen. All the restraint he exercised while Nerferpitou was pleading him to allow Komugi to get healed first, how the monster that Gon imagined Neferpitou to be is now nursing a wounded little girl, caused internal strife within him. He was very very angry, yet he saw a sight that made him confused and not know how to release this anger, so all he had was the hopes of getting Kite all fixed up at least, but even that was taken from him. He felt like he had nothing to lose at that point, and threw everything away, losing himself, even his sanity, and just wanted to bring hell to the one who took everything from him. Personally I feel like it wasn't Kite's death per se that really got to Gon and make him turn into a monster, but the things that surrounded Kite's death.

Also, Togashi obviously has more to add to the story, and killing one of the two main protagonists makes less sense than Gon having a fit over being too weak to protect a friend. It's just that Togashi works at a snail's pace and maybe has a lot of distractions, so he doesn't continue/finish the story. Of course I don't exactly know what Togashi's doing, but I doubt that he really just wants to drag Hunter x Hunter out. Hunter x Hunter goes through arcs and adds/removes characters as each arc starts/finishes, and it's happened many times even before Chimera Ant Arc was reached, so I don't know why you think that introducing new characters is an insult to the Chimera Ant Arc.
>> ARTICLE
That's the point.  The Hunters were NEVER anything beyond petty.  Most Hunters are weak nen-users who think they're hot shit.  The truly strong never cared about the association or its politics.  Hisoka and the Zoldycks, for example. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a brutal arc to be honest. From what happens to Kite all the way until the end. The ending song for that episode makes the entire scene hit that much harder too.  It's pretty emotionally taxing but that's also what makes it fantastic.

So far its the only show that has got me close to tears. It's amazing they made me feel so sad for the villain. One of the best death scenew I've ever seen. One of the best anime I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
One of the few shows that portrays the villains as not being truly heartless.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I think that's a bit of an understatement. It's one of the few shows that *properly* portrays the villains as not being truly heartless.

Meruem and his mental/emotional transformation far eclipse any villains I can recall from Bleach, Naruto, or the all-hailed One Piece.  It's one thing to *tell* the viewer that the villain isn't pure evil with flashbacks showing how they had a tragic upbringing. HxH takes it a step further, by following Meruem in real time through his formative years (Well, not years, but you get the point).

It's one of the few instances of villain humanization that actually felt believable and made sense.
>> ARTICLE
CA wasn't my favourite arc but I have to admit Meruem and Komugi's relationship was amazingly well done. Such a sweet end.

If you had told me at the beginning of the arc I would be that upset at the end, I wouldn't have believed it. I wasn't a huge fan of the beginning of the arc, but I was sorely mistaken.

I rolled my eyes because the bugpeople thing seems to be way overdone in anime. Of course I reserved my judgement because HxH was already awesome before that point.

I also didn't like and never liked Kite. He came out of nowhere and the show tried to retcon him in as Gon's "oh yeah he punched me a long time ago." It was disappointing to see some random dude instead of Ging. I could never get a handle on how strong he was; he seemed like a weakling.

My biggest problem with this arc was it was so stretched out for no reason. It began to feel like DBZ, hell even "Cell" started to eat his androids. It felt like they were milking HxH because of its success instead of pushing through the story like the earlier arcs.

Mad house was pretty lazy, they did exactly like the manga without adjustment, they should've skipped some explaination/dialogue in the manga that the animation can show.

I definitely agree with this. As amazing as the arc was it's not my favorite because of this (Yorknew > Election > Chimera Ant IMO) Although I have to admit, going back and watching it with my friend, I see a lot more of the subtle hints of what's to come which gets points in it's favor in my book. (Gon sounds like such a racist in this arc knowing what I know)
>> ARTICLE
It sucks that you're being downvoted just because you're saying something negative about a good show, but you're absolutely right.

After a while, it started to feel like Togashi was being paid by the word like Charles Dickens, it felt so long. After a while, I started skipping stuff. I get it, the octopus is crying because he couldn't kill the lobster. I don't care about that. I already know how Morel's powers work, you don't have to tell me that. I can *see* that this character is upset, you don't need the narrator to tell me how he feels right now.

I came to hate the narrator after a while. I've taken one Intro to Writing course, and even I know about "show don't tell." I'd really like this arc to get a Kai treatment; take out all the repeated lines, take out the unnecessary shots of the same thing still happening, cut down on the monologues and time-slow, maybe remove the narrator completely except for entirely necessary explanations, and the whole thing would be a lot more enjoyable.

I'm really glad I watched this show after it was done airing, because if I had to wait a week just to see one plot-relevant thing happen in twenty minutes, I'd have been pretty pissed.
>> ARTICLE
I literally just finished watching that arc days ago. Im sure the people downvoting me have some rose-tinted glasses going on. Also if they see 1 episode a week its a lot less painful than watching 5 in a row. 
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree, I also just finished watching this arc for the first time yesterday.

To me the narrator was really jarring, because for a large part of the previous arcs he was largely vacant, only doing the ending voice-over. Then all of a sudden in the Ant arc, he's talking virtually every episode, explaining peoples powers etc. While it's vastly preferable to Bleach's method of someone explaining their power to the person they're trying to kill, it was still a rather strange choice, and probably could have been handled differently, 
>> ARTICLE
That anime was the shit.

In my opinion, a person would have to be lying to claim they were even remotely prepared, having reached that moment properly by watching the series in its entirety.

A touching final scene such as this simply does not exist in traditional shounen; it is the antithesis of comedy.

As far as my amateur viewpoint is concerned, KomugiXMeruem is a masterpiece in tragedy.

Why did komugi stay there and die? Anyone else think that was bs?
>> ARTICLE
The people talking about her and Meruem's relationship aren't wrong. That was the main reason. She loved him, and she didn't want him to go alone. He gave her life meaning, and she didn't want to live in a world where she couldn't play gungi with him anymore.

But if you can't understand that, also consider that she was poisoned. After he told her that he was contagious and that he'd infected her, it was already too late. She couldn't have left and lived anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely not. From the very beginning you knew one thing about Komugi, she played Gungi, that was her whole life, nothing else. All of her worth as a person in her entire life came from the fact that she never lost. After playing so long with Mereum, her life became more than just Gungi, since she also fell in love with him since he basically was the only person to give her any importance as a person. If the only person that gave your life any meaning what so ever died wouldn't you want to die with them so you could be happy till the end?

no?  but I see your point

She stayed with him because she loves him. It's not a romantic love though and like gungi, without meruem she is nothing

It was made clear earlier that Komugi lived solely for gungi; there was nothing else in her life. In Meruem she found the ultimate challenger and the ultimate partner. Their games were the best games that would ever take place and without him there would simply be nothing left for her to fight anymore. He made her feel alive. I like to think they fell in a platonic sort of love.

>> ARTICLE
oh noooo! I just rewatched it a couple days ago come onnnn!!! ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Rewatch it again!
>> ARTICLE
Awesome. I'm really looking forward to getting into the threads and seeing people's thoughts.

Definitely my favorite show.
>> ARTICLE
Cant wait to see the reactions from first-time-viewers, espacially from my personal highlight episodes! I know that the expectations are rather hight, but if it doesnt start out with a bang, dont worry, it will be a lot better.
>> ARTICLE
Never got around watching HxH. Watching it after One Piece really put me off for some reason. So I never ended up watching after episode 2. :/
>> ARTICLE
HxH is way different from the vibe in the 1st arc. It's a dark, sad show with shitloads of amazing characters and bad ass fights.
>> ARTICLE
HxH and One Piece are 2 of my favorite shows. You definitely need to to see the whole series. You will be glad you did.
>> ARTICLE
Good to see this, all-time favorite anime. And maybe while this rewatch-process we might get new manga chapters^^^Hunter^x^Hunter^2021^the^dream
>> ARTICLE
This will finish around my Bday, going to be really hard to stay on schedule during the Chimera Ant arc though!
>> ARTICLE
Just finished season 1. Currently dling season 2. Looks promising.
>> ARTICLE
Well fuck. I guess I'll pause at episode 37 and just start from the beginning for the 7th time.

Man it's going to be hard as hell to keep to the slow pace
>> ARTICLE
Then don't pause at 37 but rewatch the weeks videos before each discussion ;)
>> ARTICLE
*Re-rewatch it again!*
>> ARTICLE
This is probably my favorite anime. It starts slow, but it picks up... so new watchers, just stick with it. It can seem kind of kiddy at times, but it gets more serious, I promise.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched this series while introducing it to new friends, why not do the same with redditors as well? Really excited for this one.

I've seen many of these rewatch threads and almost did the Gintama rewatch (couldn't commit to that long a show).

Hunter x Hunter is my favourite anime so I'll def be giving this whole rewatch thing a shot and see how it goes; hopefully nobody will be an ass and spoil or hint towards things while thinking they are being vague. 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished it yesterday, it was amazing!
>> ARTICLE
I've been putting off watching this show for awhile, looks like it's time to pick it up. Hope it's as good as people claim.
>> ARTICLE
it is

>> ARTICLE
Just finished the 5th episode last night and I'm inclined to believe you, I'm pretty surprised by the quality of the show, even the art style seems to look better than pictures I've seen.Now I gotta wait a week to watch the next episodes. [](#deko-cry)
>> ARTICLE
If you liked the first few episodes that's great. A lot of people drop it because of the first few
>> ARTICLE
Aww really? I thought they were great!
>> ARTICLE
The anime art gets better, its consistent as well. Which is very impressive once you see how bad togashis manga art got at some points.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah! HxH is my favorite anime, i got a lot of my friends into anime because of hunter x hunter, it might start off slow for some people, but dont give up, probably the GOAT anime (IMO)
>> ARTICLE
Im in, its my first time watching it, i wanna know if it deserves all the praise it gets.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if everyone knows, but the first 90+ episodes are available on Netflix. After that you have to resort to CrunchyRoll :( 

For whatever reason, Netflix's epsiodes end after like 10 episodes into the 5th arc. No idea why.

Edit: Netflix USA. Can't speak for any other region's Netflix content.
>> ARTICLE
Lmao I just started it again, great minds like great animes?
>> ARTICLE
This came at a pretty good time, I've had HxH on hold for a while now at episode 84, can't wait to discuss though!
>> ARTICLE
You put it on hold at episode 84?! 

That is hilarious and unfortunate. Pretty much nothing interesting happens in that entire arc until literally episode 85 were the situation changes

I put it on hold because [Spoilers] (/s "Kaito died and that pissed me off for reasons I can't explain")

Ah dude then you did watch 85. My bad I thought you stopped at 84 when it was just about to happen. [Spoilers](/s "yeah I get that. Especially since they show you how adamant and hopeful Gon is that he's alive, I couldnt believe how brutal it was"). As you can imagine, the situation for the boys isn't the same so you should look forward to picking it up again.  
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I'm already about 90 episodes in so I won't be able to take part in this. A shame since it's an excellent show.

Bah, you'll have finished by the time the rewatch starts so you can just watch it all again

Probably actually considering I've watched 36 episodes since last Wednesday...

Weak. I watched the whole thing in 3 days. During finals week.

Crazy theory time, but I think it might actually be a setup for a totally different series set down the line, hence the zero in the title. Totally new cast and narrative but with overarching subplots of old characters and their relationships affecting the politics of the world.

>> ARTICLE
Why would she [ever](/s "betray her squad?") There is zero motivation for this in the anime (dunno bout manga). I mean sure its interesting and a surprise [that](/s "she survived of all the people") but I don't get your reasoning for her being evil.
>> ARTICLE
[Well,](/s "it was the eyepatch and the arm to be honest. The show didn't seem like it was trying to avoid cliches, so I expected her to be one as well when she was first introduced") That was pretty much my whole reasoning. Not because of any actions, because as you said, there wasn't anything pointing to that.
>> ARTICLE
Oh okay, yeah legit, I thought the same of [her](/s "looks"), but the thought was thrown away as soon as she did something in the show. I actually liked her because of [that](/s ", she looked more like a rugged surviving soldier, and with those looks she defied the usual tropes.")

I was thinking about picking that up, does it end differently? because the entire show was oh you like that character [to bad] (/s now he/she/it is dead)

It's not that much better


>> ARTICLE
>does it end differently

Nobody knows, it's ongoing. Pretty much everything around the arc in the desert city is different.
>> ARTICLE
at what point is the Manga right now? I read extremely fast (all of FMA in 3 days). also is Tatsumi and [probably a spoiler] (/s Mine) shown not just hinted at?
>> ARTICLE
What do you mean "at what point"? It's different. Midway through the desert arc te show deviated from the source material.
>> ARTICLE
I meant where is the Manga in relation to the anime episodes like has it passed the [spoiler] (/s Tatsumi being saved part in the anime)  or is it completely different and that didn't even happen?
>> ARTICLE
The manga is the source, there is no point where the anime would be ahead.
>> ARTICLE
did you mean to switch Manga and anime? because the anime is finished. I wanted to know where the Manga is. example the Manga just passed the dessert arc (not sure if true) in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
You don't understand. The deviation point between BS anime original content and the manga' canon story is midway through the desert arc. Up to a certain point the anime was faithful to the manga, but it split to anime original content; this point is the middle of the desert arc.

Except for that bullshit ending...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I am with you there it was back and forth back and forth. I feel it was trying to ape madoka just slightly too much instead of being its own thing.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly, yes. It had a lot of potential, too.
>> ARTICLE
Have you read Sonoko After? It's a short "epilogue" that explains some of the stuff that happened at the end of the series.

At least for me it made the ending much more palatable (not that I had much of a problem with it in the first place).

(Of course, it would have been better if that had been included in the anime, but hopefully there'll be a second season...)

[Monogatari](/s "He still might be dead, may a remind you that the arc we see him in is about Kanbaru interacting with a dead person. Ghosts exist in the this universe and he might really have died.")

At the beginning of Kaiki's narration he said that he would not be telling the truth. That "death" was the only thing that has been contradicted by other narrators (that I've noticed).
>> ARTICLE
What episode are you referring to? I remember at the beginning he explained his story would be of truths and lies. 

And other narrators tell the story as they see it, his death hasn't been contradicted just by his appearance.
>> ARTICLE
I believe Kaiki makes that remark in Hitagi End, Part One. You're right to say that we don't know for sure what has happened in a story like Monogatari. There is a lot of guessing and fan theories, which is part of why I like this series so much!

This is in the manga but I still think it's pretty prevalent since it will be adapted eventually but, [Bleach Spoilers](/s "Byakuya")

I was very surprised when Kubo pussied out and didn't follow through, I wanted this character to die because the death was so well done and would lead to development for other characters. Hell, [](/s "Byakuya's my favorite captain") and I still wanted him to die.
>> ARTICLE
Every time Kubo wants to kill off some characters, the fans have a hissy fit and he has to backtrack.

"[Ok guys](/s "Grimmjow") is dead." "**OMG KUBO HOW DARE YOU BRING EM BACK RITE NAO.**"

I'm pretty sure the exact same thing happened to [](/s "Byakuya"), and there's probably others he decided not to kill off due to fan reactions as well.

Releasing this gate uses up all of the body's energy while making the heart pump at maximum power.

could have at least put clannad spoilers in your tag

I don't know what to do, I have it but people told me it was a spoiler(and down voted me) so I remove it, and now you telling me I should put it back.... I have no idea what to do... :( someone HELP!!!
>> ARTICLE
Too soon.
>> ARTICLE
Why is this downvoted?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not one of the downvoters, but I think it's probably because [](/s "having the name of the show in itself is a big spoiler, like Madoka in other cases. Having a death in Clannad is unexpected for first time viewers, and then with this thread where it's talking about characters that die but don't, it also reveals the character comes back alive in Clannad - which again, is pretty unexpected for a first time watch of AS.")
>> ARTICLE
Ah I see, people should tell him that instead of downvote in this case, but I understand now.
>> ARTICLE
hey you were right, it work... :) good looking out brother.. 

Update: no, you were wrong.. it worked for a bit but now its backfiring.. 
>> ARTICLE
[ ](/s "I have to disagree. It doesn't reveal she comes back to life at all. It reveals she doesn't die. It's readily apparent from even season 1 that Nagisa is extremely frail and even before you reach that point in Clannad Afterstory you know she's going to have severe problems with childbirth. So, someone could reasonably expect her to die and hence wouldn't be spoiled by reading that. Furthermore -- she DOES, in fact, die. She just comes back later on due to magic light ball hax. Even if you read the spoiler, you wouldn't get that.")

Well it's my fault for hovering over it even when it was not named. I already heard that [](/s "Nagisa died") but everyone said that the events that happen after are what make clannad so good and that it wasn't that bad of a spoiler but this [](/s "Probably ruined that impact knowing she comes back to life")

The ~~un~~necessary fanservice scenes in Code Geass (dem Kallen angles and Pizza Butt).

Higurashi no naku Koro ni Kira episode 1.

Show them any scene from that OVA's first episode and they'd be put off.

Gintama can be pretty damn weird at times:

http://i.imgur.com/ggV3Xxl.gif

>> ARTICLE
see, after seeing various people mentioning the show and seeing gifs/pics im tempted to watch this but i dont know if its actually any good, it seems to be a silly comedy which i like but im not sure.
>> ARTICLE
It's a weird one. For one, the characters seem to be mostly aware that they're in an anime which leads to some pretty meta humor.

It also has some of the most well animated fight scenes I've seen in a shounen.

IMO the best thing about Gintama is that it's never what you expect, there genuinely are tear-jerking moments in addition to awesomeness and drama in the arcs. Generally though it's a hilarious comedy that doesn't hold back on any front.

I think the fact that it does comedy so well means that, when they do the action and the drama, it's more effective and more concentrated.

TL;DR: Gintama is top stuff.
>> ARTICLE
but the thread title was to put off someone from watching the show, not turn on. 
>> ARTICLE
I think "not turn them onto the show" probably would have been a better choice of words for that last part, but I have a feeling you're going to stick to it. Hey, if pneumatic drill induced anal tearing is what gets your goose going, I'm not going to argue. Mainly because you're holding a pneumatic drill, and you're wearing a kind of vacant lopsided grin. I don't argue with vacant lopsided grins.

To be honest I think most people don't realize what happens the first time they see it. I know I didn't. 

The second time I watched it I went: "Wait wait, what was that?" and it was only then, after skipping back to double, check that I actually processed that.

I saw it first time, I was watching with my bros, it was very awkward

The scene from Welcome to the NHK! where Satou goes to take panty shots of middle schoolers.

I personally dislike incest a lot in anime, but that particular scene I found hysterical.  It's weird of course, but I could not stop laughing. Context doesn't help either. 
>> ARTICLE
i felt that the context did help to an extent.
>> ARTICLE
I say it doesn't help because it's not really relevant. He's just trying to dissuade her from meeting Kanbaru because she's perverted. So he does something perverted to dissuade her. Kinda defeats the purpose huh? I feel like he could have come up with a better method. That being said, I love the scene so I'm glad they did that, I just don't think the context is that helpful. 
>> ARTICLE
the specific context i meant was that he was deliberately trying to make her uncomfortable (but then he gets a little too much into it) which is part of the reason the scene is so weird.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same way, but when Karen gives Araragi the "ok" and the triumphant music comes on as he goes in to cop a feel, I can't not burst out laughing! 
>> ARTICLE
I saw this scene before I watched the Monogatari series, and ye that was pretty "wtf?". 

Context definitely helps in my opinion since that explains why Koyomi does this in the first place, how he's actually so very noble in defending his sister from the pervy Kanbaru and also why he eventually has issues keeping his own pervy hands off his sister [ ](/s "since he has never seen her dressed as a girl before and therefore, presumably, hasn't seen her as such and therefore haven't been able to build up anti-perv defenses in his mind").

But yeah I also find this scene hilarious, [I love the Monogatari series](http://i.imgur.com/9kHgJK9.gif)[.](http://i.imgur.com/kz5DK4F.gif)

"It tasted so bad it felt like my entire body was being groped" 

Yeah I'd drop that on the spot. Then again I'm not too big on ecchi stuff
>> ARTICLE
My friend apparently hit that line, dropped the show immediately, and bleached it out with some good 'ol Fairy Tail.

Edit: B/c getting downvoted for sharing a friend's experience makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
Totally understandable reason to drop a show for.
>> ARTICLE
I remember seeing a lot of people put off and dropping the anime after the first episode which makes me sad. Ecchi isn't for everyone, so I understand why. Hell, I dropped the manga for a while because of that scene but ended up loving it. (Lots of great characters, toned down ecchi, etc.)

I wish they would've audited or toned down the tentacles scenes, but on the bright side they are staying extremely faithful to the source material, for better or worse.
>> ARTICLE
The recent 70 chapters or so doesn't have much ecchi at all.
>> ARTICLE
Yea I get what you are saying, I am someone who doesn't care if there is ecchi or there isn't, so scenes like this one or other weird innuendo scenes (yes I am talking about the toothbrush scene) don't put me off from watching a certain show.  
  
Staying true to the source material is always a tricky question, but manga are probably a lot easier to adapt than say a VN. For me who doesn't really read manga/LN or play VN's, staying true to the source material is not really required since I just want an enjoyable anime to watch.

i thought she was going to stab somebody with it, but damn [Another] (/s "anything stabbing or slicing a neck makes me feel horrible")

This actually makes me want to watch it.

If you go in expecting some more similar things happening you will probably be satisfied. I really enjoyed (sounds quite messed up to say that I enjoyed watching her die...) this scene and scenes like this is why I watched Another. I was not disappointed.  
 
It is a good anime if you want more of this.

That is just about the worst luck ever.

I think this isn't even possible in the first place if we factor physics, but anime doesn't have those.

Gotta be one of the few moments I've shouted holy fucking shit to an anime that wasn't Boku no Pico.

I loved that scene. Most friends I have showed that to are quite disgusted with it. I don't really understand why. It is just a great scene where a person dies by getting stabbed through the neck with their own umbrella. It is great!

Neck? I thought she was stabbed through her eye.

Did you watch it? It was linked by /u/Neru_Senpai in the very top of this comment thread.

Aww, you can't look away from a scene like that, you'll miss all the fun!

They made a Final Destination anime?

I have seen Another but not Final Destination, but from what I've heard of Final Destination a lot is very similar in Another up until the end part, where it goes kind of crazy. If you like Final Destination I would give it a try at least.
>> ARTICLE
The end of Another is so hilariously over-the-top. By the third time a character said "Send the dead back to death," I just started cheering for them to get axed off.
>> ARTICLE
I remember laughing whenever the teacher said something, because whatever he said was so normal and sane that it sounded hilarious in comparison to everything else.
>> ARTICLE
Did they ever even bother explaining why the hostess lady went ax-crazy?
>> ARTICLE
They did, she and the host dude were grandparents to one of the students, and you know the rule of 2 generations or whatever it was.

Oh, right. Man, that was ridiculously contrived and hilarious.

Well, I can accept that because it lead to more death and murder :)

 That will do.

There are too many such scenes from Kill La Kill, but let's pick the super creepy mother and daughter scene

Just the outfits make it very hard to conince people to watch.

Seriously though, go watch kill LA kill right now, at least the first episode. The show is full of hype and as for the outfits, you stop caring about their skimpy appearance after a while.

You do realise I'm still very inexperienced with the form of media as a whole, right?

Fair enough, what have you seen so far?

All of the ones I've seen all the way through are mecha (and I'm pretty sure once UBW, which is the only non-mecha I've watched even part of so far, finishes I'll watch the rest of it.)

Fate/Zero - [Caster and his master introduction scene.](https://youtu.be/TyzV1SMGKw0)

and also that Valvrape?? scene.

It kinda sets the mood for the rest of the show: mind-crushing utter despair.
>> ARTICLE
That fz scene was one of the highlights of the show for me, although I'm not a big fan of those two characters the way they give that boy hope and kill him at the last second really surprised me and kinda shocked me a bit(was kind of a jump scare). Plus I like dark stuff so that helps.
>> ARTICLE
I've rewatched Fate/Zero a few times, and even when I know it's coming it still manages to jump scare me.
>> ARTICLE
I almost quit the show immediately during Kirei's introduction scene. Still some of the weirdest blocking I've ever seen in... anything. "Okay, you stand there and me and your dad are going to walk around the room in circles at you."

"Why?  When has anybody ever had a conversation like this?"

"Just need to stretch our legs..."

You simply do not understand fabulous elegance like tokiomi does

That Fate/Zero scene completely sold me when I got to it, one of the best scenes of the coolest duo in the show.

I personally love this scene, it's gruesome and kind of off putting but it's an amazing introduction

Possibly the nightclub/crossdress scene in Golden Time.

The first thing that comes to mind would be a couple choice scenes from [Mawaru Penguindrum, namely ](/s "Ringo's attempted rape of Tabuki and Yuri's attempted rape of Ringo. The series is outstanding and one of my favorites, but jesus christ, Ikuhara, that was just...wow.")

How are supposed to explain this to A person?  
>> ARTICLE
What? Girls und Panzer or that scene? GuP is a show about girls and tanks, mostly about the sweet tank battles. It's really well done and an all around good show. That scene is just an extended version of the dance that gets used as a punishment early on (and again later on for other reasons).
>> ARTICLE
That scene, I mean.
>> ARTICLE
Nevermind the tanks, that scene is exactly why I'm going to watch this. 
>> ARTICLE
Come for the moe, stay for the sweet tank battles.

I think actually what surprised me the most in that show was the sound effects. Those were some pretty awesome cannon sounds.
>> ARTICLE
Hanasuka Iroha is one of my favorite slice of life series. I would say that it has potential to even beat K-on! (blasphemy?) in the SoL genre.

However one of the earlier episodes have some really weird bondage scene which seems entirely out of place of the entire series. During all other episodes there is nothing weird going on and it really sucks that an early episode has such a strange fetish built into the story.
>> ARTICLE
That scene was one of the reasons I dropped the show, felt really out of place.
>> ARTICLE
The show as a whole is really great and awesome. That scene really was out of place and weird. If you dropped the show for that scene I suggest you give it a try again and just disregard that scene. The rest of the show do not take a weird direction in any way.
>> ARTICLE
It was only one of the reasons I dropped it. There were things I liked about the show, but in general I was kinda on fence about continuing it - that scene just was sort of last nail in the coffin, I guess.

I might give it another try some day, we'll see :)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I agree, that scene was really uncomfortable. What's even worse, they made a freaking Nendoroid with that scene!

At this point I am too afraid to google what a Nendoroid is.

That's what got me into it, at first I was worried the show was a mahou shoujo moe moe kawaii show meant for lolicons. Then I saw that. I decided to watch MM and I loved it!
>> ARTICLE
Say 
I've always find it weird how everyone raves about madoka magica being traumatising and extreme .
It's not like we don't see worse on a regular basis in other shows .
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more about the element of surprise more than anything. When you know a show is gonna be gore-y or dark, you either go into it expecting just that or stay away. The thing about madoka is that the producers purposefully tried to make it seem like a slice of life-ish magical girl show (a great example of this is the madoka trailer). So people that would normally steer away from these kind of shows, watched it and got an experience they totally did not expect (or probably wanted)
>> ARTICLE
While I agree with you that it's not that bad, the people that find it to be traumatising and extreme find it to be that way due to the nature of the show. They go in expecting cute magical girls and then they get shocked when it wasn't what they expected, and the shock factor makes it feel a lot more extreme than it actually is.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but when everyone says "Go watch Madoka, you're gonna get traumatized!" it kinda kills the unexpected part of it. Happened to too many people I know.
>> ARTICLE
yeh i get kind of annoyed when i see people talking about madoka and saying how dark and sad it is, i thankfully went in blind only expecting a funny show and im glad i didnt know anything beforehand. i feel thats the better way to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
I either do it as a TV exchange (they pick something for me to watch and vice versa), or just go "c'mon man, just try a few eps. I liked it a lot" and hope they trust my taste.

i usually just tell people that i really liked it and they should check it out but even if they dont think its there kind of show just make sure to give it a few episodes

Psycho Pass's dominator gun on extermination mode.

I mean someone going into a title like that would expect some level of graphic violence and gore (maybe from the antagonist), but to see that so early, and kind of unnecessary gore of the exploding victims... 

>> ARTICLE
I tried showing it to a friend and I think the part where they show the woman panicking and screaming as she's about to be executed turned him off more.
>> ARTICLE
for some reason, even though gore usually gets to me, psychopass doesn't, I think it's mainly that I don't mind "painless gore," as in even though it's bloody, the death is instant, and thus no pain, whereas hardcore torture gore in shows like higurashi give me nightmares (it also probably has to do with atmosphere where higurashi tries to establish a horror feeling, whereas horror isn't exactly the atmosphere psychopass has)
>> ARTICLE
That was the 3rd anime I watched, didn't expect them to show the dominator at its fullest so early. It made you understand how hopeless people with high ratings felt knowing they would be blown to bits on sight 0_0
>> ARTICLE
I'll admit I actually put it On Hold because of that and considered dropping it...not exactly someone who can deal with extreme violence (thus I've also avoided Elfen Lied), but I watched Ga-Rei: Zero and survived that so I should watch Psycho Pass soon anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Never bothered me, I guess people react to things differently. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not even that it bothered me, it's just that it seems over the top for no reason at all. If that was all you saw before going into the show it'd be easy to arrive at some misguided preconceptions. If all you had was the name and the extreme gore of the dominators you might think it looks like a show that tries too hard.

How did that beat Ping Pong?!
>> ARTICLE
Because these weren't official vote polls pretty much. Nobody cared since there was like 70 different polls, and this was just one of them. People jsut got tired of voting. 

Although that being said, I did think it was better than ping pong. 
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't make much sense that Meruem won best character development and not best villain. Well, I guess everyone has their own definition of villain (?)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Tatsuya also wasn't the best or best main male character, imo, but I bet he won because /r/OneTrueTatsuya. He was amazing, but not the best.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't even say amazing... ^()^()^()^()^()^()^()^()^(have mercy)
>> ARTICLE
I found him amazing overall, but I recognize he's not the best character and he seems barely three-dimensional.^lol Also, the reason I find him amazing is more for his OPness and actions rather than him being an amazing character, per se. Peco, Smile, Dandy, Joseph Joestar, and Handa-sensei are examples of amazing characters; Tatsuya is not.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but It's Old Joseph. Not the young one.
>> ARTICLE
Isshuukan beat Ping Pong because many more people watched the former than the latter. You can't really expect people to vote for something they haven't seen no matter how loud the *"but it's really, really good!"* voices may be.

Sure, had these awards been done by committee I would fully expect Ping Pong to breeze to victory, but they weren't done that way, they were done by popular vote. Isshuukan winning a popularity contest is fine by me, and it is certainly a hell of a lot better than Mahouka winning the award.

Ping Pong actually came in third, behind Isshuukan Friends and No Game No Life. I think people saw Isshuukan Friends and thought 'Well, NGNL/Ping Pong is my favorite here, but I also liked Isshuukan Friends and I don't think it's going to get many votes...'

Actually, Ishhuukan Friends is my favourite here, slightly beating Ping Pong.

Unless the selection of Tatsuya was meant as a satirical jab at the homogenization of the male MC that particular award seems like a clear example of ballot stuffing.

Other than that the rest of results are, more in less, in line with what you might expect from /r/anime. 

Good job on handling these awards, OP, it may have taken longer  to complete than it takes Goku to go super saiyan but all in all I'd say this was pretty successful. Do you plan to do it again next year?

See, this is why i think only people who have seen both anime can vote for them as this is to compare those anime, no point if people just go with the one they have seen and ignore the other.

As of right now, yes. I'm definitely looking for advice on how to make it shorter though, it dragged on way longer than it needed to in my opinion, but I don't know how I would have made it shorter other than cutting down the number of awards. Any ideas?
>> ARTICLE
Best Abs was a nice idea, but ended up being a joke in the end. It was meant to be a way for people to show their appreciation for male characters in the same way they were appreciating female characters in Best Boobs, but Mikasa Ackerman still made top 3. If male characters can't have an award like that all to themselves the way female characters get Best Boobs, I don't think either should be included. Maybe you could do Most Attractive Male and Most Attractive Female awards instead, but that entire concept is the easiest to jettison if you're looking to cut down.

I don't think there needed to be an award for best fight scene, funniest moment, or best first and last episodes. It's a lot harder to remember that kind of stuff than it is to remember what you felt about an entire series. I remember seeing the voting threads for those and going "well okay guess I can't participate tonight."

As has been mentioned, OP/ED and OP/ED Song don't need to be separate. People like me who don't watch OPs/EDs but listen to the song will just vote for the song in the OP/ED thread, and people who watch the OP/ED will vote for song + visuals. I honestly had no idea there was a separate thread exclusively for the songs.

As has also been mentioned, I don't think each genre needs its own award. I remember voting on some of them, but then not really caring about those results when the results were revealed.
>> ARTICLE
I'd disagree on the Best Fight Scene reasoning if no other reason than because the poll thread included video links.
>> ARTICLE
Fewer awards, for a start; no pointless stuff like 'best boobs', not much point in having separate awards for both OP/ED and *OP/ED song*, an award for every genre is unnecessary.

Voting periods were too long, most people are going to vote when they first see the thread and if you could somehow convince the mods to sticky 'X Award voting thread' onto the top of the sub for, say, 48 hours, that should be enough time for the majority of users to vote.

Finally, you didn't need a separate thread for every award. Should have just done it all in one, big, fancy, post. 
>> ARTICLE
>no pointless stuff like 'best boobs'

Pointless? HERESY! If /r/anime can't have one communal favorite pair of boobs to look back on and say "Yep, those were *the tits* of 2014", what can we have?
>> ARTICLE
> Fewer awards, for a start; no pointless stuff like 'best boobs', not much point in having separate awards for both OP/ED and OP/ED song, an award for every genre is unnecessary.

I agree on the difference between OP/ED and OP/ED songs. I didn't really think that through. As for best boobs, all of the categories were voted on by the community. Even if I just included the top 10, best boobs would have made it in. Not that I necessarily agree with the inclusion of it.

>You didn't need a separate thread for every award. Should have just done it all in one, big, fancy post.

With the detail I put into the threads, there would have to be multiple threads. I could definitely tone that down though, or just do that for the finals.
>> ARTICLE
About Best Boobs, if it were me I would have just ignored* the people calling for it. It's not like you *have* to listen to everyone's opinion, and I would wager that a decent portion of the people who voted to include Best Boobs were the same people who turned around and mocked the decision for cheap karma. 

Of course, it is a community event and so getting the /r/anime community involved is key, but as the man with the plan you shouldn't shy away from acting a little dictatorial when the going calls for it. 


edit- 'ignored' isn't right... more like, *politely explained* why Best Boobs would not be included in the /r/anime awards. 
>> ARTICLE
Another thing is that the best boobs thread was actually by far the most popular of the entire event. It had over 2000 upvotes, and the next poll thread had like 96. Idk.. we'll see for next year. I'm probably going to do the same thing to get people to submit their own categories then vote on those.

I would suggest that you choose 80 percent or so of the awards beforehand and then have a few community nominated awards.  That way you may be able to organize threads and scheduling in advance, take some burden off of yourself and allow the timeline for the awards to run quicker.

That's a good fight but not good enough to compete with Meruem vs Netero, in my opinion that's one of the best fights period, not just this year.
>> ARTICLE
>that's one of the best fights period, not just this year.

lol

Just watched that and I disagree completely. For one that fight was like half an hour, most of it being talking and monologues, so from the get go it falls into a lot of shounen bullshit. Secondly the animation wasnt exactly the best either, it wasnt bad dont get me wrong but it wasnt the best animation ever (Which it should be considering how you're saying its the best fight in all of anime.), Again can I bring up the monologue issue? Like seriously, atleast 20 minutes of that fight was monologue and the fight was 30 minutes thats fucking insane. 

I mean the fight wasnt bad, but if anything I would put it slightly below Naruto vs Sasuke (Naruto Part 1) and the main drawbacks from both of those fights were the constant monologues, the thing is the Naruto vs Sasuke fight had very great animation especially for the time, whereas the animation in HxH isnt exactly anything to speak of. And I know i'm just going to get downvoted for saying this as I do if I say anything that claims that HxH isnt THE BEST thing since sliced bread, but you're really overselling it by calling most things in it "The best in all of anime". This poll proved nothing as it was one giant popularity contest, and we saw that at its finest during the spring poll.
>> ARTICLE
Obviously if you only see the fight, it won't be as impactful. That's what makes it so great, that it actually has depth to it and it's not just eye candy. Maybe lancer vs archer could have won best animated fight, but best fight? Pls that was so shallow it hurt.
>> ARTICLE
I can see what you mean, whenever I think of best fight I usually go straight to animation rather than reasons behind it or such.
>> ARTICLE
Some important factors in a fight: The emotional/significance impact, the build-up, the importance and the development of the characters fighting along with animation and quality of the fight. The Hunter x Hunter fight excels in the areas of build up, character development and significance along with having some nice animation and quality (not the best in quality and animation). But the build up and significance of this fight if what puts it above the others. The shear hype for this fight along with its importance is what puts it over the edge as a fight that will live through the ages. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, build up and hype I will give it that over some of the other fights in 2014. 
>> ARTICLE
Completely disagree but I'll upvote for it being your opinion and you shouldn't be rained in downvotes cause of it.

The animation isn't even bad, far from it, to say Naruto did it better is a huge insult, not that Naruto was bad but that fight is almost ten years old, there's no way that animation is better.

As for the constant talking and inner monologues, Hunter x Hunter always has the monologues, it explains their strategies and thought process and I personally love them but I understand someone not. But for the tlaking, the fights circumstances were that Meruem had to defeat Netero without killing him so he tried a lot to talk Netero into surrendering, it was absolutely necessary.

And finally, to clear things up, I didn't say it was the best, just one of them, I don't even know if I think that's the best fight in HxH. 
>> ARTICLE
> The animation isn't even bad, far from it, to say Naruto did it better is a huge insult, not that Naruto was bad but that fight is almost ten years old, there's no way that animation is better.

Age shouldnt be a factor in it, personally I think [this](http://youtu.be/1yF25q4OL_4?t=7m50s) has better animation than Mereum vs Netero. It might just be my preference to Studio Pierrot when they do fights like this, but it looks a lot more smoother and the choreography was also better IMO. Not to mention I think that the animation for that fight was ahead of its time, and was my favorite for quite awhile.

>As for the constant talking and inner monologues, Hunter x Hunter always has the monologues, it explains their strategies and thought process and I personally love them but I understand someone not.

I honestly wouldnt mind it too much if the monologue wasnt like 20 minutes throughout the entire fight. If it was a short fight I could forgive it very easily, I mean after all I like [Kiritsugu vs Kirei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSgXOZKSt20) from Fate/Zero quite a bit despite the monologue and strategies. I wouldnt place it in my top 10 fights because of animation and the monologue is indeed a bit of a problem, but it doesnt take up 20 minutes which is why its forgivable.

> But for the tlaking, the fights circumstances were that Meruem had to defeat Netero without killing him so he tried a lot to talk Netero into surrendering, it was absolutely necessary.

I think they could find some other ways around that, rather than having them talk for 20 minutes. And that still is no excuse for the battle itself having the monologue, it may make sense in context of the story but we're talking about the battle itself here.

>And finally, to clear things up, I didn't say it was the best, just one of them, I don't even know if I think that's the best fight in HxH.

Even then I disagree quite a bit, I wouldnt place it near one of the best as there are many many many fights that are leagues above that. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I realize the difference between us now. When we see Fight Scene, you focus on the Fight part while I focus on the Scene part.

While I agree as just a fight, Meruem vs Netero isn't amazing but it's all the components to it that are involved in the actual storyline and character development.  Both are valid ways of seeing it but for me personally, I care more about what the fight does for the anime and what it means as a whole and not if it looks awesome in an AMV (Best way I can thing of describing it at the moment)
>> ARTICLE
Meh, I guess so. I never really thought of fight scenes that way, but not to be super pedantic but the award was suppose to be "Best Fight/Battle". And if we go by how your outlook i'd still say Fate/Stay Night wins, but instead of Archer vs Lancer I would say Archer vs Caster as the entire point of that fight was to outline the similarities of Archer and Shirou while at the same time show their main difference. It becomes more apparent why thats extremely important in S2, but nonetheless its a very big piece of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Whether or not the Caster vs Archer fight's character dynamics are important in the second season or the quality of the animation/choreography, or even how it was done in the LN, that episode is probably where the writing hit its lowest point. Just as anime watcher, I thought that episode sucked for the most part.
>> ARTICLE
Why do you think it sucked?
>> ARTICLE
I decided to rewatch the Archer + Shirou bits of the episode to see if I still felt the same way and although it didn't annoy as much as it did before 
(maybe I was in a worse mood last time), it had all the problems I remember.

The interactions between Archer and Shirou just come off as irrational and melodramatic, more so given the dire circumstances they are in the time (being between a wounded Caster and nearby Assassin). What they were saying was little more than a bunch of trumped up psuedo-philosophy and I really struggled to grasp what if anything Shirou would have as a basis for the levels of resentment he felt towards Archer (and vice-versa). Everything about it just seemed really childish, both the characters and writer.

Barakamon is a quiet slice of life show, I liked the last episode but idk, I don't think it was any better than the rest of the series (which was fantastic). I'm surprised TG or Aldnoah didn't win.

well best male character and best male main character are basically the same, because usually the Mc is the one with the most fans, and Tatsuya is literally a god


>> ARTICLE
the circlejerk around him doesnt negate that he is a bad character though. But I guess thats the problem with these votings. It remains a popularity/prominence thing.
>> ARTICLE
I think you need to realize that "Tatsuya is a bad character", although a reasonable and justifiable stance, is simply your own subjective opinion, and the opinion contrary to yours, is also a reasonable and justifiable subjective opinion, all based on personal values and biases on what constitutes a "good character"

Polls such as these should always be treated as a popularity contest, or simply, a contest in which the prominent values and opinions would win, and we should not be thinking that our opinion is "correct" or "superior"
>> ARTICLE
Not all opinions are equal, and they sure as hell aren't all valid, even in art. Pretty sure if you talk to anyone who has a good understanding of tropes in anime will tell you the same thing about the character, and all good things I've heard about him have been from people who don't understand those tropes or haven't seen them before until now. 

I will happily concede to being wrong if you could point me in the direction of a well written character analysis of tatsuya that ends with the conclusion of him being a great character. This isn't a joke or anything, and I'm not trying to come off as an ass, I'm very serious. I've seen many posts detailing why someone absolutely loved a show that I didn't, and giving me a new appreciation for the show, so if the same can be done for this show, all the better. But good luck honestly finding a well thought out post on why mahouka and specifically tatsuya is a good character. 

I realize you aren't defending the character, I just needed to say that. I feel like a lot of people have this idea that everything is subjective and there is no right and wrong or whatever and I just don't agree. That's basically saying there are people out there who think that a character that showed up in one episode of gintama have as much character as Shinji ikari and its all an opinion. No, it fucking isn't. 
>> ARTICLE
i think you misunderstood the position i am taking, but since i have little intention in going into the finer philosophical details and technicalities in regards to "opinions", and i do believe we both do not want to turn this into a discussion on academics, i will simply reiterate my stance and see if you agree or disagree:

"there is no "objective standard" in which one evaluates anime characters, and every judgement of whether or not a character is "good" or "bad" is based on our own subjective interpretations and personal values and biases. therefore, since we cannot be truly "correct", we should have the attitude of being fair and tolerant towards different opinions, and understand their position by respecting the conclusion they made, engage in a conversation by discussing ideas and arguments instead of who is right or wrong, and ultimately embrace our differences"

i just think you have misunderstood me greatly, as my stance was never, nor did i claim, that "all opinions are equal" or that "everything is subjective", nor are the two even relevant to the position i am taking. although, if it was my mistake of being unclear, i apologize

the strength of an opinion lies with its reasoning and logic, not its conclusion, and there can be right or wrong when it comes to "objective values". however, my reply was to simply illustrate, albeit maybe poorly, that "Tatsuya is a bad character" is not an objective truth, but a subjective interpretation, and should be treated and discussed as such, hence whether or not a person agrees, should be based on the arguments presented, instead of treating it as a factual truth and shoving it down other people's throat. this attitude of superiority that strives towards a false understanding of "objectivity", is very unhealthy

hopefully this long-winded rant clears up any misunderstanding we might have
>> ARTICLE
Of course I agree with you there. Discussing ...anything really will always be subjective and if it`s about fiction or rather discussing how good certain aspects of said fiction are this is even more true. Sorry If I didnt made this fact clear enough in my original statement or behaved somewhat snobbish/ elitist.

On the other hand we`re nevertheless still spending our time here discussing these things and saying "all this is subjective anyways so why bother arguing about it" would just be boring and would make most of the discussion on here pointless.

With that in mind I`ll keep gladly defending my opinion against arguments that may br brought up by the other side or maybe be convinced by them who knows.

Oh and if you want explanation for this specific case (as to why *I* consider Tatsuya a bad character) I wrote something about that above although now that I look over it again it kind of resembles a rant and not a objective argument too so theres that.
>> ARTICLE
no no, i should apologize if you think i sound somewhat condescending, i just have a certain bias when it comes to the objectivity and subjectivity of opinions. 

i personally think that we should embrace our personal values and biases when discussing and analyzing anime, throw the obsession with objectivity out the window and let our subjectivity clash; we should be fair and tolerant when discussion opinions, and i find the attitude of striving for the inconsistent standards of objectivity, rather unhealthy 

if i misunderstood you, i'm sorry 

and i do not have any intention of disagreeing with your opinion that "Tatsuya is a bad character", it is a completely reasonable opinion, i was just being oddly sensitive about some words
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure I voted for tatsuya for the lolz, as did many people I'm sure. 
>> ARTICLE
what didnt you like about him?
>> ARTICLE
Well the fact that he is indeed invincible might be appealing for some but i personally think that it just makes for a really boring experience without any suspense.

Furthermore correct me if I just missed something but he was just a really plain and undefined so to say "self-insert" character who had no particular traits beside being an OP yet modest cool and serious yet sometimes edgy person with a (again in my opinion) implied incest relationship to his sister whos actually the said to be the second amazing person on the planet besides him. He seemes to be crafted after the "Kirito recipe of success" if you know what I mean and I personally just dont think that makes for a good character.

I think to sum up my opinion and to reverse your question: There just isnt anything to like about his character is there?
>> ARTICLE
well at the start of the series you dont know that hes op, at the start hes just a smart high school student that is not particularly good at magic

what i liked about his character is that even if hes smart, handsome, strong he was not born with all this characteristics [spoiler dont know if its completely covert in the anime ](/s "hes smart because when he was 6 yo they did a experiment on him and replaced a part of his brain") and the fact that he doesnt fall in love with other girls because hes unable to have strong emotions, at least they tried to explain it instead of having a dense MC just for the sake of it

i too am not a fan of incest but this for me is the most easy too swallow with the onii-sama saved my life and had a miserable childhood part, but i didnt watch too many animes with incest(monogatari and chaika where it wasnt actually incest) so maybe for others the incest part looks bad

i didnt see SAO so i dont know if tatsuya resembles kirito, but i liked tatsuya because of the backstory and made me read the manga to find more about it(planning to read the LN too when i have the chance)
>> ARTICLE
>well at the start of the series you dont know that hes op, at the start hes just a smart high school student that is not particularly good at magic

Explain the prologue where he blows up shit with his power armor and magic.

Even your spoiler serves as proof that Tatsuya *must* be a special goddamn snowflake - [he can't](/s "innanely use magic properly, so let's turn him into a superweapon with no emotions using a lobotomy while we're at it.")

Also, the LN says he's average-looking, so logically all the girls in the show swoon over him.
>> ARTICLE
Well he is a special snowflake, hes from one of the 10 clans so the fact that magic is genetic and from hes clan was one of the most powerful mages. So because he was practically useles they experimented on him.

If there is one thing that these polls showed me is that more people really should watch Ping Pong the Animation.

I love character driven series and Ping Pong has fantastic characters and some of the best character development I've ever seen, its in my top 3 series.

I didn't vote for this. Probably one of the anime shows I enjoyed the least last year. Potential? Yes. Certainly had the hype. But as far as I'm concerned the show was a train wreck.

I had fun with it. I am a little bit curious about the wildcards, though. Is it really fair that some things get to bypass the elimination round? Did any wildcards win?
>> ARTICLE
The thing is that there was no elimination round. The wild cards were brought in before the finals and there was only two rounds.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen a lot of these, guess I'll be adding to my already growing PTW list
>> ARTICLE
If it's not too much work, maybe have 2 or 3 polls posted daily instead of the usual 1. Or you could make rounds of elimination before going into voting, or any other method that serves to reduce the final number of candidates for the award.

It's difficult to please everyone, so I guess you should just do it the way you think it's fair enough and easier to you.

There's no Ping Pong, at all. This makes me sad :(
>> ARTICLE
Zankyou no Terror and F/SN in the tops... What is wrong with you people?
>> ARTICLE
Isshuukan friends my ass
>> ARTICLE
ping pong didn't get shit what the hell
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong came in second for Aoty. It also came in last place for 'best sports anime' which doesn't make sense to me.
>> ARTICLE
The animation is very key with the fluidity and quality along with the characters competing. The animation prob killed it though. I don't think kuroko should have one with the amount of abnoxious stills and how few good movement sequences there actually are, but I do think the animation is key.
>> ARTICLE
Well I think many consider its strong point to be character development and not really the ping pong(/sport) itself as youre probably aware. Last place does still not make much sense though.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, yes, we all know you all want Ping Pong in it.

But aside from that. Nagi no Asukara as best romance when other better options were there (Ao Haru Ride, Golden Time,...). It's discussable. I don't know either. Choosing for a True Romance over that whole thing in NagiAsu, maybe, maybe not.

Best ED Zankyou no Terror? That just won because people grouped it with the soundtrack, nothing else.

If I took a closer look at some other categories I could come up with more. But it looks like it became popular with a certain demography and only those paid attention to it. I didn't even realize this was going between all the other stuff there was.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka, Steins;Gate and Shinsekai Yori.

I thought about Kill la Kill, but watching that as it aired was way too special of an experience to wanna forget it.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly the same ones for me. All three of those are absolutely amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill was the first series I watched from when it aired to when it finished. Thursday nights were my absolute favourite. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, I dropped Kill la Kill after ep1 aired, watched it 6 months after it finished and it's part of my favorites. My 5 min rule fucks me over sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
That rule can't really be applied to anything anymore. You have to give everything a chance, I guess.
I've dropped and missed out on so much stuff because I judged it for its face value.
>> ARTICLE
I'll have to try out Madoka, heard lots of good things about it
>> ARTICLE
Try not to look up anything about it, it's best to go in as blind as possible.
>> ARTICLE
I found it to be pretty boring tbh, don't feel let down if it's not your cup of tea, it was definitely too overhyped for what I got out of it.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped 4 times throughout but continued as I had nothing to do.last summer.
>> ARTICLE
It has its' moments, but it's definitely not the shining beauty of anime some folks make it out to be in my opinion.

That said, I enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
You really should. It's an amazing show and I'll never forget the insane feeling of awe I had when watching it for the first time.
>> ARTICLE
And you need to watch it before someone spoils it.  I had the first act slightly ruined by spoilers and wish I could have seen it clean.
>> ARTICLE
FMA: Brotherhood
Clannad/Clannad AS (kinda a package deal)
Steins;gate

>> ARTICLE
Would be my picks as well! I pretty much had the chance to rewatch Steins;Gate though, as I had forgotten most of the things from when I first watched 2 years ago.
>> ARTICLE
This would be my three as well. Steins;Gate was gripping, FMA was an adventure, and Clannad gave me the realist feels I've gotten from this medium.
>> ARTICLE
I tried rewatching Clannad last summer.  I had to stop when I got to AS because I knew what feels I would be experiencing.  And I knew I didn't want to feel those feels till all the way through.   (I did not have time to shotgun the season).


>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero, Steins;Gate and Toradora. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I might be one of the few people who wouldn't really want to experience Fate/Zero for the first time again. Let me explain. My favorite part from the LN was the Banquet of Kings and I was eagerly looking forward to it being animated. Then in the original cut, they cut out a some of it to make it more stilted, a lot of the shots were QUALITY and the overall animation was lacking. I was quite disappointed. Thank god they fixed a lot of it in the Blurays and gave that episode the time and effort it deserved.

EDIT: Actually now that I think about it considering the literal premise of this discussion, that might put it at the top of the list to wipe my memory and experience it again.
>> ARTICLE
I started Toradora today! This makes me feel lucky.
>> ARTICLE
It's a really awesome show, you'll probably love it if you like slice-of-life shows.
>> ARTICLE
If you're into romance shows, you'll most likely love it. 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished episode 2, and I already love it. I freaked out when [](/s "Taiga and Ryuuji were kicking the pole together. They make the cutest couple ever!") 
>> ARTICLE
ahhhh, I always love when people get to experience Toradora for the first time. One of my favorite shows ever. The Christmas Reddit Rewatch was a blast. 
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact: Before today I thought Toradora had a full-length second season called Toradora Christmas Club.
>> ARTICLE
I would kill for that to be true.

A Toradora After Story
>> ARTICLE
Thats actually hilarious 
>> ARTICLE
This isn't funny. I was in the same boat. 

I was horribly depressed when I realized how stupid I was after searching frantically for info on a second season. That shows still giving me ups and downs...
>> ARTICLE
Apparently I need to watch Clannad.
>> ARTICLE
What's so special about Clannad?
>> ARTICLE
Very realistic protagonist who has quite an unfortunate life. His mother died and his father is an alcoholic. At some points he meets some some people and becomes friends with them.

There's a lot of building until you get to the climax, which makes you very attached to the character.

The drama in Clannad: AS is considered to be extremely sad and it hits even harder when you're attached to the characters. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat as you haha

Nagi no Asukara! I watched it while it was airing and the love hexagon thing really had me wondering who would get with who. Loved that feeling!

Railgun and Index so the wait is slightly shorter for season 3...

Little busters so I can bawl my eyes out


>> ARTICLE
Death Note, Steins Gate, and probably Monster.
>> ARTICLE
- AnoHana, cause the feels

- Steins;Gate, cause it's my favourite and I would like to repeat the first time experience

- Madoka Magica, forgetting everything!! I would like to experiment it without knowledge about its dark side
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann, Madoka, and, actually, Dragon Ball Z. I accidently had TTGL and Madoka spoiled for me before I'd seen them, so while I watched both and loved them, I would love to be able to watch them through a completely fresh perspective and actually know what my reaction would be to them. DBZ has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. For me, the iconic scenes in it are like Darth Vader's reveal at the end of ESB, just something I've always kind of known. I would love to go back and experience scenes like the x4 Kamehameha, the first Super Saiyan transformation, or Gohan killing Cell for the first time again.

Replace Anohano with Toradora for me. Although I did like Anohano quite a bit. Your lie in April is definitely one of my top shows.
>> ARTICLE
I see you enjoy crying. Haha but yeah I agree with you on these

I'm with you here buddy, with Stein's; Gate instead of Clannad. Steins;Gate was actually more of a roller coaster for me and Clannad personally didn't hit me as hard.

* The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya

I'm rewatching the last one recently and I'm remembering how awesome it felt to watch it for the first time in broadcast order.

Honestly, probably none. I find rewatching shows that I've already completed to be really enjoyable, because I can either precisely determine what I like most about them or realize that they weren't as great as I thought they were. The former adds to my enjoyment of the series, while the latter tempers it while still allowing myself to revisit what I enjoyed about the show. Though I usually wait a while before rewatching any show.

But if I phrase this question as what my three favorite shows are, then I'd say Madoka Magica, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Legend of the Galactic Heroes. They're the shows that I've watched that I think best exemplify what this medium has to offer.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same way. Doing a second or third rewatch was interesting cause you can pay attention to other things you did not catch in the previous times.
>> ARTICLE
* Gosick, ohhhhhhhh Gosick, the things I would do to live it again.

* Toradora, please let me do this again please.

* Haruhi Suzumiya, I think I'll just go watch it all again ( ~~even endless eight~~ ), k bye.

Yeah that moment when I was a lot younger and everything in Higurashi went to fuck and I shit myself

I wouldn't put myself through the post-anime depression that came with Steins;Gate or Clannad again, even though they are my two favorite shows.

I guess I would pick Nichijou, Baccano!, and TTGL so I would feel happy afterwards.

Well, I'd want to erase my memories of Toradora, but only if I could remember that I liked it so much.

But more importantly, would want to forget all the endings to series' i didn't watch that have been spoiled or hinted at to me here or on the internet.

Like the other day in a comment about some romance anime that i won't name, i saw a bit that went "And then she [](/s "------")" or something, and literally the only word that can fit in a space that big is dies. It's like, seriously T-T. The genre was romance so "she" is probably the main love interest too. Even if she isn't or the word isn't dies I'm still gonna be bugged by this throughout watching.

Still gonna watch anyway but if i didn't have that happen then things would be better. Used to not care for spoilers but once i had a week without internet and i used that time to watch Code Geass and the ending was so amazing, I'm a convert now. On the anti spoilers squad.

I don't know if I would want to erase my memories of any of my favorite anime since there's a lot of emotional context that goes along with them that have shaped me, my tastes and have become the strongest touch stones in my memory. There is maybe one exception though and that's Evangelion (NGE to be specific). I watched it too early (I was 14) and because of that my relationship with it was rather complicated and had an arc of its own. I went from blindly loving it without really understanding it to hating it because I became mature enough to realize I didn't understand it (but not mature enough to accept it) to ambivalent because I refused to rewatch it for years and begrudgingly admitted to myself that there were good qualities to it and eventually I found myself here. Having rewatched it for the first time in 5 years, no longer feeling too overwhelmed by it and loving just about every bit of it. Part of me wishes I could've just waited until I was maybe 17 at least so I could've gotten to the end result, but then again the journey I took getting there is kind of memorable and endearing in its own right as it sort of gives a narrative to my growth as a person, critic and creator.

Clannad(both series), White Album 2 and Mawaru Penguindrum.

Angel Beats, then Angel Beats again, and Angel Beats again for the third time.  God damn I love that show.
>> ARTICLE
The list would be different if it weren't limited to Anime (vn, ln, wn) but to answer the question as stated: Amagi Brilliant Park, Baby Steps, and Kill la Kill.
>> ARTICLE
* Clannad AS
* Toradora
* Gosick

Although I'd never find Gosick again if I were to forget it. ;_;

ITT: Steins;Gate
>> ARTICLE
- Shin Sekai Yori
- Higurashi no Naku Koro ni + Kai
- Clannad + After Story

There's a bunch of honorable mentions though I won't go into them.
>> ARTICLE
So many people naming Clannad. Is that show really that good guys?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. But to appreciate it, you have to watch both seasons. The meaning and power of the second season (Clannad: After Story) is in the first season. The first isn't the best but hang on.

You won't regret it.
>> ARTICLE
Gotta watch madoka once i finish TTGL, shit I always thought it was a majokko like pretty cure.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate, White Album 2, Kaiji! If only I could rediscover these like the first time I watched them... I could also say Death Note, since I've watched it so many times that I ended up disgusted.
>> ARTICLE
Samurai Champloo - The music, characters and finding out all the little bits of backstory was too special a combination.

Steins;Gate - The slow burn start is too good, fantastic setting and characters. Really felt memorable.

Highschool of the Dead - This would be so i don't remember it and have enough damn sense not to watch it again.
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B because its my favourite of all time, TTGL because it was my very first anime and i absolutely adored it and lastly id erase Clannad (both seasons), want the feels to screw me again!
>> ARTICLE
Clannad/Clannad AS - So i can be depressed as shit one more time. 
Gintama - So i can recover from the depression. 
Ghost in the Shell - Because is Ghost in the Shell.

Monogatari Series, the first anime series that got me totally hooked on the first 10 seconds.

Shinsekai Yori, episode 10(not too sure) with the [spoilers](s/ karma demon)

Jigoku Shoujo, one of my favorite shows.

Nanoha

Minami-ke

Death Note, Code Geass, Shinsekai Yori.

one piece, hunter x hunter and kingdom

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Amagami SS, and Mirai Nikki

Hyouka, Psycho-pass, and  Stein;s gate !
>> ARTICLE
* Shigatsu
* Madoka
* Katanagatari
* Psycho-Pass (just wanted to list it)


Like someone above me mentioned, Kill La Kill could make this list as well, if not for how good of an experience it was to sit aboard the hype train when it aired. Also, it is the only series that I have rewatched over five times, and I love it as much every single time.
>> ARTICLE
Zetsuen No Tempest

Psycho-Pass

Hard chice but : White Album 2 (or Nagi No Asukara)


If given the chance I would forget about everything I watched to watch all of them again, even those I disliked.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad, Toaru majutsu no index, Toradora.
>> ARTICLE
* Gintama
* HxH
* Monogatari series
And with this i would be pretty happy for quite some time :D
>> ARTICLE
Grave of the Fireflies x3.

If movies don't count then Code Geass, Steins Gate and Kuroko no Basket.
>> ARTICLE
I'm torn to be honest. On one hand, Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon is one hell of a ride the first time through, but it also is on subsequent watchings. Also, there's a lot of extra knowledge about its universe and I'd probably forget every book of it i've read so far, which is a lot to read again.

I love knowing about Horizon, but I'd also love being able to relive it again.
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion
Evangelion
Evangelion

It is the story that repeats, after all.
>> ARTICLE
Fooly Cooly, Code Geass, and Inuyasha. 
>> ARTICLE
It's tough but I'll go with:

Your lie in april: I din't cry in the end and I'm ashamed of it because it's my favorite Drama&Romance anime/manga ever.

Code Geass: the plot was one of the best ever.

For the third, I don't really. Psycho-Pass (best anime I've seen) or Bakuman (favorite Slice-of-Life).
>> ARTICLE
LoL I would earse the same anime 3 times because why would I watch anything else apart from my top 1 anime??

btw it would be

-ef

-Clannad

-Toradora
>> ARTICLE
I actually don't get all the Angel Beats! ones. I mean it sure is good somehow but I think if you would watch it again with more general "anime-knowledge" it would not be as good as it would be when watched as first Anime or something. Looking back I'm really confused with Angel Beats! because it was actually way to fast for feels. 


So Angel Beats! isn't the way for me to go but I somehow can understand everyone who mentions it.
My List would probably be


1. Clannad (+AS)
2. Kimi no Uso
3. TBD because there is a shitload of Anime which could go here.
>> ARTICLE
* The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya - because I watched it fragmented on local TV, it's kinda hard to watch after that

* Plastic Memories - to cry again

* Comet Lucifer - to forever remind me that potential isn't always fully realized.
>> ARTICLE
Just one, Katanamonogatari, because I was half asleep when I watched the ending and I was not conscious enough to enjoy it, thus effectively spoiling myself and taking away almost all of the enjoyment I might have otherwise gotten from that episode.
>> ARTICLE
Shigatsu wa kimi no uso
Code Geass
Oregairu
>> ARTICLE
Steins;gate, shirobako and sakurasou. Damn these were really fun to watch.


Speaking of which, i might just rewatch sakurasou this week.

Gurren Lagann




Toradora

>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann
Seitokai Yakuindomo
Fate/ Stay Night
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate (obviously). 
OreImo. 
Nichijou
>> ARTICLE
The first anime series I ever watched, because it was just an incredible feeling and I never felt so hyped or better said beguiled after again.

That makes me actually quite sad knowing that I wont get this feeling again :(
I mean, I still enjoy anime a lot but the feeling of the first time, oh baby that's special ;)
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate  
Shigatsu wa kimi no uso  
Gurren Lagann

Oh crap there is too many series I'd like to watch for the first time again. Others are: 

Nagi No Asukara  
Anohana  
Hanasaku Iroha  
Monogatari series  
Kill la Kill  

Too many.
>> ARTICLE
 Clannad/Clannad AS,  Clannad/Clannad AS,  Clannad/Clannad AS, would be my 3, no question.

Monogatari and Toradora for the first two, and I'll leave the third as to be determined. 
>> ARTICLE
* Sword Art Online

* DanMachi

* Mars of Destruction

And then i'll drop the rewatch part.
>> ARTICLE
This is a great thread to find anime to add to the ever growing "to-watch" list.
>> ARTICLE
Steins gate is on my list for sure. Some fucker on the internet spoiled a plot point for me half way through the anime. I wanna watch it spoiler free again. :'(  
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter

Tiger and Bunny 

D.Gray Man
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter (2011) as well.

FMA:Brotherhood.

I'm not sure about the last one but I'm gonna say One Piece cause I started following it about 8 years ago and it would be awesome to see everything that is out today with new eyes.
>> ARTICLE
I would use it all three on that on ice cream scene from a certain show.

FMAB, Code Geass, OPM
>> ARTICLE
probably only Toradora. dat ending tho
>> ARTICLE
Fate Zero, Steins Gate, and the Grisaia trilogy.

....I bet I'm the only one mentioning Grisaia, I absolutely drooled all over the BDs.
>> ARTICLE
Sakurasou, that was the biggest feels trip for me, ever. I don't even like romance or SoL, but Sakurasou is definitely something I'd want to experience again.
>> ARTICLE
Kemono no souja Erin, for me
>> ARTICLE
Toradora!, Golden Time and Plastic Memories
>> ARTICLE
Does it have to be an anime? Because there's some spoilers from The Devil is a Part Timer LN that was told to me by a certain banned Muslim, I'd like to erase. 
>> ARTICLE
* **Naruto** - It's basically the first anime I ever saw, and started it over so many times. Couldn't get through it again because of knowing everything already. I wish I could watch [Spoiler](/s Rock Lee vs Gaara during the chuunin exams again)

_____________________________
* **Deathnote** - I don't think there is an anime out there that made me so physically excited without it being a fight. I would get so energized seeing L and Light's battle of wits!

___
* **Bakuman (the manga specifically)** - It's me favorite manga, and have read it so many times. I would love to go back and experience it again for the first time.
>> ARTICLE
ITT: Stein's Gate. 

Is it that good? I've tried watching it but the first episode looked pretty boring. Help me change my opinion! 
>> ARTICLE
I think I ended up giving it a 7/10. It certainly has an original plot and interesting characters, but I never was able to get too attached to any of the characters. A lot of people would say to keep pushing through until when things start picking up. If you don't like it by like ep. 12 or so, I'd stop.
>> ARTICLE
Gungrave, Trigun, & Darker Than Black
>> ARTICLE
Baccano, BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad, and Anohana.

You thought I couldn't donk up the alphabetical order BUT I DID.
>> ARTICLE
-Hunter X Hunter (2011)

-Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun

-Barakamon or Yuru Yuri 
>> ARTICLE
Damn.  
- Nana, because Nana.  
- Xxxholic because god damn Yuuko is the best character. I totally aim to lay around in fancy robes drinking all day as well while being bad ass.  
- And Madoka. cause fuck.  

(I also would love to throw in Code Geass and Kill La Kill in there.)
>> ARTICLE
Yu yi hakasho, cowboy bebop, trigun.  (Hunter x hunter is definitely number 4)
>> ARTICLE
There's definitely a lot of people who want to forget about Steins;Gate to experience watching it for the first time again... And i'm definitely one of them!
>> ARTICLE
Sakurasou, Soul Eater, and probably Toradora
>> ARTICLE
1. Pet girl of Sakurasou
2. Psychopass

Monster is like the only show i can't bring myself to rewatch while knowing the story so i'd like 3 resets on that pls. :D
>> ARTICLE
* Serial Experiments Lain
* Neon Genesis Evangelion ( I wonder what it's like watching the rebuilds without the original )
* ?? Madoka, if I could also erase the hype I had heard before watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, most have already been said but mine would be for sure Shinsekai Yori, Hunter x Hunter and Kuroko no Basket. Shinsekai Yori is hard to explain, just a really unique experience that was a joy to watch. HxH was just a fun ride throughout all 100+ episodes, and Kuroko no Basket provided me with so much HYPE among my friends.
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B, Full Moon Wo Sagashite, And Detective Conan (for shits and giggles even tho it's not over) 
>> ARTICLE
* Neon Genesis Evangelion

* Texhnolyze

* Mushishi
>> ARTICLE
Clannad+AS (does that count as one?), Angel Beats and... hmm, Fate/Zero maybe.

Steins;Gate.  Watched it without knowing anything about it.  Totally worth it.

So good

Madoka Magica
Neon Genesis Evangelion
Space Dandy
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats, Clannad and One Punch Man
>> ARTICLE
1. Clannad + After Story
1.  Angel Beats!
1. Gakkou Gurashi!

All three had a surprise factor that I wish I could relive. I had parts of Clannad After Story and Gakkou Gurashi spoiled to me, so I wish I could go in ignorant and enjoy for real.
>> ARTICLE
Is that third similar to the other two in the Feels department?
>> ARTICLE
No. It's a different surprise entirely, I highly recommend you check out the first episode for yourself. It explains itself episode 1.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. Okay, you'ce made me curious. Added to the PTW list :P
