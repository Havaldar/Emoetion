Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

Good to know. [Those liars at MAL!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)
>> ARTICLE
How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.
>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.
>> ARTICLE
Well deserved.

Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.

Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites. 

Miyamori is love, Miyamori is life.

I'd love to see this updated after every season. Maybe this can be a sidebar addition or something. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

Surprised I've never heard of rainbow considering its so high up this list.

In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good

Holy shit.

I feel like I need to watch this.

You should, it's pretty great.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

[](#yousaidsomethingdumb)

IIRC it was at 8.70~ after it ended. It dropped only by a little bit.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

Yep, sounds like you understand!

They're not cannon but they still count as much as the Steins;Gate movie counts :/ unfortunately

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

Yay for Slam Dunk making in to the top 100. Very first sports anime that I watched and enjoyed. I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Oh wow, I dodnt even realize that lol

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

Maybe I just don't see it but can someone please tell me what is so good about this show cause I rated it a 7(and I think this may be overdoing it)and that is mainly due to the animation. The jokes can only be funny for so long and I didn't even find them that funny in the first place.
>One Punch Man | 9.02 | 12 Eps | 2015
>> ARTICLE
OPM is a really good show. But no way it should ever be above Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people don't agree with you on this as seen by the rank. It's not worth complaining over because you personally dislike it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not blankly complaining. I actually want to know what it is that makes people go nuts over the show and want to have pseudo discussion.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why people like game of thrones but i'm not just going to complain about its imdb rank am i?
>> ARTICLE
So this is clearly going over your head. I said I want to hear what other people are saying as to why it's so good. Do you not want to hear people's reasoning for their differing opinions?
>> ARTICLE
Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol
>> ARTICLE
It bothers me cause I have a friend that during the entire Fall season only talked about OPM and it was starting to piss me off.
>> ARTICLE
Lol, u prob wanted to stay off of /r/anime during the entire fall season then.
>> ARTICLE
the guy probably wanted you to get the same enjoyment he experienced, I dont think he meant any harm. 

I think anyone would be pissed off if they experienced what you did with any show, not just OPM.
>> ARTICLE
I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.
>> ARTICLE
recommend a show of yours he hasnt watched, if he likes something you like, youll solve that problem lol.
>> ARTICLE
It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.
>> ARTICLE
True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.
>> ARTICLE
Why do we need this thread posted every week?
>> ARTICLE
I'm here quite a bit, usually I just see people complain, I think this is only the second time I've seen a consolidated list.

I love how Gintama manages to make this list too.
>> ARTICLE
Not really surprising.  This is just for Gintama': Enchousen (2012).  Gintama (2006) Is rated 46 or something in popularity.  When people add shows to their MAL, they don't always take into consideration that additional seasons in MAL often get added as separate entries.
>> ARTICLE
Really it's just because a lot of people who have watched a ton of Gintama still might not have made it that far. (I haven't yet)

Gintama makes every list.

Really hard to understand why Hajime No Ippo is so unpopular.

Ashita no Joe is enough boxing for me. I really don't need more than one anime in my life for any given sport.

I would think not a lot of anime watchers are into something like boxing. When you count over 100 episodes with all the series combined that adds to it also. Hajime no Ippo definitely one of my favorite series of all time though.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that's sort of the reason but I don't even like boxing and Hajime No Ippo is in my top 3 easily.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. I find myself watching a lot of sports anime when the only ones I follow are Cricket and to a lesser extent Football(Soccer)
>> ARTICLE
Definitely on my top list, but I feel a sort of dissonance when I tried watching an actual boxing match, it just didn't feel the same. The author and artist did something to Ippo to make the series spectacular.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because the manga and anime has to make every match insanely good, as intense as a boxing match can be, it's a battle shonen series afterall. Obviously only one in a thousand real pro matches can get close to it. Same with any sport.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Nodame Cantabile on this list. Just started season 1 and its so much fun.

I guarantee it gets 10000000000x better when you hear the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonic versions of all the mentioned songs

One day, [Sora No Woto](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To) will be on a list like this.  
[Until then...](http://i.imgur.com/bFYqoLb.gif)
>> ARTICLE
It might be too late for our trumpet girl as the anime's been out for quite a long time.
>> ARTICLE
Most likely never going to reach a decent scoring unless MAL somehow resets them (even so, it probably won't affect much of anything).

But for those wondering, Sora no Woto is a spectacular SoL series located in a very interesting post-apocalyptic setting. The show definitely has a very cute cast of characters, but it's not afraid to venture into a more heavy scene as the show progresses. Accompanied by the musical talents of Kalafina & Yuki Kajiura, the show has one of the best OSTs from a SoL. 

It is not at all a K-On clone like many have assumed it to be. The only drawback this show has is the fact that the world it takes place in is left devastatingly unexplored. I would've loved to learn more about the world this anime takes place in.

Give it a chance.

EDIT: A phrase.
>> ARTICLE
Nitpick: Sora no Woto's OST is by the unparalleled Ooshima Michiru (Xam'd, Tatami Galaxy, Zetsuen no Tempest). While I will disagree with you on the worth of the show as a whole, the soundtrack is a work of art. 
>> ARTICLE
Seems I've screwed up a little bit.

Perfectly fine if you don't hold it up as close to the candle as I do. Even if people don't agree with how great of a show it is, it's still a fine military SoL.
>> ARTICLE
Sold, added it to my plan to watch queue. Even though that means I still will probably never get to it but it's closer.

Also the statement about resetting the scores seems odd. Is there some reason that resetting the rates would bring the score up? Like was there a bunch of hatred for this show at one point and was given crap ratings. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not too sold on the idea that resetting the scores would bring up the score by much either (despite mentioning it). That's just the only solution I could see possibly working that would raise it's current rating. Sort of just threw the idea out there since the chances of MAL getting a score reset is unlikely

Then again, I'm not sure what the reason was for the initial dislike the show received when it had aired. I'm just assuming the general consensus now is that it isn't deserving of it's current low-ish score. And I agree with it. 

Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.
>> ARTICLE
>Then again, MAL scoring doesn't mean jack in my honest opinion.

Pretty much this. haha. I don't know what could be done so that the scoring was meaningful. Just hope someone recommends and speaks out for those diamonds in the rough so you get a chance to experience them.
>> ARTICLE
Scoring will never be a useful tool for reviewing without some form of commentary to go along with it. All my scores on my MAL are only meant to be useful for myself.

Thankfully there are always a few reviews on MAL & other websites that give me a little bit more than just a score.

So mushishi, natsume book of friends, Kara no kyoukai, black butler, saint seiya, JoJo, hanamonogatari belong to "lesser known" list? What the actual fuck

To be fair it's movie 8 of Kara no Kyoukai that's on here, the lesser known 8th movie that wasn't even as good as movie 6 IMO... but yeah, still a little odd.
>> ARTICLE
It's because many of them extra seasons.

To get to Book of Circus you have to watch two seasons (many put off by the second), Hanamonogatari three seasons and Nekomonogatari kuro and for Mushishi Zoku Shou you need to watch the first season.

Mushishi is a set of loosely connected histories. One could easily skip right to season 2

Similar case with monogatari, new seasons and films aren't all released in proper, chronological order

Kaiji is brilliant.

I watched part of it before, but it was too depressing and soul crushing for me that I dropped it.  Lately I've been toying with the idea of rewatching and then finishing it, but before I do, I'd like to ask something.  Does it have a happy/at least semi-happy ending?  If he ends up just being a slave or dying or something it won't feel like the watch was worth it at all for me... so I'd like to know beforehand not to watch it if there's a bad end.  I don't want any in depth spoils, just a yes or no @_@.

Kudos to Cross Game for having the saddest first episode in a children anime.

Does Cross Game actually deliver instead of pussying out after two or three episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Please, dont think that cross game is anything like Kotoura-san. Its Adachi's most accessible and easy to watch/read series, and easily one of his best.

Adachi is the master of nostalgia high school sports, mixed in with somewhat opaque romance and usually a touch of tragedy. Its a brilliant mix, and hes been doing it for the better part of 30 years

Comparing the two is an insult to Cross Game.

Yes.

What. Did you just call an Adachi (possibly his best in many ways) series a kids show?

What would you say is the target then? The anime basically aired during a time slot that was appopriate for a younger audience.

its shounen sports that borders on sienen at times.

But adachi doesn't write your normal shounen sports ala slum dunk style, he has his own unique style

It also frequently opened with a drawing song and displayed pictures submitted by viewers at the end of the episode. That means it is, at least in part, targeted towards kids.

Let me tell you about what happened on Tuesday. I made one of the worst decisions of my life, concerning anime.

So, I had Cross Game on my PTW for a while now. Tuesday night, before I hit the hay sack, I decided to watch the first episode before going to bed, thought, "Might as well start it". 

I think you can guess what happened next...No sleep for me for 2 hours, stayed up watching 6 more episodes...Godammit...

I've got casual anime friends and colleagues who watch a series solely by word of mouth, or on recommendation only.

It's like telling a guy off for not having watched The Sound Of Music and Citizen Kane before watching the the movies now showing in cinema.

Really, there's no other prerequisite to watching anime than watching anime. We're all fans here.

No. Some are fans of what's popular. Others are anime fans and do try to know more about something they like.

I'm pretty sure most "anime fans" say they're fans but only care about watching what's popular, which is only a small fragment of what anime is.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, anime has much more depth than what's popular, but honestly, if people are enjoying themselves, then there's no harm to it. Popular shows are good for socializing and community, anyway. I feel that's a much stronger part of what we are than if we were to view anime as art, and it's where anime cons, doujins and even this sub draws strength from.

So it's only better for us if we were to be excellent to everybody here :)

For me, that's pretty old in terms of Animu. 

Then again, I like things like Rose of Versailles and Candy Candy, so yes, I can talk about REALLY FUCKING OLD if you want :3

Growing up back on the old anime forums and geocities (damn I feel old) all people talked about was Utena and then I finally saw it around 2001-2 and I understood why. It's a shame that classic deconstruction series like this are not well known but everyone knowns Evangelion (It's my favourite series but it really is kind of over rated).

I don't think Utena was ever on Toonami/Cartoon Network, though. Could very well be wrong.

It wasn't, but it was one of the first major series imported to the US en masse

That's probably why it's not all that popular, though. Most people I know who watched anime when they were younger watched it on Toonami, including myself.

Maybe? I know some kids like me were a bit proactive and started searching for imports when we were younger though.

Utena is really old, and quite niche. :(

Yeah, I thought about only putting the first entry of a series I'd encounter that fits the criteria at first, but there aren't that many in the end, and I still find it interesting when compared with the attach rate.

I always find it funny how I see people say "Mushishi is great but you should take it slow" while I'm sitting over here marathoning it every time I watch it. I specifically waited until Zoku Shou was finished airing so I could watch it all at once. Now I just have to wait for the movie.

I don't have much to add to SSVD's answer, but yeah, while it isn't everyone's cup of tea -- which is fine -- it's a fascinating show which is definitely worth a shot.
>> ARTICLE
One of my personal favorites. It's more psychedelic and trippy than SHAFT shows, but its a show about psychiatry, so it's very fitting. Highly recommended if you like dramas. The show I think it's closest to in initial impressions/structure is The Tatami Galaxy.

It is episodic in nature, but every episode runs concurrently over the same 2 week time period, so they all interweave in subtle ways. Each one is about Irabu helping people with their mental problems, and it's consistently funny and touching.

In terms of production values, Irabu's VA lifts the show up 10 points alone, OP/ED are both great, music's wonderful, the art is excellent, and I hope you like live-action elements in anime, since this goes full Aku no Hana every now and then, (probably to cover up that there's very little animation in the thing).

I'd call it a 9, as it might have benefited a little more from a stronger overarching narrative, but the individual arcs are all fantastic.

Didn't expect to see MSG: The 08th MS Team on this list, but I imagine it fell under the radar due to being a 90's OVA for one reason or another. I for one think of it as a gem. Not to mention, Shiro and Aina had such a sweet romance.

Just counted, and I haven't watched 54 of these. But seriously, we need to let others know [Patema Inverted](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12477). It's an awesome anime to watch.

It is a cruel world that would ignore the majesty of Whisper of the Heart. A very cruel, world. 

Looking over the list it's funny to see how many 'must watch' anime are on it. Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Revolutionary Girl Utena, MSG: 8th Team, Conan, Dennou Coil, and Maison Ikkoku all stand out as being among the most critically lauded shows in anime history. 

None of which I've yet to finish, mind you. Which says an awful lot about me.

I'm thrashing through LotGH at the moment. It's absolutely enthralling. Really can't stress how little it matters that it was made in 1993. It deals with things I've never seen another anime deal with, and is overwhelmingly compelling to watch one episode to the next. The only anime I can compare it to, in terms of how high a regard it holds its themes, is Monster. They're about completely different things, but the essence of how they deal with the real issues surrounding humanity is similar.
>> ARTICLE
> Revolutionary Girl Utena

What is wrong with you people? This is one of the greatest anime ever made. 


>> ARTICLE
> What is wrong with you people? 

Nothing *wrong* with these people per say... but you forget that the majority of people on /r/anime and MAL are basically the same age as Utena.  If it's 15 years or older, most people haven't seen it unless it's mainstream.

Also, most people here are guys, and won't necessarily get into things ostensibly for girls.
>> ARTICLE
I was being sort of facetious. The thing is anime is way more popular as a whole than when I was getting into the scene. There are way more of us now than there were 15 years ago. 

Anyway thanks for making me feel weird. /s It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.
>> ARTICLE
> It's tough being a guy who loves shjo/jsei.

I always found this funny.  Watching anime in general is already a niche that's, at best, looked at strangely by the general population.  The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing.  Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).
>> ARTICLE

Funnily enough even in its home country. 

> The need for nerds to even further alienate one another is perplexing. Especially when a lot of cis male viewers will enjoy shows filled with girls doing girly things and romance if it's properly catered to them (moe).

I think it goes without saying that our society is geared against folks that don't identify with the general norm. I read manga/watch anime for the art, the story and the characters but despite having all of those I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(
>> ARTICLE
> Funnily enough even in its home country.

Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

> I'm not allowed to read/watch shjo/jsei because I was born with the wrong genitalia. :(

Sure you are, do what you want!  I watch crap for kids and adults; crap for guys and girls, it doesn't matter.  Quality and artistry doesn't know gender.  Let the haters hate.  Besides, this is the anonymity of the internet too, so:

1) Who cares what other people have to say.

2) You'll find a lot more like minded people here than you would have assumed.
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, but IMO that has more to do with firmly ingrained misogyny than the rampant homophobia over here.

Oh definitely, tho there is rampant homophobia as well it just manifests differently (like being gay is considered a phase that kids go through in Japanese culture). But the stigma in Japan for anime in general is a lot like the stigma for watching cartoons over here in that its still seen as something primarily for children. 

> Sure you are, do what you want! I watch crap for kids and adults; crap for guys and girls, it doesn't matter. Quality and artistry doesn't know gender. Let the haters hate. Besides, this is the anonymity of the internet too, so:

I wasn't quite saying that I personally would change what I like, I've been watching what I like for damn near over a decade and a half now, just critiquing the dominant view. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm at episode 12 from 39 and to me it seems like the plot is just starting, while Ping Pong, the masterpiece of anime, already finished an episode ago. 

I'm definitely having fun up to this point and it'll probably blow my mind by the time I'm finished, but the show is taking it's time. And shojo's of the 90's look weird. NGE looks way better.
>> ARTICLE
You're almost at one of the best arcs ever made for any anime period, the Black Rose arc, look forward to it. 

Trust me, by the time you finish this, you'll be a believer. Just be glad you didn't get the movie four years before the series like those of us way back when. :p Also shjo, at least in manga, has not really changed since the late 80s except males have become skinnier, it's only in the anime adaptations where utena eschews a more shnen look for keeping the shjo flowery approach. 

NGE is my favourite anime ever, and yes it looks good, but so does Utena in a different way. 
>> ARTICLE
Just stumpled upon this thread and by now I have finished Utena. Still don't relaly know what to think. It definitely well done, but at face value it does so little and I am not all that good with symbolism. It had some really hilarious stuff. That's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck is wrong with you?
>> ARTICLE
Well rheumatism, arthritis, demen-wait what was I talking about again? /s
>> ARTICLE
It can be pretty painful to watch. I mean how many times must I see the stair climbing montage? Only to be outdone by the elevator taking montage. 

Also, plenty of times throughout the show I wanted to scream "What the hell are you trying to tell me?" So it can be a frustrating show for people that are driven by plot as opposed to themes and symbolism.  
>> ARTICLE
Man the stair-climbing/elevator-taking are when things get real in an episode, they serve an important point. Repetition is a huge focus for reinforcing themes. Remember Utena is about growing up, the stair-climbing, elevator-taking are symbolic of going from lower to higher, that is becoming an adult. 
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea how Utena is so low (comparatively) in terms of ranking, both popularity and score-wise. How have more people not watched this show? I've met people who've watched a ton of anime who've never even heard of it. Is it because it's a magical girl series (kinda)? Is it because Utena's a girl? Are most people really that unwilling to watch anime that's more than seven years old? People on here talk about Penguindrum fairly frequently, and obviously a lot of attention is on Ikuhara with Yuri Kuma Arashi. I wish that there'd be more discussion about Utena beyond it being mentioned as a classic because it has so much depth to it, it easily deserves threads on the level of, say, the NGE rewatch. 
>> ARTICLE
I got bored after 14 episodes and quit watching. I can't relate to anyone in the show they are all so backwards.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly there actually were rewatch threads on here for Utena a few months ago. But only like two people posted in them.
>> ARTICLE
It's odd because all throughout the late 90s - early 2000s Utena was hailed as a masterpiece even if half the people watching it didn't understand that it was largely a coming-of-age story. 

But really Utena is to shjo what NGE is to mainstream anime, remembering that shjo while influential on the mainstream is largely resistant to the mainstream as well, an endpoint to a bleak era after the economic downturn of the 80s-90s. It was a clean break between the themes prevalent before and after. I think there are enough of us around to create a decent discussion thread. :p

Is the 'Aria' series worth pursuing? 
>> ARTICLE
it is my second favorite series behind hunter x hunter
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. I watch very little slice of life because I often find the majority of them to be mostly pointless apart from them making you feel comfy. I noticed that the Aria trilogy was quite often referred to as best SOL out there so I decided to give it a shot and it turned out to be one of my favourite shows.

 It is a coming of age story what gets better with each series and ends perfectly in my opinion. What made me love this series so much was how the main character Akari viewed and interpreted the world around her in such a beautiful way that I couldn't help but feel warm and fuzzy inside. 

The OST is also great at making you feel relaxed and comfy, here is one of my favourite songs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1hGtQxHvs 

I can't recommend this series enough, the only negative I can think of is that I found the cat's voice a little annoying initially but like the series he grew on me very quickly.
>> ARTICLE
It's an episodic slice of life anime about rowing gondolas on terraformed Mars. There is an overall linear progression, but it's mostly about the development of its characters. There's no denying it's hard to get into for most people, but it's charming and soothing, and it ends on a conclusive high note.

I would say that a large amount of the sequels could have been taken out, as they typically have viewers that decided to watch based on the first season, giving them unnaturally higher ratings. 

Edit: You may also want to think about removing those with scorers around the 12,000 mark and above, because quite a few of them are well known (At least on reddit (as it seems to me))

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
Big Windup! is one of my favorite sports anime so I'm glad its getting the recognition it deserves
>> ARTICLE
Dennou Coil is a masterpiece. It really is just about perfect. 

It has an interesting and well thought out world. Characters are likeable and relatable. The story has a well pacing, is interesting and actual works out. The soundtrack, while nothing really special, is used very well, always fits and underlines the atmosphere, but also knows when to be silent.

But I'm sad X, Arjuna or Giant Killing didn't make it. At least X could've managed to get it. Clamp manga animated by Madhouse? It should've been popular. Arjuna has Yoko Kanno's best work, but a weird story. I like it.

**BUT** how in fuck did Inu Yasha get in there? Judging by the 120 episodes I watched before droping it, it isn't a contender for top 100.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen InuYasha, but this is the second season. To get there you must have already went through 167 episodes, and judging by the description, it seems to be much faster paced (covering 21 chapters in 26 episodes compared to 35 in 167, from my understanding), which must contribute a lot to its high rating.

There is quite some stuff on that list that I adore(Cross Game, Chihayafuru, Kaiji, Gin no Saji, ...) but it makes sense.

I got to most of those through checking the Top MAL scores and not because they got recommended or written about.

But there are also a lot of em that seem to sit on my ptw list forever, since there is always something "more important" to watch.

I've seen quite a few of these shows mentioned here but haven't watched them yet, I should really get around to that. The attach rate is interesting, most shows are below .6. It would be interesting if MAL included that stat itself so we could compare shows by what percent of  people dropped/finished it more easily.

Action is pretty hype and if the boobs keep being uncensored like they were the past seasons, they'll be hype too.

I once saw a censored version by mistake... The lens flare on the boobs really made me laugh.

But then I switched back again to the uncensored version and lived happily ever after!

Wait there's a censored version? Well I guess that makes sense.  For when it aired or something

How do you put Hellsing Ultimate on hold o.O
>> ARTICLE
probably because it took like 6 years for 10 episodes to be aired at a pace of 1-3 episodes per year. some people just got tired of waiting and haven't bothered to finish it yet.
>> ARTICLE
I'm assuming there were a lot of people who put it on hold because they were waiting for the last 2 episodes to be dubbed and haven't gotten around to watching them yet. (I'm in this exact situation)
>> ARTICLE
But... there are subs.
>> ARTICLE
The Hellsing Ultimate english dub is widely considered to be better because the characters have fitting accents, in addition to it just being an overall good dub.
>> ARTICLE
Ok... I'll have to think about which I'm gonna watch before watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely dub, you gotta get those over-the-top German accents in all their glory.
>> ARTICLE
And Crispin Freeman as Alucard.  It's why I watched it dubbed

I'm glad to see Major getting some love, I really recommend watching the first(maybe second) episode.  It does a great job of drawing people's attention

One Piece never fails.

Touch, Cross Game, Kemono no Souja Erin, and Rose of Versailles are all in my top 15. I'm definitely gonna try Major now.

I haven't seen Romeo's Blue Skies either but really liked the other World Masterpiece Theater stuff that I've seen (Akage no Anne, Heidi, Marco).

Man Romeo's Blue Skies is amazing, although I guess I can see why people wouldn't like it. My parents got me into classic literature at an early age, so I'm a sucker for stories like this.
>> ARTICLE
Is there a way to find the shows with the highest plan to watch vs completed ratio? 

Basically, the shows everyone has on their list, but they never get around to watching.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean like in the case of Gintama where only 28% of the users that have it on their list have completed while 51k (Also 28%) out of 178k people are planing to watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, seems like an interesting measure, Legend of the Galactic Heroes has more people who plan to watch it than who have actually completed it, for example.
>> ARTICLE
It should be possible but kinda hard to pull off since not only is the data on the website really off sometimes but you also can only sort by a single field. 

I've tried limiting the number of members that have the shows on their list as well as limit the complete and plan percentage so it kinda looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KW8wFUU.png) but then you've to deal with the wrong data like in Jinsei and M3's case.

Scraping the data from MAL directly might yield better results but I've no idea how to do that. You could try playing around with the settings [here](http://test.animeadvice.me/#state/plantocompleteratio) to give you a better list but it won't be really 100% accurate.

Sorry for not being really that helpful.

Death note getting put on hold and dropped this much....I guess this is what happens when people over hype the shit out of a good show.
>> ARTICLE
Well... the reason for most of the shounen anime drops are cause the manga is just so fraking far ahead. I gave up on shippuden by the Hidan and Kakuzu ark. And i recently read like 100 chapters to finally end the 10 years of watching and following Naruto.

[Naruto ending spoilers](/s "The ending was pretty appropriate but the last boss was kinda shit. Also the whole profecy thing kind of makes all the depth and conflicts of all the characters in the whole story kind of pointless which really really sucks.

Really impressed with Parasyte popularity rise .  surpise no Bahamut in there .  
>> ARTICLE
Bahamut is actually not anywhere near Parasyte's popularity (Only half as many MAL members have it on their list). The popularity list for this season goes like this:

1. Parasyte
1. Psycho-Pass 2
1. Log Horizon 2
1. Fate/Stay Night: UBW
1. Amagi Brilliant Park
1. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso
1. Trinity Seven
1. InoBato
1. Grisaia no Kajitsu
1. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah was suprise to I see alot of people talking smack about psycho pass season 2  and log horizon 2 right now how its bad compared to season 1  so was shocked to see them above UBW considering its popularity. My guess is people are confused on the order of the fate series so alot dont watch it yet

Hellsing: Ultimate in the put on hold top 10 when it only consists of 10 OVAs. No surprise, though. That series is insufferable.

It's melodramatic, poorly written at times, and crawls at a snails pace. The flashbacks that repeated the same thing over and over triggered my GGO PTSD. It's a good show, and I'm certainly enjoying it, but calling it a masterpiece just devalues the shows truly deserving of that title, IMO.

I meant compared to the other anime of this season.

Masterpiece isn't a comparative word. A masterpiece is a masterpiece regardless of context.

Probably the only show that will make me fall in love with a middle schooler...

It is mildly amusing to me that A:tLA is  (anime in Japanese), but not an anime (in English).

Because we Americans are picky as Fuck. RWBY is even considered an anime in Japan because they don't give a shit about cartoon vs anime wars over there. If it's animated then it's anime by default

Holy cow Gate

Yup. Also Haikyuu at 9th, OPM at 3rd, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu at 73, Death Parade at 79, Naruto at 89 and One Piece at 59.

Definitely strong bias towards shows that are currently airing. 
>> ARTICLE
One piece..  Strong bias? Bruh if it finished airing it'd be rated a lot higher
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. I'm not sure about that. The story is great but the pacing for the anime is horseshit.

I love the story. However I can't give a shit about the story if it takes 50 episodes to complete an arc.

At this rate Oda might die before we see the ending of the story.

It's not what you think though, just how it'd be rated. Fk the pacing agreed

lmao Haikyuu is pretty damn good, it's pretty high up even on MAL.

OPM is good as well. Doesn't mean they're not overrated by recency bias.

I think it's cool how Avatar, RWBY, and similar shows are allowed. This and allowing for scores of X/100 are all the only things I've liked about Hummingbird so far.

Mononoke (rank 64 on MAL)

Slam Dunk (rank 55 on MAL)

Nana (rank 50 on MAL)

Next we'll get to see an adjusted score combining the MAL and Hummingbird to see where a lot of shows even out.

>> ARTICLE
I liked magi... :(
>> ARTICLE
There's nothing wrong with liking it, but it's a bad show on almost every level. It was like a poor man's Avatar or FMA.
>> ARTICLE
How was it "bad"? It was pretty, had some nice characters, a kinda unique setting and some pretty welldone action scenes. It was a bit childish sure, but I don't think it was bad...
>> ARTICLE
The pacing was really bad, for starters. All the arcs were paced poorly. The earlier episodes were just rushed, and didn't allow you to form any sort of connection to the characters. The later arcs were drawn out and dragged on to unreasonable lengths.

The characters are some of the worst I've seen. Obviously this was to cater towards a young audience, but that's no excuse for having poorly written backstories, and shocking character exposition. Alibaba is probably the character I hate the most (save Kirito). He was written to be juvenile and immature, as were most of the characters, which honestly reflects quite poorly on the writers.

The plot was not well thought out, and was unsatisfying, especially compared to the superior Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Great round up violaxcore.  I wonder how much the figure/merchandise/character goods factors into whether an anime gets a 2nd season.  (Eg. If DVD/BD sales are poor but is hot on merchandising.)
>> ARTICLE
Here are a few examples:

Symphogear sold an average of 4,800 BD+DVD per volume. Not bad, but not great. Kind of average really. However, they also cast Nana Mizuki and had her sing a song: "Synchrogazer." The CD single sold 50k in its first week and totaled 70k by the time it fell off the oricon charts. Character songs albums also did pretty well, but nowhere near Synchrogazer.

Chihayafuru gives us another great example. It averaged a meager 2,564 per volume for BD and DVD sales. Usually when shows sell that low, we assume it was a failure. But the Chihayafuru manga rangularly sells in the hundreds of thousands. 

Bakuman is similar. The anime sold about 1000 per volume, but it's a manga that sells in the hundreds of thousands. And so we're on what, season 3 by now?
>> ARTICLE
I figured Monster-kun would sell better than it is. To-Love-Ru Darkness, it's a shame it sells so well, it just tells the industry "if you want to sell your shit, CENSOR YOUR CENSOR DAWG"
>> ARTICLE
>To-Love-Ru Darkness

 I haven't seen the anime yet (since it's censored), but the manga is very good.
>> ARTICLE
It might just be that TLRD has become a fairly popular series. The TLRD is a manga that sells fairly well.

Also, Highschool DxD aired uncensored on AT-X but was one of the top sellers for its season
>> ARTICLE
While I see your point, Highschool DXD did have boobies and lots of them which always helps sales. Though there is no denying censorship on shows like this is getting worse because they believe it helps sales. 

Highschool DXD got away with showing quite a bit, so could TLRD, they choose not to for a reason. 
>> ARTICLE
Fuck yeah G&P, faith in the japs restored!
>> ARTICLE
Sadly has Medaka Box S2 such a low ranking... :/ Hopefully they still do a season 3. 
>> ARTICLE
The Medaka Box manga gets decent sales (Over 100k per volume) and the LN adaption does decently as well, though I don't believe it does quite as well as most of the Jump manga.

I assumed that the current season of Medaka Box was planned from the start - they split the cours instead of doing 24 episodes straight. But I don't think another season of Medaka Box is outside the realm of possibility.

Ouch, that sucks. :(

Thanks for the information tho!

Ixion Saga

Avg. Rank: Shit

I'm so mad, that show is literally the funniest most entertaining show I have seen in multiple seasons, It needs some more attention, it's fucking awesome.

I would like to see HidaSketch and JoJo outsell Chuunibyou but I'll settle for just surprise hit Girls und Panzer (which is also better and funnier than Chuunibyou).

> Mako is best girl

Nein. Yukari is definitely #1.

> Teekyuu is outselling Robotics;Notes

This is ***hilarious***, but not surprising since Teekyuu is AOTY material.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! Someone else that agrees that Chuunibyou isn't God's own creation.  Bummer to see Robotics Notes doing so poorly :\  I actually like that show.  I guess Japanese people would rather see little girls playing sports than a club about building a robot.
>> ARTICLE
Teekyu is not about tennis, at all. It has less to do with tennis than K-ON has to do with music.
>> ARTICLE
i stand corrected. i guess people like the fast-paced 2 min comedy episodes then.
>> ARTICLE
Robotics;Notes is taking forever to pick up, super slow and too Slice of Life. When people have high expectations because of Steins;Gate it just doesn't live up. 

I like it, but I wouldn't buy it at this point.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;gate was almost exactly the same way for it's first 12 episodes, so I'd suggest giving it until then. Although it is going somewhat slower than Steins;Gate did.
>> ARTICLE
R;N is going by a similar pace but I think it's better. The tournament was an early episode and it was pretty exiting. And we got a pretty damn big reveal by EP7.

S;G had more cookie-cutter moe girls from the start.

Part timer-chan. Tsundere-chan. Imouto uguu-chan. Nyaan-chan and Trap-kun. Otaku bait cast at its best.

part-timer-chan the best girl

Even so even the VN wasn't that great from what I hear. I didn't say I plan to drop it, I was just stating it's been quite boring, a bit too slice of life.

I'm glad to see Chu2 doing well because KyoAni's previous works haven't been selling too well. Granted I also want to see Jojo sell well too because I want them to animate ALL THE MANGA. David Productions has respect from me.

Chuunibyou looks like it'll sell somewhere around Hyouka levels. Nichijou had pretty poor BD/DVD sales for KyoAni, but I'm told it had really good figure sales.
>> ARTICLE
You're telling me twice as many people bought Girls und Panzer than JoJo? And 20x more people bought it than Sukitte? I'm sorry but that is awful. GuP is hands down the worst show this season for me. But I guess it does prove that you can have cute girls doing literally ANYTHING and it will sell.
>> ARTICLE
> worst show this season for me

I guess that just says something about your taste.
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense. It's pretty much the only series I really enjoy watching this season.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I really can't watch a show about cute girls doing fun stuff.

But GuP is a sport anime about massive machines taking each other out in battles that are decided by proper war tactics... that happens to be starred by cute girls. Very watchable.

Now, JoJo, Sukitte and weird shows like Shin Sekai Yori doing poor sales was expected. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure what exactly it is about GuP that irks me so much, since I actually highly enjoyed Upotte! a few seasons ago. Military is one of my favorite genres of anime, but the entire premise of tanks being driven by cute little girls as a sport is just...to be honest, stupid to me. And I do watch a ton of stuff that has equally stupid premises, but like I said, this one just gets to me more than the others. Not to mention I think all the characters are so, so bland, I can't even remember any of their names save for the main character.

Garupan licensed by Bandai?  So a physical release over here will be a long, agonizing, possibly-not-happening thing, or have I misinterpreted the implications of Bandai NA's demise?

(On the plus side, Garupan doing that well means there should be a greater variety of merchandise coming.)
>> ARTICLE
No. Bandai is the Japanese licensor. Sentai has the US license.

Recent history suggests that CR simulcast means Sentai physical release.

Ah.  I remember now that Sentai managed to purchase the rights for a crapton of shows this season, so that's good news.

But it was KOREAN soup. (I never noticed. In what episode was it in?) I personally find the reaction pretty hilarious.

Actually, it wasn't ranked all that high to begin with. Pre-korean soup, it's average rank was in the 500s.

Where is Sword Art Online? 

>> ARTICLE
If I recall correctly, this only covers Volume 1 DVD/BD sales.  At least that is what I am gathering from the japanese link posted.  Look at the 2nd half of the page: http://www27392u.sakura.ne.jp/index_news.cgi

The first half only shows the Top 100 sales on Amazon, and it does have SAO listed with a walloping 22k points just for Volume 3.

Honestly, I feel even if this list did accommodate SAO, it doesn't feel appropriate as it feels very given that the show will eventually get a season 2.  If it doesn't, it probably isn't due to lack of funds.
>> ARTICLE
I can pretty much write off any chances for Medaka Box S3 at this point
>> ARTICLE
Well, manga sales do matter too, but I don't know how much, if at all, they've been affected by the anime. With the case of Medaka I'm fairly certain this is a case of a split cour scenario (like TWGOK) though, but hey you never know. I gave you shit last time and it still got a second season.

So reading all that and then looking at this chart, can I just assume that there's a ton of rage over Robotic;Notes' adaptation or was it never that popular to begin with?

And was there a definite correlation between censorship and increased BD sales like for To-Love-Ru Darkness?
>> ARTICLE
Read the text under **slight change**. Robotics;Notes has low points because it's a recent addition to the stalker chart. It still has a decent average rank, so expect it to move up in points at a decent rate

I see what you mean; that's what I get for skimming.  So looking at both can give a fair idea of what to expect.

> TLR: Darkness #1

Obviously they're not actually watching the show, but buying the BDs so that they can get it uncensored.

> LB! selling well

Not surprised, but it will not even match Kanon, much less AIR or Clannad, in sales. I hope that quality/sales don't drive off a cliff when we reach the dramatic parts.

> JoJo ahead of Chuunibyou

HELL YES. This is awesome.

> Hidamari's very strong showing

This makes me all kinds of happy.

> Busou Shinki edging out Psycho-Pass

This is what you get for "no moe": you get beaten by a terrible fanservice show about dolls doing cute things (of course there is actual moe in Psycho-Pass, but nevermind).

> SSY and Tempest getting really low ranks

They must be waiting to see if it'll pan out. Still a bit disappointing from Japan.
>> ARTICLE
Busou Shinki already has an established fanbase thanks to the toys/games, so that's probably why it's doing better so far. I know I've bought the OP/ED singles and preordered the character singles even though I don't have high expectations for the show now. After episode 3 I'm only watching it because I'm an established fan and other entries in the series have had decent plots.
>> ARTICLE
Surprised LB made it that high. I'm not watching it, but I haven't really heard much good about the adaptation.

Kind of interesting looking at sales in terms of the ratio of BD:DVD. Girls unf Panzer has 11:1, while Magi is at like 1:1.3.
>> ARTICLE
the anime is absolute garbage so far
>> ARTICLE
I figured that DVDs were bought only by "casuals" (josei-watching women, people watching shounens like the big 3, Magi, Gintama, etc.) because those shows always have a disproportionate number of DVD sales compared to "otaku pandering" shows, a category into which Girls und Panzer would definitely fall.
>> ARTICLE
Well I think the hype and popularity is the reason the sales are high. The adaption is decent so far. 
>> ARTICLE
Seitokai S2 hasn't even had a single episode out so far right?

Would explain the low ranking.
>> ARTICLE
Probably has more to do with the fact that it's a net anime

[Official website](http://seitokai-no-ichizon.com/onair/). It's being produced by the same company that did Ebiten so I expect it to air on TV next season.
