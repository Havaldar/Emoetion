I'm putting out this a bit earlier than usual because I'm going to see Ant-Man.

That's the only reason why.

As for this episode:

#***YOU JUST BEEN SPOILED MUAHAHAHAHAHHAHA***
>> ARTICLE
D:

>> ARTICLE
Prelude: I highly recommend watching the dubbed version of this. I mean absolutely no harm to the Japanese voice actors or just people who prefer subs, but in my opinion not doing so would be doing yourself a disservice. It's one of, if not *the* greatest dub I've ever heard in my life. Not to mention, the show *is* set in America, after all.

Post-Prelude: If you find yourself overwhelmed by the first few episodes and their disjointed, non-chronological storytelling, dont give up. The show has a way of tying all the plotlines together in a perfect way that, by the end, even first-time watchers should be able to make sense of nearly all of it. And you'll also have the help of the rest of us. (Spoiler-free help, but we all already knew that, *right?*)

Episode 1

* [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--tfb6Cv7eY). [Fucking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F5459jCtuM). [Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU0TTFCD66s). [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJjM-eOkKoM). [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOUIXQdrQaI).

* Yes, his name really is [Jacuzzi Splot.](http://i.imgur.com/qdRkjDv.jpg) Its 1930s New York; you think that was the weirdest name floating around back then?

* Im now going to show what a fanboy I am of this dub and credit as many of the dub actors as I can as they appear, because they all deserve to be recognized.

* Gustave St. Germain (Vice-President of the *Daily Days*)  [Kent Williams](http://myanimelist.net/people/872/Kent_Williams)

* Carol  [Kristin Sutton](http://myanimelist.net/people/8824/Kristin_Sutton) 

* Gustav: What are you doing up there, anyway?

* Carol: Well, honestly, sir, I was thinking of a quirky and unique way to make the audience feel confused as fuck in only the first fifteen minutes of the pilot.

* Gustav: Taking notes from Fate/Zero, are we?

* Carol: That implies their info dump was quirky and unique.

* [This is what happens when you let Gustav grab a handful of fortune cookies before he leaves the Chinese buffet.](https://a.pomf.cat/lctamm.mp4)

* [Thats the look of a man whos ready to slap a bitch.](http://i.imgur.com/Jd1MGeF.jpg)

* [I love how they never really explain what this point system is.](https://a.pomf.cat/rbywjv.mp4) Its just implied that she gets some sort of quarterly grade with like a preset point allotment.

* [I feel like making a Certain Magical Index reference here, but Im not sure how to word it.](https://a.pomf.cat/wfcymf.mp4) And, aww at shocked Carol.

* [Has anyone besides Lelouch ever introduced themselves like this?](https://a.pomf.cat/rsvnte.mp4)

* [I fucking love how these flashbacks are structured.](https://a.pomf.cat/lgzmii.mp4)

* Yes, yes, the trains name is *Flying Pussyfoot*. Told you Jacuzzi Splot wasnt the weirdest name back then.

* Hahaha. [Annoyed Carol.](http://i.imgur.com/Xf00gMi.jpg)

* [Behold the greatest couple youll ever see in your entire lives.](https://a.pomf.cat/hvafuf.mp4) Dont get me wrong; I love Kraft and Holo, but I still feel Isaac and Miria were cheated out of their rightful first place in the Best Couple contest. [Hell, they even have their own Wikipedia article that is literally just titled Isaac and Miria.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_and_Miria) (Spoilers, obviously) That should tell you how much they stand out.

* Isaac Dian  [J. Michael Tatum](http://myanimelist.net/people/1602/J._Michael_Tatum)

* Miria Harvent  [Caitlin Glass](http://myanimelist.net/people/313/Caitlin_Glass)

* [Whoa, spoilers!](http://a.pomf.cat/eldeaj.mp4) Yeesh, and I thought the people in the Code Geass rewatch were bad.

* Gustav: Or perhaps

* Carol: What about this guy?

* Gustav: Never interrupt me when Im monologuing! You want minus two points, you bitch?!

* I, unfortunately, cannot credit the panhandlers VA because He isnt credited in the cast list.

* Firo Prochainezo  [Todd Haberkorn](http://myanimelist.net/people/860/Todd_Haberkorn) Sounding a tad more badass than he did in My Bride is a Mermaid, but not quite as badass as his greatest role of all time, the Honnouji Academy Sewing Club President, Shirou Iori. (Seriously, the Sewing Club is fucking hardcore in that show.)

* [Love that line.](https://a.pomf.cat/cigtto.mp4) Probably because it reminds me of a few conversations Ive had with others.

* I love how Firo just doesnt give fuck about compensation. He does good things because hes just that fucking cool. [Speaking of which, this moment is when this show really grabbed my attention.](https://a.pomf.cat/oxocai.mp4) (In b4 Django Unchained clip.) From him being able to grab the knife from behind his back without even looking, to his fingers getting sliced off, to the dramatic music that kicks in during the slow pan of his fingers reattaching, to the menacing stance he has while he holds his hair out of his face, all culminating in him beating the shit out of his would-be-attacker. Great scene.

* And to top it all off, [blushing Carol.](http://i.imgur.com/AiMP8d5.jpg)

* [Carol:](https://a.pomf.cat/orovad.mp4) Gee, Mr. Vice-President, you sure do like to wax philosophical over the news.

* Gustav: Well, when you go to a liberal arts college, that and having raunchy sex are pretty much all youre taught how to do.

* Carol: You arent taught to burst out into random covers of pop songs? Thats what Glee taught me.

* Gustav: You just lost those two points.

* Luck Gandor  [Jason Liebrecht](http://myanimelist.net/people/650/Jason_Liebrecht)

* Berga Gandor  [Phil Parsons](http://myanimelist.net/people/7522/Phil_Parsons)

* Keith Gandor  VA Unlisted

* Gustavo  VA Unlisted

* Runorata  VA Unlisted

* [Boss man aint taking his shit today.](https://a.pomf.cat/bqhimu.mp4)

* Eve Genoard  [Jad Saxon](http://myanimelist.net/people/6729/Jad_Saxton)

* News agencies today could take some lessons on how to report things from this show.

* [Gustav:](https://a.pomf.cat/gqywax.mp4) Carol, you know what the metaphorical fourth wall in movies and plays are, dont you? Cause I just broke ours like it was wet tissue paper.

* [I fucking adore how blunt these episode titles are.](http://i.imgur.com/tBUq1pF.png) No metaphorical, allegory nonsense. Just telling it how it is. Just as how the news should be.

* [And here is where the story sort of, kind of, not really starts.](http://i.imgur.com/15F8wnP.png)

* *[Sigh](https://a.pomf.cat/hfovuu.mp4)* Fine, Ill post the [clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xmAC9Qu908)

* [I have the strangest feeling that Gustavo might be a fan of violence.](https://a.pomf.cat/lfceso.mp4) Just a hunch. (Also, do those cronies just stand around outside the house, holding up automatic rifles and waiting to be told when to kill someone?)

* [Speaking of which.](https://a.pomf.cat/okunkm.mp4)

* [Beaten Thug:](https://a.pomf.cat/gtshcx.mp4) You cant do this to me! Oh, if only we lived in a time where a British comedian could make an episode of a [TV show saying that what is happening is wrong!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmeF2rzsZSU) That would fix things for sure! (In all seriousness, I love John Oliver, but I wish that his segments did more to actually fix problems going on in the world.)

* Tick Jefferson (Torturer)  [Adam Dapkus](http://myanimelist.net/people/12569/Adam_Dapkus)

* And, Im just gonna stop mentioning when theres no credited VA from now on.

* [I probably would be, too, if I could actually understand it.](https://a.pomf.cat/ldqudl.mp4)

* [Firo:](https://a.pomf.cat/tnokyr.mp4) Why are you being so cryptic, dancing around saying what you mean?

* Luck: What am I over here, Mr. Exposition? Thats the VPs job.

* Firo: [Fuck.](https://a.pomf.cat/mvgutc.mp4) Shouldve listened to [Finn.](https://a.pomf.cat/idstjd.mp4)

* [Im Inspector Clich and this is my partner, Inspector Trope.](https://a.pomf.cat/modqrn.mp4)

* Adele (Woman with the cross-shaped spear)  [Stephanie Young](http://myanimelist.net/people/475/Stephanie_Young)

* [Still love these two.](https://a.pomf.cat/akvpsv.mp4)

* Wow, Im posting a LOT of WebMs this time around. I think I like this dub even more than I realized. Sorry to anyone that feels Im wasting their time. Tell me if you want me to cut back for the next episode.

* Czesaw Meyer  [Maxey Whitehead](http://myanimelist.net/people/8722/Maxey_Whitehead)

* [I wonder how long immortals can play dead before their bodies reform.](https://a.pomf.cat/swyosp.mp4) Its gotta take a lot of willpower, as I assume getting blown apart cant feel very good.

* [Its so nice to find a show where the characters have some form of common sense.](https://a.pomf.cat/kspxrk.mp4)

* Ennis  [Brina Palencia](http://myanimelist.net/people/659/Brina_Palencia) My personal favorite female VA.

* Maiza Avaro  [Sean Hennigan](http://myanimelist.net/people/5440/Sean_Hennigan)

* [There is no truer love than a couple whose entire relationship is based on the guy wanting to kill the girl and the girl wanting to be killed by him.](https://a.pomf.cat/gteduk.mp4) Also, Ladd lost his arm.

* Ladd Russo  [Bryan Massey](http://myanimelist.net/people/7151/Bryan_Massey)

* Lua Klein  [Carrie Savage](http://myanimelist.net/people/327/Carrie_Savage)

* [The end theme is such a contrast from all the other music in the show.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXDWMf5CPeM)

* [Can these two just narrate the previews for every show ever?](https://a.pomf.cat/otmfhm.mp4) The name of the next episode is, Setting the Old Woman's Qualms Aside, the Flying Pussyfoot Departs, to put what theyre saying into perspective.

Holy shit, when I first started this, I was sure it wouldnt be as long as my past ones, but I guess I underestimated what a weeb I am. Oh, well. Hopefully tomorrow I wont end up posting the equivalent of half the episode in my review.

Oh, who am I kidding?

I had no idea how much I miss seeing that OP. 

Btw, I wouldn't mind riding the Flying Pussy...foot.

[](#smugpoint)
>> ARTICLE
Oh...oooh okay. I was not ready for this to be honest.  
I expected this show to be more...generic(?) but I was clearly wrong.  
I am pleasently surprised!  
First of all, this show's got style! Not many anime from the 30's, that's for damn sure! Can't see that OP being skipped either and the rest of the OST is also nice smooth jazz.  
But man, this was hard to digest at once. I think I could follow about 70% of what's going on if not less. Non-linear story can be a bitch but this is a whole other level. Non-linear, non-chronological AND meta. I underestimated this show...  
Can't tell much about any of the characters, everybody had like 1 minute of screen time.  
One thing I liked is how they handle gore. It's trying to be realistic despite the unrealistic scenario. (HE BLEW THE KID'S HEAD OFF)  
  
I think I'll like this.
>> ARTICLE
I watched about 3 episodes a few weeks ago and then stopped because other things... I didn't remember half of the characters then, but watching the first episode a second time I recognize most of the faces and names. I'm excited for where this will go!
>> ARTICLE
The nonlinear stuff makes a whole lot more sense on the second go-round, than it does on the first. Probably cause you already know how all the storylines play out and intersect.

It gets easier to follow. The first episode is really bizarre in the way it's presented - it's more like a spoiler-free summary of the events of the story. I typically recommend that people watch the first episode LAST for that reason.     

Er... anyway, glad you like it! Episode 2 is the actual beginning of the show.

You're not the only one who thinks the first episode can be skipped

I mean the first episode of Baccano Abridged is also called:

So, this is my first time actually participating in a REWATCH thread, apart from watching other's reactions to a few show's that I've seen myself.

But now the show is on the other foot as it were.

I mostly lurk and write various comments that I promptly delete when i re-read them and see how useless whatever I was writing happens to be.

Also, it happens to be 8am here when these posts go up, so i will try and be punctual with them but I make no promises.

I'm watching the Dub, as i have heard is is a good example of dubbing done well an that the accents used by the VA's contribute towards setting the time period well.

As such I've kinda decided to do comments in a more 'stream of consciousness' style, writing minor notes during my watching of the show and only doing some minor clean-up before posting, as such I'm just going to apologize now for the mess you are about to read >.>

Enough crap, on to the reactions.

* Jazz/Brassy opening fits the roaring 20/30's ideal

* outfits look thematically appropriate

* can't not imagine leprechauns burning to death at the end of a rainbow now...

* monocle dude is very stern

* Vice Pres more like Vice Monocle

* answer her question, out of how many damnit.

* chunky salsa

* its gone meta 'he is MC-ish'

* moonshine, prohibition, speakeasies and tommy guns. FUN

* 'burn powder' that's a cool way of putting it

* mafia boss is like :[

* Standing around polishing their guns, quick and easy way to say this is the bad guy group.

* this show likes it's realistic violence

* a couple of MiB(men in brown) inspectors huh

* immortals, huh

* interesting, it seems that instead of regenerating or being impervious to damage their bodies reconstitute themselves from 
whatever damage they take.

* I wonder what happens if you seal their bits apart.

* heh, bleeding groom guy looks pretty .... harmless.... sorry

* 'you live long enough and ill tell you the story' sounds like some kind of immortal in-joke.

* Interesting, quite interesting.

It's setup a bunch of mystery and most of the characters from the OP seem to have shown up.

Judging by the framing setup with vice-monocle and Carol the flying pussyfoot is going to be the stage of some kind of falling out/power grab or something of a bunch of immortals.

>> ARTICLE
> I wonder what happens if you seal their bits apart.

That's actually explored later on. (Well, not exactly that, but you'll see.)

> 'you live long enough and ill tell you the story' sounds like some kind of immortal in-joke.

[Future Episode Spoilers](/s "I completely accidental in-joke, as a matter-of-fact.")
>> ARTICLE
> this show likes it's realistic violence

I'm quite glad they're just showing everything. It really helps set the mature tone. I wonder if they'll do any nudity. It's probably a bit of a stretch, but not necessarily out of the question.
>> ARTICLE
> heh, bleeding groom guy looks pretty .... harmless.... sorry

How dare you talk about Boss Ladd that way!
>> ARTICLE
First time I've ever participated in a rewatch, this is quite exciting. 

This was far different than I was expecting, plus that intro was so jazzy and cool with all the character introductions where I managed to remember a total of zero names. I was anticipating a complex and dense start, which is was, but when that guys fingers fell off and then came back on that was the last thing I was expecting. This is really interesting and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.

Tried the dub and did sound far better than others I've tried, but just preferred the Japanese dub. 
>> ARTICLE
Believe me after seeing the OP hmmm maybe for the 3rd of 4th time you will remember, but not because of the OP alone but because these characters are really memorable
>> ARTICLE
I just I hope that I can memorise names like Isaac and Carol easier than Kurotatsuyataru Hakumari
>> ARTICLE
don't worry about remembering the names of Isaac and Miria, it will be really easy, trust me. For the rest of the cast you will watch the op so many times that you will actually start to memorize their names because of that. 
>> ARTICLE
So it begins, one of my favourite anime, I already rewatched you a few months ago, but this time I will watch the dub instead of the sub.

First I want to say to everyone confused with this episode please stick with it, it is worth it. The first episode is the, in my opinion, only confusing episode because it starts the series on lose ends of stories. So I believe next episode we'll still have jumping around in time periods and several stories but they will be told chronological themself. 

Now to my impressions of the dub, I really really like it probably one of the best dubs I ever heared, but I already missed how the japanese voice actor of vice president says ["Carololu"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl8u_hZ3xQ0)
and also how "japanese" Isaac is saying ^[Spoiler ^next ^Episode] [Miria~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tqPHmlY7gk)
but apart from that really great dub.

By the way is it just me or does [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/mCQWWL8.png) look like a character straight out of Professor Layton?

Edit: Also this episode already has one of my[ favourite OST songs ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI76wS6tlKs).

Edit: some spelling and writing errors
>> ARTICLE
This will be my first time watching this show. Don't know what to expect. Synopsis makes no sense. Will update this as I watch the episode

Edit 1: That OP is brilliant 


Edit 2: Currently confused as hell

Edit 3: So the vice pres and carol are both historians trying to link the past?

Dont worry, Nerd, the first Episode of Baccano! is always confusing as hell.
No, the Vice- Pres and his Assistant are [](/s "Journalists")

Thanks.

It was my Pleasure ;)

Is it wrong that I knew that I would love this show the moment a poor kid's head got blown off? Good thing it all worked out for him in the end.

What an amazing episode! I actually watched it twice, just to remember all the characters and the relationships between each other. I'm really excited to know how this immortality business plays out. So far they are all pretty sympathetic for a bunch of thugs and mafiosi. We'll see how that goes.

Also, I love it when the framing device of a story discusses itself. That sequence was really well done. Are we going to see more of the two journalists?
>> ARTICLE
> Are we going to see more of the two journalists?

In the least-spoilery way I can answer this, yes, we are.
>> ARTICLE
This is going to be my first rewatch ever and i'm also a first time viewer of Baccano so I hope spoilers get tagged properly. I'm watching this with zero knowledge and i can say i'm pretty amused.

The OP, man that OP, looks like this is going to be a deep anime with tons of characters so I better pay attention or otherwise i will get lost. So far looks like the two periodists will explain a story of 1930 that involves a fight between a group of Mafia families and supernatural humans (wasn't expecting that at all).

Looks like there are a lot of interesting characters but let's see if they are able to develop them and not make it boring, but so far looks great. The only thing that bother me is that I won't be able to watch another episode until tomorrow and I usually like to watch more episodes so I hope that doesn't influence my opinion of the anime. See you tomorrow!

>> ARTICLE
Hopefully this will help the uninitiated of /r/anime understand the mistakes they made voting the Baccano! girls out in the best girl contest. Especially Miria.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget Isaac and Miria being voted out of the best couple contest. That was some bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
Ah yes. How could I forget that night? So much anger. After they were knocked out (I think there were a couple other Baccano! couples in that bracket, [like](/s "Claire and Chane") who'd already been eliminated) I sat there and cursed the universe and stopped caring about the best couple contest. 
>> ARTICLE
Same.
>> ARTICLE
It's been too long since I've watched my favorite show. This will be my second time watching but first time with the english dub.

**Episode 1**: Ahh, one of my favorite openings. Deep thoughts on rainbows. 1711, I think we'll get back to that. And the train. Firo, the MCish! That's not a flower. Time to heal. Looks like you don't want to mess with the Gandor family. Damn, forgot how much they show in this episode. No wonder I was confused back when I watched this the first time.

As for the dub. Wow, didn't realize it was this good. Firo sounded a bit iffy at the start for me but already got used to it. 
>> ARTICLE
Another rewatch! I'm excited. Mostly to be doing one of these again, but also for Baccano! Though I just want to say that I have no idea what this show is about. Gangsters, maybe. I think it's set in NY in the 1920s-1930s. That's really all I know. I mean it. I kept myself in the dark for this one. Oh, and like many others I'm sure, I shall be watching the dub (and would be even if everyone didn't praise it. Suck it, sub lovers! VIVA LA DUBS!) Here we go...

**Episode 1 -- The Vice President Doesn't Say Anything about the Possibility of Him Being the Main Character**

So many characters in this OP! It looks like Isaac [farted in this guy's direction.](http://i.imgur.com/YHCckEF.jpg) Oh, [Lua is quite lovely.](http://i.imgur.com/YS9RQla.jpg) Chane's probably gonna kill some people. Jacuzzi Splot is the best name I've ever heard, EVER, and he looks like he's in over his head. Good OP though. It'll probably be helpful to always see the character names, and the music was spot on.

This guy likes folding newspapers... OH GOD! Did he hit her?

Hahahaha! Holy shit! [He shot that kid's face off.](http://www.gfycat.com/AridDearestHammerheadshark) Wasn't expecting that. Haha, why am I laughing at this?

I really like [this shot.](http://i.imgur.com/MinSsiF.jpg) I mean, his arm is kind of blocky, but the background art is nice and quite detailed.

There's some [pretty graphic stuff](http://www.gfycat.com/KeenDisgustingGartersnake) so far. This guy's freakin' Majin Buu absorbing his fingers back.

This St. Germain guy is strange. A bit creepy too. What is a young girl like Carol doing with someone like him?

I love the ["exterminator's"](http://i.imgur.com/uxrj1bf.jpg) whistle theme. Powerful and creepy. (I tried making a webm of this, but failed. :( Only time will tell if I can figure it out and get on /u/The-Sublimer-One's level.)

Fearow (probably not spelled like the Pokemon, deal with it) seems pretty darn cool. Good VA. Good voice acting all around so far. I wonder how the Japanese did these accents, if at all.

[FEAROW NOOOOOOOOO!](http://www.gfycat.com/SmugTotalAnole)

Did the inspector say "immortals?" Interesting. Hmmm, like the guy who brought his fingers back.

Isaac too!!!! And holy hell, the kid who lost his face. I wonder what that feels like, to have your pulpy stew of a face glue itself back together.

[FEAROW YESSSSSSSSSS!](http://www.gfycat.com/AridSmoothAmericanwarmblood)

Lua's with some crazy guy. Cute face and a cute voice. Hope things work out for her.

And this mysterious kid. Seems like he's mature past his age or...

**Post Episode Thoughts**

Favorite character is Firo. Yeah, that's right. I can spell his name correctly. I went back and checked the OP, but that doesn't mean I'll continue to spell it correctly. ^You^can't^make^me I usually don't love a character right off the bat, but this guy is different. I'm not exactly sure why, but I'm definitely excited to keep watching him work.

I also can't wait for more Isaac x Miria. She looks like the biggest bundle of fun. I just want to hang out with her, like all the time, and I don't think I've seen more than 60 seconds of her. Those two are gonna be a blast to watch. Between them (mostly Miria) and Fearow, I don't think I've ever liked characters more after one episode of a show.

Talking about the episode itself, we are introduced to a *lot* of characters, and this is only the first episode. I didn't connect all the dots right away, but I think I've an understanding of it now. Good enough at least until I continue watching more. For example, Lua's husband, partner (like in crime), brother, whoever, Ladd, is the man who shot Czeslaw. Also, I didn't remember that Fearow was the one who had his fingers sliced, making him immortal. So when he got shot up I was all, "Son of a bitch. I actually liked this guy a lot, and they killed him already. This show is gonna be brutal." So then my excitement shot up to a FUCK YEAH/10 when he got up and kicked that thug in the face.

I liked the episode a lot, though. It was obviously a lot to take in for a first episode, but I can already tell this will likely be the second show that I could recommend to people who don't watch anime. The first, and only before this, was Psycho-Pass. Both are anime it seems people wouldn't be "weirded out" by.

**Thoughts on the Future**

[Going off of Czeslaw, the mysterious kid...](/s "I'm wondering how immortality works. Is it a mutation, or genetics, or something that is granted to people? Not sure yet. However, I'd say it's possible that you aren't born with it. Czeslaw seems like he's a smart kid. Been around the block, you might say. I reckon it's possible he was 'granted' immortality at his young age, and because of that, he's been alive for a long time. So for now I'm going with immortality stopping you from aging once you acquire it.")

**Bonus Gifs**

These aren't new gifs, just .gif versions of the gfycats. While I personally prefer gfycat to gif, I think a lot of people like gifs. They're good for reactions and stuff, and since they're smaller they come in handy. So while the main body of my posts will have gfycats, I'll still post .gifs for those who want them.

Also, feel free to shoot me a pm if you want anything specific made into a gif. I can likely do that for you. It's no prob.

> Suck it, sub lovers! VIVA LA DUBS!

Lol. Don't get overexcited, buddy. You know I agree with you, but that's a fast way to get downvoted on this sub.

> Jacuzzi Splot is the best name I've ever heard, EVER

Someone, somewhere is gonna change their name to that after watching this show. You know someone is weeb enough to do that.

> Only time will tell if I can figure it out and get on /u/The-Sublimer-One's level.

No one will ever be on my level of pissing off sub-exclusive watchers by making dub WebMs. But, seriously, I save them in .mp4 format, and upload them to https://pomf.cat/ (or http://webm.land/ if it's over 50 MB, that site severly compresses the quality).

> Hmmm, like the guy who brought his fingers back.

Lol. Did you already forget that the guy who reattached his fingers is Firo, the same guy who just got shot up to hell?

> Also, I didn't remember that Fearow was the one who had his fingers sliced, making him immortal.

Apparently so.

> "Son of a bitch. I actually liked this guy a lot, and they killed him already. This show is gonna be brutal."

Don't worry. This anime isn't written by Urobutcher or *the other one.*

Also, thanks for mentioning my name in the post. I wouldn't have known this was posted early, otherwise.

Oh, I know. It was mostly in jest. 'Tis a silly feud.

I'll take a small amount of responsibility for that. I remember in the CG rewatch you started posting webms after I started posting gfycats. I will try out those sites if I ever need to make another webm, so thanks for that info.

> Did you already forget that the guy who reattached his fingers is Firo... Apparently so.

Yeah. I did. There was just SO much to keep track of in the first episode. He mentioned his name when his fingers were sliced, but it just went over my head.

Don't worry, you'll understand it more after a few more episodes.  I was super confused after my first time through as well.
>> ARTICLE
As expected, the newtimers don't have a clue of what's going on. And that's alright. This is a really strange episode to start out on. We start out with a meta-analysis of the show before it has even begun, as well as disjointed scenes from all of the subplots. Also, [](/s "most of those scenes were spoilers. It may seem pointless to use a spoiler tag if the show spoils itself. However, without any context, its not really clear how spoilery this whole episode is to newcomers.").

Anyways, to you newcomers out there, things will start to become more coherent from here. The plot is still totally disjointed, but at least you'll have more context for each scene in the future. Here's all you really need to remember from this episode:

* There are a lot of characters and subplots.
* There are folks who don't know how to stay dead.
* Bad shit happens on the Flying Pussyfoot.
* Never name a train the Flying Pussyfoot. It's a hilarious, but awful name for a train.

Also, near the end of the show, it might be worth re-watching this one again.

I forgot how much I loved this show :D  I also forgot how dated the animation looks lol.

[Minor spoiler/PSA for first time watchers](/s "Adele (the woman with the spear) and several characters in the background (basically everyone who does not show up in the OP and is not one of Jacuzzi's friends)  iirc they are from the novel storyline that chronologically takes place directly after the events of the series.  I think they only put that clip in there to showcase Isaac and Miria.")

Its been a while since Ive watched the show, so Im really looking forwards to this rewatch! I have been rereading the LNs very slowly recently though, so hopefully some of it is fresh in my mind to some extent. Ill be watching the dub, not the sub, since I think its absolutely fantastic. 


I think the framing device for the show is pretty interesting, probably because it's just so meta-literary, as it's a discussion about how best to present a story! I do miss the framing device for The Rolling Bootlegs, with [LN #1](/s "the revelation that it was Firo telling the story all along!") But I guess since the show combines 3/4 plot threads, they needed a 3rd party who would be likely to know about all of the events. And I do like Gustave St Germain. Though his voice actor being Father from FMA:B is now throwing me off slightly! Ive always wondered exactly how old is CaroleI know there were no child labour laws back then, but she seems really young! 


The first time I watched this episode, I was pretty confused, but I think now, watching it for the second time, there is a definite structure to the random scenes in the second half - for example, it begins with a set of scenes about the Runorata/Gandor feud, and then uses the scene in the bookshop to transition into scenes that all seem to involve people healing after they've been injured. It is far less disorganised than I thought. I do think it's definitely worth watching episode 1 again after you've seen the series, although [mild anime spoilers](/s "not all of the scenes will make sense even then - the scene where Isaac gets injured isn't covered within the timeline of the anime, and is in fact from the 1933 arc. I'm glad it was animated though, because it gives us a quick look at some characters not in the anime, especially my fave Maria who was unfairly cut from the 1932 arc.")


And now for my thoughts on the OP and ED - because, hey, the first episode is the best place to put them! 


OP: This is basically one of my favourite OPs ever  probably up there with Tank. I love the jazzy music, I love the transitions, I love the little eye-catch thingys with everyones name on  its definitely a plus in a series this confusing. In a lot of ways, its very similar to DRRR!!s openings, which isnt surprising since the director of both animes directed each OP, but I just think Baccano pulls it off better. [anime spoilers](/s "and upon rewatch, or in later episodes, you can get a lot more out of it. The main thing is that the one character whom the camera focuses over but isnt named, is Claire! But Dallas fate is also shown in the opening and Ennis identity as a homunculus is hinted at by her presence in the bottleits really very clever.")


ED: The first time I watched this show, I disliked the ED. I thought it was extremely boring and slow and almost always skipped it. I think it has grown on me a lot, actually  but I do think the contrast between the frantic pace of the show and the slow ending might just be too great. Still, it is a beautiful song, with all the hallmarks of a Kajiura power ballad. The animation isnt anything special though, just some pictures of the gigantic cast. 


Super excited about this rewatch!

Now, I really want to participate in this rewatch and I would like to watch it with the english dub. However, every site I go on that has the  dub is really quiet for some reason. Because of my hearing loss, I was wondering if there were any websites that would have the english dub but with reliable closed captioning. Does such a site even exist?
>> ARTICLE
Lol "series of strange events that began back in November of 1930" sounds really awkward coming from what looks and sounds like a small child.

Decent first episode. Don't think I caught everything (I'm fairly certain that details like the newspaper folding has some significance), but I think I got the gist of it.

Firo (actually had to look this up because I thought it was Viro or Iral) seems like he'll be the "main" MC the same way Mikado was in Durarara!! (He's already far more fun and interesting a character than Mikado was at first though, and seems like he'll get even better as the show goes on.).
>> ARTICLE
I think I recognize the VAs for FMA Brotherhood's Father and Pride in this, but I could be mistaken... Either way, the dub kicks ass.

Anyway, I love this. Gangsters, immortals and a train called the Flying Pussyfoot. Wonderful.
>> ARTICLE
Show reminds me alot of Durarara, its told in many perspectives and not just one and I like that.
>> ARTICLE
Funny enough, this is made from the creator of Durarara!!, but this was his first work.
>> ARTICLE
He also loves exclamation points, which is why it's Bacanno! and Durarara!!
>> ARTICLE
First off, I loved the OP and plan on listening to it more.
I'm going into this series blind, and so far the soundtrack (smooth jazz ftw) and interesting setting really stand out to me. 

I also really liked the exploration of literary tropes in the first few minutes of the episode. We don't think about it too often, but the chosen chronological starting point and perspective used both have a major impact on how we view a story, and this isn't really something I see explored in anime very often, so I'm excited to see if that's a recurring theme. The self awareness found in that scene (especially the episode's title) was also great.

The rest of the episode was admittedly confusing (there's a lot of different characters and plot elements introduced), but overall I enjoyed it, particularly the concept of the immortals. I think this is going to be an interesting series.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest I'm not too crazy about it so far. There is no clear plot and there are about 15 different characters to keep track of in different locations and times which is confusing. It could easily still be a good show but I really didn't like that first episode because it was just all over the place.
>> ARTICLE
I don't get anything...
>> ARTICLE
This will be my first time watching the show, and it's definitely interesting!

I knew a bit about the storyline beforehand, but didn't expect the Supernatural part of it! A lot of cool characters like Isaac, Miria, and Firo whose name I recognize from r/anime's anime contests. And by recommendation, I'll definitely watch the dub.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to try watching the dub for this this time. I didn't make it all the way through the series the first time I tried to watch it, so we'll see how it goes this time around. :/
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I watched all Baccano! episodes yesterday, I won't watch Baccano again this month.

First episode: The episode is a HUGE SPOILER. That's it.
>> ARTICLE
Dang, I didn't realize there was gonna be a rewatch of this. I heard good things about this anime, and I never really joined in on these rewatches before, so why not. So is this like an episode a day thing, or what is the schedule for this?

But man, what a first episode. Loved that opening. I really like the story telling. Can't really tell if I can trust the narrator, really not sure whether this is a fictional story the vice president is telling the kid honestly. But I may be just not following things right. The way its told, which feels like a bunch of separate but connected stories, and the number of characters in it sorta made it hard for me to follow. But I'll probably pick up whats going on better by the next episode. I like stories that deal with the mafia a bit, so I'm excited to keep watching it.
>> ARTICLE
It's an episode a day for the first 8 episodes, then 2 per day for the last 8. 
>> ARTICLE
So. Many. Characters!

[](#kininarimasu)

Watching Baccano for the first time and it's safe to say that I'm lost but am looking forward to unraveling the story bit by bit. It's a refreshing change from shows where the entire premise is just dumped on you in the first episode. 

Really liking the supernatural element and the meta commentary by Carol and Grumpy-face. Hope we get to find out why there are immortals in 1930s America. 

Watching a dub requires way more concentration, but on the plus side it made me pay more attention to the soundtrack, which was great. 

This show seems very ambitious, in a good way. Can't wait to watch the next episode!
>> ARTICLE
My First time watching this, sadly due to a vacation I can't join in for the rest, but I'm gonna binge this to completion once I return. My first thoughts was it seems like old fashioned Durarara! mainly because the OP with the names, the magic people in normal everyday life, and the massive list of characters, who seem to have no connection, but probably end up connecting to one another at some point.   But then again DRRR! is one of my favorite anime, so this will definitley be fun to watch.
>> ARTICLE
The LN's for DRRR and Baccano were both written by the same person.
>> ARTICLE
First time watching *Baccano*. It's funny, because I actually own it on DVD because it went on a crazy sale a while back, and I'd heard so many good things about it, and also enjoyed *Durarara*, so I figured I couldn't be disappointed.

Anyway, the first episode. In a lot of ways, I have the same issues with the first episode of this show that I have with the first few episodes of *True Detective* Season 2 and the Netflix show *Sense8*. I'm not a huge fan of presenting the audience with a whole bunch of mysterious happenings, but no real meat only to drip, drip, drip explain what's going on later in the show.

Of course, it's only episode one, and I have some experience with *Durarara*, so I expect there will be many flashbacks and multiple viewpoints on everything that has happened, and will happen. In a way, the opening explanation by the Vice President reminded me a bit of the premise of the movie *Rashomon* where, the various viewpoints of a single event will drastically change the audience's experience of what happened. 

I hope that as the series goes on, the individual stories of the characters involved will become more interesting, and I'll be pulled into the overall story. I don't think episode 1 did a great job of that.

I watched the Japanese subbed version to start, but I'm going to go back and watch episode 1 dubbed to see if I like it better, since so many people here are recommending it. Also, I just think because of the general amount of quick cuts to imagery and characters we haven't seen before that occur in this episode, I might be better off listening to an English dub so I can fully concentrate on what's being shown to me.

This seems like a show dense enough that multiple viewings will be required to fully understand it. Excited to watch with everyone!

Edit: Finished rewatching the English dub version. Have to say I enjoyed the first episode a lot more the second time watching. The English dub added a lot of flavor to the dialogue that the subs just didn't have, and made the show feel a lot more authentic to a 30s gangster crime drama. Also, caught quite a few things that I missed while I was reading subs the first time through. Todd Haberkorn also sounds GREAT as Firo. Will definitely watch dubbed the rest of the way through.
>> ARTICLE
I recently watched it.
It's the best non linear show ever created.  It's simply jumps to different times a lot which all makes sense in the end.
The crazy characters and insane storyline is all very unique.
Tremendously enjoyed you just have to let go and enjoy the ride.

Cool. I definitely will.

A great first epsiode to a great series. This will be the second time I've watched Baccano! and I'm really enjoying the Dubbed version. Anyone new to the show will probably come out more confused than anything else after this episode, but after watching it once already the most important thing to remember is with Baccano! it is not the destination, but the journey that is most important.

For first time watchers, I started the show a few weeks ago and I'm already at episode 13 (haven't watch the special OVAs). The first time I watched the first episode I was lost, I didn't like it at all (Except for the part where the guy repeats carol's name like a pervert), if you feel the same, go watch the second episode, that one picks the pace up to something more digestible and the show starts to make more sense and gets really interesting.

I've gotten pretty big into anime in the last year or so--as in a serious watcher. I've never actually seen Baccano! Before, but I'm a big fan of the party that made it! I was planning on watching it at some point, but I guess this is perfect for me! I'm quite excited.

Additionally, this will actually be my first watch (er..rewatch) of a show (minus those ongoing) with the sub.  So it'll be one episode a day for 8 episodes, then two a day? I read that correctly?

In theory the dubs should be the better choice. Alas, they still suffer from what I find is the biggest problem with a dub: the feeling of being dubbed over a scene than being voiced into a scene.  Just feels like it's on a different layet from the soundtrack.  Anyway I'd recommend the subs definitely.

I know everyone likes the dub, but for me, it came down to what made me enjoy Isaac and Miria. Which meant I jumped back and forward between subs and dubs for a while....

It's hard to not spoil all the best parts if you want to know the difference, but here's a brief comparison that doesn't contain major spoilers (just don't watch all the through the dubbed if you don't want any context).

What did you like about it?
>> ARTICLE
The storytelling was really unique, especially how everything fit together at the end and how no one was really the main character. Can you really not see how it can be someone's favorite anime? 

I mean you gave shit like Oreimo, SAO 2, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, Attack on Titan, ~~Toradora~~, and Guilty Crown 10's. It's easier to justify giving something like Baccano! 10 than any one of those shows. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but I can't see how it could be someone's favorite anime, that's why I asked in the first place. \^\^

I don't rate anime on how good they are, but on how much I enjoyed them. The anime you've listed are probably far away from perfect, but I had a lot of fun watching them, thus the 10's.

Edit: Funny how you gave them 8's and 9's (4/4.5's) and call them "shit" 
>> ARTICLE
MAL works differently than anime-planet. Don't translate the scores one to one. I use anime-planet more as a way to track what I have watched and what I haven't than as a serious metric for rating shows. 

A 3.5 means it was rather disappointing. 

A 4 means it was okay, like a check mark. 

A 4.5 means I enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything special. 

A 5 means it stood out to me, and I really enjoyed it and wouldn't mind a rewatch. 

If I was using MAL's scale, my scores would change quite a bit from what they are now. 5's probably won't change much, but the rest would go way lower than a 3.5, which is equivalent to a 7 (btw, that's absurd and why you can't make the one to one conversion). 

Another thing is I give 4.5's pretty often, but I'm more careful about 5's. Even if I enjoyed the show greatly, but I knew that the show was objectively not worth a perfect score, I won't give it. So maybe you saw me give one of those shows a 4.5. But I would NEVER give that same show a 5. No matter how much I might have enjoyed Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, for example, giving it a perfect score just doesn't feel right. 

Edit: Now that I think about it, if I was using MAL, 3.5 would be 5 and below. 4's would be between 5 and 7. 4.5's would be between 7 and 9. 5's between 9 and 10. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah yea right. What? That doesn't make any sense lol.
Is a .5 on AP then a -3 on MAL? ;-)
>> ARTICLE
No, if you looked at my ratings, you'd see they don't go that low...what's the point of rating 0.5 stars on anime-planet if I'm using its rating system to separate shows into categories? 3.5 means bad. 4 means okay. 4.5 means good. 5 means superb. Now you're just trolling me. 
>> ARTICLE
If you rate a show based on how much you enjoyed that show, which is by the way what most people do, then why bother asking how Baccano! could be someone's favorite anime? If anything, it suggests that you don't actually believe that someone could enjoy a show you didn't enjoy that much. 
>> ARTICLE
Um, on your MAL, are you using "no humor" and "no drama" as reasons for why Baccano is bad? 

First off, that's not true. Second, why would that matter at all?

Fair enough. I'm not saying Toradora! was a poorly done show. Just seemed to be a stretch to rate it a 10. I'll edit it out if it bothers you that much.

Um... All of it?
>> ARTICLE
Narita's best work. I agree with you.
>> ARTICLE
I just wish people just stick with it instead of dropping to get the whole story.
>> ARTICLE
usually they drop it because of how confusing the first episodes are :c      
it is a fun watch!!!
>> ARTICLE
As someone who has dropped it I almost fully agree.
>> ARTICLE
Was it really that confusing?  I dont remember that my first time. But Im one of those people  who  loved it all the way through
>> ARTICLE
That fucking bottle that gets passed around...
>> ARTICLE
if i remember the first episode is kind of a clusterfuck that introduces like a dozen characters.      
Kind of a turn off so people drop it.      
The dub is really good though, highly recommend the dub.
>> ARTICLE
Isaac and Miria in the sub are just not the same to me. I know some people disagree, but I *adore* their dub voices. 

On a somewhat related note, I always felt that Baccano! might be the easiest anime to adapt into a legitimate Broadway show. It'd be fun to write up a script treatment for that one.
>> ARTICLE
I could be bias since I watched the sub first, but their interactions are still great but fall a bit short for me in the dub. The VAs for them in the sub just make me as happy as the characters do for people in the show. It's hard to explain.

 The dub is good, I watched one episode in the dub because of this thread. But the sub feels perfect for those characters. The lack of accents doesn't bother me in the slightest. 
>> ARTICLE
> I know some people disagree, but I adore their dub voices.

Ditto. I listened to their sub voices, and while they are both very good, I don't get the overwhelming amazingness I've seen others talk about that would make me want to watch is subbed just for them.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if you scramble the episodes and watch in a different order with the last episode as the last, would the story still make sense?
>> ARTICLE
Probably. It would be funny for the last episode to end with the first episode's halfway point.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely, but you have to remember that some episodes jump between years a lot and the plot relies on the mixed view. I mean, if you knew everything that happened on that important ship before you even see a scene not on the ship, you'll see a lot of big spoilers.

It'll also kind of ruin the pacing. The story makes sense either way, but the way it was presented was designed to keep your interest going, like how the first episode has a few scenes that are supposed to make you think "How did things/that guy end up like this?", and the scenes are a lot less important/interesting when you know what happened already. Some shows are just as good in chronological order, but Baccano really is best in release order.
>> ARTICLE
It was just a thought. Since the series goes back and forth, I was just wondering if it would still make sense, but you're right on that spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
/u/DasTales, the timing is perfect

The dub for Baccano! is beyond top-notch, it's not only one of the best dubs ever but one of the few shows I think are better dubbed than subbed.

Oh no! This is terrible! Everyone on /r/anime is going to be devoured by the railtraceh!

Well. I just finished a rewatch yesterday. But I guess I can still shill Yen Press' recent licensing of the light novels.

This may be a stupid question but, is there a site that has Baccano dubbed but also with the english subtitles?
or spanish.

Baccano is so damn cool.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. This is happening!
>> ARTICLE
Now I can watch it for the first time I guess haha
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen this show yet, so I guess I'll jump on this bandwagon.
>> ARTICLE
Lucky timing for me. I was going to start watching Baccano for the first time today but I guess I will put it off until next week :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm new here but wouldn't it be cool to actually watch it together in some stream or something? 
>> ARTICLE
Lol. You must really be new here. With some of the massive essays some people write, doing a group live stream would just never work out.
>> ARTICLE
Well that's why I said "I'm new here" lol, never expected massive essays though
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Some of these people are really dedicated... Myself included.
>> ARTICLE
Alternatively, watch the whole show in one day. It's short enough to do it (if you have the time), and it has a quick pace that keeps you wanting more.

I won't be taking part in the rewatch, as Baccano is a show I like to watch around late winter/early spring, but I will be rewatching in spirit!
>> ARTICLE
I have never watched Baccano, so this will be very interesting!
>> ARTICLE
same here hoping for a nice wild ride

"Plus, since I finally know what I'm truly passionate about in my life, I'd like to focus on that in the future."

What is your passion?
>> ARTICLE
Journalism in video games. But honestly, I still need to explore more on that front to see what I actually want.
>> ARTICLE
So as in being a video game journalist? Or how journalism is depicted in video games?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, something like that. It's just... I *really* love video games. Most people love video games too, that's for sure, but for me, it's something truly special that I want to keep on experiencing and talking about them for the rest of my life. That's how much I love about them. Do I want to develop video games? Well, depends. Didn't really enjoy my time making rather basic games at school, but maybe I still need to see what is it that I want to do in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing wrong with that. Video games are amazing and if your heart lies there, go for it. 

As a graduate student in history of all things, I truly believe in following one's passion.  I wish you the best of luck. 
>> ARTICLE
Would this be worth doing as it's my first time watching, or is it reasonable to assume that the threads will be spoiler territory?

Rewatches are made for people watching for the first time as well! If there are any spoilers (and let's be honest there will be) they should all be properly spoiler tagged.

Awesome, just making sure as I don't want to stop people from having spoiler discussions but obviously don't want to be spoiled as well :p
>> ARTICLE
I only watched Baccano! for the first time a month or so ago, and immediately after I finished it I started to watch it again together with my mum. We finished it around 2 weeks ago now, but I feel like I'll still join in on this rewatch. I picked up so many things on my second watch, and I'm sure I'll pick up some more on my third! 
>> ARTICLE
Oh great gonna watch it first time with you guys, love Durarara!! so Baccano must be awesome as well.
>> ARTICLE
The show was reccomended to me because I enjoyed Durarara, guess it's about time I watch this.
>> ARTICLE
Oh come onnn, I just started watching Baccano this week!
>> ARTICLE
I need to watch Baccano!, so I'll be joining.
>> ARTICLE
This will finally push me over the edge to start watching Baccano!.
>> ARTICLE
I've been waiting for an excuse to watch Baccano!, since I've heard it's apparently like an even better Durarara!!, the first season of which I loved (The sequels have been good, too, but something just feels off for me when compared with the original season).

Also, sad to see you go, u/angel10701. While I haven't participated in these rewatches before as a contributor, I've read through many of them, and I know from experience they're a great way for people to be introduced to older shows without episode discussion threads.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen durarara before bacanno and I have to say, I liked durarara better :). I was really confused for like the first 6 episodes of baccano, so much was happening.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished the first season of Durarara and had to take a little break. The story was pretty tight so I don't know how good it will compare moving forward.  

The password to Dollars being baccano pretty much made it one of my next watches, and now I know when it will start.  

: )
>> ARTICLE
I just finished today for the first time, wnat to know what do you guys think! And maybe I will have a different view already knowing how the story unfolds
>> ARTICLE
Maybe this will get me to finally pick Baccano back up. I put it on hold after the first episode back in January and never got around to it...
>> ARTICLE
Woo I'm excited! Love this show. This is my first rewatch for this sub, if you're not doing it any more who else does?

I'll probably jump on this too, I've been meaning to finish Baccano for a while now.

I guess I know when I'm going to start watching this, then.
>> ARTICLE
This is just the excuse I need to start watching this show.  
>> ARTICLE
Yesss, finally, it has been in my hard drive for months. I think I'll join. I was planning to start watching after I finished the shows I'm currently watching, but there isn't any better time than this to start watching.

But I have a question: People say the dub is better for this show, but I still wanna watch it subbed, so is the sub still watchable (good) although it's not as good as the dub?
>> ARTICLE
I watched the sub originally and then dub when I rewatched it. The only other dubs I've ever watched were Death Note and Panty and Stocking (which were really good), and I'm very much a 'sub over dub' person. I really enjoyed the series subbed, it had a lot of voice actors I really like who I thought really fit their characters. When I watched the dub though, after the initial getting used to all the voices being different, I had to admit that the dub was better. All the accents were so perfect and fit in so well with the American setting. That said, if you want to watch the sub then go for it. I think they're both really good, and they both have different stand out voices. For example, in the dub I found Firo and all the Gandors to have the most perfect voices. But in the sub, I would say the same for Graham and Ladd in particular. I've started to ramble a bit I think but point is: both the sub and dub are really good, so whichever one you watch you'll like it. And hey, this is the kind of show that's perfect for a rewatch, so you might even end up watching the one you don't pick later anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
I think, I may give the dub a shot for the first time then. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I am so in for this! As some of you may know, Baccano! is one of my favourite series.

The Code Geass rewatch was my first time watching the show, and it was a good time.  Ended up dropping out of Gurren Lagann due to falling behind too much.  This time, no excuses!  It'll be fun.

#*JIBUUUUUN WOOOOO*
>> ARTICLE
Please pick TTGL up again! It's one of my favorites so it makes me sad to see you say that. :'(
>> ARTICLE
I will eventually!  The reason I fell behind was because my sister wanted to watch it with me, but her show schedule at the time was weird and she gets upset when I watch things before her.  We also couldn't agree on sub/dub as the cherry on top.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend the TTGL dub just to hear Steve Blum as Leeron.
>> ARTICLE
I did get the chance to watch a few random episodes here and there when TTGL was on Toonami, and Leeron's English voice seemed like a very good fit based on what I saw.  Might be at the top of the pros/cons list for the dub (on the pros side).

**First time viewer:** This episode was a lot easier to follow than the first one, and it does a great job of setting up a sense of suspense; I can't wait to see how things go down in the next one.

I thought they kept ordering chinese because they misunderstood what all-you-can-eat means.

Well, that too.
>> ARTICLE
How do you figure they're ordering it because he's Chinese and not because they like Chinese food?

Also, are you sure he's Chinese? Not saying your wrong on that point, its just that I've never noticed that while watching this before and even while focusing on him he doesn't necessarily seem Chinese to me.
>> ARTICLE
In the second light novel "The Grand Punk Railroad - Local Episode," the cook (whose name has been translated as either Fan or Fang depending on the translator), and the bartender (Ian in the anime, John in the LNs) are described thusly:

> *The Asian man was Fang, and the Irishman was John. A Chinese-American and Irish immigrant duo was rather unusual for this time period, but both of them had been driven out of their respective communities after causing some sorts of trouble.*

So in the Light Novels he's definitely of Chinese heritage. 
>> ARTICLE
That answers that question, and I've been meaning to read the LN"s.

But is there anything to suggest that they're ordering Chinese food because he's Chinese.
>> ARTICLE
No, the LNs and the anime don't suggest that at all. Isaac and Miria don't mention Fang at all. 

An alternate explanation for the specific cuisine is that Isaac and Miria seem to have some fascination with various(ly vague) Asian themes and cultures. Their constant references to "the Orient," Miria's unexplained ability to speak Japanese--

>  Yaguruma, who'd immigrated over from Japan, muttered quietly to himself from Firo's side.
"I wonder how Miss Miria came to know Japanese so well..." (said after Miria unleashed a flurry of Japanese insults towards Firo)

--and somehow knowing (though, of course, their comprehension is  warped) some Japanese history and mythology...all are evidence of this. Based on their interest in (vaguely Chinese) and Japanese food and culture, it wouldn't be too unreasonable for them to have a predilection for Chinese and Japanese food. 
>> ARTICLE
> Miria's unexplained ability to speak Japanese

The original version of that is like the Japanese version of [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKpZvO0j6RI) from K-On.
>> ARTICLE
Now that makes sense. The original comment just threw me off a little when it referred to them as possibly being racist.

>Miria's unexplained ability to speak Japanese--

That seems like such an Isaac and Miria thing.

Thank you good sir

Dooooooo iiiiiiiiiittttttt...

Nothing is impossible

So just Do it
>> ARTICLE
Err....well...I guess I'm not gonna top this so I'll just chime in with my own 2. 

Looking at [this](https://a.pomf.cat/cejzoz.mp4) WebM in particular, something that came to mind when I watched the scene in the episode is that because of Baccano's cast the tone can be changed at the drop of a hat without it being too jarring. Jacuzzi can swap it from being serious or joke-y to an anxiety-filled build up, Isaac and Miria can swap it from any tone to any other tone, etc. 

Something I've found interesting. I'm also surprised that you didn't show off Ladd & his gang's introduction more, though to be fair then you might as well have just WebM'd the entire episode. 

Side-note, how do you make your WebMs in English? I was fiddling with it a bit before and couldn't quite figure it out. Cheers.

Ladd is so fantastic. Bomb? Nothing bad can happen, right? "Isaac, you are so smart!" -only Miria. First time the rail tracer is mentioned. Shit seems to be about to go down. Hmm, I wonder how this'll get resolved.

Yes, the episode 2 is quite different from the first. More linear, like a calm before the storm...
>> ARTICLE
I love this episode, primarily because I love Isaac and Miria a lot. Their crazy logic always has me laughing, especially Isaac's explanation of a train robbery: Wait, let me see if I can remember how to do thisfirst we take the train to our destination, right? Yeahand then we do the robbery, and then we get back on the train,  and then leave, right? Thats the way theyve been done for years!  Oh, you two. But I love how relentlessly positive they are, even whilst robbing members of the mafia. 


But I also have a soft spot in my heart for Jacuzzi and Nice. I get why people would dislike Jacuzzi, especially after this episode where he just...cries a lot, but I found him endearing from the get-go. His dynamic with Nice is really interesting, and all of his interactions with Isaac and Miria are great. Though he does have an absolutely ridiculous name. 


THE RAIL TRACEAH. I love Isaac and Miria's horror story faces. 


Overall, this episode is pretty cohesive! It pretty much all takes place in 1931, and the majority of it takes place on the platform, or on the Flying Pussyfoot itself.

> Though he does have an absolutely ridiculous name. 

Yeah, absolutely ridiculously awesome.

I enjoyed [this Baccano! abridgement's interpretation of 'Lua-vision'](https://youtu.be/uI6cBCfEVEg?t=298), though I think there's more to Lua than what people like to think. She does genuinely care for Ladd and is terrified at the thought of losing him/him dying. I'm always interested whenever we catch a glimpse of her in the LNs.

So second episode....

This was more structured, and easier to follow, even if they still talk in riddles sometimes that doesn't make sense if you don't know the whole story...

First I want to say that the VA for Nice is great, she is my favourite voice in this dub in the moment.

Second Miria and Isaac are still the greatest comedic couple in anime, the two just have a great dynamic and fit each other so perfectly


next onto Czeslaw [Major Spoiler](/s "poor guy must have been scared shitless after being touched on the head by Nice, after he discovered that there is an immortal among those people")
http://i.imgur.com/NZXIgUd.png picture is related to the spoiler

And last but not least Jacuzzi, poor guy I already see people complaining about his whiny nature, but I can't blame them he really is a big crybaby.

Oh and not to forget Ladd I am really excited to see what first impression he made, but maybe that's to early for that.

I'd have to say Ed Blaylock as Fuhrer King Bradl-I mean the train conductor was my favorite VA of the episode, of only because I freaked out when I recognized him. Can't believe I didn't catch that the first time.

**Episode 2 -- Setting the Old Woman's Qualms Aside, the Flying Pussyfoot Departs**

This lady is smart, and is she Frieza?

Stealing life from the Earth. Ambitious.

["Even though we've done nothing, I'm so inspired!"](http://i.imgur.com/bnRYBKX.jpg) Just like real life except Miria will likely do things while the rest of us keep doing nothing.

Ennis says people were "created" before her.

[Hammock flip!](http://www.gfycat.com/PoliticalSilverGalago) Sweet moves, Miria. [Hammock bounce!](http://www.gfycat.com/BrokenGiganticHarborseal)

Rob a train. "That's a good idea." Saying it like it's no big deal.

[Baseball antics.](http://www.gfycat.com/NaughtyThunderousHammerheadshark) These two are hilarious!

Jacuzzi and Nice, what's up with their faces? Burns?

Poor conductor. :(

The "item" is a bomb. Not sure if I believe that. I mean, it could be a bomb, but I think it might be something to do with all this immortality biz.

Nice (pronounced "Neese") has those markings everywhere. Jacuzzi has on a long sleeve shirt. I wonder if he is the same. He's also really high strung.

[Isaac ^dat ^jawline and Miria.](http://i.imgur.com/0tydwK2.jpg) Seriously. These two are so wonderful. They're always perfectly in sync.

Ok, so immortality is obtained it would seem. We've seen a few immortals already. Wonder how they all got eternal life.

Jacuzzi is going to inadvertently prevent the worst from happening because he was spooked by some story Isaac told.

Oh. That's it? I want more.

**Post Episode Thoughts / Thoughts on the Future**

Fun episode. I guess we'll start seeing how everything occurred leading up to the events in episode 1. So many important people all on this one train. I wonder how many of them know who the immortals are. None of them have really let on that they do, besides the Ghosts, maybe sort of. And Isaac and Miria seem to know people in the immortal business, but aren't yet directly involved themselves.

[Thoughts on the future](/s "The leader of the Ghosts is going to make a power grab by finding the other immortals and killing them. If he isn't already mixed in with the mob somehow, he will be now. The immortals in the mob families will eventually be outed causing tension between members. All hell breaks loose, and everyone fights for power.")

I really can't wait for Miria and Isaac to meet up with [Firo.](http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/fearow.jpg) Boy, do I hope they do.

I also made a simple [wallpaper](http://i.imgur.com/Uy80Vm7.png) out of the mid-card. Also this [gif](http://i.imgur.com/6gIsCP1.gifv) of Isaac giving a thumbs up. --[gfycat version](http://www.gfycat.com/RequiredScratchyLarva)

[Durarara Spoiler](/s "Unfortunately, the dub uses different VAs for Isaac and Miria's cameo. Why couldn't they just get the original VAs?").
>> ARTICLE
Baccano was dubbed by Funi and DRRR was dubbed by Aniplex. It probably wasn't worth the money on Aniplex's end to fly J. Michael Tatum and Caitlin Glass from Texas to California, although I wish they had. 
>> ARTICLE
True, I guess Aniplex just helped with distributing Baccano. I still don't understand why location is still such a big issue with voice acting in the internet age. 

Granted, I have no clue how the industry works. I know you need a sound booth, you can't just have VAs phone it in with crappy webcam mics. But there's probably a recording studio in just about every state. I don't understand why anime, video game, and cartoon companies don't just rent out recording studios closer to the VAs. Then again, that's probably a stupid idea, since I have no clue about all the other stuff that goes into voice acting.
>> ARTICLE
Aniplex has the distribution rights for the BluRay's

All though I am no expert in the workings of the VA industry I will try to provide an explanation.

All though there is probably a recording booth in every state, either the VA's have to go to the ADR Director or the ADR Director has to come to the VA"s and Aniplex may have decided it would cost to much to get all three in the same location just to do a few lines. 

From what I understand the VA's who work in California are a part of a union and the VA's in Texas are not and that probably creates some problems. 

Tatum and Glass may also have some sort of contract with Funimation since they do so much work for them (I can't think of any of their roles that are not titles licensed by Funimation) and that may of prevented them in some way from working with Anipex or the recording studio that Aniplex was using. 

There is also a possibility the both Tatum and Glass were unavailable at the time the DRRR dub was being recorded or they could've turned Aniplex down.

These are all speculation and it's possible that none of them are true. But I would bet that it's one of these situations. To my knowledge the reason Tatum and Glass were not in the DRRR dub is not publicly known so we may never know.
>> ARTICLE
I never see people mention this, but the first time I watched Durarara I noticed that scenes from Baccano are always playing up on the big screens on the skyscrapers and stuff.
>> ARTICLE
People always praise the dub, but watching it with subs is great as well. Isaac's and Miria's "Ne, Isaac?", "Nandai, Miria?" and "SUGOOI, ISAAC!" are iconic, and Kobayashi Yuu as Nice is always great. Also I think that Jacuzzi's Japanese VA doesn't make him sound as annoying as the English VA.
>> ARTICLE
Just watched episodes 1-2. This is my first time watching the show.

So far, I'm enjoying it. I've heard that the initial episodes sort of make this show kind of hard to get into, but I am absolutely intrigued. I love that they're such a huge cast of characters and I'm definitely glad that I took everyone's advice and decided to listen to the dub. It's very well done!

I'm very interested in all this immortals business. Also, I wonder why the kid gave his full name? The alarm with which he gave it up made it seem as though he couldn't help himself but say it. Are immortals forced to sort of identify themselves amongst each other? I guess they can sort of fill each other's presence. 

I also love the non-linear narrative.

It's no problem if you as a first timer express your thoughts, because you can just speculate, but everyone rewatching I'd like to be careful with spoilers.

So it looks like the newcomers are having an easier time with this one. For one thing, this episode only focuses on the Flying Pussyfoot subplot. Also, we finally have proper character introductions. We meet our pair of eccentric thieves, Isaac and Miria. How do these two even pay for food if they spend months mining for nothing. 

Oh well. We also meet the other passengers of the train. We already know Czeslaw's up to something, but we now get to meet Jacuzzi's friends, the Lemure cult, and Ladd Russo and his goons. Poor Tony, he was literally one day away from retirement [Spoiler](/s "Also, I think Tony's the only innocent person to die in the Flying Pussyfoot subplot"). Also, Ladd Russo is such a ham, and he'll just keep on getting better. So the Flying Pussyfoot has left the station, and we already have two casualties.

Ok Ladds VA is great, he really got me excited as him and grinning like an idiot in the scene before the title of the episode. Ladd is one of the best sociopaths in fiction in my opinion. I don't know how the author managed to make such a heartless monster so likeable. He only gets topped by [character not revealed yet](/s "Vino") in my opinion.

Also the dining car scene is so gruesome but one of Ladds greatest moments.


The search of Dallas Genoard (or Eve Genoards story) 1931-1932  
involved characters:

* Eve Genoard and her household
* Dallas Genoard
* the brokers of the Daily Day
* the Runorata Family


The horror on the Flying Pussyfoot 1931
involved characters:

* Lua Klein and Ladd Russo and Ladds gang
* Miria and Isaac
* Jacuzzi and his gang
* the wife and daughter of the senator
* the followers of Huey or how they called themself "the Ghosts"
* **Chane Laforet** 
* [spoiler about the shadow at the end](/s "the Railtracer")

10 hours before the department of the Flying Pussyfoot:    
involved characters:

* **Ladd Russos uncle**
* **Jacuzzi** (according to the wanted poster)
* **Ladd Russo** 

And the story of the "Elixier of Immortality" 1930  
involved characters:  

* Firo 
* Maiza
* Dallas Genoard
* Ennis
* Randy and Pecho (the two idiots who were playing with fire)
* Miria and Isaac 
* Mr Barnes (the old man with box of two bottles)
* **Szilard Quates** and his club of chosen 

every bold written character was added this episode..


What I noticed this episode.. either Maiza and Firo are walking really slow or this fire was really far away from the hat store, because at the same time they walked to the burning house

Miria and Isaac finished a hat buying shopping tour after that they get hit by Ennis in a car. Ennis managed it to drive Szilard to his meeting with his club, and she still was at the burning house before Firo... 

Bonus: [todays Abridged version of the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46Ux_xeKo_Y) Lua and Szilard are the best characters in this parody.

>> ARTICLE
>  best sociopaths

and 

> how the author managed to make such a heartless monster so likeable

There's an even better example of Narita making a Baccano! character extraordinarily likable on the surface, and that character really technically shouldn't be likable (and having it turn out that that likability is really an extension of [his](/s "moral sociopathy")) and that character [is](/s "Elmer C. Albatross"), one of my favorite Baccano! characters ever.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing the scary stuff is from the source material? I don't remember him being anything but likable in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
He wants people to smile and be happy, but doesn't care if what makes them happy isn't very nice.
>> ARTICLE
Well, when I first watched the anime, I thought so too. Then I read the LNs, and naturally on a rewatch tried to play closer attention to his actions.

For instance, in [episode](/s "7, he says to Sylvie") something along the lines [of] (/s "go on and smile, Sylvie, RIGHT AFTER she learned her lover was devoured and saw blood and gore in front her eyes.") You wouldn't normally say that to a person who'd just gone through something traumatic, would you? It's completely irrational, and it takes him a moment to consider that no, she [wouldn't](/s "smile after something like that. "No, I guess you wouldn't," he says.")

Oh dear. I'm going to *try* not to go on about him for too long--I was planning on raving about him after his first appearance. I find him endlessly fascinating as a character and could go on and on about him.

But...yeah, in the anime the essence of how he functions isn't really conveyed too strongly.  It's much more evident in the LNs through his actions, his dialogue, and others' observations of him. Hell, he [terrifies](/s "*Fermet* of all people. FERMET. Fermet is absolutely repulsed by him."). 

Still, the way he is can probably be attributed to his rather dark past...at any rate, his fixation [on](/s "smiles and getting people to smile") in the anime may come off as odd to viewers and for good reason.  [He](/s "says his goal is to make everybody in the world smile--he knows it's impossible yet he wants it anyway.") But the thing is, the real crux of his character, what makes this goal slightly sinister or unnerving rather than charming, [is](/s "that he wants to make them smile out of his own selfishness. He wants to see them smile because it makes him happy. Maybe it's partly because he can't actually smile genuinely (if I remember that bit correctly).") He's so fixated on smiles he can instantly tell if a smile is fake or real. That's why he loves the smiles of infants--they're genuine. 

/u/Emyd isn't kidding around. He would probably [condone](/s "murder or theft if it would make the perpetrator smile/be happy, though he'd probably be in a quandary because then the victim would be upset and not smile.")  Heck, in one of the LNs, a boy is [about](/s "to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. Elmer climbs onto the bridge and says, hey, if it makes you smile/happy, go ahead, jump off! Then Elmer reconsiders, and tells the boy not to jump, because it would make a big mess and cause a traffic jam and people wouldn't be happy if he did that. Then Elmer jumps off the bridge, splattering over the pavement to deter the boy from jumping.")

In the fifth LN, [he](/s "is on the roof of a castle trying to get Czes to smile. Czes says something like "if you jumped off the roof I'd be happy," out of irritation, and Elmer, what else, throws himself off the roof solely so Czes would smile. Czes did not smile.")

Oh God. I want to continue talking but this is long enough already and the point of these threads is for the newcomers, not us old-timers talking about characters they haven't even met yet. (Speaking of [meetings,](/s "Graham and Elmer meet in the LNs and it is glorious.")

I'll stop myself before someone has to forcefully cut me off. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow this is so cool to read. I've never really considered looking into the novels. What book would you recommend for someone who's already watched the anime once?
>> ARTICLE
Well...all of them! 

I mean, it all depends on what you're looking for. If you're interested in comparing the anime adaptation to the original, then you'll want to read the first four LNs, which contain the 1930, 1931, and 1932 storylines. (Episodes 14-16 come from a different LN arc entirely). 

Some books deal with the years immediately following the anime, in 1934 and 1935, some are set in the future, in 2002 and 2003. Some are set in the early 18th century )1705, 1710, 1711) and reveal more about the pasts of some of the older immortals (Maiza, Elmer, Huey) and talk more about immortals existing even before *then*.

Since you've only watched the anime once, and, frankly, I'd recommend this to someone who's watched the anime five times, I'd actually suggest reading the first four LNs. 

Why recommend the LNs for which you already know the plot? Well, frankly, the anime does cut out several characters (most, but not all, were characters appearing in the 1931 arc) that actually have importance to the plot and show up repeatedly in later LNs. 

If you don't read the first four LNs, you will be confused later on reading the other LNs and wondering 'who are these characters? Have they been introduced before?' 

I'd also feel a little uneasy recommending you read certain LNs on their own, because most of the LNs refer to events that happened in previous LNs and build off events that happened prior. 

So, yup. Start with the first four, and then go in chronological order. Safest and most rewarding route, really. 

If you asked me what books it would be essential for you to read other than the first four...that's a more interesting question, and I guess I'd recommend the 18th century ones because they provide much needed backstory and background for the events on the Advenna Avis and character motivations. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your answer! I think I'll take your advice and start with the first four, then read the 18th century ones. I find the story of the older immortals fascinating. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh indeed, the older immortals are certainly that. 

Now that the light novels have been licensed, translators are starting to take down their translations of them. If you don't want to wait for the official translations and can't find the fan translations online, message me. I can send you the files.

I've sent you a PM :)
>> ARTICLE
That's awesome. You're making me want to read the LNs. By the way, you're formatting your spoilers in a way that the first word is showing.
>> ARTICLE
You should definitely read the LNs. They're brilliant. 

As for the spoiler tags, I've been following the format guidelines in the right sidebar, which only work if you have some visible word tied to the rest of the hidden spoiler. I tried to make sure that the first words were innocuous/non-revealing.  I don't know of any other format that would hide all the words, at least when it comes to /r/anime. Thanks for the good intentioned heads up, though. 
>> ARTICLE
You don't necessarily need a visible word showing, you can just have the square brackets without anything in them, like this []. Although I personally think it doesn't look as neat overall, since it creates a black space before the rest of the spoiler tag. 
>> ARTICLE
...oh yeah, that would be the obvious thing to do, wouldn't it?

[](/s "like this"). 

Hm...I'll keep this in mind. For now, I think I'll stick with the visible first word, because for some reason it feels like it 'flows better' to me, though that doesn't make too much sense. Maybe I just like transitions, I dunno. 

Thanks for the tip I should have been able to figure out on my own but somehow didn't manage to give it enough thought. Yikes. I should probably get some sleep, because this is rather embarrassing and I'm clearly not firing on all cylinders at 3 AM in the morning.

I like how this show explains what happened in previous episodes gradually. I love the feeling of suddenly understanding something in an earlier episode then having to go back and watch it again.

I love the opening to this show. I must've played two or three times today before actually getting into the episode, then once again afterward for good measure.

Ladd is a pretty funny character, although I'm not entirely sure about his apparent obsession with killing...

Ladd is probably my favorite character from this show. Really entertaining, not to mention I think the English VA did a fantastic job voicing a sociopath (right word for Ladd?).

I really love the Baccano dub. Maybe give an episode a go and see how you like it because it really made the show for me.

Do itttt. I usually prefer subs too, but am really enjoying this dub.

Try one of the latter episodes as the first episode is a lot of the conversation with the young girl when we don't really see her much.

I think psychopath is more appropriate for Ladd.
>> ARTICLE
So!  I had to start from Episode 1, but I got caught up with y'all today.  Never seen Baccano! before, but I'm having fun.

Biggest things so far for me:  

* It was a bit of a shock in Episode 1 when Firo's fingers got sliced off and it wasn't a big deal.  Didn't realize that Baccano! was that sort of anime.

* The recap woven into Episode 3's opening sequence was neat.  I've never seen one done like that before, but it was really non-intrusive.  Maybe I just like listening to a little extra Guns & Roses.

* Ladd actually skipping toward the gunshots in the dining car.  Please.

Otherwise, I'm just enjoying the ride while it lasts.  Hoping the [Rail Tracer](http://www.gfycat.com/AbleHeavyAlaskajingle) doesn't go after Nice, since I like her a lot up to this point.  The rewatchers pointing out *when* each scene is happening has been a big help.  Nothing too confusing so far.
>> ARTICLE
Durarara!! does recaps the same way!
>> ARTICLE
Prelude  Is it just me or is the activity on this rewatch not as lively as one would expect? Damn, more people really need to watch this show.

Episode 4

* You have no idea how hard it is to not just go ahead and write these for the rest of the episodes all right now.

* I was so pumped that I literally laughed manically after the OP ended. Im so glad there wasnt a camera focused on me at that moment.

* Im not totally sure, but I think Ladd might have the slightest taste for violence. [Maybe.](https://a.pomf.cat/hqngvu.mp4)

I'll be honest, I actually thought things around here would be more lively. It seems like /r/anime loves this show. Who knows, might just be bad timing for others.

> Im sure /u/Neawia is taking notes at this scene.

I'm quite interested in how these two met and why they are the way they are. At least I officially know their relationship, and why they're together. They're a good match, I guess.

> I swear theres not one shot where these two dont look adorable.

The best part is that during that whole scene they're just lying on the floor, hands up, not moving. I can't stop laughing while thinking about that.

>These two are gonna be the end of me.

We posted the same clip! I, too, love these two.

Well I think a fifth of the people participating in the rewatch are us fanatics who prepare paragraphs and paragraphs of stuff before hand to post. Maybe our enthusiasm is a little off putting...(don't care, gotta gush about the show).
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say the enthusiasm is off-putting.  Maybe it's the case that a lot of people have nothing extra to say after you guys post up?  For myself, it just took me up to now to catch up to Episode 4.

I would agree with that, except the exact same thing happened (and in a *lot* bigger way) in the Code Geass and TTGL rewatches, and each one of those still got flooded with activity. Weird.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been around here long enough to know about past rewatches, but the Code Geass one seemed like something special. One episode people were talking about how it had (or almost had) the most comments in a rewatch ever. There were four or five newcomers writing huge posts and making crazy predictions every day. Even the TTGL rewatch had a lot of newcomers posting. I don't know why that happened there and not here, but hey, whatever.

The Baccano! rewatch hasn't been bad at all. I'm having a blast. Maybe it just hasn't picked up steam yet. There's still time for others to join in.

Definitely one of my favorite episodes. Watched it in sub this time and have to say, that while Japanese dub sounds really good and natural, the translation doesn't have any chances with dubbed. "Guns, I love guns! Machine guns? That's even better!" and "My fat ass!" just felt so great. Can't say which Ladd's voice I prefer, they are so different, yet both great. Isaac and Miria sound sooo much better in English dub. And we got first glimpse of the Rail Tracer! Things are starting to get exciting... Yes, yes yes yes, yes yes yes yes yes!

***Non-linear Timeline Recap.*** Correct any timeline mistakes if I'm wrong.

**1930**  GG, jiji...get it? (Japanese pun lol.) [Old man DGAF.](https://i.imgur.com/aJ7QIOT.png) And lol Isaac and Miria are hilarious trying to "blend in". [Their relationship in a nutshell.](https://i.imgur.com/VELVjel.png) *SUGOIII!* And omg they just got run over by Ennis. I also really like that transition from 1931 to 1930 Ennis.

And it looks like we found the [grandfather of the immortals](https://i.imgur.com/OYxF0Cb.png), Quates, aka the name of the guy who the Barnes (rat guy) was working for! [They have the Philosophers Stone](https://i.imgur.com/GJx9Gb9.png)! Putting the pieces together, Im guessing that Isaac, Miria, and Firo somehow get a hand on the immortal elixir on accident, if they aren't immortal already?

**1931**  *Before the Departure of the Flying Pussyfoot*

As the boss is hating the baseball couple Isaac and Miria for invading their turf, here comes Ladd! [Hes a really sadistic character](https://i.imgur.com/j4P3iwD.png), and for some reason Im not even antagonizing him that much. 

*Reboard the Flying Pussyfoot*

The first shots are fired, and casualties happen between the black (Sir Huey) and white suits (Ladd Russo). [*Dont you think its cool to wear white? That way you can see the blood stains of the people Ive killed.*](https://i.imgur.com/KL4IXlH.png) Geez, Ladd was going nuts!

And in the same boat, [Czeslaw](https://i.imgur.com/S3kZV6O.png).hes reminding me of [FMAB Huge Spoilers](/s "Selim Bradley/Pride just because theyre both evil-ish kids").

Lastly[WTF RAIL TRACER?!](https://i.imgur.com/B7Cpq56.png)  Logical explanation plz.

**1932**  The search for Dallas nii-san continues. Also noticed a very proper use of Language (ojou-sama) indicating their high status. Was it revealed what family theyre with already? And thats sad, tricking the baby sister just to protect a secret. [Dallas confirmed immortal?](https://i.imgur.com/QO6mi9F.png)

**Post-Episode Thoughts:** I like how a few of the scenes from 1930 were revisited with extra detail. It allows the viewer to really appreciate the knowledge of the developing story in comparison to the previous episode. Theres still a lot of characters to remember, but referring to the OP really helps lol.

For now, the 1931 storyline is the most intriguing. Its definitely the link between the stories that come before and after it.

>> ARTICLE
>I also really like that transition from 1931 to 1930 Ennis.

Actually, the one in the Flying Pussyfoot isn't Ennis, it's Chane Laforet (the girl with the dagger in the OP).
>> ARTICLE
Oh thanks! They looked semi-similar so I assumed they were the same person.
>> ARTICLE
> Logical explanation plz.

Lol, you expect logic in a show titled "Ruckas"?

> Was it revealed what family theyre with already?

I assume you're asking about Dallas and Eve.  Basically, the Genoards are their own family. [By which I mean](/s "Eve's father ran an underground [drug] empire"). 

> Sir Huey

Huh, you're watching the sub...is that what the Lemures call him in the sub? I can't remember. In the dub, it's Master Huey.

>> ARTICLE
More stuff for the newcomers/those who havent read the LNs!

A lot of Ladd this episode! Hes one of my favorite villains (yes, I think you could reasonably call him a villain). Everything he does is highly entertaining, made even more so by Bryan Massey, his VA. Also, Ladds pretty badass. That fight/boxing scene! My word. 

If [Placido Russo](https://thanmoreseries.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/baccano-25.png), Ladds uncle and the don of the Russo family mafia, looks suspiciously familiar to you, youre not the only onehe has a striking resemblance to [Johnny Caspar](https://pic.yify-torrent.org/1990/31308/d98ef3e98fb544109c3e3063c7e61131.png) (played by Jon Polito), a crime boss from Millers Crossing. Im sure Placido was modeled after him. 

So, it may be hard to tell, but as far as Placidos considered, December 30th (when you see him sitting at his desk) was the worst day of his life.  Hes had a lot of bad news thrown his way. Remember how Isaac and Miria, dressed as Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb, stole all that money earlier? That money was the entirety of [The Russo Familys] astronomical earnings from the month. Isaac and Miria were throwing a powdery mixture of pepper and lime at people who tried to stop them. 

(Placido had the guy who was transporting the money tortured out of the suspicion that he was lying. Placidos not the nicest of guys).

(Neider from the LNs was supposed to lead a coup against Goose Perkins [who by the way is a military dropout] and get the rest of the Lemures to join up with the Russo family. To make a long story short, he failed. Miserably. Placido was not happy.  Then he found out the charred remains of his subordinates were found around town. Therell be an explanation for this in the anime in due time).

So when Ladd comes in and says he wants to hijack the train, hes saying theyll earn all the money back and more that the Russos lost thanks to Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb - aka Isaac and Miria).

By the way, every boxer Ladd mentions is real and were big names back in the day. (Wikipedia links: [Jack Dempsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dempsey) and [Jack Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Johnson_(boxer)). Pete Hammond doesnt have a page. He wasnt that big a name). Actually I wonder if Bryan was supposed to say Pete Herman instead, because he mentions [Pete Herman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Herman) in the LNs along with Jack Dempsey and Jack Jackson.

Ladd also rambles about how maybe Jack is a good name for boxers, dont ya think?! Well?! Ladd seems to be a big fan of boxers and boxing.

Also when the Black Suit swings his knife at Ladd, in the LNs Ladd bites the offending hand. 

Yesterday I forgot to mention that Nicholas Wayne is actually Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Days. Also, oddly enough, Elean Duga is described in the list of characters in LN#7 as a severely bipolar black man. I dont think hes ever shown any signs of being bipolar in the actual LNs, so I dont know if Naritas planning anything with that information. Well, maybe hes shown some signs. From LN #9: brooding Mr. Elean will go into one of his depressive episodes and from LN #14 In New York, the information broker Elean was well-known for his depression .

Im going to keep reminding people that everything sleazy and slightly dickish about Nicholas is all Henrys personality from the books. Seriously. In the character lists, the only description for Dallas is trash. For Henry, its an information broker. Trash number two.  I think Nicholas sarcastic streak is all his own, though.

Before Maiza and Firo went to the hat shop, they were confronted by Inspector Edward, who does not like the mafia at all (theyre part of the Camorra, but hey). Edward was one of the two inspectors from episode one. Hes a reoccurring character in the LNs. 

I kinda want to share some of the quotes from the LN regarding Maiza, since hes one of my favorite characters, but Ill hold off on them until a later episode. 

Firo, watching Isaac and Miria enter the store:

?"There wasnt any more to the incident, but Firo stared at the duo who seemed like they were plucked straight from Broadway and thought,
*These two people are both in their twenties... But in a recession like this, just which wealthy family did this young master and missus come from?*"

 
I swear, as soon as I post this I'll probably remember 10 different things I should have included (already I'm wondering if I should have talked about Ennis and Szilard...) so be warned: there's probably going to be tons of updates/edits to this post. 

To sum up this episode: Ladd is a badass, that scene on the train was badass, Isaac and Miria are beacons of sunshine and Ennis needs more love. 

Favorite line: "[the white fabric] will make the blood look so pretty."

**Edit** I forgot to mention that this episode is one of four to have audio commentary by the English crew. The ones commenting for this episode were Tyler Walker (the ADR Director), Bryan Massey (Ladd Russo), J. Michael Tatum (Isaac Dian), and Caitlin Glass (Miria Harvent). I've transcribed the commentary. If anyone's interested in it, let me know. 
>> ARTICLE
> Isaac and Miria were throwing a powdery mixture of pepper and lime at people who tried to stop them. 

That's kinda hilarious. And I didn't realize how much money they stole.

> Also when the Black Suit swings his knife at Ladd, in the LNs Ladd bites the offending hand. 

I read that too fast and thought you typed "bites off the entire hand," which I can't say I'd put past him.

> But in a recession like this, just which wealthy family did this young master and missus come from?"

Crap, that's true. Wonder if Isaac and Miria will eventually slip up.

All around great post! Such good supplementary information that doesn't spoil anything. Nice work!

Thanks! I was late to the first two episode rewatches but I managed to share similar info in the episode three discussion yesterday. Glad to know I didn't spoil anything--if I inadvertently do, someone please tell me!

**--- Episode 4 - Ladd Russo Enjoys Talking A Lot and Slaughtering A Lot ---**

This episode title! How accurate. Ladd's a wacko for sure. He's skipping towards murder. Skipping.

"Homicidal lunatics think you're a nutcase!" So Ladd's an assassin, huh? His uncle just let him murder those two guys. [Brutal, but efficient.](http://www.gfycat.com/BossyDefenselessCaudata)

Ladd's odd face cronie dies, and that woman just climbs out of the window.

Seriously. Ladd is so over the top psychotic, but he is pretty fun to watch. He steps on odd face's dead body then beats the shit out of that "ghost" in front of everyone.

[Overkill.](http://www.gfycat.com/SpitefulDrearyFiddlercrab)

Czeslaw is laying low now, but he's probably going to be a major player/badass.

Lol Miria just seconding what Isaac says. Adorable. ["Maybe we could just poke him in the face."](https://a.pomf.cat/fqlrpe.mp4) The hat shop clerk doesn't care what they plan to do, whether it be face poking or robbery.

[So theatrical even when hit by a car.](http://www.gfycat.com/ThriftyUnequaledKoala) Those spins! They're still perfectly in sync down to the moment they hit the ground.

Yeah, well, Chane is gonna live past tomorrow, sorry to tell you.

[Conehead.](http://i.imgur.com/ZidZrh0.jpg) Why is there a conehead?

[WHAT THE FUCK?](http://www.gfycat.com/AbleHeavyAlaskajingle) The Rail Tracer?!?!? That was unexpected. I thought it was just a myth, some scary story.

**--- Post Episode Thoughts on the Future ---**

Read like Wheel of Fortune's "before and after" category.

Now then, fairly heavy Ladd episode, at least the first half. He's breaking away from the family, and will be doing some killing on his own. We also learn how messed up he really is. At least he seems pretty smart as well.

So Quates tells Ennis to kill Barnes "if he's gotten into the finished product." The perfect formula? They already have a way to kill a perfect immortal? How? Also to kill Barnes if "he has corrupted the remedy." Remedy to being immortal? Agggggh! I want to know these things. Tomorrow's episode will be watched soon. I must wait.

[no spoilers, just my speculation...](/s "Eve might be immortal. There are pictures at a young age of her and who I am assuming is Dallas. Dallas is apparently grown up now, as indicated by the OP and last episode. So why did Eve stop aging? I'm not sure why Dallas left her. Possibly to protect her, because bad things always happen around him. Idk yet. We'll find out.")

You have to wonder how these two managed to live before they met each other.

Look, man, I thought in this universe it was established that immortals were a thing. That's cool. Then they go and bring in a freaking monster. I'm half expecting something else to come into play (that is, if that thing is an actual monster).

This anime is getting very confusing, which isn't a bad thing but i might have to do a re-rewatch because so far there are a lot of events happening and the timeline changes constanly. That is a little confusing I must say but huge thanks to all  the people who are doing a great review for every episode, it really helps if you are a first time watcher like me.

This episode is mostly focused on Ladd, who is a merciless killer, and his group. I was pretty suprised when Ladd killed those two poor guys in the office. We also get to see a new group, who seem to be the scientists who discovered the "immortality" secret. I wonder how all these groups and events will be conected to each other, because so far, the only thing we know about the story is that a group of periodists are trying to reveal a story from the past. I am looking foward to the next episode.

To finish I would like to apologize because I missed day 2 and yesterday I totally forgot about it. ^^^^I ^^^^blame ^^^^the ^^^^Hearthstone ^^^^announcement. Anyway I'm really looking foward to this anime, i'm loving it so far.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, one of the things I love about Baccano! is all the factions it has. So far in the anime we have the Runoratas, the Gandors, the Martillos, the Russos/Whitesuits, Jacuzzi's gang, Isaac and Miria, the Genoards (if you can call them that), the Lemures, the Daily Days...

...and to refrain from spoilers I won't even mention a faction that won't show up in the anime for a long while and the *other* (yes that's right; there are more!) factions in the LNs!  

Don't think too much on the journalists; they only really serve to frame the anime.

So glad you (and the other newcomers) are sticking with it! I was nervous people would drop out after the first episode, but it looks like there are a fair few who are still here. Love hearing all your speculations and comments. It's a lot of fun as someone who's watched this series and read the LNs an obscene number of times. 
>> ARTICLE
My favourite episode title of them all! Because...it's just so accurate. Ladd somehow treads the fine line between absolutely insane and hilarious, and it works. I mean, he literally has a scene where he skips along the corridor, getting super excited about the prospect of killing. I think Bryan Massey does an fantastic job as him.


Czeslaw seems more and more shady with every appearance he makes, haha! That smirk he makes there is not exactly normal. 


I don't think Isaac & Miria could act like normal people if they tried...well, they do try here, and...they're not very subtle. "From the time we've started our robbery tour, we've done 87 jobs, from San Francisco to New Jersey. All of them have been interesting challenges. But have I once come close to putting your life in danger?" "Only 87 times..." "My point exactly love! It's still less than a hundred!" "Oh yeah, I guess you're right!" OTP right here, guys. 


I like that Szilard has a secret society, that he just hasn't visited for 20 years. I like to think that the other guys just live in there forever, waiting for Szilard to visit. 
>> ARTICLE
> I like to think that the other guys just live in there forever, waiting for Szilard to visit. 

Heh, liking the mental imagery there. 

Of course, Szilard's just using them as sponsors to fund his research (and maybe as guinea pigs)...
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 4**: So much fun for Ladd. Yes, he gives no fucks about people's lives. Ahh, from Ladd mercilessly killing to a mellow scene of Eve leaving the Daily Days. And then to more comedic scene with Isaac and Miria. Poking in the face? That's ruff. 87<100! Of course! Positivism! Wow, I really like the voice of Szilard in the dub! Ohh, we get a glimpse of *something* in the end...

Edit: Looks like people figured out what that *something* was

Ok, this is not relevant to this episode, but I forgot to mention this in an earlier thread:

[anime spoiler](/s "The LNs intentionally mislead you into thinking Claire is female, due to his name. Perhaps the sub/Japanese dub is trying to do the same thing?")

Either that, or [](/s "it was intentionally put there to throw people off. If so, it's one of the few things I'd say the sub did better than the dub.")

Ladd is so far my favorite character. I still don't know if I like Miria and Isaac: their idiocy is starting to get a bit old already. I still have no idea where Eve's story is supposed to go and why I should really care. The Flying Pussyfoot and a crazy immortality elixir are so much more interesting.

Hey, HEY! You're doing the "wait until this episode" psuedo spoiler thingy. You watch yourself.

I think Isaac and Miria, oddly enough, are supposed to be the "normal" characters. They're the ones that don't seem to be mixed up in the immortal stuff... yet. They just rob people.

Dallas and Eve seem like they'll eventually tie into the story in a big way, but I see where you're coming from so far. There isn't much going on besides looking for Dallas. We just keep getting a few pieces of info here and there.
>> ARTICLE
Ladd definitely stole the show in this episode. That dining car punching scene was brutal. 

I wonder if the anime will continue this format of featuring or sort of focusing on one character per episode.

Isaac and Miria continue to be adorable. I couldn't stop smiling throughout the whole hat shopping spree. "Now listen up, pal. You should erase our faces from your mind." "And don't even think about reporting us to the police." Yep, that's not suspicious at all. 

Characters I'll be looking out for in future episodes:

* Ninja girl in green
* Czeslaw - I knew he was up to something!
* Chane 
* Ennis
* Maiza - He seems pretty mild so far but Szilard's comment about how he 'went mad' makes me curious.
* The Rail Tracer, of course 




>> ARTICLE
Still slogging through. I've watched the episode 1 three times now and this is the first time I've made it to episode 4. Everyone said it's good so I thought I'd join the rewatch. 

I really hated Ladd early but he's moved to okay status. I thought Firo was kinda cool but all he's done since episode 1 is buy a hat. 

I do like Isaac and Miriam. Isaac's English VA is really good and I don't usually like dubs.  Oh and of course the opening is fantastic. I usually skip those too.

Are you forgetting that Firo beat up Dallas and all three of his friends barehanded without breaking a sweat or even dropping his hat in Episode 3?

[Godamn how I love this scene](http://i.imgur.com/N4iV0I4.png)
this one and the dining car scene cracks me up everytime.

So now we have jumps between the three main storys of this series and everything is now set in motion. 

So at the moment  who is the most intriguing character for you?
and which story line is most exciting for you.

For me it is always the story of the Flying Pussyfoot.



So today we had: 

The search of Dallas Genoard (or Eve Genoards story) 1931-1932
involved characters:

* Eve Genoard and her household
* Dallas Genoard
* the brokers of the Dayly Day
* the Runorata Family


The horror on the Flying Pussyfoot 1931  
involved characters:

* Lua Klein and Ladd Russo and Ladds gang
* Miria and Isaac
* Jacuzzi and his gang
* the wife and daughter of the senator
* the followers of Huey or how they called themself "the Ghosts"

And the story of the [just to be sure spoiler](/s "Drink of Immortality") 1930  
involved characters:

* Firo 
* Maiza
* [not sure if this character got called by his name this episode](/s "Dallas Genoard")
* Ennis
* Randy and Pecho (the two idiots who were playing with fire)
* Miria and Isaac 
* Mr Barnes (the old man with box of two bottles)


Just wanted to make this so first timers have a better structure who is where involved and in what time period it is playing. Also I only listed the characters which appeared in this episode, I will add the characters everytime a new one appears in the story line.


Bonus:  [this episodes Abridged version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX9bqjeNyXg)

>> ARTICLE
>not sure if this character got called by his name this episode

He's named in the opening, so the viewer should recognize him.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, Flying Pussyfoot is my favorite plotline. Jacuzzi [not really a spoiler but I'll hide it anyways](/s "turns out to be a very noble and likable character. Yeah he seems like a coward at first, but he's able to take action to protect everyone on the train. He's also what more main character-ish than Firo"). Also, boss Ladd just steals the spotlight everytime he shows up on screen. I'm so excited, the next episode is all about boss Ladd and his wacky (putting it lightly) antics.

AMV MAJOR SPOILER FOR THE WHOLE ANIME

> So now we have jumps between the three main storys of this series

Phew, there are just three! I thought there might be more coming up, since we haven't even covered the events of 1711 yet.

> which story line is most exciting for you

Currently a tie between the Flying Pussyfoot and Firo's arc. It's crazy how that many things are happening on that train at the same time. And there are even [more characters](http://i.imgur.com/mo88WTd.png) whose stories we haven't heard yet (I'm guessing). 

I had to go back and rewatch some scenes just to check when they happened, so this timeline/character summary was very helpful! :) 
>> ARTICLE
JelloApocalypse's (currently incomplete) abridgement of Baccano! is my favorite abridged version (the other popular one on Youtube is a bit too random for my tastes). I was so excited when he ~~finally~~ recently released episode 8 back in Jun.
>> ARTICLE
> For me it is always the story of the Flying Pussyfoot.

Yep. I love all the stories, but if I had to list from best to worst it would be Flying Pussyfoot, Firo's Arc, then Eve's Arc.
>> ARTICLE
This was really helpful. Nice work!

So Baccano! is essentially just us viewing a bunch of events that already happened? And then possibly by the end it will catch up to "present day" if that makes any sense.
>> ARTICLE
basically yes, it is like a puzzle which slowly get build together piece by piece every episode.

even though non linear story telling is really confusing most of the time I really like it because it adds to rewatchability.

We're 3 episodes in and I have literally [bookmarked the OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOZ1hsb8smQ) so I can watch it whenever I want. It's just that catchy. :p

**--- Episode 3 - Randy and Pecho Are Busy Getting Ready for the Party ---**

Really smooth mini-recap they slid into in the OP.

These reporters (info brokers?) [don't fuck around.](http://i.imgur.com/4npq7Ho.jpg) The woman at the bottom of the stairs looks like she rushed down just so she could draw a gun on somebody.

I'm definitely confused as to why Lua wants to die. Is she immortal, and Ladd has figured out some way to kill immortals? She doesn't really seem to be immortal. I don't know.

Jacuzzi's face markings (are they actually tattoos?) make it easy to identify him. I still don't think they're tattoos. If he's in illegal business, why would he purposefully give himself such an easily identifiable marking? Unless someone forced it on him and Nice.

Wow, Randy.

[These two are buffoons.](http://www.gfycat.com/UnluckyAdvancedDassierat)

Humans are always experimenting on mice. Even when it comes to immortality. Ooooohh, formula perfected... OH SHIT, THE FIRE! Well that sucks. So are all the current immortals imperfect?

[Looking good, Firo.](http://i.imgur.com/dlflFMy.jpg)

Yeah! [No excuse for carelessness.](http://i.imgur.com/ynihyHJ.jpg) And joy! Isaac and Miria met Firo... sort of. My favorite three. Let's hope they can properly meet.

Baccano! really does have an odd way to tell a story. There's still a bit of jumping around. This is probably a fun show to rewatch since you'll better know when/why things are happening.

Huey, first immortal maybe? Or just a power hungry gangster?

I hope Eve finds Dallas. I wonder how they'll tie in with the bigger story.

Firo! Save the formula!

Yes! Music kicks in, and Firo kicks ass! While stylishly keeping hold of his hat, I might add. Lick pavement,  ginks. ([Thug 1,](http://www.gfycat.com/AnguishedFemaleAlaskanhusky) [Thug 2,](http://www.gfycat.com/SerpentineDisastrousJapanesebeetle) [Thug 3,](http://www.gfycat.com/CheapPartialHoki) [Thug 4](http://www.gfycat.com/DangerousGiganticHarborseal))

Who is the old guy with the formula? Also, who killed him? It looked like the goon Firo beat up, but does he have a name? Is he important? So many characters!

[Like this seriously weird dude.](http://www.gfycat.com/InsistentDelectableAustraliankestrel) Who is this guy? Dressed in white, one of Ladd's cronies?

Isaac and Miria are still perfect. They fucking did what all three "bad guys" told everyone to do. All three. Fucking lol!!!! Like, hey, if we do what they all say, none of them can hurt us. Hahaha! ["Don't move!"](https://a.pomf.cat/kxclym.mp4) They just freeze. I can't take it. [Their faces!](http://i.imgur.com/Qji83zn.jpg) These two rule! They're barely phased by anything going on around them. So very calm. This little scene had me laughing pretty damn hard.

And so this old guy got up. Barnes? Looks like he's immortal. Wonder if he sampled his new creation. Wonder what Ennis wants with him. HIS FORMULA! Probably, I guess.

Again, wish it wasn't over so fast.

Isaac Greenback and Miria Moneybags. lol

**--- Post Episode Thoughts / Thoughts on the Future ---**

I should combine this section to read like a Wheel of Fortune puzzle (before and after). "Post Episode Thoughts on the Future."

Ok, so that scene I mentioned where Firo/Maiza and Isaac/Miria bump into each other on their way in/out of the hat store, it's a good example of the dub vs sub. And for the love of god, I'm not trying to rustle anyone's jimmies, I'm just comparing a specific scene between both versions.

In the dub Maiza says "Excuse me" to which Isaac says "For carelessness, there is no excuse" and Miria adds "No excuse for carelessness." Haha, they say it like they're reprimanding a child, not talking with a stranger. A more clever response than in the sub: "Oh, my apologies," says Maiza, to which best couple responds "Hey, hey, watch where you walk" and "Watch where you walk."

**edit** see /u/The-Sublimer-One's [webm](https://a.pomf.cat/habgwq.mp4) for the dub example.

[no spoilers, just my speculation...](/s "So Dallas has been missing, and no one can find him. I wonder if he is Huey. Changed his name, started over. Maybe that's a little bit crazy, but who knows?")

[...and some more](/s "I also think some of the immortals are going to die. I'm not sure which. How could I really say? But since there is now a perfect immortal formula, I think the current immortals aren't actually 100% unkillable. Some will die, and maybe Firo will get his hands on the perfect formula seeing as he's the main character. Well, main character-ish. Oooooohhh, or maybe Isaac x Miria can get the formula so they can continue being awesome forever.")

Another decent episode. There's still much to learn, and I'm excited to find out.

I just compared your dubbed webm from the "Don't move!" scene with the subbed version ( https://youtu.be/MBtu23vQCRs?t=210 , you should probably pause it after that specific scene if you want to avoid spoilers, I didn't watch the rest of the video), and I don't know why people are saying that the dub is better.
I really, really don't get it! This was so cute
>> ARTICLE
The "don't move" scene in the sub was pretty good. It pretty much had all the heart and soul of the dub.

Sub vs dub is always a matter of preference though. As an example, I cannot speak Japanese. Reading subtitles can be a bit annoying as it can take away from enjoying the show's visuals. So I personally enjoy dubs so I can soak up everything all at once. If the show has a good dub (which it seems Baccano! does) then that's just even better for me.
>> ARTICLE
I get what you're saying. I don't speak Japanese either (well you pick up things, of course), but I guess I don't really have a problem with reading while watching like that. It's probably because I've grown so accustomed to subtitles through out my childhood. Literally everything English spoken is subbed here, except for children's shows. Even some children's shows used to be subbed on certain channels (or at night times).

Advantages of being a non-native English speaker I guess.

Edit: I went to Germany once and watched the Simpsons. It was a german dub. It was terrible. Actually it was amazing. That is all.
>> ARTICLE
> I went to Germany once and watched the Simpsons. It was a german dub.

Please tell me you recorded it.

Edit: yeah german is by far the worst LOL
>> ARTICLE
It's probably because I grew up with the German dub of the Simpsons, but I don't think that it sounds this bad (apart from Marge) 
>> ARTICLE
> Advantages of being a non-native English speaker I guess.

I suppose so. English is my main language. Before anime I rarely, if ever, watched anything with subtitles. Even in video games I would turn them off because I didn't want to read what I could already hear. I don't mind subtitles, I'd just rather not have to deal with them.
>> ARTICLE
I always turn them on in games, so I never miss what is being said. Even if it's just to double check what someone just said, just to make sure I didn't mishear or anything.

I briefly watched dubbed anime when I started out (also most anime were dubbed in English here, that probably has something to do with it), just so I could look away from the screen and still catch what was being said. This is just like that, but with sounds I guess?
>> ARTICLE
The biggest problem I have with playing games with subtitles is that you occasionally have some idiot doing the transcribing who puts like a whole paragraph on the screen at once, so you read ahead and can get spoiled at points. The BioShock series is the worst offender at this. There are points where subtitles appear a good twenty seconds before the lines are spoken.
>> ARTICLE
> you occasionally have some idiot doing the transcribing you who puts like a whole paragraph on the screen at once, so you read ahead and can get spoiled at points

> There are points where subtitles appear a good twenty seconds before the lines are spoken.

Yes! That's very true. Anime subtitles seem to be quite good at avoiding that. The only "trouble" I would say is when somebody is getting cut off at the end of a sentence.

"Yeah, /u/The-Sublimer-One. I know him. What do I think of him? He's a real -"

And then you know that person is going to get cut off before he finishes speaking.
>> ARTICLE
Tell me about it. What they should is

> The woman at the bottom of the stairs looks like she rushed down just so she could draw a gun on somebody.

Lol, yeah, I always laugh at how she looks like she almost tripped over herself trying to pull out the gun.

> I'm definitely confused as to why Lua wants to die.

I don't think she really wants to. She just wants to be the cause of her death to be Ladd.

> are they actually tattoos?

Yep.

> So are all the current immortals imperfect?

[Future Episode Spoilers](/s "Well, a few of them.")

> This is probably a fun show to rewatch since you'll better know when/why things are happening.

True, but it doesn't make watching it the first time any less awesome.

> It looked like the goon Firo beat up, but does he have a name? Is he important?

This isn't really a spoiler, so I'll just help you out: *That* is Dallas Genoard, who Eve is looking for in the other timeline.

> "Don't move!"

You did it!

> A more clever response than in the sub

Exactly. In the sub, especially for anyone not familiar with Japanese speech patterns, Isaac and Miria seem almost out-of-character levels of rude. In the dub, they're just their charming selves, trying to sound proper.

Another great read. Enjoying them.
>> ARTICLE
> She just wants to be the cause of her death to be Ladd.

This is still confusing. Guess I'll have to wait and find out why she wants Ladd to be the one to kill her.

> This isn't really a spoiler... the other timeline.

It's sort of a spoiler. Idk. I don't think it's a bad one though. And another timeline. Oh boy. Things are gonna get crazy.

> You did it!

Almost! Do you use RES? All of your webms can open within the reddit comments (the little play button), but mine can't. I don't suppose you know why.

Thanks!

Hmm... Maybe because the image size is so small? Not really sure why.

>I just figured it was okay because he's been clearly identified in the OP for the past three episodes.

That's perfectly fair. I just didn't put the two together yet so it's my bad.

>>She just wants to be the cause of her death to be Ladd.

>This is still confusing. Guess I'll have to wait and find out why she wants Ladd to be the one to kill her.

It's not something they ever really go into, at least not in the anime.
Its always been my impression that she is very masochistic and Ladd is very sadistic.
>> ARTICLE
She's not really masochistic, nor is she suicidal (I suppose). Here's a passage from LN 3 (on the train):

> 
Lua wanted to be murdered. So much so that she had even forgotten why. Suicide was a foolish option to her, so she searched for someone who would kill her. She searched for someone who would delight in killing her. She wanted to at least make someone happy in her death.

> That was when she met Ladd. Perhaps he would delight in murdering her more than anyone in the world.

Well, there you have it. And 

As for Ladd, he...ah, seems to have a thing for women who don't care if they die.

> The magician nodded, closed his bag, and entered one of the Second Class cabins.

>"Tch." Ladd watched him disappear. "Agh, damn it! What's with that look?! It's like he doesn't care when he dies! It's like he's already dead! I can't deal with guys like that." He complained, then remembered Lua and began heading for the conductor's compartment.

>"'Course, if he were a woman, he'd be my type exactly."

>He recalled Lua's eyes--dull like those of a dead fish--and looked up at the sky from the coupling.

>"The roof, eh? This is gonna get fun."

Later on the Flying Pussyfoot, Lua and the 'magician' (who's the doctor called Fred, who isn't in the anime but is pretty important in the the train arc in the LNs) get to talking. 

> "Pardon...?" Lua asked in a frail half-whisper. As she looked into the magician's eyes, she realized something.
> *'He's just like me. He wants to die.'*

He then tells her how he was a medic at Verdun in WWI, and one day he woke up and found he was the only one still alive.

>"If this was divine punishment, then I suppose escaping it through suicide would earn me something even worse in the afterlife. That is why I treat people out of a sense of duty. As long as I can save even one more person who wishes to live--until God will finally allow me to die."

>He looked directly at Lua.

>"Looks like you've found yourself a purpose. Your eyes are different now, so full of life. Although I can't say for certain if it's fear, or anger, or sadness."

Her purpose is to be killed by Ladd. She genuinely loves/cares for Ladd and is terrified at the thought of him dying. 

Later: 
> Slowly and quietly, the grey magician began to tell the white suit about what he thought of Lua.

> "That girl and I have something in common--we both wish to die. But there's one fundamental difference between us. I often saw men with eyes like hers, back on the battlefield--the eyes of those who wish to die themselves, but have someone they care for greatly. Those eyes belong to people that can help other. Compared to me, a man who treats people out of nothing but a sense of duty... she is someone many times more valuable to the world."

A couple paragraphs down:

> Ladd was someone essential to Lua. It wasn't only so because he was pledged to kill her--even discounting this fact, Lua could not imagine a world without Ladd. Life and death were as one, and through the act of killing her Ladd would find joy in his life. For Lua, who had nursed fantasies of this one-way cycle all this time, Ladd's death would mean the destruction of her world. She was a fanatical believer and martyr of her own world, in a somewhat different sense from Claire--after all, her world was part of the larger whole of Ladd.

>> ARTICLE
Huh, well that's interesting. I was just speculating based on what has been shown in the anime.

On a side note, I've meaning to read the LN's. Now that they have been licensed I plan to by them when they're released, but could you tell me where I might be able to read them in the mean time?
>> ARTICLE
Somebody else sent me a message asking the same thing. I'll send you the message I sent them, but the problem is that with the series now licensed people are already pulling their download links and translations from the internet. Some of the links I sent the other guy still have translations up, but there's no telling how soon those will go down too. (Details in the message).

I do, however, have all of the LNs downloaded as PDFs (except for Vol.10, which is in the process of being translated--I have been copying and pasting the translations for Vol.10 into a separate file). If you find you just have to read them to find out What's Next on Baccano!, I'll be happy to send you my copies somehow, in whatever way you prefer. Always love helping out when it comes to Baccano!.

>This isn't really a spoiler... the other timeline.
>>It's sort of a spoiler. Idk. I don't think it's a bad one though. And another timeline. Oh boy. Things are gonna get crazy.

The way this is written sounds like it's a time-travel sort of thing, I want to clear it up and say it's not. Everything in the series is part of the same "timeline", just not chronological. By "other" timeline he just means that Eve's part of the story is taking place at a different time than the Train part, and both are at a different time than the Firo/immortality potion part.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly this. Though I admit it would have been awesome to have a Steins;Baccano twist.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was a little confused at first that this was gonna be like Steins;Gate or something, but it seems to be all on one "timeline." Thanks for the confirmation on that.
>> ARTICLE
Since you can see what Dallas looks like in the OP, it's not really a spoiler: He's who you called "Thug 4".
>> ARTICLE
as a rewatcher I just love your speculation... I'm grinning everytime I read them.

Reading his Code Geass speculation was also great. There were several times where he was actually really close to guessing what would happen.

Haha! Your kind words are one of the main reasons I enjoy doing these write ups. So thanks, and I guess I'll have to wait to see if any of my predictions come true. At least they're entertaining someone.
>> ARTICLE
So some things that might be of interest to the newcomers/those who havent read the LNs:

The Daily Days, officially the DD Newspaper Agency, if it wasnt made clear enough, is actually an information agency. Publicly speaking, however, it operates as a newspaper agency located in Chinatown, publishing Chinese, English, and Italian editions every day.  According to the LNs, the Chinese comprised over half its workers, although there were some other nationalities.

The blonde guy (Nicholas) you see dealing with the Runorata goons is in charge of the English desk. Actually, Nicholas in the anime is a **composite character**a mixture of two characters from the LNs: Nicholas (again, in charge of the English desk/edition) and Henry (who I think is in charge of the Italian desk, I can't remember).

In the anime, Nicholas general manipulative and sleazy demeanor is actually all Henrys personality, who chose this line of business because he has a love for manipulating information. And by manipulating information, you can manipulate bigger thingsmoney, people, the cityand this power, Henry adulates, is better than any drug. Nicholas actually asks Henry in the LNs have you no shame? and berates him for his unethical work ethic. Yeah, in the LNs, Nicholas is a pretty decent guy. Who knew?

Elean Duga, Samantha/Samasas childhood friend, speaks fluent Chinese. I think he's the head of the Chinese desk, but don't quote me on that. 

Benjamin, Eves steward, is German and will correct you if you mispronounce his name as Ben-jah-min (he says it is Ben-ya-min).

-

Samantha's name is Samasa in the LNs, and I will admit to being very embarrassed by Narita's dialogue for her, which is heavily accented in the somewhat racist 'yes mazza' manner of 19th and 20th century media portrayals of black people.  His explanation for this is that "As a servant, she-- Samasa, had traveled across the entire country quite a few times to date so she spoke many dialects, making communication very difficult."

Something worth mentioning is that the anime cuts out several characters from the Flying Pussyfoot arc. There's actually another member of Jacuzzi's gang who's supposed to be there on the train--his name is Jack. He's actually involved in many of the shenanigans Jacuzzi's gang will find themselves involved in on the train. (For instance, when she leaves Nick to 'take care of the dining car', she takes Donny AND Jack with her). 

The anime also cuts out a guy with a fairly important presence on the train--doctor Fred, also called the Grey Magician because he's entirely covered in grey cloth. Joining him as his new assistant at the end of the LN is another character cut out from the anime, [not really spoilers since he and Fred never show up in the anime but just in case](/s "whose name is literally 'Who'--Who, as it so happens, was one of the Whitesuits--in fact, I'm pretty sure he was a childhood friend of Ladd's"). 

ANOTHER guy who was not so much 'cut out' of the arc (since he didn't show up in the 2nd and 3rd LNs which focused on the Flying Pussyfoot--in fact, he doesn't show up until freaking LN #14) as 'he was present on the train and later in LN 14 recalls how he was there' was Upham, one of the Lemures (black suits). He, Fred, and Who all show up in later LNs.

[Read this only if you've seen the entire anime or don't mind being spoiled: Guess who else was apparently on the train?](/s "Elmer and Fermet, according to the DS game! Upham was caught by Jacuzzi's gang on the train. They tied him up and left him in a storage room. He's rescued by Elmer, they come across a guy named Victor Talbot, who stabs Upham. Victor is revealed to be Fermet (Victor Talbot is one of the other immortals. He's a part of the FBI. Fermet took his name as an alias). Fermet and Elmer talk/confront each other, and then Elmer physically forces Fermet through the doors of the conductor cabin and pushes him off the train. Fermet tries to drag him down with him, but Upham saves Elmer just in time. 'That was close! Thanks! I was prepared to fall with him, you know.' said Elmer.")

Also Fan(g) (the assistant chef in the dining car) and Ian (John in the LNs; the bartender) are part of Jacuzzi's gang and are working in the dining car under the Head Chef, who in the LNs you never see but hear his voice through the kitchen door. The Head Chef is only important in that [it's](/s "through his connections that, after Fang and John lost their jobs after The Flying Pussyfoot was legally declared not to exist, he was the one to get Fang and John jobs at the Genoard Mansion out of gratitude for them protecting the passengers. This is important because Fang and John then convince Eve to let 'a few of their friends' stay at the mansion while she [was at the other Genoard home], neatly not mentioning that by a few friends they meant the entirety of Jaccuzi's gang, all of whom needed a place to stay. Or that these friends were in fact bootlegging delinquents.").

I'm sure I'm forgetting some things. I might go through my copies of the LNs again and see if I did. 

If anyone is interested in knowing more or wants something cleared up please feel free to reply to this and ask! I'm always happy to help when it comes to Baccano!.

**EDIT** -- See, immediately after I posted this I remembered I forgot to mention that in the LNs it's said that Nicholas was the one to train the employees how to use guns. How was he able to? Because he used to be in military intelligence. Here's the passage:

> Nicholas, who originally worked for the military intelligence unit, came here after resigning. He used every ounce of his strength to get to where he was today. Here, he taught those Asians how to use guns, and enabled The Informer to gain power to contend with the surrounding organizations.

>*--Its not enough. This is nowhere close to enough.*

>Given that he was working at The Informer, he couldnt completely eliminate his anxieties of attacks, even if he armed himself with more equipment. This was part and parcel of working at an information agency.
Manipulating information while being controlled by information at the same time. The experience from working at military intelligence was already telling Nicholas that this was an unpleasant fact of life.

**Edit** - /u/accordionheart has kindly reminded me that Neider, one of the Blacksuits, was also present on the train but is cut out from the anime. He becomes important in later LNs. How could I have forgotten about him? Clearly I need to reread the LNs again (God knows how many times I've already read them).
A man named Mr. Turner was also there, but he's pretty unimportant. I only mention him because of his significance towards another character's life. [Specifically](/s "Rachel, whose father (a railway engineer) Mr. Turner framed. I guess you could blame the ruin and subsequent death of her father on Mr. Turner. Or maybe blame Senator Beriam instead, since Turner was working for him").

**Edit, again, unsurprisingly** -- did you know that Randy and Pecho (Pezzo in the LNs) have nicknames? That's right! "Ghost" Randy and "Meatball" Pezzo. Also, Randy and Pezzo are Martillo executives. I know, right? Clearly the standards in the Martillo family must be slackening. I'm pretty sure those two are pyromaniacs.  

**Edit** - Also, one of my favorite moment in the anime is in this episode, when you have *three factions* all converging upon the dining car at the same time--the Black Suits from one end, Nick from the bootleggers on the other, and the White Suit Vicki in the middle. God I love that bit. Three factions acting independently of each other end up taking over the same car at the same time. What timing, what chance! (I also love Nick looking at the guns, looking at his little switchblade and just getting the fuck out of there - "uh, sorry for the confusion." I always liked Nick.)

As a person watching baccano super late (behind even the rewatch I found this post in!)

It's more than just the 16 ep anime then? Is there an anime only ending? Or open ended and I should read more?

Episode 16 wraps up the anime very nicely (even more so than EP 13's ending), though admittedly it is somewhat open-ended (quite a few of the ending scenes 'connect' with the light novels).

**Edit* - I keep making more edits to that post. I am unstoppable. Stay tuned for an addition regarding Randy and Pecho.

Really interesting read. It's no wonder that all the characters in the anime, even minor ones, are multi-layered rather than just cardboard cut-outs.
>> ARTICLE
> The anime also cuts out a guy with a fairly important presence on the train--doctor Fred


I've always been curious about why they did this...I guess perhaps it was a time constraint thing. But Fred is a pretty important character and I'm sad that we don't get to see him. 


The other character I'm curious about, because I can't quite remember, is whether Neider is present in the anime or not. He's another character who only becomes important later on in the novels 
>> ARTICLE
Oh crap, you're right! Completely forgot about Neider (*so many characters were on that train oh my God*). No, as a character I don't believe he's present in the anime (his name is never mentioned), which is a shame because you're definitely correct that he becomes more important later on. 
 
Now that I think about it, the LNs had a character who I think *may* have had one speaking line in the anime, and whom I'm mentioning because he's interesting only in his significance to another character's life.  The man was Mr. Turner, and I'm mentioning him because [it turns out](/s "he was responsible for framing Rachel's dad, the railway engineer. He's also under the employment of Senator Beriam. Plus he has his shoulders dislocated by the Rail Tracer, so, y'know. Also he follows Victor/Fermet around for a while in the DS game.")

> so many characters were on that train oh my God


I think when I read the DS Game translation, I realised that Narita needed to be stopped.
>> ARTICLE
Those crack endings, man...

He needs to be stopped, but at the same time I never want him to stop; Baccano! is just too good. 

Still, I had to stop for a moment and comprehend that [both](/s "Elmer and Fermet") were on that train. I couldn't take it in. It was too glorious and ridiculous to be true.

So what you're saying is, we really need some officials translations of the rest of the light novels?

I think the LNs have been licensed recently by Yen Press! No official release dates, but hopefully soon.

HAHAHAyes. And at least five more seasons. AT LEAST A SEASON 2 PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.

Non-linear Timeline Recap. Correct any timeline mistakes if I'm wrong.

**1930**  [Getting Info on Dallas](https://i.imgur.com/WSqXo1z.png), a dangerous business. Who is Dallas? Did they introduce him already? lol.

This guy is exploring the [concept of immortals using a lab rat](https://i.imgur.com/jIXxi8X.png) for someone named Quates, but his laboratory burned down, interesting.

Ooh, and this must be the point where all of the characters either get their immortality, as Isaac, Miria, Firo, Nice, and Luck [first run into each other](https://i.imgur.com/mG8NEPX.png)? Yes? No?

And soon after, Firo meets the guy experimenting with the immortal rat.

**1931**  Reboard the Flying Pussyfoot

Jacuzzi is recognized for his bounty, and the train fight begins! And LOL Isaac and Miria are trying to act like theyre in mortal danger haha.
	
**1932**  [Dallas is missing/dead?](https://i.imgur.com/ga07W0S.png)

Thoughts: So it seems this story will be about three different time periods, and it really gets a feel of piecing together all of the information, and I'm really enjoying it! Right now I'm most interested in the *1930 immortal origins* and the *1931 train heist*.

Prelude  For some reason my editing software made the episode clips quieter than usual this time. Not sure why.

* Obligatory mention of the OP. And this time with establishing flashbacks!

* [Benjamin](https://a.pomf.cat/hmtqvi.mp4) kind of reminds me of that other old guy who was sitting near the car Isaac and Miria robbed.

> I dont feel like Im adding that much to the discussion like I did with Code Geass and TTGL. (And even that is debatable, depending on who you ask.)

You definitely did. It's probably tough when you've seen the show already (at least to discuss it with the newcomers). I'm hoping we can get some good speculation discussion going amongst the newcomers like we did with the Code Geass rewatch. Bouncing ideas off of each other was quite enjoyable.

Definitely a tattoo. Why would he get that!?!

Today, it's a more confusing timeline than yesterday's episode. We have incidents from all the different arcs present. 


First of all, we start with [Finding Dallas](https://jelloapocalypse.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/finding-dallas.png). Eve, one of my favourite characters, for her sheer determination, is trying to find her missing brother. Unfortunately, "he's the biggest scumbag around" [mild anime spoilers](/s "which is pretty accurate! When even the author calls you trash, you know you're a terrible person"), and very very missing. The Daily Days, the main information broker in town, is a really cool place, and it seems like Narita really does just like the idea of information brokers, since they turn up here and in DRRR!! (I think there might be one in some of his other novels, but I'm less familiar with them than I should be!) The Daily Days is far more organised than Izaya is though.


On the Flying Pussyfoot, we find out that Jacuzzi has a bounty on his head. Which is pretty cool, but also unexpected, considering...well, a lot. Ladd and Lua are really creepy, especially since they have some sort of agreement by which he is going to kill her one day. I also really love the scene where the three different groups burst in on the dining car and give all the contradictory orders...and Isaac and Miria somehow attempt all three. And Miria's impression is super precious. I will never tire of Jacuzzi saying "the Rail Traceah!" though. 


My conclusions on the 1930 arc for today are...that Firo is pretty cool. He's got a cool new hat, that matches his snazzy suit, dodges people with ease, and always tries to help out where he can! He's a pretty nice guy for a future capo of the Camorra. 


Edited, since I accidentally messed up my spoiler tags, whoops!
>> ARTICLE
From the character list in the LNs: Confirmed, [Dallas Genoard is indeed trash](http://imgur.com/i3uTj5H). 

Eve I think deserves more credit than people give her. Her quiet resolve to do what it takes to find Dallas, her love for him despite her religious views and him being a total scumbucket, and considering how [later](/s "with Dallas gone and her brother and father murdered she's essentially the new heir to her father's underground (drug) empire") she's stronger and more admirable than people think.

The scene where the three factions converge on the same car at the same time is indeed one of my favorites for the sheer chance of it all. 
>> ARTICLE
So much shit going down but Nick definitely stole the show!  
"Well, sorry for disturbing you"
>> ARTICLE
I'm very fond of Nick as a character. The side/minor characters in Baccano! (if you can even call them that) all have their own personalities and quirks which is really nice, considering that many side characters in other stories don't get the same treatment. 

"I'm, uh...sorry for the confusion." (his line in the dub version). Kills me every time. His whole (understandable) deliberation over what Nice meant when she said "take care of the dining car" is also gold. 

Extremely fond of Nick. He's my favorite (apart from Ian/John) out of Jacuzzi and Nice's ragtag friends.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 3**: Poor Eve. Even the Daily Days are armed to the teeth. Heh, people think they are safe becouse they belong to a family. Aww, Ladd really does love Lua. Ooh, Jacuzzi is wanted. And finally we get our mad scientist. Good guy Firo.

Ooh, looks like someone created the formula for immortality... But my hunch says that someone has done it before him.

I'm surprised at the number of newcomers not as confused as I would've thought. Good on you guys!

The most confusing part so far would be "I'm not sure *when* each scene is taking place" (as far as ordering), but the people actually rewatching the series have been kind enough to break that down so far for us newcomers.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I think because there's so much going on I'm not picking up on *everything.* So the show isn't extremely confusing, but perhaps that's from a bit of ignorance. Watching for a second or third time would probably help pick up on all the little things.

Prelude: So, I watched all of Highschool of the Dead and its OVA last night. My penis feels like its been cheated. And I didnt even go into it caring about the fanservice! /u/Jordy56 has the right idea: If I wanna watch porn, Ill watch porn. While the dub made it a lot better than it would have been ([this line](https://a.pomf.cat/nevwro.mp4) had me fucking rolling), these super-ecchi, hentai-wannabe shows need to learn to either go all the way or go home. (Go back and reread that in Mr. Plinketts voice. It fits for some reason.) Anyway, nice to get back to something that doesnt have to rely on teasing horny weebs with impossible boob physics to keep an audience.

Is that actually true? If so, that's a pretty neat fact to know.

Watch anything else last night that you forgot to mention?

You are technically correct. The best kind of correct. Although, if they just keep giving more people immortality, the "younger" ones can absorb the "older" ones and continue on like that. Normal enough. Good lord though, the younger ones would eventually be so smart from all the previous knowledge.

Oh ho ho shit! Nice. So it's sort of an involuntary reaction? [So then](/s "If it's only for those in close proximity, perhaps Isaac has his immortality already. I suppose someone else could have it too. Maybe even Miria.")

The philosopher stone is part of the real historical record. It wouldn't be trade markable.

Apparently. It's not quite clear what the Entity means by "lose your real names for all eternity," but I'm guessing it involves like a mind-wipe thing or something that was explained better in the LN.

> It's not quite clear what the Entity means by "lose your real names for all eternity," but I'm guessing it involves like a mind-wipe thing or something that was explained better in the LN.


I think (if I remember correctly!) that the Demon is saying that he set the rule so that they will keep their real names, and not forget them over time. Immortals have a sort of involuntary reaction that prevents them from lying about their names in the presence of other immortals.


Edit: Found the quote from the first LN: "...Those who have drunk this elixir will lose the ability to use false names. It will be a mental constraint... If its just giving a temporary introduction to ordinary people, then there is no problem. But you will use your real name when conversing with fellow immortals, and your body will reject establishing a false identity in this world. ...If I dont do this, you will never be able to find each other..."


>> ARTICLE
Oh, that's interesting. So it's basically a way to ensure that they will be able to find other immortals. That way they can, I don't know, kill each other if they're tired of living or whatever.
>> ARTICLE
The devil sure took steps to ensure he wont get bored for the next couple of centuries.
>> ARTICLE
> Thats a pretty chill Demon. Giving them an opt-out if they decide theyre tired of living.

He's so considerate. I can't believe there's no catch, apart from having to use your real name with other immortals. 

> As you might have noticed by now, Elmer has this thing about smiling.

Worst timing ever bro. I felt like punching him whenever he said the word 'smile'. 

> Ive decided I want an unlimited supply of tapioca pudding.

This scene was gorgeous.

#Thoughts on the Episode:

So many characters, who look like they have interesting backstories, I just want to know if Maiza gave the biggest alchemists an invitation or why they were all gathered on this ship.

I just want to know if any of these characters on this ship gets more characterisation or some background in the LNs. /u/Revilrey1? 

and while I have /u/Revilrey1's attention [LN spoiler](/s "I still can't believe that Elmer is such a sociopath because this episode made him such a nice character although his "make everyone smile"-constraint his too strong, even after reading your examples from the LN. He just *so* friendly") hmm maybe I really need to pick up the LNs...

#Rules of immortality set by "the Devil":

* If you wish to die another immortal must place his right hand onto your head by this the devourer will inherit all knowledge of the person he had "eaten"

* same way to give knowledge

* you can't use another name than your real name when you are with other immortals

> and while I have /u/Revilrey1's attention [LN spoiler] hmm maybe I really need to pick up the LNs...

I don't know who this "Revilrey1" is...hey! Hey, you're not thinking of replacing me are you? I'm hurt. 

Kidding. Sorry I was late to this thread--it was unavoidable. As to your first question--yes. Yes they do. I gave a little background on some of the people who show up in this episode, and I couldn't even begin to talk about Huey Laforet in this thread without taking up half the page. 

I won't talk too much about Elmer, since once I get going I won't be able to stop, but yeah--I quite truly didn't notice anything 'off' about him my first watch, but after I started going online, reading the LNs...I took a closer look at him in the anime and you can tell if you pay attention. 

Asking Sylvie to smile right after she lost her lover and was threatened is definitely not within the social norm. That's Elmer for you. He wants you to smile purely for his own selfishness, no matter who you are or whether you're in pain or sad. He doesn't care. That was the hardest thing for me about him, because I love his character and it's easy to fool yourself into thinking he does, because he's a *moral sociopath*. He's doing things that look kind and warm, but you have to remember that he will use any means to get a smile out of you.

Though, the fact that he wants everyone to smile does complicate things, usually for the better. In the books, [spoilers only if you intend to read the LNs, guys](/s "a boy is about to jump off a bridge. Go on, Elmer says, if it'll make you happy. Then Elmer reconsiders, because well, a mess like that would make a lot of people unhappy, so the boy had better not do it! And to convince the boy, to show him what a mess it will make, Elmer jumps off the bridge.")

Literally the lengths this man will go to, the pain he's willing to endure. It's incredible. 

Still, knowing his past, I can see why he turned out the way he is.

They definitely do! Some of them turn up later, in the 2001 LN, but the 1700s LNs go into more detail about a lot of their backstories. And, of course, some of them, like Huey, are important to the plot in the 1930s.

Alright, so no gifs today!! ...... :( I like making gifs. This episode though, it just had such a huge amount of new info to absorb. I had a blast watching and writing up reactions. Time to move the plot forward at breakneck speed. Everything's out in the open now.

**--- Episode 7 - Everything Starts Aboard the Advenna Avis ---**

Oh, man! The OP! Ennis' picture comes up in the bottle that Szilard is pouring because he created her!

So it looks like anyone can be absorbed.

Maiza is apparently quite the big shot, and he worked alongside Szilard. Interesting.

Czeslaw was the first immortal. I'll call it now.

[ *insert Fullmetal Alchemist joke* ]

Szilard definitely has something to do with The Rail Tracer or he is TRT.

Czeslaw, ok, maybe not the "first ever" immortal, but he'll be the first among the main cast.

C'mon, just show this guy already.

Oh shit. Face sliced off.

Damnit. I thought they were going to test immortality on Czeslaw. I didn't think it'd end up being so, I don't know, magical. Obviously if all you have to do is drink some water everyone will do it. Especially after seeing Szilard reattach his head. Still a really cool reveal as to how they went about gaining immortality.

Ok. Anyone can consume others / give out information. They must also always use their real names.

Who's gonna murder the first immortal? Szilard looks like he's ready to kill any of these people siding with Maiza.

Maiza is respected as *hell* among these people. I guess the reason Szilard will break away from them is because he wants to make more of the formula.

Szilard killing these people? Poor Sylvie. Can't wait to find out what Maiza's brother is up to in the present day. Oh, well he's probably dead by Szilard's hand. Taking Gretto's info is likely how he was able to make the formula at all.

And yeah, Gretto is dead. Didn't expect it'd come this quickly, but Szilard spied, so yeah, dead.

Sylvie didn't drink! Wait, sooooo, what? Immortals can only absorb immortals?

The devil can talk to the immortals whenever he wants?

The devil comes across similar to The Outsider from the video game Dishonored. Technically the other way around based on when each work was released. Both give certain men power, watch them with interest, and have a secretive agenda of their own.

Who is the guy who abstained from voting? The guy who talked with the devil about being an observer? Ah, don't bother. I'll find it out in one of the other posts from you good people. (PS I figured out who it was while writing my speculation. See "...and some more.")

The devil is Luck Gandor?

**--- Post Episode Thoughts on the Future ---**

So much.

Questions:

Earlier when they summoned the devil, they talked about someone who had been alive for a long time. Is Szilard this person? It seemed like that was what the episode was trying to say. Which makes sense when you think that...

...Szilard wants to make more formula so he can continue absorbing as many people as possible to gain as much information as he can, yes? It would seem he's been doing that for quite some time. And if that's true, immortals can only absorb immortals, but...

...just to be safe because I have been so confused... Can someone please confirm: Immortals can only absorb immortals. Or can they absorb anyone?

It seemed like Szilard could not absorb Sylvie because she was not an immortal, and yet he was still able to pass information to her. That's what confused me. I guess the two powers have separate rules.

[no spoilers, just my speculation...](/s "Szilard is The Rail Tracer. This seems to be the safest prediction right now. He's on the train trying to procure that "item" that was said to be a bomb. I previously called bullshit that it was a bomb. I bet it's the immortal formula, and Szilard wants it. The hole in this theory is that The Rail Tracer seems to be a myth. Isaac painted him like a monster from a bedtime story. So how often is Szilard harassing trains that he's turned into a myth? Or maybe the two aren't actually related. Just good timing on Szilard's part. And if it's not Szilard, it's that conductor guy. Where the hell did he go to?")

[...to go off of that and enter Crazyville...](/s "If it is Szilard, Czeslaw is going to absorb him before meeting up with Maiza and co. in NY.")

[...and some more](/s "The "vote abstainer" is Huey. I hope they didn't say ......... mother fuck. I was telling myself, just go back. Stop typing your crazy speculation, and just comb the episode real quick to see if you can catch someone saying that guys name. I did. They called him Huey. Yay for me. I feel soooooo accomplished.")

Also, Maiza talked about Czeslaw at the end of episode one, and they shared a look once Czes arrived. I'm looking forward to seeing what their history together is.

Oh and Elmer's wish.

OH! And I remembered too that Huey and Chane share a last name. Wonder whats going on there.

So much stuff going on. So much fun!

Really looking forward to continuing this show. There are still a few scenes from episode one that I haven't figured out how they play into the story yet, and I can't wait to find out how they do.

I've seen many a person confuse them, so you're not the only one there.

Immortals can only absorb other immortals, yes. It is one of the unspoken side-effects of the first law.

I think you misread that scene. He didn't pass info to her with his hand. She just figured it out from what he said.

Mmmm no, I think it's safe to debunk this one, because if it was Szilard he would have just pointed him out--plus, Szilard was clearly not immortal before the events on the ship. I think Maiza was actually talking [about](/s "Dalton Strauss"), a character from the LNs. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok.

I thought that maybe Szilard and the devil were working together, so to speak. Szilard drinking the elixir didn't do anything since he was already immortal, and he and the devil were just trying to recruit more people.

Plus he seemed like he was already really into absorbing people so I thought he'd been doing it for a long time.
>> ARTICLE
Pfft, nah, Szilard's just a creep.
>> ARTICLE
A much needed episode that provides background on the 1711/2nd generation immortals. 

Stuff for the newcomers/people whove only seen the anime:

Lets put some names to faces, shall we? The anime wouldnt waste our time by showing random, faceless characters drinking the elixir, oh nothe anime was deliberately giving some screen time to immortals that are important in the LNs. 

[First pair.](http://i.imgur.com/P46MqN2.jpg) On the left (guy with purplish hair) is Victor Talbot, a British alchemist (the english VA does not sound British whatsoever). He was kinda driven out of England for arguing with the South Sea Company about slavery. He said the racial theory that all Africans were savage barbarians was bullshit based off his research and thus you couldnt justify the slave trade because of it. He made powerful enemies with this view and was thus exiled. He and Szilard were on the Advenna Avis being sponsored by House Dormentaire, a powerful noble family from Spain. Victor is hilariously prone to profanity in the LNs. You wouldnt think it by looking at him.

([Victors face](http://i.imgur.com/46UrWCb.jpg) is so incredibly *Victor* in this screenshot that I had to bring it to your attention. Look at his face. Look at it). 

On the right is Tougo Denkuro. Denkuro (a Japanese alchemist and samurai') was the only person with [Asian] heritage on the ship. 

[Second pair](http://i.imgur.com/TPl9GjZ.jpg). On the left (guy with dreadlocks) is Nile, who speaks English, Chinese, Indonesian, and the Berber languages. Hes a formidable warrior. In the LNs, he has a verbal tic--he often introduces his sentences by saying "I say this:." On the right is Begg Garott. Hes the family alchemist for the Avaros and the Meyers and he specializes in narcotics (he experiments on himself with the drugs he creates too). Hes in his 30s. In 1711, hes known for being a very fast talker. [Later](/s "not so much"). He and Fermet were the guardians of Czes on the ship, and he and Czes got along very well together. They played hide and seek on the ship.

[Third Pair](http://i.imgur.com/yMIEMV6.jpg). Gretto Avaro (Maizas younger brother) and 17 year old Sylvie Lumiere, Grettos lover/fianc. She originally became an alchemist because she wanted to be beautiful forever.' She was the only woman on the boat. After Szilards massacre, Sylvie was going to kill herself, but Elmer and Maiza managed to calm her down. Sylvie was a maid in the Avaro manor, so Gretto and Maizas (terrible) father didnt approve of their relationship.  Gretto convinced Maiza to let him and Sylvie run away on the Advenna Avis posing as assistants.

[Huey Laforet](http://i.imgur.com/JUdRTDp.jpg). His past and the events leading up to him boarding the Advenna Avis would take a while to explain, so I wont really go into it here. However, I will happily tell you that Huey was 100% an angsty teenager, and that fact alone brings me great joy.

[Maiza Avaro, in all his dorky round glasses glory](http://i.imgur.com/4aiFPRf.jpg). I mean, look at them. (He also had his hair in a ponytail in the 1700s, God bless him). Have I mentioned how much I love Maiza as a character? Id love to give you a detailed overview of his life before the Advenna Avis, but then again how could I condense a light novel into a paragraph? I wont go into the tricky stuff, but I'll give you a short summary of 'who he was' before the A. Avis. 

 So, he and Gretto were the sons of a Spanish drug-dealing aristocrat, and grew up in the Italian town Lotto Valentino. Maiza, believe it or not, in a fit of teenage rebellion formed the Rotten Eggs, a gang of delinquent aristocrats and called himself Aile because he didnt like his real name Maiza, since it sounds a lot like miser in English (not to mention avaro in Spanish is miser). He cant catch a break. Maiza, despite being the leader of the group (thanks to his skill with a knife rather than his prestige), doesnt take part in the thievery and extortion that his gang engages in.

[Elmer C. Albatross](http://i.imgur.com/3NmZqEF.jpg) [aka the Smile Junkie"](http://i.imgur.com/WDjM5Bd.jpg) 
aka an endlessly fascinating character I could probably write a whole damn paper on if I so chose. His childhood was incredibly horrifying and probably can be considered what warped him into the twisted persona he is today. 

[Czeslaw Meyer, Lebreau Fermet Viralesque, and Szilard Quates](http://i.imgur.com/Nga07Jp.jpg). Czes was actually quite a sweet kid before 1711. His family ran the Meyer Workshop, did stuff involving alchemythey all died in an accident (Czes grandfather was Beggs teacher). Begg and Fermet (who worked in the workshop for a while) said they would look after Czes on the ship.


Id love to post the entire exchange between Ronnie Schiatto (the demon) and Elmer, but that would be very long. Ill just put this small bit in. 

> The demon was silent for a moment, and then its voice rang directly inside his head. 

> **[Hmm.  I thought you were just a good-natured simpleton, but it seems youve got more evil than good in you.  Well, no matter. Youre an interesting one. Very well, I guess you could call this a connection between us.]**

> The demon said something unbelievably *exciting*.

> **[Ill give you any power you want, just say it.  If you wish, I can take away all the conditions from your immortality.  I can give you the power of farsighted, to look at distant places, or the power to stop time, or mind control. Anything.]**

CREEPY AS HELL ACTUAL SENTENCE spoken by Szilard when he prepares to devour Sylvie: 

> "To think I would come to eat a young girl here. My sexual desire has long since faded, but I'm so excited right now I have no regard for such things."

 What the hell Szilard. I dont know if this is the lust from an immortal youve just eaten or what but that's not cool.

I don't want to talk about them too much though. Not yet at least. Plus this is really long. I'll probably have to cut it. 

Poor Maiza, though. Really. His brother got devoured because of him. That's 200+ years of massive guilt issues right there. 

Chuck Huber as the demon is fantastic, and I really appreciate the VAs for the attention to detail by strengthening Maiza's and Czes' accents. They would have sounded different back then, to be sure. 
>> ARTICLE
Does Sylvie ever drink the elixir?
>> ARTICLE
This was actually already revealed in the episode, though I can see how one would miss it. Yes, she does--when Ronnie's talking to Huey at the end, a few clips of the immortals go by--Maiza in the hat shop, Czes on the train, [Begg Garott](http://i.imgur.com/UQCvdPT.jpg) experimenting with drugs, and [Sylvie Lumiere](http://imgur.com/tYOibL8), a little older and definitely not in the 18th century anymore.

Huh, I thought that might be her, but she looked so different I assumed it was another LN character. Thanks.

> Look at his face. Look at it

"Get that camera off of me!"

> he and Czes got along very well together. They played hide and seek on the ship.

> Id love to post the entire exchange between Ronnie Schiatto (the demon)

[speculation](/s "So, putting together this fact that his name is Ronnie together with the fact that /u/The-Sublimer-One said the accountant at the end of the episode is called Ronnie, I feel like I can rest easy in thinking that the two of them actually are the same people.")

> They would have sounded different back then, to be sure.

It is really cool and crazy to think that over large amounts of time their accents will adapt to wherever/whenever they are.
>> ARTICLE
I knew you'd come through with the backstories! Thanks for the great (as ever) summaries.


> However, I will happily tell you that Huey was 100% an angsty teenager


Huey is the angstiest teen I know. I like to think that he was really just brooding in the crow's nest, not really observing everyone. 
>> ARTICLE
He was *so angsty*. It was beautiful. 

I'd like to think so too, though it's a bit [difficult](/s "for me at least to figure out how much Huey's personality has changed since the events of 1710. He's definitely more calculating and distant (though let's face it, he wasn't the friendliest guy in the first place), which I guess is what he intended, but I'll conjure that he isn't yet the man he is in 1934, considering what he said to Elmer in the LNs.")

Now I'm picturing angsty brooding Huey just brooding in the shadows--aaand now I'm picturing Huey as an angsty emo kid in the 21st century. With a skull-covered beanie and a hot topic shirt and everything. Why would my brain do this to me? 
>> ARTICLE
[LN spoilers](/s "I find Huey hard to read at the best of times, but I think I agree with your thoughts! He's definitely trying to sit back and observe, but he's nowhere near as manipulative as he later becomes. Though I think you can see hints of it in his conversation with Gretto. His conversation with Elmer at the end of White Smile does seem to prove that he's still in there somewhere after the events of the novel. I think we may get answers to how much Huey has really changed in the 30s by the end of the arc, but I have no idea when that will be!")

This episode probably answered a lot of people's questions.

*Wrote this yesterday while waiting for the thread. Oh well...*


Okay, I'm starting to feel more confused as time goes on, but I'll just keep watching and hope I pick up some things I've missed or had trouble understanding before. It seems to be quite easy to lose focus when watching Baccano! because of how much is going on and the fact that it jumps from year-to-year, etc.

One interesting thing this episode explained (and I'm sure all the other new watchers figured it out too) was why, on the train, Czes introduces himself as "Czesaw Meyer" and then thinks to himself: "There must be an immortal here...".

This episode was a little different, but was entertaining nonetheless. The only thing I can think of that it maybe lacked was screentime for Isaac and Miria. Before watching this show I didn't really understand /r/anime's "obsession" with the couple, but it is clear to me now that they are great characters overall and bring a light-hearted side to what looks to be a very good show. I understand, though, that this episode was set in the past, before Isaac and Miria show up and so I think I can accept one episode without them, but if they don't show up next episode I'm gonna be visiting Episode 8's thread a very angry man!

> I'm starting to feel more confused as time goes on

That's why this show is so good to rewatch. It really helps to grasp things once it all becomes clear. Especially since upon rewatching you won't be confined to watch on a day-by-day basis.

> but if they don't show up next episode I'm gonna be visiting Episode 8's thread a very angry man!

Considering the next episode's title, that happening would actually be hilarious.

Being obsessed with Isaac and Miria is never a problem.

Soo, yesterday I wrote out a comment for an episode 7 post, and then my computer crashed and I lost it. C'est la vie. I'll try and remember the important things...


The first time I watched this episode, I didn't really care about any of the characters, except maybe Maiza. After reading the LNs, I'm far more emotionally invested in several of them, so it was really interesting watching it again! 


My only real problem was with some of the accents here and there...They all seem to have really heavy generic European accents. Huey's French accent makes sense, considering his name and everything, but it's far too strong for my liking! There are others that stick out as really weird now - for example, the guy with the massive sideburns, Victor Talbot, is meant to be British in the LNs, but has a weird French accent. I'm guessing Funimation just didn't have access to information like that at the time. 


I also think this episode does horror pretty well - not that the episodes set in the 1930s haven't been doing that pretty well with the Rail Tracer - but I think one of the scariest sequences so far in the show is definitely the scene where Sylvie is just running around the ship, with Szilard lurking in the shadows. 


Random facts:


The text that Huey and Gretto recite is from [The Emerald Tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Tablet), and I think it's from Newton's translation. 


Nile (the black guy who cuts Szilard in half) once went to Ikebukuro and had a fight with Shizuo. He lost. 


Speaking of DRRR!! crossovers, [](/s "Ronnie is apparently friends with Celty. It figures.")


[](/s "Does Ronnie's identity count as a spoiler? It's explicitly confirmed later, but I think if you put all the pieces together, it's pretty obvious in this episode.")
>> ARTICLE
[later episodes spoilers](/s "Ronnie is an odd case. I don't think his name was even mentioned yet. During my first watch I thought he was Luck. And yes, if you listen closely, both in the English and the Japanese dub, you'll notice that the demon and Ronnie have the same VA. Then you just have to put 2 and 2 together.")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Yeah, I didn't realise it my first time around, but now that I know, it's really obvious, especially with the catchphrase.

Ah, crap. Hey, newcomers, if any of you guys are still checking the thread here, I'm going to take a risk and warn you not to watch the episode preview at the end of episode eight. I can't tell if this is a spoiler in itself, so if **someone wants to call me out on this please do and I'll delete it/spoiler tag it.**

I'm just worried that the preview is a little too spoilery, so: **NEWCOMERS**, if you want to remain as in the dark as possible about what happens in future episodes, stop episode eight before the end credits are over. That's all I'll say about it.

I was out a lot this weekend, so I missed episode 6.  Catching up!

**Ep. 6:**

* Rail Tracer whispering sweet nothings to the girl in fatigues?  Weird.  There goes the most obvious suspect for who the Rail Tracer is, though.

* Luck gets the bottles from Dallas, and then Dallas gets captured and injected with... something.  It confused me that Dallas was a known immortal to the Daily Days, but then I remembered that that storyline takes place 1-2 years later.

* [Ennis meets Isaac and Miria!](http://www.gfycat.com/PhysicalUntriedGosling)  I wonder if they recognized her car...

* We're going on a ship next episode!  The plot summary for Baccano made that much clear from the beginning.  Kind of surprising it took this long to get there.

**Ep. 7:**

* Getting one storyline this episode was interesting, and yet somehow a little harder to follow!  I'm assuming because we're not familiar with all of these characters.  Was that Huey in the crow's nest talking with the devil toward the end?  It's possible that devil is somehow related to the Rail Tracer.

* Not sure why Elmer helped Szilard, or what exactly he wished for when he was underwater.  I guess it was giving Sylvie the vial of panacea?  I can see why she'd change her mind about living forever... or for only one night, in the case of her lover.  Goodbye, Gretto.  We hardly knew ye.

I'm not sure what you mean when you say Elmer helped Szilard. He takes Maiza's side in the mess hall. 

Do you mean when Elmer balances on the shiprail and calls out to Szilard? Essentially Elmer's aim was to convince Szilard to stop devouring the others, and if that failed, convince Maiza to be merciful. Why? Because if Maiza won then Szilard wouldn't smile/be happy, and the same vice versa. 

>> ARTICLE
I interpreted Elmer's actions on the deck as reminding Szilard that "Hey, you're immortal but you can't win a 6v1.  Just escape!"  It stops the devouring spree, but that was likely to end anyway if Maiza and Co. were able to catch Szilard (which they were very close to doing).
>> ARTICLE
Well, admittedly I'm just referring to the LNs, where Elmer explains to an incredulous Nile what he intends to do. At any rate, the anime is a little different from the LNs anyway, so your interpretation may work better in the context of the anime. After all, in the LNs Szilard isn't forced off the ship, he jumps off. 
>> ARTICLE
> Was that Huey in the crow's nest talking with the devil toward the end? 


Yup, that was Huey. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, alright.  I thought so.  Thank you!  (And thanks to /u/Saikimo, too.)

So episode 7, i actually quite liked this one, we got a lot on info about when the story started, inside a boat in 1711 and it's nice to have a full episode in a single timeline. This is probbably a set up for the next episodes so i expect more fights in the next episodes.

In the boat we can recognise some characters of the main timeline such as Maira, Szilard, Huey, Czes and that means they do have eternal youth and immortality. The only way to kill them is being "eating" by other immortal , the same thing that Szilard did. 

At this point i think we can pretty much guess what is everyone looking for in the train, knowing that a lot of immortals are involved. I think is about time to do some [speculations](/s "the Rail Tracer is Szilard who is trying to recovery the formula from the train, and probably that was the thing every other group is looking for in the train, if i am to guess probably in the next episode we will get to see the identity of the Rail Tracer and also the ingredients of the formula , maybe we get some more Dallas, because he seem to have an important role in all this. Maybe he was the first immortal made with the formula?") 

I don't know, maybe I just need to wait until the next episode because probably everything will be more awesome as we already reached the half of the anime so we will get a lot on info in the next episodes.

Edit: I don't know how to spoiler, sorry :P

I'm surprised that they dedicated an entire episode to the historic backstory,considering that its only 16 episodes long. That being said, it probably opened more questions for me than answers. And thinking about it, some quality tinfoil theories. I really can't believe that Maiza creep used to be a hotshot alchemist. Is he hanging on to Firo because he [speculation](/s "reminds him of Avaro? Also, what ever could have happened to him to make him work for the Chicago underground of all things?")

[More Speculation](/s "The "devil" never went away, and instead became a moralistic information broker hiding behind a newspaper fort in the Daily Day. ")

Also, as far I can guess, they got the recipe to make a philosophers stone. So who thought it would be good idea to call it a great panacotta of all things? 

Lastly, the ship reminded me of the good ol' Assassin's Creed games.
>> ARTICLE
> So who thought it would be good idea to call it a great panacotta of all things?

I joked that FMA had already trademarked the term Philosopher's Stone, but I really do think Narita called it that to help distinguish it from FMA.
>> ARTICLE
[your speculation...](/s "Maybe Firo does remind him of his brother. As for working for the underground, maybe he's bored? Or maybe there is a better reason for it. Now I can't wait to find out. And your second speculation, who knows. Only two characters we've never seen a face for! Hahaha!")

I sure hope he tries to summon an apple-aholic demon next time.

Regarding [your first speculation.](/s "I think it's heavily implied that Firo looks and maybe acts a lot like Gretto. It's no wonder that Maiza takes him under his wing.")

Panacotta? If that's a joke, it's a clever one. Just for clarity's sake, it's called the Great Panacea. 

Edit: Aw...why would you call Maiza a creep? He's the best. He's definitely not the sort who would hang around another person solely because they reminded him of his dead brother. Firo's more than that, I'm sure. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess I called him a creep because something about his 1930's self behaviour seems...off. Nothing personal. And yes, the panacotta was a joke. Probably because I have as much chance of getting hold of one as a philosopher's stone.
>> ARTICLE
>Also, as far I can guess, they got the recipe to make a philosophers stone. So who thought it would be good idea to call it a great panacotta of all things?

because the philosophers stone is too mainstream, and probably because this drink can't change any metal to gold.

It is "just" a cure-all.

Oh also--quick note about the elixir.  When you drink the elixir, you're essentially preserving your body at the time of consumption. If you have, say, a tattoo on your arm when you drink it, you'll have that tattoo forever (I think). If, say, your arm is chopped off, it'll reform with the tattoo on. 

This is evident with Elmer: [kinda spoilery for his backstory](/s "who due to the constant torture he received as a child has scars all over his body. His back is literally covered by them. ('It's worse in the front', he says). He still has those scars hundreds of years later"). 

As you can imagine, this 'rule' makes it hard to have a haircut. I think the LNs Huey (maybe?) cuts off his ponytail and puts it in a jar so it won't reattach itself. 

Actually the scientific and quirky aspects of immortality are given quite a bit of detail in the LNs--for instance, immortals can recover more quickly from types of injuries they've endured before. I won't go into it too much, for fear of spoilers. 
>> ARTICLE
The craziest example of body preservation is [LN spoilers](/s "the guy (forgot his name) who drank the potion while he had a knife in his neck, so he has to go around forever with a gaping hole in his throat.")
>> ARTICLE
[Hmm](/s "was that Lester? I did a quick search through my PDFs and in LN 16 'Mark' stabs Lester in the neck with the ice pick, then in the chest, stomach and leg. Lester manages to grab the incomplete elixir and drinks it in time. Of course, as Elmer points out to him, the elixir doesn't heal previous injuries, and Lester will be fated to be perpetually dying, in agony, until he dies of old age. Elmer gently says that if Lester would be happier to die, he could devour him right then...only on the condition that Lester would smile. When Lester refuses, even with the knowledge that Nicola was going to torture him, Elmer says "that's a shame. Then how about this? I'll be back in a few years...once you've change your mind."")

Though, Elmer says something quite interesting about the elixir and immortals. Apparently, he's heard, given enough time things will 'naturally improve.' So I guess if there was a gash in my arm and I became immortal, given enough time (decades? centuries? millennia?) it'd close. 

Though, he points out [that](/s "given Lester's injuries, it would take a very long time before they'd heal. Plus, does Lester really have enough time for them to heal anyway? He's only got till old age.")

Yeah, it's weird. I loved Durarara when I first saw it. Then someone recommended that I watch Baccano since it was made by the same people, and came first. I didn't think I would like Baccano more since I saw Durarara first, but I did. It's one of my favorite shows right now. Right up there with Cowboy Bebop, Madoka Magica, and Fullmetal Alchemist 2003.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're the first person I've found on this sub who likes Baccano better than Durarara AND FMA 2003 over Brotherhood (or at least recognizes that 2003 is worth being a favourite)... I could hug you right now.
>> ARTICLE
My brethren. (I didn't last far enough in Brotherhood to get to the new stuff.) 
>> ARTICLE
I always argue that FMA 2003 is better than Brotherhood in concept just not in execution. This means that if you can handle some plot contrivances and some odd pacing issues it's in theory better from a story standpoint. When it comes to characters each show does some better which means that it's down to preference. Animation is better in Brotherhood but I don't consider animation very highly when I rate shows so that's mostly balanced by 2003 having a better soundtrack. In the end Brotherhood wins for me just because I found myself less entertained by 2003. Had the ideas in 2003 been executed to satisfaction though it would clearly surpass Brotherhood and possibly even move into my all time favorites.  What all of that is to say is that between the two I feel like it's a lot of a closer call than people make it out to be often.

(oh, and just to note Baccano! *is* one of my favorites of all time. I love Drrr!! but it will never compare.)

I honestly didn't know people preferred Durarara over Baccano (guess I haven't been paying attention). Durarara's fun and all, but it doesn't hold a candle to Baccano IMO. The history, characters, setting, and dialogue are some of the areas I think are executed better in Baccano. Plus, Isaac and Miria.

What I'm getting at is this: group hug.
>> ARTICLE
I still prefer Durarara over Baccano tho. I love Durarara setting, characters are more interesting for me and I enjoyed Drrr slightly more. That being said, I am not denying that Baccano is great show.
>> ARTICLE
Basically the same case with brotherhood for me. I liked both shows, but there was only room for one on the list. 

>> ARTICLE
Well, Durarara!! is different on a fundamental level in that most stories have someone at their center. Baccano! has one story (well, more or less) with no one at the center.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno why I never thought to watch it dubbed seeing as it's set in America.

If people prefer subs though, the original voice acting was pretty reasonable, if a little eccentric. 
>> ARTICLE
> was pretty reasonable

It was great! Them being eccentric matches the tone and the characters perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
The subbed version's biggest selling point(s) is(are) Isaac and Miria. They are amazing subbed, and lose some of the magic when dubbed into english. That said, the dubbed version handily earns all of its praise.  
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but Isaac and Miria trump all other considerations. Subs are the only way for me.
>> ARTICLE
This. Times a million. MIIIIIRIIAAA. Doesn't get any better than that. 
>> ARTICLE
As someone who exclusively watches Subs, this show is the exception. I own multiple shows on DVD and have used services that offer both Sub and Dub, i 99.9% takes Sub just because i feel the original voices brings more to the show. In this case it is the opposite. The Dub voice actors really bring an additional element to the show that you just can't get with the Japanese. I highly suggest watching the Dub or at least trying an episode of both to see which you prefer. I would put money on you watching the Dub after hearing both though. 
>> ARTICLE
The subs are great no doubt, it's just they're so off given the setting. Like I said, it's set in America during a very distinctly American era and it's really weird to watch Mafia thugs and Chicago gangsters talking in Japanese. 
>> ARTICLE
> it's just they're so off given the setting

Isn't that like every anime that's set outside of Japan though? You might be more sensitive to it because you're from America, but I, a non-native speaker, had no problems with it.

I don't know. Maybe if an anime was set in Egypt or somewhere I will notice it more.
>> ARTICLE
Again, it's not just because it's in America, but because it's in such a distinctly American setting like the wild West. Baccano in Japanese is like watching a western in Japanese, it's just really weird and off putting. 
>> ARTICLE
That's what I'm saying though. I think you're more sensitive to it because you're American (I'm assuming) I also think that's why people don't care that things set in Scotland or in any medieval setting still have Japanese-speaking characters.
>> ARTICLE
Canadian actually. And I'd just say that overall it's an American setting that has somewhat permeated the world, like the wild West. If you say 'Mafia' in many places around the globe you'll think of guys in trench coats and suits with Tommy guns and underground bars talking about broads and dames and 'the family.' Just like talking about Samurai brings to mind visions of honourable, noble warriors steeped in worldly wisdom who wield mystical katanas. 
>> ARTICLE
> that has somewhat permeated the world

I recognize that. I'm just saying that for those who don't speak English as their first language, or aren't around that part of the world, the disconnect between the setting and the spoken language is overridden by the expectation that anime has lines spoken in Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
Ehh. I watched Berserk in Japanese too. I didn't even notice in either series. Unless the dubs are really impressive, I don't usually bother, regardless of their setting. 
>> ARTICLE
The Dubs phenomenal, they use eastern accents and everything.
>> ARTICLE
This is a case where the dub is damn impressive. Not just for good English voice over but for nailing era-accurate accents and slang.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, the slang is brilliant. When one of the Russo gangsters called Jacuzzi a "gunsel", I was a little floored. Like, did Jacuzzi just get 1930's burned in a one-off line not even uttered by a main character? When dub writers are willing to put that level of effort into the dialogue of each and every character, it's worth watching... many many times.

I side with you on this. The amount of hype people give to this show really makes it hard to live up to it. It's a very solid Anime, maybe worthy of a top 10 but isn't "the best" out there.

And make sure you're *paying attention*.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes! This show just **demands** a rewatch or two. Safe to say I have no qualms with that whatsoever. :D
>> ARTICLE
I actually think Baccano is really unfocused.  The different plots don't rely on each other very much at all which calls into question why they decided to tell the story this way in the first place.  (By which I mean that the events of any one arc didn't influence how I viewed the events or characters of any other arc)

None of the plotlines are particularly impressive on their own, and the storytelling style doesn't add much either since it's essentially just three separate stories told simultaneously for no real reason.
>> ARTICLE
You just don't get it, man.

You're like actively trying to dislike it.
>> ARTICLE
Two things:

* Criticizing a show and not understanding it are not the same thing.

* Baccano is absolutely not a difficult show to understand.
>> ARTICLE
You very apparently don't understand it if those are your criticisms, though.
>> ARTICLE
> Baccano is absolutely not a difficult show to understand.

A lot of people have difficulty understanding it when watching it for the first time.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention that the dozens of named characters all get introduced at the same time creating narrative confusion and making it really hard for the viewer to follow what's going on the first time around.  A better show would have slowly introduced the cast and maybe focused on certain characters that are more important to the plot/events than others.

As it stands, it feels like chopping up the story, playing it for us out of sequence, and spreading it out feels less like 'perfect storytelling' and more like a poorly used gimmick designed to hide the fact that the story itself is rather simple and uninteresting.
>> ARTICLE
You're not super supposed to follow what's going on the first time around.

Don't be so insulting to a show you can't even take the time to wrap your brain around character names, okay? It makes your casual show *really* easily.
>> ARTICLE
> You're not super supposed to follow what's going on the first time around.

So what, as a viewer I'm expected to watch a show at least two times just to understand what the hell is going on?  I'm sorry, but I don't have time for that.  And anything that blatantly disrespects the viewer's time like that is not 'perfect storytelling' in my book (and a lot of people's books).

> Don't be so insulting to a show

Sorry for kicking your favorite pet or something; I'm just giving my honest opinion here.  I wasn't born with photographic memory like you were apparently.  When you throw three dozen character names at me within 20 minutes, I'm not going to remember them.  That's just life.  I shouldn't have to sit down and study something either like I'm about to take a midterm exam either, just to follow what's going on in my animus either.
>> ARTICLE
The dates pissed me off. There were multiple times where I had to really think about the order of events to get the story straight. You can argue that the style doesn't want you to timeline the series but if you want to pretend like they all interconnect and have an impact on each other then the order of events is absolutely important.
>> ARTICLE
What exactly is wrong about a show making you think?

You must not be watching it correctly if you seriously think this.
>> ARTICLE
I'd rather a show make me think about the meaning of a plot or the conflicts characters have. While all of the characters were unique, they didn't have much depth to them and the plot itself was average. If there was a reason behind showing the plot segmented like that i would be okay with it, in fact i think if they changed the order it was presented it would be much better. With how was presented, they just chopped up a few character stories and presented them in a random order.
>> ARTICLE
The characters themselves weren't supposed to have depth, nor was the plot. Didn't you watch the intro with the loli?

The story itself is the character. The telling of the story is its depth. Thinking it's just random order, thinking it could've been presented better, is robbing the show of its one, true, real character.
>> ARTICLE
If the most complex part of your story is the way you tell it and not the characters or the plot, then you have an issue with content. I've seen nothing to tell me other wise that it isn't a random order, which is another part of the problem. There were plenty of scenes that would have been better off coming sooner or later than when they appeared. 
>> ARTICLE
> The characters themselves weren't supposed to have depth, nor was the plot

You realize to most people this is intrinsically a problem right?

This is exactly what everyone you have responded to was complaining about.  The plot and characters are relatively straightforward and not all that interesting*, and the anime tries to hide that behind flashy action and gimmicky storytelling methods.

Is the style they went with better than having all the arcs told one by one?  Maybe.  The monologues about storytelling at the beginning/end were certainly cool, but either way that won't just automatically turn the show into a masterpiece when every other aspect of the show simply can't carry the weight of that title.

*(This is a slight overstatement to make my point clearer as there were a few interesting things in the show for sure.  I'm not claiming the show is bad--I'm just claiming it's far from perfect.)
>> ARTICLE
> Not to mention that the dozens of named characters all get introduced at the same time creating narrative confusion and making it really hard for the viewer to follow what's going on the first time around.

It was trivial for me to follow what's going on the first time I watched it.  However, I don't try to memorize character names; I just track who did what.  The show does a fairly good job making the characters very unique so they're relatively easy to keep track of.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's a fair point to make, so long as the writing in the show recognizes this fact and doesn't ever actually requires you to know character names.  But Baccano!, even as early as the first episode, pretty routinely has characters making references to named characters that aren't on screen, and there's just no way of knowing what they're talking about without either having seen the show before, or having a character-glossary open and ready.

To compound that issue, Baccano!'s characters also routinely lie about their own identities, in ways and for reasons that aren't clear the first time around.  So there's this entirely separate level of obfuscation being layered on top of an already confusing situation.

Also, with other shows that have have huge ensemble casts that introduce dozens of characters at the same time, usually those shows make a conscious decision to stick with only a small handful of characters and give them screen-time/dialog priority over the rest of the cast.  Look at a show like LOST.  Episode 1, there's like a hundred characters.  But the entire first episode is framed through the perspective of Jack, and only really focuses on a small handful of characters who are important to the story at that time.  The rest of the cast is just there in the background and the show comes back to them later to flesh out their stories in a way that the viewer can easily follow everything that's going on and learn the names as quickly as necessary.  Meanwhile, Baccano! jumps perspectives continuously in the first episode alone and never gives that focus that says 'all you need to know are these handful of guys'.  That leaves the viewer discombobulated and not really sure who or what is important to follow.
>> ARTICLE
It goes back to episode 1.  The show as a whole is a retelling of the 'story' that happened by that girl to her editor/manager.  The idea is that the real events were a long series of strangely interrelated scenes, and that they didn't know where to start the telling of the story.

So, she just started with one scene, and then shifts to other scenes as appropriate.  No specific basis of chronological order -- instead, a conceptual sequence.
>> ARTICLE
So basically, the story is a jumbled mess, but because its a character telling the jumbled mess and not the author (allegedly) it suddenly transforms into something else?

Yeah I'm going to go ahead and call bullshit there.
>> ARTICLE
> So basically, the story is a jumbled mess, but because its a character telling the jumbled mess and not the author (allegedly) it suddenly transforms into something else?

No, the story is told piecemeal but in an order that is based on concepts and association, not strictly based on chronology or plotlines.  You may find it a 'jumbled mess' because you are limited in the ways you can understand and/or learn information.

I found it very easy to understand.  You ... well you're either dumb or you "simply have a personality and general perception that is not amenable to that format of storytelling".  Watching Baccano! is more along the lines of *discovering* information or hearing a friend try to explain a series of events to you.  It's very analog and organic.

Some people can't handle that.  It's not a common form of storytelling.  That's fine.
>> ARTICLE
I was saying that because it looked like what your post said, but looking back I was probably either reading this post along with a different one and merged them into one, or I was just confused due to having just woken up.  

Talking purely about my own opinion, I don't think the story is a jumbled mess.  I also however think there was very little if any merit to presenting the story the way they did outside of allowing the first and last 10 minutes of the series (not counting OVAs) to happen, and I think everything else about the show is more or less average.

And I don't think I have a problem with this storytelling style intrinsically either.  I can think of quite a few things that take a similar approach which handle it far better than Baccano does imo.  In particular, I really like Durarara, Mawaru Penguindrum, and Watchmen (non-anime, but oh well), the main difference with these cases being that the story and/or characters themselves have the necessary depth to support this style.
>> ARTICLE
I think Durarara is pretty mediocre.  It has none of the intensity of Baccano!  I was fairly disappointed when I watched it afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
I share the same sentiment. Jumping around characters and through different time periods gets messy really fast.

The reason a movie like Pulp Fiction works is that it covers such a short timeline and all of the scenes are contained events that can stand on their own. You could present almost any scene in the movie as a short film and it would be fine even out of context.

DRRR and Baccano really don't have that going for them. Every scene is missing context and important information because the author wanted to throw some kind of tangled web at the reader/viewer. It can be interesting at some points, but for the most part, it's really unnecessary.
>> ARTICLE
> I share the same sentiment. Jumping around characters and through different time periods gets messy really fast.

Baccano! is one of the very very rare times I will ever actually use the stance that the viewer has to be 'smart' enough to 'get it'.  Specifically Baccano! does require a significant passive attention to context in order to follow the story as its presented.

Personally I had literally zero trouble understanding the story, but that's me and I know most people don't pick things up as quickly.  As a result I think it's legitimate that a large fraction of viewers don't like Baccano! or think it's overrated -- the storytelling and presentation are risky in that sense and will not appeal to everyone.  A lot of people will think it's a mess.  No surprise.  A lot of the people who *like* Baccano! still don't *really* get it in terms of being able to follow the story 100% on the first watch -- they just like the characters or action and such and want to follow it.

I think that certain personality types specifically have a very hard time watching a show like this.  I think J ~~or S~~ MBTI types would really hate the show tbh.  Edit: probably just Js, although Ss may hate the pacing I think.

There's nothing to "get" about it though in the same way that there's nothing to get about a jigsaw puzzle. You reach into the pile and grab a random piece.

A few cuts in baccano are solid. Czeslaw's torture by his guardian leading into Claire is one. The problem is that those are the minority. A lot of them just function as a way to mix it up. It's not necessarily bad but for me, it doesn't really serve a purpose. I think the author likes to play around with the idea of parallel interconnected events a little too much
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find you've pretty much summed up Narita's narrative style.  That's how he rolls, so if it was the narrative style you had a problem with and not, say, the characters, you probably won't like his other work (notably Durarara but I believe Vamp is again the same).
>> ARTICLE
So if someone (like me) didn't like especially Baccano's characters but didn't mind the narrative style would you recommend Durarara?
>> ARTICLE
The narrative flow of Durarara!! is a helluva lot slower. If you can stomach a slower Baccano that doesn't focus on action, I say go for it.
>> ARTICLE
I did not like Baccano's characters much and loved Durarara. I don't know exactly the problems you had with Baccano, but if they were similar to mine then yeah I could see you liking Durarara.

A weird recommendation, but I recommend binge watching Durarara over watching it slowly, if possible. 
>> ARTICLE
Your recommendation is weird but I agree with it completely. I was extremely busy at one point in my college career when I tried to watch Durarara. I was watching about 2 episodes a week. I dropped Durarara not once but twice. A friend of mine then convinced me the story gets much better as it goes on right around when I had a full saturday free. I started binging that morning, got past where I dropped and couldn't stop watching. I don't know what it is about that show that makes each episode better when watched in quick succession.
>> ARTICLE
Depends what you didn't like them for.  Durarara is a lot more shounen-like whereas Baccano is definitely more seinen-themed.  So for example is you like quirky dudes showing off just how quirky and unique their powers are, you'll like Durarara more, whereas if you prefer philosophical musing and hard 180-degree character turns yet still didn't like Baccano, then Narita is probably not for you.  However, you might want to check out the upcoming Chaos Dragon.  From the description:

Chaos Dragon is based on the role-playing fiction project Red Dragon, a story which was created by five notable character designers: Gen Urobochi (Fate/Zero), Kinoko Nasu (Kara no Kyoukai), Iduki Kougyoku (Mimizuku to Yoru no Ou), Ryohgo Narita (Durarara!!), and Simadoriru (member of the Stripe Pattern doujin circle). The results of their tabletop role-playing game sessions over six days created material for a seven-volume light novel series.
>> ARTICLE
That conclusion makes sense but I actually love Durarara.  I think it's a lot better at tying multiple different plot threads together, and I like the characters significantly more.  Also, although this might be specific to the anime adaptation, I think the way the narration in Durarara is written is really cool.

It's also worth mentioning that I don't actually dislike Baccano.  It does some things really well (style, music, relatively good characters), but I also have problems with it such that my reaction is a resounding "meh".
>> ARTICLE
Just finished it yesterday. I found myself enjoying Bacanno more than Durarara. Can't say I particularly love this style of storytelling, but Bacanno is definitely worth a watch and seems to have a sense of direction than Durarara (at least personally).

It helps if you actually pay attention to the timeline otherwise the story might feel all over the place.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano! isn't overrated but not an masterpiece either as everyone portrayed. I can understand why it get this praise, and it is simply because of so-called "non-linear" story telling. To be frank, I liked Pulp Fiction movie, and have seen a hell a lot of "non-linear" movies. But somehow Baccano! doesn't impress me as much as some other movies did. After first 2 episodes, things looked kick-ass and I kinda fell for it, but then comes characters after characters, serving no purpose or be there just for the sake of it.

I wanted to finish Baccano! badly, but I couldn't. If I must say, I dragged myself from 11th episode onwards. Till then it was okay-ish but then it got too boring, I literally had to drag myself to watch it for closure(for my OCD kinda thing! I need to finish if I am already half way even if story is crappy! sigh) and to understand why it get such praise! I understand this is my personal opinion, but then, why people suggest Baccano! for everyone?

My problem with Baccano! is, it is literally stuffed with too many characters. Don't say that's the beauty. I am not talking about Jacuzzi, Claire etc. I am talking about other characters who is just there in the screen and serve nothing to story! And by story, I meant closure! Too many of anything spoils its value and that becomes true with this otherwise good anime. Yes, I would have liked the show if not for last 3 episodes where only thing happening is blood splatting all over the place and people talk, talk and those talks not contributing for story or their goal!

The setting is good, I agree. Some action sequences are good. The way characters come across with each is good. But as an complete package, it fails to deliver what other non-linear story telling movies/shows does. I rated it an 7/10, just because of Isaac & Miria and for episodes 2-10. Nothing else.

Isaac and Miria are better characters, but I like [spoilers](/s "Firo and Ennis") better just from a couples standpoint.

Thirteen episodes plus three extra OVA's, so sixteen in total. Never was a second season, though I desperately pray there will be.

If I remember right the anime made some changes to the novel that make a sequel almost impossible, they would probably need to remake the series.
>> ARTICLE
Not at all. For one thing, the novels bounce around a lot of different times, so even if it changed things, it wouldn't be a problem. But actually it changed nothing substantial; left out a character that wasn't very interesting and simplified one novel, but ended up at the same place.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so. They seriously altered the Drugs and the Dominoes story, which is what the 1932 arc is based on, but that story is fairly self-contained and they could absolutely carry the show on if they wanted.

I've watched about 25 shows. The most important factors for me are stories that wrap up nicely with complexity and a lack of loose ends and strong characters that you can develop relationships with.

If you guys liked the show, you'll love the light novels.  The author's writing translates well and there's a host of delectable plot twists and characters to enjoy.  Almost everything's been translated, so you'll have a fairly seamless reading experience.

Not much.

Just a series of seemingly unrelated events that all eventually tie into each other to develop a greater overall story.

Baccano pretty much does that, but the main backdrop being 3 very distinct timelines instead of somewhere all around the same time-ish, rearranged.

I went in expecting the anime version of Lock stock and two smoking barrels, but it left me a bit... unsatisfied.

For me, the narrative choice was what drew me in, but I didn't think the individual story lines were that interesting. I was simply waiting for when shit would hit the fan, and the moments leading up to them were quite lackluster, and even the payoffs were not that great.

I never got that feeling of frenetic energy like when I watched Guy Ritchie's films. On the plus side though, the music's fantastic.

> Whoa man where do I get taste as good as yours to say it's overrated with no backing evidence at ALL.

Baccano! is, in fact, overrated.  Specifically the storytelling approach is risky -- a lot of people will inherently not appreciate or 'get it', and therefore the show is not for everyone by a good stretch.  As a result, when people claim that Baccano! is the best show ever, that is called "overrated".

It's an excellent niche anime, but the degree to which some people hype it is misleading to random people who haven't seen it.
>> ARTICLE
I make no claims to have any sort of incredible taste. Just as well, I'm not here to write a thesis for you on an anime that I didn't like very much. 

Most of my friends were incredibly high on the anime, and it seems like something of a cult hit more than something of an immense popularity. That being said, the people who like it seem to *really* like it; it's not quite as good as people say, but it's an enjoyable experience. Definitely a little too highly acclaimed by fans, but again that isn't to say it isn't a solid series. 

EDIT: I'm also a little confused by your hostility. I don't like something and that's completely okay; you like it and it's just as okay. There's no need for an argument or anything like that; you don't need to justify anything and neither do I. My general 'not-caring-for-ness' of the series is not a personal attack on you or anyone else.

I just don't see how it even can be overrated unless it's hyped as something it isn't.

This is one of the most hyped series I've ever heard of and your post is proof of that.

It deserves every bleeding ounce of that hype.

What is even though point of arguing "overrated" or not, anyway. Who freaking cares. 

It's about the show's quality (10/10 astounding I don't care who knows) not about whether or not a large or small group of people acknowledge said quality.
>> ARTICLE
Arguing a show is overrated is obviously the counter to 10/10. Why would i agree with your rating which is clearly way to high for your show? In cases like this, we argue that the show is over rated, since it is receiving a rating which is over what we think it should be.

Franky I think it deserves all the hype it can get.

I actually finished Baccano! yesterday by recommendation of a friend who praised it forever. I understand that it manages to tell 3 stories at the same time and still tie them all up into a satisfying ending but it just doesn't feel like a 10/10 to me. ~~[I mean...](/s What even is the deal with the Rail Tracer? He has no real motivation to do what he does and seems like his sole purpose in the story is to stop Ladd Russo.)~~

I still liked it though, i just don't feel like it's the masterpiece people make it out to be. Then again, I'm not really into this kind of setting/era (If you are, totally watch this!).

 Oh and the opening, though, is a real masterpiece indeed! One of the best openings I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
What motivation are you even looking for?

This isn't some deep character study.

It's about a disparate cast coming together for adventures during various chunks of time. Who cares what their motivations are. You glean what you can from their actions, watching how they interact different characters.

And *clearly*, from what you think his motivation was, you didn't pay good attention at all.

Do you want the show to spell it out for you? No. That's how a hack writes.

Watch it again, and pay attention. 

It's a 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm sorry for not liking it has much as you do. I wish i did.

> but it just doesn't feel like a 10/10 to me. I mean...


Claire Stanfield -the Rail Tracer- has his motives. The reporters talking about him said he operates on his own sense of justice, and a bunch of murderous thugs hijacking a train and killing innocent passengers violated that sense of justice. Hence he started killing all the hijackers and Russo thugs.

I disagree. I watched in sub and in no way did it feel like your example. I have no problem with people watching it dubbed, but you simply can't know what everyone will prefer, so telling people they MUST watch it dubbed is really one sided. I tried dub later. It wasn't for me. Yes they did a better job than most dubs, but I still think original VAs fit much better. So please can dub fans stop INSISTING that everyone watched it the way you liked it? At least let people give subs a chance and choose by themselves.

Too ambitious without the writing to match. A boring, confusing mess of a story with a huge cast of one-dimensional characters.

I just do not understand the praise this show gets. As of right now, it stands at 8.62/10 and ranked #58. Thats pretty impressiveat least thats what I thoughtbut this was the show that made me question anything on MyAnimeList. An 8/10 is meaningless when Dragon Ball Z is rated 8.28/10. Are you guys even trying to be objective? I think youd better off with having a Shit/Not Shit rating system.

Im beginning to think the people who like Baccano! do so because it makes them feel smart. They get the story. They can follow it and appreciate all delicious complexities. They can keep up with its non-linear storytelling. Anyone who doesnt understand this must be goddam peasant with the IQ of a vegetable.

Baccano! is shit, and you should feel bad for ever recommending this garbage to someone. Its just gimmick after gimmick that tricks you into thinking its better than actually is. If you break it down to the fundamentals of good story telling it fails.

Ill admit that its ambitiousjust like another certain show Ive reviewed (hint: the first word is Sword and ends in Shit). Baccano! juggles a huge cast, multiple intersecting plotlines, different time periods, and attempts it in 16 episodes. Its admirable, but when your ambition is that big you better fucking bring your A-game.

And Baccano! fails miserably. Its so obvious that the writers goals could not be met by their abilities. Its all gimmicks and flash to cover up poor writing. I can forgive boring characters if the story and plotting were good. I can forgive a shit story if the characters are charming enough. But Baccano! has neither. The show 24 has some terribly shallow characters, but, goddamn, you cannot say it doesnt keep your ass glued to the seat.

There are so many characters, and almost all of them are forgettable. I get it. Youve got a big cast, and you dont have time to give everyone an episode to tell their sad, childhood story. Then cut or combine some characters. I couldnt tell one gangster from another, and there were too many characters I didnt understand what purpose they served to the story other than just existing. Worse, the shows tries for this authentic, Prohibition era America setting only to have the tone ruined by some lame, anime-styled characters. Theres a lot of dialogue that is just embarrassingly cheesy.

The story is told in a non-linear way which is just another way of saying, Fuck you if you cant keep track of every little detail, you mongoloid. The plotting skips around so much you cant tell if youre watching a flashback. One moment youre trying to understand whats happening and itll cut to different characters in the past without any indication. This isnt innovative or bold. Its confusing. Im not asking to be spoon-fed a story. Nobody is, but its up to you as the writer to balance between telling the story in an engaging way and making sure its understood.

Most of the story takes place on a train. I cannot stress the quotes around the word story enough because there is none. Now I thought it was gonna be one of those coincidence stories where everyone is going after the same thing on the same day in the same place, and the fun comes from them figuring out how to deal with each other. Youve got gangsters dealing with thieves and an urban legend monster lurking on the train. That wouldve been 100x more exciting than what I actually got which was none of that. Theyre literally just on the train for no reason. They run into each and stuff happens. Theres no ultimate goal or something to accomplish, and when you dont have that why the fuck should I care?

"Blending sci-fi and pulp fiction to create an entertaining saga unlike any other, this action-packed anime series revolves around the exploits of a group of immortal 18th-century alchemists currently living as Prohibition-era gangsters."

The Netflix description is as exciting as the show gets.

It doesnt even explore or do anything with its immortality gimmickwhich was what got me interested in the first place. When they finally talk about it doesnt have any effect on the rest of the story. You couldve taken it out, and itd still be the same boring shit.

And after all this youre left asking, What was Baccano! even about? Its sad when the only thing I liked was the opening.

> Baccano! is shit, and you should feel bad for ever recommending this garbage to someone. Its just gimmick after gimmick that tricks you into thinking its better than actually is. If you break it down to the fundamentals of good story telling it fails.


I'd usually say that this is a subjective opinion, but I can't. I really just feel this is incorrect.



> There are so many characters, and almost all of them are forgettable.


For the life of me I cannot understand this opinion. Jacuzzi, Ladd, Claire, Chane, Rachel, Czes, Szilard, Firo, Ennis, Dallas. They are all unique, both in look and voice. They have colorful personalities that are quickly and efficiently shown to us so we can understand them immediately and therefore know why they're doing what they're doing. 


> Youve got a big cast, and you dont have time to give everyone an episode to tell their sad, childhood story. 


That's the beauty of the show, they sufficiently fleshed out the characters without needing to drag us through half and episode of backstory. They way they speak and act is all we need. The way Ladd treats people and talks about them is all we need to establish his mindset, same with Jacuzzi, Claire, Nice, Dallas, and the rest. They radiate personality in both voice and action and really don't need any exposition to tell us who they are because they tell us who they are.



> Worse, the shows tries for this authentic, Prohibition era America setting only to have the tone ruined by some lame, anime-styled characters. Theres a lot of dialogue that is just embarrassingly cheesy.


I legitimately don't know who you could be talking about here, all the characters work perfectly with both the tone and setting. 




> The story is told in a non-linear way which is just another way of saying, Fuck you if you cant keep track of every little detail, you mongoloid.


That's true if done in a lazy fashion, Baccano is not lazy in its story however. Starting off from seemingly chaotic and unrelated incidents it does a perfect job of showing how these incidents set off and connect with other unrelated acts and tie them all together. The story starts off as a bunch of jumbled and disconnected threads and is woven together into a fully coherent story, that is a mark of good non-linear story telling.



> The plotting skips around so much you cant tell if youre watching a flashback. One moment youre trying to understand whats happening and itll cut to different characters in the past without any indication.


I disagree. Different characters are firmly established within different story arcs so just by the characters alone we can follow what is happening to who. Eve never appears in the 1930 or '31 arcs so we automatically know it's in 32, likewise with other characters. And the scenes shift around just frequently enough so that you aren't forgetting what just happened.



>  its up to you as the writer to balance between telling the story in an engaging way and making sure its understood.


Honestly that strikes me as your failing to follow a story which judging by overall feedback from the majority of watchers wasn't a crippling roadblock.



> Most of the story takes place on a train. I cannot stress the quotes around the word story enough because there is none. 


Correct, there are many. It isn't a singular story about one thing, it's multiple stories. Everyone has a different story to tell about the same thing and that's what we see. 



>  Now I thought it was gonna be one of those coincidence stories where everyone is going after the same thing on the same day in the same place, and the fun comes from them figuring out how to deal with each other. Youve got gangsters dealing with thieves and an urban legend monster lurking on the train. That wouldve been 100x more exciting than what I actually got which was none of that.



Well that is purely subjective. I found it extremely entertaining to see such a organic story where everything is changing constantly and new elements are always been thrown into play, the fun came from watching the various characters deal with the constantly changing situation. 


>  Theyre literally just on the train for no reason.


They all have their reasons. Russo is trying to make money (and kill some people) Jacuzzi's gang is trying to steal a package, Czes is trying to delivering a package, Isaac and Miria are trying to just go to New York, and Claire is on his way to help the Gandors. All of this helps with the meta-narrative about story telling, that there is no 'main plot' or character, that it's all about the stories of each different person and how different unrelated events tangle together to form new stories.



> They run into each and stuff happens. Theres no ultimate goal or something to accomplish, and when you dont have that why the fuck should I care?


No there's no big goal like saving the world or any such thing, it's about watching interesting characters deal with a changing situation and how all these unrelated events run into each other. Ladd starts off just pulling a mere robbery and ends up in a physical and philosophical battle with the Rail Tracer. Jacuzzi is trying to steal some freight and ends up trying to protect the train, while Czes is just trying to get to New York and starts trying to kill all the passengers for his safety. As the saying goes, it's about the journey not the destination, and the journey is one helluva ride.



> It doesnt even explore or do anything with its immortality gimmickwhich was what got me interested in the first place. 


No, it's just a fun element the story plays with. How would some petty punks act if they got immortal bodies? What about some cold heartless immortal bastard who runs into more than he can handle? What about the hilarious implications of a couple of idiots and mob thugs all becoming immortal? 



> And after all this youre left asking, What was Baccano! even about? 


It's about people. Different people doing different things and watching how everything runs together. Fun and entertaining characters dealing with situations in the ways they know how and watching what follows, along with some delightfully pretentious meta-narrative of storytelling that has some damn fine points.

I guess you have lower standards for what good, memorable characters are. Ladd Russo was my favorite. He was so much fun and snapped me out of my boredom whenever he came on. Now that I think about, boredom was how I felt during Baccano! 90% of the time. I remember Jacuzzi being a whiny, annoying little bitch. Ennis (or was it Claire? Whatever) was some bland, robotic sidekick to that old guy with the Miroku-hand. Everyone else was too bland and one-dimensional to care or remember about.

That guy in prison with the long hair just screamed anime character. Then the Rail Tracerman, that was fucking broke all my immersion. Some super acrobatic guy from the circus can just around the train cars like Spider-Man. Okay.

Wow, that certainly sounds likes a fun story. I hope I have fun, interesting characters to follow for thisoh, wait. No. Nobody was interesting. At most, they were annoying.

>I disagree. Different characters are firmly established within different story arcs so just by the characters alone we can follow what is happening to who. Eve never appears in the 1930 or '31 arcs so we automatically know it's in 32, likewise with other characters. And the scenes shift around just frequently enough so that you aren't forgetting what just happened.

Again, boring characters. Dont care.

>Honestly that strikes me as your failing to follow a story which judging by overall feedback from the majority of watchers wasn't a crippling roadblock.
Nope. I followed the boring story fine. I only say confusing as its an appropriate word for its liberal use of flashbacks and cuts which are really bad when youre trying to get invested into a moment or scene.

>Correct, there are many. It isn't a singular story about one thing, it's multiple stories. Everyone has a different story to tell about the same thing and that's what we see. 

Boring characters. Dont care about their stories then.

>Well that is purely subjective. I found it extremely entertaining to see such a organic story where everything is changing constantly and new elements are always been thrown into play, the fun came from watching the various characters deal with the constantly changing situation. 

Subjective this, subjective that. Yeah, and it wouldve been nice to have something to care about. An ultimate goal. You know, literally the basis of all story telling? Otherwise, Im just watching a slideshow of characters I dont care about.

>They all have their reasons. Russo is trying to make money (and kill some people) Jacuzzi's gang is trying to steal a package, Czes is trying to delivering a package, Isaac and Miria are trying to just go to New York, and Claire is on his way to help the Gandors. All of this helps with the meta-narrative about story telling, that there is no 'main plot' or character, that it's all about the stories of each different person and how different unrelated events tangle together to form new stories.

Again, boring, one-dimensional characters. You can write all the cool back story you want but if the character Im watching on screen is as fun as cardboard then who cares.

>No there's no big goal like saving the world or any such thing, it's about watching interesting characters deal with a changing situation and how all these unrelated events run into each other. Ladd starts off just pulling a mere robbery and ends up in a physical and philosophical battle with the Rail Tracer. Jacuzzi is trying to steal some freight and ends up trying to protect the train, while Czes is just trying to get to New York and starts trying to kill all the passengers for his safety. As the saying goes, it's about the journey not the destination, and the journey is one helluva ride.

>No, it's just a fun element the story plays with. How would some petty punks act if they got immortal bodies? What about some cold heartless immortal bastard who runs into more than he can handle? What about the hilarious implications of a couple of idiots and mob thugs all becoming immortal? 

How many time do I have to emphasize this? Baccano! has a terribly uninteresting cast. They're boring, annoying, and cringey.

>It's about people. Different people doing different things and watching how everything runs together. Fun and entertaining characters dealing with situations in the ways they know how and watching what follows, along with some delightfully pretentious meta-narrative of storytelling that has some damn fine points. 

Youre really telling me something new here. Its almost as if ALL stories are about people, their motivations, their values, their goals.


>> ARTICLE
> I guess you have lower standards for what good, memorable characters are. Ladd Russo was my favorite. He was so much fun and snapped me out of my boredom whenever he came on. Now that I think about, boredom was how I felt during Baccano! 90% of the time. I remember Jacuzzi being a whiny, annoying little bitch. Ennis (or was it Claire? Whatever) was some bland, robotic sidekick to that old guy with the Miroku-hand. Everyone else was too bland and one-dimensional to care or remember about.

And I can very honestly say this is all subjective. Ultimately it's all subjective, but the fact is that the majority of the people who watched this show found the characters to be quite interesting, or most of them at least. The implication here is that the characters were objectively well-done, otherwise they wouldn't be so loved. 


> That guy in prison with the long hair just screamed anime character. Then the Rail Tracerman, that was fucking broke all my immersion. Some super acrobatic guy from the circus can just around the train cars like Spider-Man. Okay.


I don't know what on earth an 'anime character' is since anime has produced all kinds of characters, and neither do I understand why you're so pissy about an anime character being *in an anime.*


> You know, literally the basis of all story telling? Otherwise, Im just watching a slideshow of characters I dont care about.


Basis of many stories but not all. *Pulp Fiction* doesn't have any main goal, instead the entertainment comes from watching the characters interact with each other, and you'll be hard-pressed to find people who think it was a poor piece of entertainment.

Its something called tone." Baccano! clearly attempts for this authentic, Prohibition-era America but your immersion is destroyed when you see such obvious, cliche anime character.

Dont compare this garbage to Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction was a great movie with memorable characters and clear, focused stories. Both of which Baccano! lacked. PF didnt cut away every 5 seconds when you were getting invested into the scene. Id hate to imagine if the The Gold Watch was cut by a flashback then cut back in the next episode.



>> ARTICLE
> Again, the classic its all subjective defense. Its the greatest get-out-of-jail card against all criticism.
 


Oh hush. Just because it can be used like that doesn't entirely invalidate it. In this case it blatantly is subjective; I like the cast and you do not, that is two different opinions being formed on the same topic, that is subjective. Of course the characters are also demonstrably objectively well-made, they're just not to your personal liking.


>  Its something called tone." Baccano! clearly attempts for this authentic, Prohibition-era America


Tone and setting are not the same thing. The tone of Baccano is overall a thriller/adventure feel, a tone that can be applied to any setting. Just because the setting in the dirty thirties and it features the mob doesn't mean it has to be a grim detective noir flick or *The Untouchables.* 


> your immersion is destroyed when you see such obvious, cliche anime character.


I'm not sure which cliche anime characters you're talking about. I wouldn't say any of the cast is character-type exclusive to anime like a tsundere or something of the like. Lovable idiots, charming killers with strange personal philosophies, strong and silent types,  tomboy, spineless little whiner with a defining hero moment, none of these are specifically anime characters, they're found all over the world. 



> Dont compare this garbage to Pulp Fiction.


You made the point that all movies/stories need some clearly defined ultimate goal. I pointed out that Pulp Fiction has a similar style, there's no real main goals everyone keeps chasing through the movie, the entertainment comes from watching the characters and their actions and seeing how they collide and intertwine with each other.



You're entire criticism basically boils down to not liking the characters, and that's fine. But you can't say that the show is genuinely poorly constructed or that the characters are badly developed because that is just your opinion. General critical opinion of the show contradicts yours, with the overall consensus from critics being that is well-put together with an interesting cast.

I saw that this was what it was trying to do, but in my opinion, it really fails at it.  Really it comes down to the characters being forgettable.  I had no group or character I felt attached to to root for, and so the interactions were entirely irrelevant, I had no stake.
 After watching, I could not tell you a single character's name.  The lack of interesting interaction led to an incoherent mess.  It is one of two shows I ended up giving a 1.

This is coming from someone who typically loves the thinking shows, ergo proxy, shinsekai yori, tatami galaxy, I'll eat that shit up.  Idk, show is not for everyone I guess.

I do acknowledge that on a personal level the show and its cast aren't for everyone, but the fact that it has been so well received implies that the characters were built pretty well or else they wouldn't be as popular as they are. 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, popular doesn't mean well put together.  If that were true the transformer movies, or 50 shades of grey must be masterpieces of their art.  Or even for Anime context, sao is generally acknowledged as popular but not that good.
>> ARTICLE
> Eh, popular doesn't mean well put together.

Personally I think Baccano! fits the concept of "very well put together for what it is, but will not be popular because it doesn't match the taste of the majority of viewers".

In other words, I agree that popular != good, but I think I apply it to Baccano! the opposite of how you intended the statement.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really glad I read this. I posted a few days ago asking what to watch, Baccano! Was recommended and I just so happened to own it from a convention I went to awhile ago. I watched the entire series finishing it 2ish days ago and making a post about it not living up to the hype. You have captured exactly what the problem is. Overly complex story telling with under developed characters and weak plot.

This series would have been much better if they ran an episodic approach and told each piece of the story completely and uninterrupted. The order you tell the stories doesn't matter, what's important is you aren't telling 3 stories at the same time when they are in different years. Why is that creative and praised? The premise that stories don't have a start and an end is understandable, all events set other events in motion. Got it. Presenting those events in a way that makes them interesting and easy to understand is the point of storytelling. 

Can someone tell me the point of episode 1? Episode 1 is the best example of being confusing for no reason. After seeing the entire series, I have no idea why the bookstore scene is even important let alone shown so early. All you did was show a character trait and then have 12 episodes of the past of that character before he finally gains that trait, to the point where you don't even realize that story is before that point.
>> ARTICLE
I suspect people like Baccano! for the novelty of it. 

"Oh, look, it's a wacky anime with a bunch of 'cool' characters and a really 'innovative, creative' way of a telling a story."

Baccano! is a gimmick, and that's all it is. 

Its characters are one-dimensional. Its story is nonsensical and pointless. Literally pointless because there is no goal. Nothing for the characters to accomplish.

Here's how Baccano! could've been 100x better.

All the characters are on the train after the immortality elixir. As the show progresses, there are flashbacks to where they were before they boarded the Flying Pussyfoot. The excitement comes the diverse cast of characters interacting with each other from gangsters, thieves, and a monster lurking on the train.

There, isn't that so much more exciting than the garbage we actually got?

Baccano! as-is is basically similar to what you suggest except radically better because of the intentional discord of chronology.

Nope.

Its current pacing is mundane and bad. It may be "radical", but it's not better.

"You're trying to get invested in this scene? Well, fuck you. Here's a flashback and a cut to another scene."

EDIT grammar
>> ARTICLE
> "You're trying to get invested in this scene? Well, fuck you. Here's a flashback and a cut to another scene."

You "try to get invested" into scenes?

You're a strange person.

Either the scene draws you to invest in it or not.  If you're trying then either the show is bad, your comprehension is bad, or you have a personal mismatch with the show.


You simply "don't get it" / the show doesn't match your preferences and personality.  Without going into too much detail, I'll just use one core example:

> Here's how Baccano! could've been 100x better.
> All the characters are on the train after the immortality elixir.

No.  You seem to be the type of person that likes a structured story that expresses something discrete.  In other words you want a definitive premise upon which you can ingest the rest of the story.  "All the characters on a train for the elixir" -- this is a type of concrete basis that you personally favor as an anchor to build a story off of.

This is 100% not how Baccano! is delivered or intended to be delivered.

The very first scene of the first episode describes that: they say the train "incident" doesn't have a clear beginning or end.  That it, in fact, could be scene as pure coincidence for so many actors to be on the same stage, but that with the full story you can see that it was connected after all.  It's presented as an investigation mirroring how that girl learned about the multiple plotlines.

In other words, the primary story of the entire train incident has no singular cornerstone or anchor for "why these people be here doing their thing".  This is much like reality -- people are in places for disparate reasons.  This show just highlights the incredible case of when [semi-]disparate people end up in the same place at the same time with wildly different agendas.

The secondary story comes into play in arrears revealing that these disparate storylines are, in fact, connected in a supernatural fashion -- exactly what the girl in the first episode was leading towards.

In other words the anime as a whole is intended to be presented in a nebulous fashion in piecemeal, and then coalesce by the end into a complete story.

You prefer a building block approach with one piece constructed at a time.


That's fine.  The story doesn't work for you.  There a legions of stories told in this fashion, because it is the norm.  Personally, I think it's great that there's a show like Baccano! that tells a story in an inverted fashion.  I think it's excellent, but I can easily see why many people don't like it.

However, that does not mean it "should be changed".  Your suggested does not "make it better".  It makes the story more mundane and mirrors most other stories told.  It makes it more understandable and coherent *to you*.  No thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Much better. The order that they told the story in made 0 sense. I understood the story after getting all the pieces but normally in a style like that cutting to a different time period will expand on what happened previously. Instead they told the story in chunks that never really expand on or explain the previous segment of that story line. Instead, those explanations are shown later after other gaps are created until the last few episodes where they start closing the gaps.

Not at all. DO NOT do this.

The first episode is basically just a commercial of the light novels, with parts that don't even appear in the series, and the worst part, tons of spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Don't really see how. I mean, it doesn't really spoil anything. It is key to the message of the series and it includes important scenes that, as you say, aren't shown anywhere else in the series, making it an essential episode.

Also, it doesn't really spoil anything, and the things it does spoil are A) hardly spoilers, and B) you don't even realize they are spoilers till later.

Also, the point of the show was the non-standard story progression, where that first episode is key in this. Also, the first and last episodes really bookend the series and give light to the meaning of it all.
>> ARTICLE
On the other hand, the first episode is also a really interesting discussion of the nonstandard narration as well as points to think about as you watch the series.  Skipping the first episode makes you lose a lot of interesting hooks that help pull you into a few characters (particularly Firo and Ladd).

Watching the first episode last might make more sense at first glance but it makes the narration way, way worse.

The spoilers are to get you hooked on the show. You don't know anything that's going on and then it shows you a bunch of small exciting bits, and you want to know how all those bits fit together.

2 parts

- Firo getting his fingers cut off, then healing. Dat music and hobo reaction.
- The president of the Daily-Days talking about him and Carol being the characters who might begin the story, with an immediate cut to the episode title "The president doesn't say anything about the possibility of him being the main character". It was such a clever way to begin the story!
>> ARTICLE
The Firo part pisses me off. They show two notable scenes of him being an immortal, fingers and bookstore. Then you go 9 episodes where you think he is immortal up to when he questions Maiza's quick healing and then you think he's an idiot. Only to find out he didn't become immortal until later explaining why he didn't understand and making you question why he was the primary person to show off immortality. Poor presentation.  
>> ARTICLE
I didn't experience that personally. But I have had friends who were confused a lot watching it.
>> ARTICLE
It's not confusing, it's annoying. Withholding information is part of story telling, i get it. Normally when you withhold that information its for some shock or awe factor when it is revealed. I had very little shock or awe from any story line except Claire/Vino/Rail Tracer. That was the only character that had legitimate surprises and decent development. The entire 1932 plot seemed insignificant to the story. It had no affect on what appeared to be the main plot (train) and is basically just endlessly looking for Dallas. 

Having dates that close together (1930, 1931, 1932) with no change in the characters between those time periods naturally makes it difficult to follow the characters timeline and separate when an event is occurring and what you know about the past and future for that character.

Stuff for the newcomers/those who havent read the LNs

Remember how I said Placido was pissed because one of his capos and many of his subordinates' charred remains were found around town? Yeah, that was all Jacuzzis gang. Blowing them the heck up. 

In the LNs, it was Nick *and Jack* (whos part of Jacuzzis gang on the train in the LNs) who were caught and tied up. Actually, Jack was caught before Nick. 

HAHAHA holy *fuck* do I love how they animated the devouring of other immortals.  Plus the musicthe strings and the bellsthe music and the animation combined make an epic scene every time. Honestly, the 'devouring' was quite accurate to the description of it in the LN.

So I think it was pretty clear when Szilard devoured Barnes, but just in case: when an immortal devours another immortal, they inherit the other immortals memories and knowledge. 

Senator Beriam may seem somewhat suspect in the anime, but hes even more so in the LNs. Hes involved inthingsbig things behind the scenes...

The Chinese waitress (the one who shouted at Isaac) at the Alveare is in fact Lia Linshan, Fan/Fangs older sister (Thanks to /u/accordionheart for pointing out they were siblings and not cousins. I'm losing my mind at 19. Someone save me).  Did you know that Fan and Lia's father was British? The woman behind the counter in the front shops name is Sena. She owns the store, which is, by the way, a specialty shop that sells honey. (Alveare means 'beehive' in Italian).

**Edit**: I just realized that the scene's I'm thinking of is not in fact in this episode. Haha, um...er...I'll just copy and paste the above paragraph tomorrow. Eheh....ouch. 

Heres a little backstory for Firo:

>Firo never knew his own father. Firo was born and raised in Hells Kitchen, one of the slums for Italian immigrants. His father was Italian, his mother an American with British ancestry. His father seemed at the time to be a member of the Camorra in Naples, Italy, but in the end, due to the internal conflict in the Naples branch, the organization had to move to America.
>His father was already dead by the time Firo was born. He died of lung cancer. Firo, who had never seen his father, lost his mother too before his tenth birthday.

>Again, due to a lung disease- tuberculosis. His mother, isolated by the people around her, died a lonely death.

>In the years that followed, Firo did whatever it took to survive. Back then, he simply didnt have the luxury to differentiate between good and evil. Then, when passing through various blocks of New York, Firo met the primo voto of the organization, Yagulma. The instant Firo reached out towards this Japanese old mans pocket, his world turned upside down. Although he had been tripped by Yagulma many times afterwards, the first time was the most memorable.

>From then on, Firo became affiliated to this organization. To him, all the people in this Alveare store were family.

>There was no question in Firo's mind as to if this was the place where he belonged.

>Because he liked them. That alone satisfied Firo.

(Yagulma emigrated to New York from Japan. Hes the mustached guy who officiates the knife fight between Maiza and Firo). 

Firos very loyal (devoted) to Don Molsa Martillo, and is very loyal to Maiza. 

Dammit, I still want to write about Maiza but Ill continue waiting until later. 

They cut out part of the ceremony in the anime. In the LNs, after Firo stabs his own knife int the table, he takes the handgun and points the gun at his heart. Still pointing it at his heart, he circles around the table, kneels at Molsas side, cocks the gun and offers it to Molsa. Fire is then given a glass filled half with wine and half with poison. Fire brings it to his lips; Molsa smacks the glass from Firos hand before he can drink it. 

>That action just now demonstrated Firos mentality and loyalty. Placing the knife on the table meant he would not rely on weapons; pointing the handgun that Molsa had accepted at himself represented his mentality: Rather than let the capo societa get attacked, I am willing choose death; and drinking the poison represented his loyalty: If it is the capo societas will, I am willing to die. This Camorra organization's inauguration ceremony was different from the original Camorras in content and meaning. After the series of ceremonial rites just now, the Martillo family began the final ceremony.

 Maiza, it should be noted, is practically a wizard with a knife. Hes incredibly good. Really really extraordinarily good. So its kind of a big deal that Firo managed to beat him (Firo was the best at knife fighting among the picciattos). Yagulma makes a point of saying that as long as hed be a supervisor hed never seen a candidate executive beat Maiza before. Im pretty sure the match was longer in the LNs. (But, boy do I love the duel between Maiza and Firo. Gives Maiza some time to shine and it's just plain exciting).

 The woman in fatigues, [aka](/s "Rachel"), is a badass. I mean, youd need to be pretty strong and durable to cling and crawl alongside and to the bottom of a fast moving train and not fall off. 

Did I mention how I love how the Rail Tracer is animated? Every time you see it, its just soominous. 

This post is already extraordinarily long, so I'll try to make whatever subsequent edits I do fairly succinct...or at least short. 

I'm going to post something else in a separate post that I *think* is important enough that it warrants one. It's regarding what 'devouring' is like.

Okay, that answers my question. The fact that they aren't fully invincible and can still be killed makes things more interesting.

Ok, so other immortals likely can do this same thing. Now to wait and see if they all know how to do it or if they have to be told about it/learn it first.

> Baccano! seems to be set up to reveal things in a very specific, interesting way, and I don't want that to be ruined on my first time.

I've been trying my hardest not to put anything that can be considered even slightly a spoiler in my essays. I get kind of upset when I see stuff that could be, even they are just minor.
>> ARTICLE
That's fair. I personally don't do the 'how I see it now' thing, but I admit I'm giving background information. I'm not explaining what's happening, mind, though I do clarify certain scenes that can confuse people, and my intention is never to reveal things that happen in future episodes. 

Most of the stuff I do is compare some of the differences between what happened in the anime and what actually happened in the light novels, and some background information about characters that's usually never revealed in the anime (like Ian/John being an Irish immigrant and Firo growing up in Hell's Kitchen). 

Trust me, I want the newcomers to experience the show without spoilers, and I don't intend to reveal the reveals anytime soon. Still, I'm aware that I can slip up sometimes, so if you think you'll enjoy the anime more if you don't read the essays please by all means do so. I so dearly want people to enjoy Baccano!.
>> ARTICLE
The effort is definitely appreciated. For some reason, knowing that other people in an episode discussion thread have future knowledge really bothers me (with rewatch threads or even airing anime that aren't original).

Okay, so, here's what I was talking about: Devouring. 

I'm going to post the passage from LN #1 where we see Barnes' thoughts as he's being devoured, and the subsequent description of his 'death'. 

> Master Szilards hand was already stretched before my face. 

> Aah, as I thought, I was going to be killed.

> But it couldnt be helped. After all, I didnt complete Masters mission.

 > My last hope of survival, those two bottles of the completed product- I never thought theyd be taken by those scum in the end. But being killed personally by Master Szilard was also an unsurpassable honor in its own right.

> Finding out what happened and such... You achieve that by just doing this... Master Szilards palm rested on my head.

> Then all my memories were immediately snatched away. Whatever was asked, I replied in whole. I felt all the blood rushing to my head. Not just blood. From the tips of my feet, muscles began to dry up. I felt the withered muscle shattering, slowly being absorbed into my body. Aah, my feet were already gone.

> Memories... I could feel my memories being sucked away... Aah, now I thought about it, I was becoming a part of Master Szilard. Another way of putting it is that I have obtained immortality. But if I really gained immortality, what did I want to do?

> Aah, my abdomen had also disappeared. Quickly, I must remember quickly. But, why is my stomach gone? Aah, Master Szilard is before me. Ah, that was right, I am currently being punished by Master Szilard. But why did I have to be punished? 
> Aah, that was right, because I didnt complete my mission. But, what was this mission? I already couldnt recall. That was right, I needed to think of something.

> Aah, that was right, I remember, I remember all of it.

> I wanted the power of immortality.

> I wanted to become a hero, like in myths and legends. Because I wanted to protect this country.

> No, that was not right, not this country.
> It was Mother, because I wanted to help Mother. Mother was beaten everyday by that stubborn guy...

> Who was that guy? Couldnt remember. Only recalled that he died in a car accident. 

> That guy died in the car accident. together with mother.

> whats a mother? cant remember

> Maiza

In this episode and another I noticed that Maiza looks at her sleeve. I think she may have bumped into Firo during the fire. Is there any significance to this? She looked at it again when she was thinking about the guy (him) supposedly looking for her.

What about Czeslaw Meyer?
>> ARTICLE
ah thanks don't know why I forgot him.
>> ARTICLE
> Huey Laforet

Ooooh. I missed his last name. So he's related to Chane somehow. Going to have to keep that in mind. Oh and the group was talking about how Chane would be dead. So either the group is betraying Huey (sort of) by killing Chane or Huey doesn't care for her anymore. Interesting.

Episode 5

* I love [this scene](https://a.pomf.cat/qjlrir.mp4), because at first it sounds like Jacuzzi is just trying to pathetically find a way to stop them from killing him, (which, okay, he sort of is) but then it turns out that hes seriously trying to keep these idiots from getting themselves killed.

* [Okay, come on, Jacuzzi.](https://a.pomf.cat/pytdqg.mp4) Youre not fooling anyone.

* [Why would he be so reluctant to say it?](https://a.pomf.cat/araqfo.mp4) BE PROUD OF HAVING THE COOLEST NAME EVER!

* These episode titles remind me of the titles of Gintama episodes.

* I could listen to Jacuzzi say [The Rail Tracah!](https://a.pomf.cat/ipsccv.mp4) all day long.

* [Donny](http://i.imgur.com/9zxiCqn.jpg) reminds me of Fezzik from Princess Bride.

* [This](https://a.pomf.cat/kusiuv.mp4) may be my favorite line read Jacuzzi does throughout the whole show.

* Jacuzzi can get shockingly intimidating [when he stops crying.](https://a.pomf.cat/dyejsx.mp4)

* [Even Nice is impressed.](https://a.pomf.cat/pzfuae.mp4)

* Holy fucking shit, I love [this scene](https://a.pomf.cat/wxmsqa.mp4) so much. You suddenly realize how much power and authority Jacuzzi commands, and how much he tried to stop these guys from fucking themselves over.

* [Nice is really the Jokey Smurf of the gang.](https://a.pomf.cat/rhldbv.mp4)

* [Thats right.](https://a.pomf.cat/ppxdyx.mp4) Ennis is a test-tube baby. I would make an FMA reference here, but I know that everyone else has already made one, so whatever.

* And *[THAT]( https://a.pomf.cat/osfwyd.mp4)*, newcomers, is how you kill an immortal. As you can see, it is quite obviously a painless and all around preferable way of dying. And with the added benefit of giving the immortal recipient all the memories and experiences of the person killed. Fancy that.

* [And it also has the plus of being able to share memories with other immortals.](https://a.pomf.cat/fmkndd.mp4) You know, after watching A Certain Magical Index, Ive decided that right hands are just like the cure-all solution for everything. Try using yours to cure cancer.

* [For anyone wondering,](https://a.pomf.cat/flxnnb.mp4) hes not saying that just becoming an immortal pulls a Death Note on you and just wipes out any chance of the afterlife. Hes saying that the way he plans on going about doing it may end up costing him any chance of heaven. (Then again, considering his line of work, his chances were pretty slim to begin with.)

* [Firo:](https://a.pomf.cat/ahqbnc.mp4) As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster. (Please tell me someone gets this quote.)

* [Go get em, Sheriff!](https://a.pomf.cat/stexhe.mp4)

* [Yeah About that](https://a.pomf.cat/vkjgig.mp4)

* Damn, this girl is [popular tonight.](https://a.pomf.cat/ffpnoh.mp4)

* [Apparently two tommy guns beat fifteen assault rifles.](https://a.pomf.cat/pirysl.mp4) What is this, some messed up game of rock-paper-scissors? [Im afraid of whatll happen to Nicholas if he loses.](https://a.pomf.cat/kehbqa.mp4)

* [Nicholas](https://a.pomf.cat/ssdowx.mp4)  Condescending, snarky, and promotes child kidnapping.

* [Who knew Albert Einstein was part of the Martillo Family?](http://i.imgur.com/LZ9i4l1.jpg)

* [How was Firo the only one to notice that?](https://a.pomf.cat/fibtoi.mp4)

* [That is probably the most scared Ive ever heard Miria.](https://a.pomf.cat/xprtnw.mp4)

* [Smart thinking by Natalie.](https://a.pomf.cat/gtfuxb.mp4) Good way to use the startling situation to her advantage.

* [I love this camera shot.](https://a.pomf.cat/goyzyd.mp4)

* [Great job, Isaac and Conductor.](https://a.pomf.cat/vwieri.mp4) Youve doomed us all.

Ennis will probably betray Szilard. She and Firo will meet up and team up. She seems like she's better than this shady group.

There's 10-15 guys in that room, and only three Runoratas. They just dropped their guns. A bit more afraid of the mob, I guess.

**--- Post Episode Thoughts on the Future ---**

I'd totally watch a live action version of this show. It's doable, and if you put it on HBO, I think it'd do fairly well. I only thought this because I love the voice acting. However, the animation of mouths in this show is just, I don't know, sub par. I thought, "well, in live action the mouths would obviously be synced up with the voices." Either that or a remake/continuation of the show seeing as a lot of you are talking about how much more material there is from the LNs.

That scene where Jacuzzi is saved by Donny/Nice: Great scene. Jacuzzi is such a nice lad. Even though those thugs were going to kill him, Jacuzzi still pleads to them. He warns them. He knows he has friends that will do anything to help him, but he also knows how they'll go about helping him.

I also loved how he was half laughing/half hyperventilating as he grabbed Nice and told everyone to run away. Then he sort of questions whether or not he warned the thugs to leave. "I told them. I know I told them."

[no spoilers, just my speculation...](/s "Not much today, I guess. 1- I still think Dallas might be Huey, but that's slightly crackpot. 2- Eve is immortal, that I'm a little more convinced of. 3- Like I said in my reaction section, Ennis will betray Szilard. 4- The Rail Tracer is the conductor. I don't know who else it could be at this point. Someone new, or maybe, maaayyybe the fatigues woman.")

We've been saying that for years. With this and Spice and Wolf, Brain's Base is like the Valve of anime studios.

I'm not going to say anything about the Rail Tracer, because spoilers (duh), but I will say to keep an open mind.

I mean, yeah, but he seems like he's been around forever. And he can freaking absorb people and take their memories. I said in my reply to your post that I'm wondering if that's a power unique to him or if other immortals are capable of doing it. Either way, Szilard looks like he's a step above the others.

Part of the fun is seeing them react to the reveals on screen and figuring out things on their own, so I'll happily do so.

I do enjoy your speculations and other reactions. Keep 'em coming. 

I think it's great that you and the other newcomers seem to like Jacuzzi well enough, though, because one of the complaints I sometimes hear about Baccano! is that "Jacuzzi is such a crybaby/annoying/can't stand him" which I disagree with. I was worried what people would think of him. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!

I do like Jacuzzi. I mean, I get how one could find him annoying, but he's just another character. Sure he whines, but he's a lot of fun. It seems like there's definitely more to him than the scaredy-cat persona.

In general, unless a character is really over the top annoying I usually just enjoy them for who they are. That's how they were written. Sometimes characters are written for the sole purpose of the viewer not liking them. I don't think Jacuzzi fits that mold, but some people do, and that's fine.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 5**: Jacuzzi in trouble. Yes, it's not cowardliness but a condition. Looks like a robbery, huh? The gang is here to save Jacuzzi! Oh, we already got Ennis' identity. Bye, Barnes! Firo's entrance ceremony! Yes, many people are after Dallas. Knife fight! Firo wins! The rail tracer is quite scary thing.

Well, I certainly didn't expect to see a guy eat someone via their hand.

Today was my first time watching one of the episodes dubbed. It was alright I guess. It definitely stood out against other dubs I've seen in the past and is no doubt top tier, but I think I'm going to stick with it subbed from now on because I'm more comfortable that way.

Anyway, I'm quite intrigued by Jacuzzi. He seems like a real crybaby and at first glance really has no strength, yet he seems to have a loyal group of people around him and even has a bounty on his head. This is one of the things this show appears to be great at doing: gradually informing you about the characters more and more over multiple episodes so that you can't just drop the show.

On my first watch of Baccano, and it looks like a pretty strong 8 or 9 out of 10!
>> ARTICLE
I literally just said this to /u/Neawia, but I can't help it, I'm just so pleased you all actually like Jacuzzi instead of hate him, like so many others I've seen. He's one of those characters that's definitely a 'more to this guy than meets the eye' sort of person. 

> gradually informing you about the characters more and more over multiple episodes

Mm, it does do that indeed...
>> ARTICLE
We finally see Jacuzzi in action, in a hilarious confrontation with some Russo goons. I still wonder how he became the head of a gang when he's so violence-averse, but the others clearly respect him and followed his lead immediately when he decided to do something about the men in black & the Rail Tracer. 

Whoa, Szilard has some freaky powers! He literally absorbed Barnes like water through a straw and can transfer memories to others. I wonder if all immortals can do this.

I was half-expecting a show-down between Chane and the woman in fatigues. Next episode, perhaps.

[Just my speculation](/s "Maybe the Rail Tracer is a creature created by Szilard, or Szilard himself. At this point, it seems totally possible that transforming into a cloud of brown smoke with glowing red eyes is just another one of his powers.") 
>> ARTICLE
I'm looking forward to seeing what made everyone respect Jacuzzi. It must've been something big.

[my speculative response to your speculation](/s "I actually like the idea that the Rail Tracer is some creature that was created by Szilard (or maybe someone else, who knows?) He had someone working for him that made a perfect immortal formula, why can't he have someone who can create dark, murderous creatures?")
>> ARTICLE
[Not really speculative, but also not a spoiler](/s "Don't forget that Szilard has the power to literally create life via homunculi, as proven by Ennis.")
>> ARTICLE
Given all the backstory reveals so far, it'll be good for sure. 

If that doesn't get covered in the show, hopefully we'll at least get to see Jacuzzi doing something besides just crying in the next confrontation.
>> ARTICLE
It's already late but who cares, this was a great episode. It starts with Jacuzzi surrounded by enemies but soon enought his group appears and save his ass. I wonder why they only look for Jacuzzi and not the rest of the band, who knows, maybe he is a bait to catch those guys, we will see in future episodes.

Now back to the scientists, they even made an human, are we going full FMA? Anyways the "death" of the man was amazing. He also got all of his memories which is interesting, can he do that with everyone or only with immortals? We shall see what hapens.

The ceremony of Firo was also very good. Even he looks like a child he probably had a though life, but I wonder if he was an immortal already or was transformed after this, because Maiza and probably the rest are immortals, how could they know this secret?

To finish the episode we get back in the train, at this point i don't even know what to say, because the Rail Tracer really appeared, holy shit, things starting to get fucked up, can't wait for the next one. 
>> ARTICLE
> but I wonder if he was an immortal already or was transformed after this

I'm thinking he isn't an immortal yet. He looked more confused when he saw Maiza's arm heal then he did surprised to find another immortal. I kind of want to him to go under Maiza's wing for a little, and then Maiza gets Firo the formula.

Could be wrong. I don't know. We'll find out.
>> ARTICLE
> It's already late but who cares

I don't know about the other old-timers on here but I pretty much monitor the rewatch threads for new comments and discussions. No comment is too late, as far as I'm concerned!

> Scientists

Well, the old men that Szilard consults are kind of scientists. From LN #1:

> While Szilard let this loyal group of tools research the complete product, he was engaged in other aspects of research.

I think they're also sponsors--I can't remember if it's mentioned in the LNs, but I'm pretty sure they're probably helping fund the process. 

Mostly though, what they're there for is for Szilard's personal 'use', which I'm not going to go into because that would be talking about something that hasn't quite been revealed yet in the anime. [That is,](/s "he has great disdain for them as people but keeps them there because he wants to obtain their knowledge via devouring. His purpose, his goal, his endless quest, is to obtain knowledge. He wants to know everything.").

The old men had nothing to do with Ennis' creation, though. That was all Szilard. 

> he probably had a tough life

Yeah. His dad died of lung cancer before Firo was old enough to remember him and his mom died of tuberculosis before he was ten. Firo survived by pickpocketing people until one day he tried it on a Martillo member and subsequently was picked up into their ranks.

> can't wait for the next one

Do come back and join us after you watch the next episode. Not too many people posting in the rewatch threads, so I'd love to hear your thoughts on the rest of the series. 
>> ARTICLE
How do you pronounce Baccano?  I think "BACH-uh-no" is the correct way, but I keep wanting to say "buh-CHIA-no" because Italian.

Anyway, it's nice to see that Jacuzzi's gang has his back.  He didn't feature as prominently in this episode as I expected, but the insight we got was neat.  I thought Ennis would be an Immortal who was subordinate to Quates because she forgot her real name/past life (or something like that, hence the single name), but a homunculus is close enough.

The knife-fight between Firo and Maiza was cool.  Afterward, when it sounded like Miria screaming "No, they killed Isaac!"?  Not so cool.  I know they're just fine later on, but Miria has such a happy voice normally...

[First-timer speculation regarding Dallas](/s "The OP shows Dallas drowning, so the mystery about him being missing feels like it shouldn't be so tough.  The Runoratas  -- I think that's them, anyway -- mention a delinquent getting an immortal body, so that could be Dallas.  Maybe he gets captured by Ennis and/or made to drown forever?  It seems likely that Ennis will find him, but why wouldn't Quates just absorb him or kill him?")

I have no idea where "Huey is in custody" fits in or what relationship the Runoratas have with the black suits on the Flying Pussyfoot.
>> ARTICLE
/u/Revriley1 wanted another newcomer to respond so 12 hours later response, GO!

Baccano! Here are two different audio recordings ([1](http://www.vocabolaudio.com/it/baccano) and [2](http://forvo.com/word/baccano/)). In Italian the letters usually flow together, but you can still hear the pronunciation of each one individually. So the "English" pronunciation is more "bahk-ano" or "bah-khano" than "baka-no."

[speculation..](/s "I like your idea of his endless drowning. I wonder how that would work. It looks like all the other immortals actually die, but then put themselves back together. I wonder if Dallas is just lifeless in a tank somewhere. Once he's let out he'll come back to life.")

[some more](/s "Going off your idea of the OP; I still think Czeslaw has a big role to play. I'm not sure if the cards that surround Dallas and then go to Czeslaw's hand actually mean anything, but I'm not ruling out the idea that Czeslaw has something to do with Dallas' disappearance. He may have even absorbed Dallas for all I know.")
>> ARTICLE
Most people pronounce it 'Bah-kah-noh.' Man, now you're making me wonder if that's not how you actually pronounce it in Italian.

Miria screamed "Isaac's been killed!" You're on the money there.

Ooh, I like your speculation. I can neither confirm or deny anything. I hope one of the other newcomers replies to you, 'cause it's fun to watch two people speculate together about what's happening.

In Italian it's pronounced "bah-'kah-no" and it means "ruckus".

**PSA: Heya, guys, first off HELL YEAH weve reached the halfway point in the show, congrats to all whove stuck with it and hello to all you folks reading sans commenting. Its been a ton of fun so far.**

**I know were at an exciting point in the show, which is why Im going to ask that you all restrict your comments to episode 8 alone and *refrain from hyping up whats to come in the 8 episodes remaining*. Baccano! is a very plot and action-oriented show, and its not fair to the newcomers if we all start giggling to ourselves about, say, things happening 3 episodes from nowand this includes talking about things like episode previews. Keep a lid on the previews, guys (hey newbies, several of the previews from here on out have spoilerish things in them, so you might want to avoid them).**

**Im definitely not saying dont speculate, though. Newbies, continue to ~~entertain me~~ speculate freely; everything above is just me being a crotchety old fool waving a stick at my fellows.**

Onto my ~~contributions~~ ~~LN expertise~~ ravings? useless infodumps? Knowledge gleaned through a worryingly obsessive devotion to the show and the books?: 

...Actually, theres not too much to elaborate on this episode, since it mostly revolves around Isaac and Miria (and sheds slightly more light on Eve and Dallas). Still:

Bill Sullivan and Donald Brown are both Inspectors from the Bureau of Investigation (back before it was theFBI), along with Edward Noah (one of the inspectors from episode one). Sullivan and Edward also primarily deal with investigating immortals (yes, theres a division specifically devoted to immortals).  Here, though, Bill and Donald have the problem of Isaac and Miria to deal with, as they do in the LNs. 

The Inspectors dont really get too much spotlight in the LNs, though they show up in more than one. Lets seeBill has a sort of stutter in the LNs (erah), and Edward really dislikes Maiza and Firo (well, he hates all mafia/Camorra). 

Again, the 1932 storyline has been heavily modified in the anime, which Ive talked a little about before. You know what? Just go ahead and blame Gustavo Bagetta for everything that happens in 1932. ...In case you missed it, Eve had an older brother Jeffrey, who died along with her father, Raymond. 

Oh Isaac and Miria, you and your nave racism. Someday youll know betterI hope. 

I think they made a coloring mistake at 9:39 with Donnys skin. Not sure. Baccano! makes very few mistakes when it comes to the animation and art, which is pretty impressive. (Although, theres a doozy of a blunder in a future episode that I somehow didnt notice at all until my third or fourth rewatch). 

Imnot going to say anything about the end scene, unless someone asks (Ill reply to them with spoiler tags). Theres no need to explain it anyway, at least not right now. 

Theres no such thing as a filler episode in Baccano!, but I guess if you had to pick one, thisd be the closest to one. Its big on comedy, this episode, what with Mirias dress and Donnys size and Isaac & Miria oVision and what have you. Still, it does serve to show not only how much I&M have impacted the plot and characters lives in general, but it gives  us a little more insight into Eves and Dallas relationship.

Sublimer, I had you tagged as "Fellow Baccano! fan" but now I think you deserve something more...grandiloquent.  Perhaps "the cynosure of all things Baccano!?" No, too long. I must ponder upon this. 

Neawia, dear Neawia, whatever shall I tag you with? 'Sir Tinfoil?' 'Knight of the Woeful Countenance?" So many possibilities.

**--- Episode 8 - Isaac and Miria Unintentionally Spread Happiness Around Them ---**

So, right, if this is an Isaac x Miria episode I hope /u/The-Sublimer-One can control his urge to webm every scene the two of them are in.

These guys' reactions ([1](http://i.imgur.com/fGa0zQi.jpg) and [2](http://i.imgur.com/eagAjaA.jpg)) to the slides of Isaac and Miria ([1,](http://i.imgur.com/IMDJLD5.jpg) [2,](http://i.imgur.com/4JqUt0j.jpg) and [3](http://i.imgur.com/VA0z2EU.jpg)) are hilarious.

[Oh. My. Fucking. God. These. Two.](https://a.pomf.cat/coolzp.mp4)

Are they really sugar cubes? He chews them so loudly.

Eve is going to get her justice.

"You two are so just so funny!" Eve gets it.

Awww, Jacuzzi.

Only Isaac and Miria would go to rob a house and then comfort a little girl.

This is just too good! Oh god, her dress! Donny's too big! [Great scene.](http://www.gfycat.com/SardonicFriendlyApe) Isaac even saves his hat from falling to the ground, just like Firo.

The Rail Tracer doesn't really look like Szilard.

"Just one day?!?!?" Teach us, Jacuzzi!

[Jacuzzi, two people believe in you!](http://www.gfycat.com/AgedWatchfulJabiru)

Honestly, Isaac and Miria are essentially just one character.

Ennis making new friends. T_T

Nice. It looks like Sugar Cube is a good guy. That or he's mad no one ever takes up his offer for a cube.

**--- Post Episode Thoughts on the Future ---**

[bold speculation](/s "Dallas is the The Rail Tracer.")

[Response to speculation](/s "Please don't associate that scum with Vino")
>> ARTICLE
You ended up getting some downvotes. Probably because you responded to my speculation with an actual spoiler. People figured your response would also be speculation.

The reason as a first-timer that I spoiler tag speculation is so if other first-timers don't feel like getting too wrapped up in predictions/discussion they don't have too.

As for the spoiler, hopefully others avoided it. I had already watched the next episodes, so no harm done to me at least.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really mind downvotes, but you're misusing the spoiler tag. If people don't like discussion they shouldn't come to a discussion thread.
>> ARTICLE
You're right. All true enough, but I'll continue to use the spoiler tags in this manner. Others will likely be doing the same. So if you do respond to our "speculation," could you label yours so as to not accidentally give spoilers to us newcomers?
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand your reasoning for using spoiler tags for things that aren't actually spoilers. You're afraid what you write will cause people who come to a discussion thread to think about what you're writing? That's absurd. I'll continue to use spoiler tags the intended way, I see no legitimate reason to change what *I'm* doing; you're the one using them wrong.
>> ARTICLE
That's more or less what I thought you'd say.

I'm aware I'm not using the tags for their "intended" purpose, but I don't have to. There's technically no wrong way to use them unless of course I just spoiler tagged my entire post. That'd be annoying. I'm simply tagging stuff in case it ends up being too close to the truth. Other newcomers may not be interested in engaging in deeper discussion, and are here for the fun.

Does it make perfect sense. Quite frankly, not at all. Spoiler tags are misused often. You probably see it all the time used for comedic effect or other reasons.

[](/s "We're arguing.")

What show did that spoil?
>> ARTICLE
I still don't understand your logic behind the spoiler tags. Seriously, why would you be that concerned about accidentally making people think? If people aren't interested in deeper discussion, they don't have to come to the threads. If they were just here for fun they probably wouldn't be reading the longer comments like yours, they'd stick to the short ones with memes and shit. Also, you should take context in to account. People don't normally misuse spoiler tags in episode discussion threads.
>> ARTICLE
> Honestly, Isaac and Miria are essentially just one character.

I feel the same, especially because Miria tends to parrot Isaac a lot, or else they're in mad sync.  Not that it's a bad thing that they're attached at the hip.
>> ARTICLE
The mimicry is why I made that comment. I wonder what Miria would do if she didn't have Isaac. Who would she copy?
>> ARTICLE
(haha 14 hours late to see this but whatever)

She actually does get separated from Isaac in the LNs, after he gets [sent](/s "to Alcatraz"). Chane notes that her eyes are red and puffy, so Miria probably was crying alone in a room somewhere. But she resolves to be cheerful because she's certain they'll reunite sooner or later. 

So, they both can definitely function without the other, though I'm sure it'd be much easier for them if they had been voluntarily separated as opposed to involuntarily.
>> ARTICLE
I came here hoping for a gif of that wave. I was not disappointed.

[Reply to your speculation](/s "I've never thought about Eve being immortal, but it makes sense! Dallas looks different in person than in that photo of him and Eve, because he's aged, while she still looks the same.")
>> ARTICLE
[speculation](/s "The only thing I've been able to think against that theory is that the boy in that picture isn't Dallas, but Eve's other brother who was killed. But that just doesn't seem to make much sense since the brother is only mentioned once, and Eve keeps looking at the picture while searching for Dallas.")

[Speculation?](/s "Yup. I'm pretty sure we've seen her mention Dallas by name while looking at that photo.")

What are your thoughts on the show so far?
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen it?

It's honestly very good. I binged through the first ten episodes like it was nothing. The first episode was excellent. Probably the best first episode I've seen in an anime so far. The violence is well done, and the characters are pretty human. I spoiled myself long ago on one plot point, but it didn't even take anything away from the story. Really solid stuff so far, and I can't wait to keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the review mate! Was saving this one to be dubbed, and will watch it very soon
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching the dub, and it's good. No complaints. You could say the MC overacts with his speeches, but it's not that bad. Plus they're damn inspiring.

Plus, unique art style, good animation, and good soundtrack.

When first getting into anime earlier this year, I had already heard about Attack on Titan and Sword Art Online. Popular shows, right? Where you can make the argument that SAO is a bit of letdown, AoT hasn't been at all. It's been solid through ten episodes, and seems like a bit more than just a "starter anime."
>> ARTICLE
Man you had it good that you could binge watch it, I was watching it while it was airing... and I can tell you it felt like a cocktease every episode, "yes finally something will be revealed, I'm so ex... NOPE CLIFFHANGER SEE YOU NEXT WEEK SUCKER" really this show must be marathoned to be more enjoyable, because every episode has a new twist and a cliffhanger.

Still I also really liked it and I want finally a second season, I know that there is a manga but I don't know if I could go back after this great animation to still images...

This is only my second time responding in the Baccano rewatch threads. I got quite a bit behind, but I'v since caught up and am right on track. . This is my first time watching the show, and I have to say I love it. A few thoughts...

* I just love the fact that there are so, so many characters in this show. For the most part, all of them are extremely interesting and multi-faceted. 
* I'm enjoying the plot a great deal. I haven't been super confused throughout the watch, but you rewatchers have done a fantastic job with any questions us first-timers (or I suppose non-LN readers as well) might have. Additionally, you've given some fantastic backstory that I wouldn't have known, such as the information on the Daily Days.
* I'm not sure if we'll see them again, but I'm quite interested in the two characters that set up the whole framework of this thing: The Vice President and Carol. Heck, maybe I can just hear him say "Carol.." one more time and I'll be satisfied.
* I really like the way they integrated the "previously on..." bits within the OD. Also, I continue to love the OD!
* 1711...(not having read the LN) was this some sort of alchemist ship destined for the new world? Or was it a place for alchemists to practice in secret or...maybe this is explained later?
* As far as the rail tracer goes, I've seen so many opinions flying about that I'm going to throw out that, at this point, I am the rail tracer!

Thanks all of you for making my first rewatch with this sub so worthwhile.

>> ARTICLE
I've been wondering: What made Isaac and Miria become thieves? They both seem too nice to just say "Hey, let's rob people!" LN spoilers are allowed.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, you say they seem too nice, but in their view they do good deeds with robbing bad people or bad organizations, or things
>> ARTICLE
They wanted to rob a museum (though they settled with taking away everybody's access to it), and they planned to rob the Genoards (whether they knew that the Genoards have a few skeletons in their closets or not, I don't know).
>> ARTICLE
although I don't know what their reasoning behind the museum one was, but they stole from the Genoards to make Eve happy because she said everyone is nice to you and a lier because of the money so in their mind stealing money from Eves family results in Eve being happy, in their mind they think that they do good things
>> ARTICLE
Sure, that was their reasoning after they heard Eve's story, but why were they on her balcony in the first place? They even introduced themselves as robbers. 
>> ARTICLE
ok you got me cornered here, they maybe nice thiefs but in the end they are thiefs, still if possible they try to convince themself (and the viewer) that what they do is good...
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately, Narita gives us almost no info on their pasts (probably deliberately, Narita you absolute tit).  From what I can remember, Isaac [has](/s "a bad relationship with his family in San Fransisco") and [Miria](/s "may have had a troubled past, as she says she once thought she'd never be able to smile again...and then she met Isaac.")

Also, Isaac [is](/s "smarter than he acts - though to what extent is uncertain - considering in LN #9 he realized almost immediately that the man sitting near them in the Alveare was actually a cop in plainclothes looking to arrest them. To save Miria, he tells her to go get his wallet that he 'forgot' at home (it was actually in his pocket) and he turns to the cop and awaits his fate.")

Which turns out to [be](/s "Alcatraz. He, Firo, and Ladd all end up in Alcatraz together. Good times.")

As far as I know though, we still don't know what the genesis was that kickstarted their thieving capers. 
>> ARTICLE
[mild spoilers for LN #9](/s "I think Miria is also smarter than she seems, because I think it's also implied in #9 that she's worked out who Ronnie is.")
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, good point--somehow, that bit slipped my mind. Yes, Miria [definitely](/s "has some idea of what Ronnie is, at least partially so"). Plus, she somehow [knows](/s "Japanese. Your guess is as good as mine.")

Somehow, they both know several stories from Chinese and Japanese mythology, though they do tend to mix them up or get them wrong. One wonders how--maybe they both just read a lot of books. Firo is pretty sure that Isaac's a big fan of detective novels, after all. 
>> ARTICLE
**Ep 8 - Isaac & Miria make everyone smile** 

It's funny that their biggest, baddest heist happened because they wanted to make Eve's troubles go away. They're such sweethearts. 

Possibly the most enjoyable episode of the series so far.

[Speculation](/s "I'm now thinking that the RT could be a member of a rival family, or an assassin sent by them to get rid of Russo's gang and the Ghosts while they're stuck on that train. So far we've only seen it kill the men in black (I think?), even though it could have easily killed the girl in fatigues too.")

Edit: phrasing. Also forgot to include an honorable mention for Jacuzzi, for taking charge and being all kakkoii in this episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Isaac & Miria Unintentionally Spread Happiness Around Them is another brilliant title. Because that just seems like their daily life. 


Their meeting with Eve is pretty touching, especially when they decide to make her happy, by stealing all her family's money. Other star Isaac and Miria moments from this episode include: their freak-out over remembering they didn't buy Ennis a present, their cartoon-y imagine spot of Jacuzzi being swallowed by the Rail Tracer; "we'll be okay, Jacuzzi-heaven-voice"; their random in-depth knowledge of Chinese literature (with the addition of Billy the Kid); playing the harp for their own sound effects; and the infamous "you know where a real cowboy keeps his gun..." scene. Just everything about them, really. I have a lot of love for them and all their eccentricities, because of their relentless optimism and melodramatic escapades. 


Eve is also fabulous in this episode. She just has real grit to her, and her loyalty to Dallas is unfailing, despite him being...a generally awful brother to her - yelling at her, calling her stupid for her religious beliefs, and being really selfish. 

>> ARTICLE
Should the last bit be spoilertagged at all, about Rubik? I thought about explaining the scene, but figured that it might be nice to let the newbies speculate about it for a little while. 

But maybe it was obvious enough and I'm just underestimating them.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I deleted it, but I thought that [since](/s "some of them had worked it out already, and it's not a massive plot point, it wasn't too bad.") But you're probably right!
>> ARTICLE
Turns out that my predictions were completely wrong, but we got one of the best duo I've ever seen so that's great. So this episode is basically the daily life of Isaac x Miria, which should be pretty funny looking how much fun they had in this episode. This two must have a great story, they even think they are doing a favor by stealing people. 

We also get to see more story of the Genoard family, and how Dallas vanished from the Earth, it was kidnapped by Ennis. We don't know why yet but I feel this is going to be a huge plot point.

The last point of this episode I want to discuss is Jacuzzi's leadership, he looked like a weak member of the group but he's probably the leader. He knows what to do in every situation even if he's under pressure.

At this point I don't even know what to expect but it will be awesome. Also remeber that from this point you must start to watch double episode per day.

* Jacuzzi and Nice, aw.  I always thought they were together from the way their hands link in the opening sequence, but now it's canon and not just headcanon.

* Isaac and Miria's way of cheering up Eve was... something else.  They really are jesters.

* I thought Donny got snatched at first after Jacuzzi called for a move to the baggage car. Romance of the Three Kingdoms?!  I don't remember Billy the Kid being in China at the time...

Getting a lot of Isaac and Miria was nice (especially with Ennis), but it feels like we haven't had much conflict on the train lately.  Rail Tracer is still hungry.  [first-timer speculation](/s "The young conductor is featured in the closing credits where the mustached conductor isn't at all.  I don't know why that makes me suspicious, but it does.  And he *did* bring up the story of the Rail Tracer independently...")

Good luck to them.

I could watch this episode alone and I would satisfied with the entire series.

Isaac x Miria are the best!
>> ARTICLE
Holy mother fucking shit Jacuzzi is actually an alpha male O_O  
Biggest plot twist until now!  

>> ARTICLE
**Episode 8**: Those are some fabulous pictures of Isaac and Miria. I love the dramatic music because they forgot to buy a gift for Ennis! A lot of Isaac and Miria in this episode in fact. 
>> ARTICLE
Half-way!

Probably one of my favorite episodes. Isaac and Miria are the best.
>> ARTICLE
Isaac and Miria should have their own anime series where they steal stuff. Did they just steal from Eve, AND rationalise that they were making her happy? Holie sheiit. 
>> ARTICLE
This train isn't very [giant friendly](http://imgur.com/a/ecrFZ)

that's what I love about Jacuzzi, if the situation needs him to be brave he can be brave, I mean not everyone would have been so bold to Ladd

I love how Isaac and Miria think that they do good with stealing.

Ennis is awesome, I just love how she knocked everyone of these idiots out [with just one attack](http://puu.sh/jcAfg/6c445def28.webm), and I love how she just says icecold: "I'm afraid they don't concern me, my problem is with you"

**--- Episode 6 - The Rail Tracer Covertly, Repeatedly Slaughters Inside the Coaches ---**

I'm really loving how they do the recap/setup in the middle of the OP. Much more enjoyable than a normal recap.

The Rail Tracer! This piano track is spot on. And it looks like The Rail Tracer is human... ish.

Dallas wants in. He's not worth the trouble. Now the Gandors have the immortal formula.

Czeslaw as The Rail Tracer? I don't know. It seems like he's been with Mary so how could he get away to do the killings? [If he is The Rail Tracer/working with The Rail Tracer...](/s "He wants to find the immortal. He does so by trying to absorb everyone Ladd's men somehow capture him, and Ladd blows his head off. What other reason is there for such overkill on a child?") Well, besides Ladd being Ladd, of course. Maybe a crazy theory, but just wanted to jot it down anyway.

Why can't I get over how massive Donny is? He doesn't fit in the [hallway](http://i.imgur.com/XKwAn6E.jpg) or through the door. And he finally gets in and has to [squeeze back out!](http://i.imgur.com/QkrdUTi.jpg)

Chane! First kill! Nice save. Hope she doesn't bring Mary to the ghosts.

Did Ladd just come out from killing Czeslaw?

Jacuzzi is a secret badass.

I rewatched a bit of episode one earlier, and I forgot that Isaac and Miria are friends with Ennis (who hit them with her car).

Dallas, protective brother.

[Wtf are these two doing?](http://www.gfycat.com/RecklessLightheartedIzuthrush) Seriously, you two are weird, but I love you.

Eve!

Ok, so that room didn't look like the one Ladd shot Czeslaw in.

[Is this guy a consciousness of newspapers or is that just a really awesome fort?](http://i.imgur.com/D77WldE.jpg)

See, Nicholas is trying to control things through information.

Vino? Could she be The Rail Tracer?!?!?

Did they just make Dallas immortal so Szilard could absorb him?

What's next on Baccano! - young versions of everyone?

**--- Post Episode Thoughts on the Future ---**

I still think Czeslaw has a big role to play. I'm not 100% sure if he's The Rail Tracer or not (or has anything to do with TRT). Especially now that some assassin is on the way. Vino. Claire. She could be The Rail Tracer.

For now Dallas is held captive by Szilard and co.

[no spoilers, just my speculation...](/s "They were giving Dallas a version of the immortal formula. However, Dallas is already immortal. He either sampled the perfect formula or previously attained immortality somehow. Giving him another dose is going to cause something completely new to happen to him. Dallass will be the most powerful immortal, and even Szilard is going to be surprised. Especially when he tries to absorb Dallas and can't.")

[...and some more](/s "I really fucking hope that Jacuzzi is the reason Ladd loses his arm.")

I'm just excited for each episode as they come, because each has its own scenes that I can't wait to see them discuss.

This is such a dark (lighting-wise) scene in the show. What exactly is The Rail Tracer doing, slicing him on the wheels or dragging him on the ground?

> How this guy has not lost his teeth as of yet is anyones guess.

Mr. Sugarcube is secretly a horse. Szilard gave him a human body so he could easily get his hands on sugar cubes. 

> I never got why rich people have these things. I mean, who would want to steal trash?

Maybe rich people throw away expensive things and don't want looters around their house? Or finding out details about them by sorting through their trash? I don't know. You'd think rich people could hire someone to just bring all your trash to the dump so that eyesore of a cage isn't in front of your house.

Wellll....[...](/s "dunno if you're saying that in order to keep the newcomers on the wrong track, but Ladd's actually feeling blue here because when Jacuzzi said the conductor's dead Ladd is thinking of his friend Dune, who killed Tony and impersonated him.

>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Good detective work. Still, let's be honest. He's still upset he didn't get to kill him.")

Backstory from the LNs for those who havent read them and the newcomers:

(Wow okay, not only did I somehow think the scene with Lia was in yesterdays episode when it wasnt, I somehow thought it was in this episode, when it wasnt. Its not for four more episodes. I have a great memory, you guys).

You know, its a bit late for this tidbit of information (and for Barnes), but I neglected to mention yesterday that Barnes used to be a prominent real estate agent. Twenty years prior to the anime, his Congressman friend revealed himself to be a member of Szilards circle and introduced Barnes to Szilard. (Well, its twenty or thirty years. I think there was a mistake in the translation because at one point it says twenty, then later it says thirty. So Barnes met Szilard in either 1900 or 1910).
Barnes didnt believe them until Szilard cut off his own finger. 

By the by, Barnes wasnt actually the guy who made the elixir. Remember the beggar from episode 1? He killed the latest chemist working on the stuff right after the chemist had sent Szilard a telegram saying hed possibly found the formula. Barnes job was just to check that the elixir worked and prepare it for distribution. Theres been a bunch of chemists over the years. Every time theyd make a breakthrough Szilard would devour them and give the new info to the next chemist.

The broom closet area where Czes hides Mary will later come into play (in the DS game) when Mr. Turner, after [paying](/s "Fermet, whos calling himself Victor Talbot after the immortal") money, is led there. His guide' takes the rifle from the corpse of the White Suit that Chane killed, gives it to Turner and goes off, implying that Turner should hide in the broom closet. 

(Turner at some point leaves the closet and runs into Rachel (the girl in the fatigues) in the LNs in the Third Class Cabin/Car. It is a tense confrontation, [since](/s "Rachel pretty much considers him her mortal enemy to an extent, because of what he did to her father.")).

I absolutely adore the casting people, because the President of the Daily Days' voice in the dub is spot on, and I think it was important they get the voice right for a character whose face we never see because hes always hidden behind a mountain of papers. (I also love that he's hidden like that in the first place).

Dallas uses a lot more profanity in the LNs than he does in the anime.

When Nick was originally put in the freight hold, Lua, the White Suit (I'm pretty sure that's [actually](/s "Who")), and Jack were already there. Nick tried to talk to Lua and the WS, but they kept silent. There was a Black Suit guard with a machine gun keeping an eye on them. 

When Ladd comes to rescue them, hes all, Im so glad youre all right, Lua! and the WS is just like, you werent worried about me at all? Jacks a bit volatile, and he calls Ladd a sunnuvabitch after Ladd doesnt untie them. Nick says, Stop it, Jack, lets just try and untie ourselves. 

Remember from episode four when I said Ladd was going on about how maybe all guys named Jack are good boxers ?
Ladd unties Jack, and then: 

> "So your names Jack, huh? This is interesting! Its finally time to see if everyone named Jack is good at boxing or not! Start!

Then he beats the crap out of Jack. Jacks not in the best of conditions afterwards.

> He was breathing with some difficulty, and his face was so swollen that it was impossible to even tell what color his eyes were.

> Jacuzzi narrowed his eyes and clenched his fists. Nick took a step away from him and whispered to Nice and Donny, Hey. Dont tell me Jacuzzis gettin serious?"

You know, I never really paid attention to the music in the background of that scene until my third watch or so. Its kookiness worked, surprisingly.

Speaking of NickI missed out on commenting on episode two, so I missed a chance to post this fun thing concerning the dining car. What did Nice mean by take care of the dining car? Heres your answer.

> Nice had actually meant, "Keep an eye on the situation in the dining car", but Nick was an experienced mugger--as a result, he came to an entirely different conclusion.
> "So, what she means is, I have to keep the dining car quiet while they get on with the job... Sounds about right. Can't have anyone finding out about us and stopping the train along the way."

 The Black Suits apparently normally communicated by telegraph. The fact that Spike received a radio transmission meant it was a dire emergency.

Natalie Beriams a pretty good person. Heres the exchange between her and Ian/John the bartender.

> "Aren't you going to hide?" John asked from behind the counter.

> "No, it's better this way. I don't know why, but it looks as though both sides are after me... And if I were to hide, it would cause trouble for everyone else on board." Mrs. Beriam smiled softly.

Speaking of John and Mr. Turner (kind of), John and Fang threw Turner out of the dining car when he was making a fuss in a pretty badass way. Id love to post the passage but its kinda long. If anyones interested Ill post it as a reply to their comment. 

Dallas family earned their fortune from the textile industry [and](/s "their underground drug empire.").

I think a fan of Baccano! once joked that they liked to think that whenever someone refuses one of Rubiks sugar cubes, they get put on his hit list. 

Okay, so the whole thing with Nicholas tipping off Gustavo that Eve would be a good hostage/bargaining chip is a lot more complicated in the LNs and involves people and an entire plot line thats completely cut out from the anime. 

Its a big plotline involving characters that show up in later LNs and it takes up a big chunk of 1932. It would be too long and complicated to explain it all, plus there'd be spoilers if I went into it now, so Ill simply say that in the LNs it was Henry who hints to LN char. drug addict Roy Maddock that Eve could be used as a shield against the Runoratas, who Roy and his family and friends are in danger from. What happens next isnt quite what plays out in the anime. (As one person from TvTropes said, the MacGuffin in the 1932 LN isn't Dallas, like it is in the anime, it's a parcel of drugs). Essentially just blame Gustavo for everything in 1932. What an idiot. 

Random trivial facts: Yagulmas name has also been translated as Yagurama. He taught Firo Japanese, which is why Firos Japanese, though very fluent, has an ancient flavor to it. Fire says he learned the modern speech and tone from movies and Japanese comics. So essentially Firo reads manga. Of course he does, Narita. Of course he does. 

I may have to post this and take off, because real life gets in the way of hobbies. Well see.

Brutal. Szilard don't mess around.

Who is Jack? Is that just short for Jacuzzi?

It's always a bummer. Well not always, but a good chunk of the time.
>> ARTICLE
> Who is Jack?

Ah, I've mentioned him in previous episode essays, so I guess I forgot to rereintroduce him. He's a member of Jacuzzi's gang, and in the LNs he's there on the train with them through everything that happens. I'm not sure why they cut him out of the anime (he shows up in the last three eps though). Like when Nice says to Nick 'take care of the dining car', she tells both Donny and Jack to follow her. 


>> ARTICLE

It's on me for not remembering. So he's a LN only character (for the most part). Got it. Thanks.

**Episode 6**: The president of Daily Days is quite mysterious hiding behind a mountain of paper/books. First time we actually we get to know Dallas before he went missing. Luck Gandor is not taking any of his shit though. And juices trade hands. So nice of Chane saving the senator's daughter. Dallas is quite arrogant just like the rumors said he would be. It's a trap, Eve! More Rail Traicah! Poor Isaac and Miria. Luckily Ennis comes to rescue! But Szilard now has Dallas.

Yay! Watched episodes 1-6 today and finally caught up with you guys. That being said, why does every one of the POV characters seem to be ermm....weirdoes? I confess that I'm having difficulty keeping up with all the different names, some of the "alternate" ones I made up are Ciel for the hyper-intelligent kid rescuing the senator's daughter, Ohgi for the blonde weirdo-robber guy, Mirri Maaz Durr(MMD) for his girlfriend. 

Now that's out of the way, I am really enjoying the format for the 3 different storylines taking place despite the difficulty of keeping track of who's on which one. 1930's USA is also a really nice setting, dig those hats (and suits of course).

Yeah, I was wondering what type of weird necessity compelled them to spell out the characters in an OP of all things. After watching em all, I get their point.

**I was seriously impressed with how tight-lipped people were yesterday about spoilers and the lack of hype. Great job, and lets keep it up for the rest of the anime!**

Well, episodes 9 and 10 were doozies of episodes. 

Info dumping time!: 

In the LNs, Im 99% certain that a bullet grazes the crap out of Rachels thigh, not her ankle. 

Of course the President knows more than Rachel. Hes practically omnipotent, or at least I like to think so. 

Come on Dune, tell us who did this to you right now! How are we to avenge our friend if he cant talk much less find his own face?  Ladd has so many great lines, though. "Oh Dune, you poor poor faceless bastard. Genius. 

Thats right, the young conductor is the Rail Tracer! His real name is Claire Stanfield, aka Vino, and his [high kicks are a thing of glory](http://imgur.com/WsgR45s) .  Really though, he is incredibly strong and agileif it wasnt clear enough, hes holding Dune completely parallel to the train tracks, which means hes managing to hang horizontally from a *moving train with just his legs*. This is explained by the President of the Daily Days as being mostly due to the time he spent in the circus. 

The thoughts of the Lemure conductor as Claire points the gun at him:

> The older conductor shuddered. It wasn't the gun that scared him--it was the eyes of the young man pointing it at his face. They were no longer the eyes of the lighthearted young man telling stories. They were destruction incarnate, dark and deep yet luminous.
> It was like hatred and sorrow and pity all mixed into one, directed towards himself. The young conductor's eyes were like a black flame burning bright, the glow directed entirely into his eyes. What kind of a life had he led to gain such a look?

I really want to screenshot every second of Ladds scene in the conductor car, because its all golden. Ill tap dance on their head like Im Im goddamn Bojangles! [Some](http://imgur.com/aUTvpu6 [highlights](http://imgur.com/ksPEdvT) [of](http://imgur.com/LVk2bAb) [it](http://imgur.com/5vtl0XQ) [okay](http://imgur.com/Fd3lvQo)..?

Ian/John the bartender must have had a conversation with Claire at some point to have heard the Rail Tracer story from him, as he says in the LNs. I wonder where he found the time? 

A note about Claire: He really does like being a conductor. Heres why in his own words:

> What do I like about being a conductor? Its all the people I get to meet.  Some passengers I see once and never agin, and other people are regulars I meet every week.  The Flying Pussyfoot carries all sortsboth the rich and the poor.  And even setting aside your financial status, people with all kinds of pasts ride this train.  And I work to make this train the kind that brings the same smiles to everyones faces. I love watching people.  Considering what I did before I got this job, I really do just like seeing people smiling and enjoying themselves.

See, he takes his jobs seriously. As a conductor its his duty to protect the passengers, so thats what he does. Its a pretty warped honor code he has, reallyhe works for criminals (the Gandors) to kill other criminals, but he he doesnt harm innocents. 

Hey, have you noticed that most of the time the Rail Tracer appears near the Conductors Cabin? Have you been wondering how the trains been running when the conductors were (well, not anymore) dead and with all the killings going on? Well, the train is being run by a pair of elderly brothers, whose ears arent too good anymore so they cant hear all the screams in the back. Claire tells the engineers that the train is being accosted by train robbers riding on horses alongside it, so they better keep the train running and not slow down for a second. Meanwhile, Claire, in between killings, is running back and forth to the conductors cabin to make the scheduled signals (the lights) so theyd think nothing was wrong. 

Why is making the train run on time so important to Claire? Well, he wants to get to New York on time so he wont be late for a meeting with the Gandors. Even he has people he doesnt want to disappoint. 

I like how both Luck and Berga look [at Keith](http://imgur.com/feSZTeC). He is the head of the family, after all. It's a nice little touch. 

The Gandors may indeed be unsuited as mafiosos but damn [can they look the part](http://imgur.com/sM84geS). Plus their [reactions](http://imgur.com/tIWUNDk) to Claire calling himself Vino--just great. 

As for Rachel: 

> In other words, she was a serial stowaway. She'd boarded without a ticket over a thousand times now, with a perfect track record.
> She did not feel at all guilty. This was both part of her work and a personal vendetta.

> She was an agent working for an information agency. She made a living by collecting all kinds of information from across America and selling it to the brokers.

The scene where Dallas cohort is devoured is hilariously melodramatic in the LN. Hes like, what are you doing to James? and then he thinks to himself, wait, is this guy really Jamesis my relationship with them so bad I dont even remember their names?

Szilard, right before he leaves, gives Dallas one last parting blow. Andthat man wasnt James, was he?"

And then the [guy next to him, most likely](http://imgur.com/4Vh7uIf), in the most dramatic soap opera way possible, starts to cry. "There were now only three people left in this room. One of the men staring blankly into space started crying.

> Dallas... the one who disappeared just now was Scott... James... is me.

(cue swelling string instrumental)

[Szilard's face, though](http://imgur.com/PEzORqn). Look at all those lines. What a shot. 

Shit, I forgot you can see [Scott's spinal cord as he's devoured.](http://imgur.com/0uc4BPj) That's so...creepy. That's his skeleton you're catching a glimpse of. 

[Claire](http://imgur.com/Qmx5gEr) [is](http://imgur.com/JEc07Qd) [pretty](http://imgur.com/F7sIoVy) [cool](http://imgur.com/w60uFfB), though the fandom is a little obsessed with him.
 
**Episode 10 (should I just put this in a separate post?**

Yeah, lets make this clearHuey did *not* tell the Lemures to hijack the train. That was all Goose (and Spike?)s idea. Though, Huey did see the Flying Pussyfoot as one of his experiments.  Due to an understanding/deal he has with Elmer, Huey isnt supposed to/wont hurt those who arent part of one of his experiments. 

Yeah, the birds thingI think theyre adapting something else from another LN, in which Leeza (Chanes younger sister that she doesnt know about) uses birds to relay Hueys orders while hes in captivity for the anime. Except in the anime I guess they represent more of a psychic connection between Chane and Huey that I dont think exists in the LNs. 

Czeslaw offers Ladd $20,000 to kill all the passengers at the tail end of 1931. Today, that would be about $291,691.92. 

[It must suck to be Ladd's childhood friend.](http://imgur.com/YM0m8OO) ...Poor Who. 
I wish I could just crawl into some dark hole and never come out.  that might be referencing Eleans tendency towards depression/depressive episodes. You know, I really like Eleans VA. Great choice. Also this never happens in the book. Eve goes with the LN character Roy Maddock, and things happen and Elean never rescues Eve at all because the previous events just dont happen the way they did in the LNs. Nor do the future events. Still, that Elean and Tick were there to witness the events in the Gandor's hideout in the anime is in my view a good thing.  

With that said, though, I think they did a good job with the adapted storyline and I really appreciate them giving Elean an expanded role because I like his character a lot. 

Eve, on Dallas: 

> I never liked Brother Dallas. He was uneducated and unskilled, base and shameless, immoral, and frequently made himself hated. But what came to mind was the scene when we met for the last time.

> On the next day after Gods emissaries, the thieves, came- that gentle face as he taught me billiards.

> *--Aah, why, why was Brother kind only to me, so gentle and so genial? Why didnt he treat me like the others and do hateful things?*

 As Firo says, Isaac really likes detective novels. Professor Moriarty indeed. He must be a big fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories.  

Holy shit do I love Tick Jefferson (the torture specialist) in the LNs. He gets to shine in LNs #6 and #7 and *I need to see the Slash arc animated so badly goddammit*. 

Haha, Chane blocks his bullets with her knives. Badass. And Ladd cackling as he falls from the signal post is fantastic. 

Nick has so many great lines, though. "What the hell just happened?" Truer words have never been spoken. He and Nice getting caught by ~~Wolverine~~ Spike also happens in the LNS. 

Fuckin' Keith. He cheats the hell out of poker. I'm pretty sure in the LNs he carries around a deck consisting of 52 jokers. (Have I mentioned how much I love Keith?)

Elean makes the greatest faces.

The Chinese waitress is Lin Lianshan/Linshan, Fan's older sister. The two had a British father. (Finally this info becomes relevant!)

I bet I'm forgetting a lot of stuff, but this post is obscenely long and I'm sure you'd all hate me if I made it any longer. 

**Edit** also the fight scene with Ladd and Chane on the roof of the train is "frigging unbeLIEVable." No, really, Chane's somehow running (in heels?) on the top of the train, while Ladd is shooting at her, and Ladd is kicking at her and somehow balancing on one leg as he does so *on top of a moving train*. *What.*

**Edit x2** - I've added some of my screenshots.

So he's like Robin Hood, assassin edition.

It's interesting that they're usually so confident and assertive when dealing with anyone else, but they tiptoe around Claire/Vino. 

> One of the men staring blankly into space started crying.

This sounds hilarious, I wish they'd included it.

I can see why, can't wait to find out more about him. 

>> ARTICLE
> but they tiptoe around Claire

Weellllll maybe they're more nonplussed when it comes to him, some of the time. Honestly they get along pretty well. Berga and Claire used to and still do roughhouse all the time--they get into sparring matches. Claire wins. Always. 

Plus Keith is, on record, probably the only man ever to whom Claire has backed down and apologized to/for. You see, in the fourth LN, [spoiler tag just in case, I guess](/s "Claire is fighting a Mexican assassin, Maria (who becomes more important in LNs 6 and 7) and mocks her pride in being an assassin and the idea that there's honor among thieves"). He's mocking the crap out of her. 

This is what happens next:

>  Pressed against the back of Vinos head was a gleaming, black handgun. Feeling the muzzle touching his hair, Vino said without any trace of surprise or fear,

> Keith!

> From behind came a brotherly answer.

> Dont mock the living.

> At Keiths words, the worlds most terrifying assassin merely closed his eyes and sighed his reply, 

> Were just not the same as you, guys like us......

> Doesnt change a thing.

> He chose the bare minimum of words, not giving Vino any chance to counter.

> Were all the same- all villains.

> Vino didnt care the slightest about the gun aimed at his head, scratching his head as he turned around and looked into Keiths eyes, the murderous intent from earlier no longer present.

> I understand, sorry. You too are someone beset by honour and pride.

> Whether deep in his heart, or in Vinos Claires tone of voice, there wasnt the slightest trace of mockery.

> Suddenly, Keiths eyes glittered with killing intent and charged straight at Claires side. With a heavy thud, something behind Claire fell down. Without any unease or questions, he turned around and saw the scene he had expected to see.

> Taking advantage while Claire and Keith werent paying him attention, the old man who had attacked from the back had already been forcefully kicked to the ground by Keith. Then, Keith relentlessly stomped down on his chest. The old man let out a weak moan, sprawled on the floor and unable to move.

> Take pity on the poor old man!

> Staring at Claire, who laughed as he spoke, Keith said expressionlessly, ......Enemies are enemies!

> Hearing Keiths response, Claire gave a satisfied smile. Maybe only you are still like Mafia!

(Claire likes to say (and he's not the only one) that the Gandors aren't cut out to be Mafiosos. They're too soft, he claims. I think he's right, though; Keith is probably the hardest of them)

**EDIT**

> This sounds hilarious

It was. It was like every soap opera rolled into one. I couldn't believe it. I was drowning in melodrama. 

> I see why. Can't wait to find out more about him.

He's definitely a fan favorite. While I'm not quite on the same devoted level as others, I usually have fun whenever he shows up, kind of like how I do whenever Elmer or Ladd's on screen/on the page. 
>> ARTICLE
Nice. It's too bad that we don't get to see that much of Keith in the anime. 

Thanks for the background info! Your dedication to this show/series is seriously amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
> I like how both Luck and Berga look at Keith. He is the head of the family, after all. It's a nice little touch.

I figured that Keith was the oldest Gandor brother (he certainly has the "severe" look down), but for some reason I assumed Luck was in charge.  It seems like everyone outside the family goes to him first.  I guess being the youngest is what makes him most approachable?
>> ARTICLE
Yep, Keith is the oldest brother and the head of the family after their father died from overworking himself when they were all still young. 

> I assumed Luck was in charge...I guess being the youngest is what makes him most approachable?

Well, Luck is the go-to guy, frankly because Keith is pretty taciturn and Berga isn't the brightest guy around. So yeah, Luck's pretty much has to be the face of the family. It's not that Keith is mute, like Chane; he just prefers to be silent and speaks only when he has to (except when he's with his wife, Kate. Then he sometimes speaks more than half a sentence!). 

(Apparently he talks a lot - for him, at least - on the phone when he's talking with her). 

When Keith *does* speak, it's usually pretty important. The Daily Days has so much respect for Keith (or at least the President knows that when Keith voluntarily speaks everybody better sit the fuck up and listen) that when he visits the President in the fourth LN the president pretty much says that anything Keith says "will definitely be precious information" and implies that since it's that important Keith will probably be charged very little money for the info he wants to know. 

Ahem. Keith is a pretty intriguing character that I'm very fond of. 
>> ARTICLE
> See, he takes his jobs seriously. As a conductor its his duty to protect the passengers, so thats what he does.

That's oddly admirable. I like him a little more now.

> Dallas... the one who disappeared just now was Scott... James... is me.

Damn, Dallas. Know your bros.

> uses birds to relay Hueys orders while hes in captivity for the anime. Except in the anime I guess they represent more of a psychic connection between Chane and Huey

Well that explains that.

> Holy shit do I love Tick Jefferson (the torture specialist) in the LNs. He gets to shine in LNs #6 and #7 and I need to see the Slash arc animated so badly goddammit. 

I'd love to see that. Sounds awesome. I really like that character even though he's only appeared, I think, two times so far. I just want to see him work.

>I'm sure you'd all hate me if I made it any longer.

I'd never. Your posts are 100% awesome.
>> ARTICLE
> I'd love to see that. Sounds awesome. 

Well, we get some background on his childhood and how he came to work for the Gandors, for one thing. ([He](/s "and his brother Tack lived with their stepfather, a clockmaker, who owed a lot of money to not only the Gandors but the Martillos and countless others he'd never be able to repay. So when teenaged Luck Gandor comes to collect on the debt, Tick's stepfather 'sells' Tick to him. Luck, being entirely unsuited to mafia business (by which I mean he's too damn soft) takes him up on his offer and Tick thus becomes the 'property' of the Gandors/is sold to them as collateral.  As they leave, Randy and Pecho arrive and start beating up the stepfather.")

We also learn what has become of [his](/s "genius prodigal brother - who now calls himself Tim, having changed his appearance completely - who now is the leader of the Lamia, another of Huey's factions, made up entirely of homunculi.")

Tick [and](/s "Tim") are two of the main characters of 6 and 7, as they are heavily involved in one of the main plotlines. 

Plus, Tick at the end of #7 has a climatic scene [with](/s "Dallas") and he is so incredible that I *cannot believe the scene may never be animated ever this is inexcusable Japan why couldn't you have bought more DVDs?* think it's one of my favorite scenes period in the novels. 

Actually, the scene where Isaac's ear is nicked in episode one [is](/s "from that very same arc.")
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so their names... are Tick and Tack?



^^^^^\*snicker\*
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was Tick and Tock.
>> ARTICLE
Tim's real name has been translated as Tack or Tock, depending on the fan translator. Both are 'correct' as ticking sounds a clock makes. 

At this point I'm more used to Tack, since that's what I've seen the majority of the time in the LNs, and I prefer it too. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep. Or Tick and Tock, depending on what the translator chooses. 

Although, in the anime Luck calls Tick 'Chick', which I think makes less sense than Tick when you consider that Tick and Tack's stepfather was a *clockmaker* of all things. 

(I'm nervous for the official LN translations. If they call Tick Chick because of the anime I'm going to be sad). 

**Edit** - Plus, what would they call Tack, then? Chico, ala Chico Marx? Chack? Chock? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE official translators please call them Tick and Tack this has been a PSA

I have something to say first that isn't directly related to Baccano! so **if you're not interested in this, just skip down to the "Now On To the Episode" section.** This is a brief explanation of mine pertaining to spoiler tags and I guess discussion threads as well. I'm not trying to be all "high and mighty," and I'm certainly not trying to spark a debate that overpowers our normal Baccano! discussion. It may be a consequence of this so let's try to avoid that. **Most importantly, I am not trying to cause anybody to bend their use of spoiler tags to fit into my mold.** This is just my personal explanation of how and why I'm using them the way I do.

[Late in yesterday's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3ey3dy/spoilers_baccano_episode_8_rewatch_discussion/ctjlmgu) it was brought to my attention that I don't use spoiler tags for their intended purpose (i.e. preventing those who have not yet seen any or all of a story from learning about future plot points). That is obviously true, as it's not how I'm using tags. Tagging my speculation is something I picked up during the Code Geass rewatch. It's sort of a "just in case I get this right" kind of deal.

I know that if you don't want *any* potential spoilers you shouldn't be in a place like this. That doesn't mean I can't try to lower the risk for other first-timers. We have all been spoiled before. We come to discussions knowing full well we may be spoiled, then we are spoiled, then we're mad at ourselves anyway. You might only read a simple prediction, but it might be one that is *very* possible. You'll continue watching the show with that thought in mind, and when it turns out to be true you won't be as shocked or excited because you saw it coming.

This is somewhat nonsensical since you can easily avoid the risk. Again, you shouldn't go to discussion threads if you don't want spoilers. It's tough though because you want that feeling of watching the show alone, relying only on your own intelligence to predict what could happen next, but you also want to discuss everything with others because you love it so much.

Now, this is a *rewatch* thread. I would likely not be using tags at all if this was an airing show. What I as an individual am doing in these threads is providing two services, so to speak. The first chunk of my post contains my (mostly) live reactions as the episode progresses. I try to keep these parts speculation free so that everyone, rewatchers and first-timers, can enjoy it. Then we move down to my "Post Episode Thoughts on the Future" section. This is more geared towards the rewatchers so I can provide them crazy theories and they can laugh at my expense. I keep some of it tagged so that the first-timers can read it, but don't have to if they don't want to. That is why I usually label it "no spoilers, just speculation." 

I'm a first-timer, and like other first-timers have been doing in these threads, I tag my speculation. There will obviously be no spoilers from us. I only advise that for us first-timers reading any responses (to our speculation or not) that contain spoiler tags, that we be careful, as we normally must be.

Thank you for reading if you did.

**--- "Now On To the Episode" ---**


There was some good old RES tagging yesterday. [Does anyone else tag themselves?](http://i.imgur.com/lpCgSms.jpg) No? Just me, probably. Ok then.

Only watched five episodes of AoT yesterday. I got caught up watching anime bloopers. \\\_()_/

**--- Episode 9 - Claire Stanfield Faithfully Carries Out the Mission ---**

For real. I don't know if I'll ever see a better way to present recaps. They even keep the music going over them, and then it just bangs (literally with the Nice/Jacuzzi intro) right back into the OP.

Damnit. The woman in fatigues isn't Vino. -319 points.

What the heck. Why does she seem so familiar? She sounds like Ennis, maybe?

Well this I didn't see coming.

I had to rewatch the scene where they walk outside the train at least four times. The editing was confusing, and the characters looked similar. [The Rail Tracer is the conductor?](http://i.imgur.com/Fb1v0qh.gifv) And maybe he grows in power the more blood he draws.

[Ladd loves blood and violence.](http://www.gfycat.com/FluffyShyFlea) All the Russo's are crazy. This guy just laughing as his face is pressed into the tracks.

"Your ticket please." Scary af.

Nice. At least I got this one right. Looks like Szilard injected Dallas' gang with the formula so he could absorb them. +156 points.

Good move making Dallas and co. do your dirty work. They're gonna be surprised if Ennis isn't telling them they're immortal.

C'mon, Chane. Turn sides. You and Ennis both. I'm pretty sure it's more or less confirmed, but I still want to see it happen.

They know they're immortal. [Hahaha!](http://www.gfycat.com/AntiqueSereneHammerkop)

I'm I'm being honest, I don't like the way The Rail Tracer was revealed. It's not that I don't like the choice, I'll enjoy it for what it is, but I feel like that was a tough one to see coming. Any other first-timers feel that way? What about rewatchers? Did you have any idea who it would be the first time you watched Baccano!?

Wonder what the hell The Rail Tracer is going to do now that he sees Czeslaw can't die. [speculation, no spoilers](/s "Can TRT kill immortals? He was summoned as an assassin, but what for? To kill immortals or just for gang related stuff? Seems like the latter.")

[This one is really random, and maybe a bit of stretch...](/s "Carol is Ennis' daughter. I have no other reason to believe this except that their hair seems sort of similar. Bonus crazy points for me if Firo is the dad. Yes I know she's a homunculus. No I don't know all the homunculus rules. Fuck you, they can have a kid if I say so. Let me have this one.")

[... finally some slightly boring speculation](/s "Firo absorbs Szilard.")

Eve and my whole [I think](/s "she's going to be immortal thing sort of got debunked. She seemed slightly, only slightly, surprised when the Gandors came back to life. It's possible she doesn't know she's immortal.")

Anyway, that last one is still on my mind, and also the final scene of episode one where they're all gathered together after the train finally arrives. It seems like the series is only 13 episodes with 3 OVAs. I don't know if that actually means anything in terms of how the story plays out, but maybe The Flying Pussyfoot arrives at the end of episode 13, and from there we can get into some "present day" stuff. I'd like to see some of the gaps filled in between the relationships of Issac/Miria and Ennis/Firo as well as Maiza and Czeslaw.

Late in the thread yesterday I saw /u/DazeRyuken's speculation. You pretty much nailed it on the head. I couldn't respond to you since I had already watched the next episode, but good job. 

/u/The-Sublimer-One, what was this comment for the other day when I randomly remembered/speculated about the woman in fatigues being Vino?

> Do you even memory, bruh?

Did I just completely miss some information that would make the assumption obviously wrong?

Even a broken clock is right twice a day!  I didn't have much reason to assume that apart from meta information (closing sequence, mainly), but when you have an active imagination...

I totally fell for that too :( 

> "Your ticket please." Scary af.

Turns out he was just doing his job. 

> Oh, this is probably where Isaac gets shot and lives. 

I'm still confused about this part. Did Isaac get shot, or just his hat? 

They didn't show Isaac and Miria drinking the 'liquor', so we don't know for sure if they're immortal yet at this point. 

> I don't like the way The Rail Tracer was revealed... I feel like that was a tough one to see coming

I didn't see it coming either, but then again I'm pretty lousy at solving mysteries lol. 

Reading through everyone's replies, it seems like there *were* quite a few subtle clues, but I agree that they could have done more to setup the reveal. Like mentioning the murders in different cities beforehand, or something. 

>> ARTICLE
> Turns out he was just doing his job.

Hahaha! True.

> Did Isaac get shot, or just his hat?

> They didn't show Isaac and Miria drinking the 'liquor'

Yeah, I don't know if we're supposed to assume that's what happened or not since they didn't explicitly show it. Well, I mean, we know they're immortal based off of the first episode, or at least Isaac is. So maybe we are supposed to assume they (maybe just he) drank it.

> Like mentioning the murders in different cities beforehand, or something. 

That would've been good. Maybe even giving background on Vino being a circus person (acrobat? carny?).

Any other first-timers feel that way? What about rewatchers? Did you have any idea who it would be the first time you watched Baccano!?

Well, I was surprised as well tbh. And I've had time to analyse the plot points for a couple of points. Of course, there was a small voice whispering that the train conductor Claire is alive. But I had no idea whatsoever that he was the RT.

Now that I see the kind of stunts he pulls off, Suzaku's spinning kick seems REALLY reasonable for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
> Of course, there was a small voice whispering that the train conductor Claire is alive.

I didn't catch that. Nice going.

Spinzaku vs The Rail Tracer. I'd watch that fight. I'm not sure it'd last long, but it'd be good.
>> ARTICLE
I meant that since his death wasn't shown on-screen, there was a brief thought that there a 0.0001% chance of him being the RT. Creepy immortal sucking dude/Dallas the douchebag were more probable candidates in my mind.
>> ARTICLE
> What about rewatchers? Did you have any idea who it would be the first time you watched Baccano!?

Well...actually there were a few clues that didn't make the reveal for me at least as revelatory as it was for others. Claire telling the Lemure conductor the Rail Tracer story isn't in-your-face 'you should be on the alert, this is suspicious!' hinting at you, but I kept it in mind as I watched the show--plus, the fact that they didn't actually show Claire's death was another major warning flag for me (I always get suspicious if they don't show the deaths on screen. I'm too jaded at this point). 

Plus, in some of the Rail Tracer shots (especially when Claire whispers in Rachel's ear) the hair looks somewhat distinctive, plus they gave us a pretty good glimpse of his eyes.

Mainly though, the episode 8 preview shows a clip of the Rail Tracer that pretty much doesn't hide the fact that it's the young conductor, plus Isaac and Miria say Claire's name (they conclude at the end the Rail Tracer must be a girl, though). That's why I recommended that people stay away from that preview. It just seemed so blatantly revealing..at least to me. 

> Claire is a girl's name

I see someone's already explained that Claire was mostly a boy's name back then. Other names have done this too, like Lindsey and Ashley--which used to be mainly names for men. 
>> ARTICLE
> That's why I recommended that people stay away from that preview.

Yeah. I did. Good recommendation. As for the on screen death thing, you're right. I usually try to abide by that rule, but I guess I was fooled by thinking one of the bloody, mangled bodies was Claire. Oh well.

> I see someone's already explained that Claire was mostly a boy's name back then. Other names have done this too, like Lindsey and Ashley--which used to be mainly names for men. 

Truthfully it was a clever trick. You're in the 2000s writing a story that takes place in the 1930s. All of your readers/watchers are used to Claire being a girl's name so you can cleverly fool them into thinking it was back then too since they likely don't know any better.

But out of how many?

> Ladd loves blood and violence.

Tapdancin' Ladd!

> I thought Vino is Claire. That's a girls name!

That's the whole point. In the LNs, they even start off referring to Claire in a female context.

> Well, either she's a mortal or a homunculus like Ennis.

Nah. She just happened to be conceived a short while ago.

> Wtf are they doing running in circles?

I CALLED IT!

> What about rewatchers? Did you have any idea who it would be the first time you watched Baccano!?

I'll be honest. The first time I saw this show, I marathoned it all in one day, so I was never really stopping too long to think who the Rail Tracer might be. When it was revealed it was Claire and Claire was the conductor, I was too overwhelmed by the fucking badass things he was doing to really be disappointed.

> [Speculation](/s "Bonus crazy points if Firo is the dad.")

I'll better answer this question in a few episodes, when the answer won't be as spoilery.

> Did I just completely miss some information that would make the assumption obviously wrong?

Actually, that was just me being a troll trying to further throw you off the scent. I'm sry, bby. Pls don't be mad.

And I definitely think marathoning Baccano! would have helped care a little less who TRT was.

The moment I found out who was the Rail Tracer, that's when I knew this show is amazing.

#Thoughts on the episode 

Episode 9: 

/u/Neawia one of your predictions was right the Conductor is the Railtracer

and here we have him, my favourite character in this anime Vino, he is just awesome, and his world view is especially awesome, but you all will see in future episodes.

Episode 10:

I love it when Isaac and Miria "act naturally"

also I was never really sure at this scene with Chane but can Huey use telepathy? Because it really looked like it.

Nooooo! I was talking about the other guy, the older one! I guess I was a bit confusing, so that's on me. I was too much of a simpleton to think something other than the obvious would come from their scenes.
>> ARTICLE
but they really make it difficult to guess who the rail tracer is because the guy from Ladds gang is also a readhead and you only see the hair of the body, of course you assume that Claire or the young conductor is dead.
>> ARTICLE
Holy cow Czes is kinda evil... and I like it. >:)
>> ARTICLE
He reminds me somewhat of FMAB's Pride.
>> ARTICLE
I've fallen behind twice when we only had *one* episode a day.  Never was good at two-a-day's...  Never played high school sports, either.

**Ep. 9:**

* Now that I'm thinking about it, who puts a dartboard on the inside of a compartment door?  It seems pretty dangerous.

* So *that's* why the young conductor is featured in the closing credits!  [My speculation from yesterday was correct.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3ey3dy/spoilers_baccano_episode_8_rewatch_discussion/ctjzeob)  Admittedly, I was also suspicious because the young conductor is also right in the middle of the key visual on the [MyAnimeList page for Baccano!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2251/Baccano!/)

* I thought the girl in fatigues would be Claire Stanfield (as she did have a mission, clearly), but she's Rachel.  Not much difference, since I don't think either name has been mentioned before.  In that case... what mission was Claire/Vino actually carrying out?  Being gruesome?  Mission accomplished.

* Coleslaw, I see what you're asking for.  You want to figure out who the immortal is by just killing everyone.  But really, do you need to give Ladd even more reason to do something he loves?

**Ep. 10:**

* What's your angle, Sugarcube?  I don't understand you.

* Oh, Coleslaw's plan was a lot more elaborate when he got down to it.  Kind of saw Ladd's response coming because of the slip from the first episode, but whatev.  Kid'll walk it off.

* 10 years for the first kiss?!  And Nice is so abashed.  Adorable.

* We get to see an Isaac and Miria robbery in action!  It was... too easy, really.  Is this before or after they steal from the Genoard household?  I hope Ennis isn't forced to try to hurt them, but that seems like it'd be Szilard's style, so I'm not getting my hopes up.

* I'd like to see more of the Gandors.  They're prominent enough to get their own name cards in the opening sequence, but we've only seen a little Luck.  Otherwise, they act as a unit.  It is interesting to see that all 3 are immortal in 1932.

Things seem to be speeding right along.  [first-timer speculation re: Sugarcube](/s "I imagine he might be in the employ of the Daily Days.  Letting Eve go, and then tipping off the Gandors that Gustavo and his goons were coming to pay a visit would make sense.")
>> ARTICLE
> But really, do you need to give Ladd even more reason to do something he loves?

I think it would have worked better if he had pleaded with Ladd to *not* kill the passengers. 

[Reply to your speculation](/s "I figured he was some sort of double agent, him working for the Daily Days makes sense! That would explain how Elean knew where Eve was.")
>> ARTICLE
>  In that case... what mission was Claire/Vino actually carrying out? Being gruesome? Mission accomplished.

That is a good point. What exactly was his mission. We know he was called up by the Gandors, right? So there's that. But on the train, I don't know.

**edit** Dumbass me. I should've read /u/The-Sublimer-One's comment. Is that it though? His mission was just protecting the passengers?

>  I hope Ennis isn't forced to try to hurt them

She... she would never!

To your speculation: I like it. Definite possibility.
>> ARTICLE
> Is that it though? His mission was just protecting the passengers?

Yep. I wish it was more complex than that, but that's pretty much it. Protecting the passengers by slaughtering the fuck out of the bad guys. Still fun to watch.
>> ARTICLE
It makes sense. The "mission" is more like his overall goal (protecting his passengers) rather than one simple task (murder this man). It works, and yea, fun to watch.
>> ARTICLE
> what mission was Claire/Vino actually carrying out?

Protecting the passengers by killing the white/black suits.
>> ARTICLE
Aw.  Such an upstanding young man.  Too bloodthirsty for my taste, but at least the normal passengers only have to survive 2 factions instead of counting the Rail Tracer as a third.

Prelude: [Episode 8s Preview](https://a.pomf.cat/fbtjee.mp4)

Episode 9

* Finally. This one. Er Two, actually. (Ive been saying that a lot, recently.)

* [This is actually the first time in the whole show that Rachel is identified by name.](https://a.pomf.cat/ewprwp.mp4) And for a reason. This whole time, theyve been pushing for people to believe that Claire Stanfield is a woman. Judging from the past threads, it appears they succeeded.

* [I still love this guy.](https://a.pomf.cat/ntolhc.mp4)

* Seriously, does anyone else have any shows with authority figures as awesome as the President? Hell, I wanna work for him.

* Rachel  [Trina Nishimura](http://myanimelist.net/people/1804/Trina_Nishimura)

* [You can see how clearly upset Ladd is.](https://a.pomf.cat/xqbdua.mp4)

* [Ladds face is amazing here.](http://i.imgur.com/iuyMvDd.jpg)

* [This line](https://a.pomf.cat/gexysu.mp4) was so obviously redubbed that it almost borders on narm.

* [And there it is.](https://a.pomf.cat/hgowse.mp4) Thats the scene all the rewatchers have been waiting for. When Claire finally crosses into psycho-killer mode.

* [Hes not wrong.](https://a.pomf.cat/yhyzhl.mp4) Have you ever read the FBIs declassified files on enhanced interrogation? They almost never get viable info.

* [Does Claire have LEDs in his eyes or something?](http://i.imgur.com/lteLWDY.jpg)

* To capture everything magnificent about the torture scene, Id have to show the whole thing. But I do find [this section](https://a.pomf.cat/egbtos.mp4) to be particularly brilliant.

* Just an interesting comparison that [this guy](https://a.pomf.cat/linurc.mp4) is the same person as [this guy.](https://a.pomf.cat/wnddcp.mp4)

* After hearing the [clear version](https://a.pomf.cat/qswftq.mp4) if you go back and listen to the [muffled version](https://a.pomf.cat/xcjgrb.mp4), you can actually make out what hes saying.

* [Breaking News:](https://a.pomf.cat/wgcxvf.mp4) All acrobats are skilled murderers and should be shot on sight.

* [Does Claire just have the ability to mentally short out light bulbs?](https://a.pomf.cat/qbbirp.mp4)

* [Remember a few threads ago when I said Vino is Italian for Wine?](https://a.pomf.cat/sqrqfp.mp4)

* [Claire confirmed as Batman.](https://a.pomf.cat/qqgqnl.mp4)

* [President:](https://a.pomf.cat/fwosnq.mp4) Well, I cant just tell you. Havent you ever heard of dramatic tension?

* [Hey, you offered, pal.](https://a.pomf.cat/afhgvd.mp4)

* [Bane:](https://a.pomf.cat/xfrpxx.mp4) But why would you shoot a girl before throwing her out of a train?

* [And he was such a reasonable mobster, too.](https://a.pomf.cat/wpxztq.mp4)

* I almost think Dallas purposefully let himself get shot just he could do [this.](https://a.pomf.cat/znkbxc.mp4)

* Why would being called a young man make Ladd not want to shoot him?

* [It says something when even people as ax-crazy as Ladd and Claire are stumped by your homicidal urges.](https://a.pomf.cat/vannwc.mp4)

* Now that I can bring this up, I always thought they should have left Claire out of the [closing credits.](http://i.imgur.com/LLuRHGI.jpg) It makes him stand out too much. In the [opening credits](http://i.imgur.com/PBg7VDQ.jpg), hes shown just enough to be noticeable, but not draw suspicion like featuring him at the end does. On a sidenote, why does [Isaac look so evil here?](http://i.imgur.com/TytR1P0.jpg)

Episode 10

* How did Beriam get to Newfoundland in that short a time?

* [If he knows that one of the passengers is immortal, whats his concern about picking up all the pieces?](https://a.pomf.cat/gjczgw.mp4) He knows that their body will just reform back together, anyway.

* [I love Isaac and Mirias theme music.](https://a.pomf.cat/vmqjgb.mp4)

* [Not a bad plan](https://a.pomf.cat/yfrwff.mp4) Too bad they forgot that Ennis can kick all their asses with her eyes closed.

* [Lol, irony.](https://a.pomf.cat/bxacaf.mp4)

* [What, youre surprised they share a telepathic link?](https://a.pomf.cat/ljdsqt.mp4)

* Chane Laforet  [Monica Rial](http://myanimelist.net/people/159/Monica_Rial)

   Thats right. THAT Monica Rial. Shes so well known for doing her standard high-school girl voice that hearing her do this one would make her totally unrecognizable unless you already knew better. It reminds me of when she voiced [Nyamo in Azumanga Daioh.](https://a.pomf.cat/hejgzp.mp4)

* If only real psychopaths were [this entertaining.](https://a.pomf.cat/hpbtkj.mp4)

* [What the fuck happened to Ladds face?](http://i.imgur.com/NsN5dRu.jpg)

* [Yeah, his spine should be broken in half.](https://a.pomf.cat/qegevm.mp4)

* [I love how they dont really give a shit about Gustavo.](https://a.pomf.cat/oahmln.mp4) Lucks more concerned with keeping his cards hidden than anything.

* Is it wrong that I broke into an insane chuckle when [this happened?](https://a.pomf.cat/skbnvh.mp4)

* [Elean again making the best faces ever.](http://i.imgur.com/YOjpnM5.jpg)

* [Youre complaining?](https://a.pomf.cat/ofpatd.mp4) I know people who would go through a lot more trouble than you did to get some liquor.

* [Fucking secret agent Ennis with the newspaper.](https://a.pomf.cat/qgeimk.mp4)

* [This seems kind of sacrilegious.](http://i.imgur.com/Z0PqgGK.jpg) I dont think Eve would approve of this behavior.

* Lia Lianshan  [Majken Bullard](http://myanimelist.net/people/1716/Majken_Bullard)

* Cant wait to see /u/Neawia make Gfys of Isaac and Miria spinning around.

* [Did Isaac just turn into a harem MC?](http://i.imgur.com/jFBktAP.jpg)

* [This scene always kind of confuses me.](https://a.pomf.cat/gfhvqm.mp4) Im never sure if Isaac has already drunk some of the immortality formula and healed in between shots (punz), or if the bullet just missed his head but passed through his hat, and Miria misread it. Regardless, YAY! ISAACS ALIVE!

Maybe there's a limit to how spread out the bits can be? Or maybe he just wanted to get Ladd to do it so that he could continue his innocent kid charade.

I'm just glad they didn't get hurt.

Thanks for posting that. I didn't even bother going back to see why a bunch of you suggested not watching it. Fairly spoilery, and yet, they still tried confusing the watcher.

Apparently Claire (or Clair) used to be considered a masculine name. That obviously changed as it's now mostly a feminine name. Real nice trickery on Baccano!'s part, those bastards.

**Ep 9**

* The Daily Days' chief has been upgraded from disembodied voice to disembodied hand. 

* Wow this episode was gory. All those squishy blood and bone cracking sounds :S

* The conductor = Vino = the Rail Tracer!!!! No wonder he appears in the OP and ED.    

**Ep 10**

More relationships are revealed in this episode! 

* So Chane is Huey's daughter and they can communicate telepathically. A gift from our friendly neighborhood Demon perhaps? 

* Aw, Jacuzzi & Nice are an item. That's so cute. 

* Question: If Czeslaw wants Ladd to kill the dining car passengers to root out the other immortal, why can't he just use the explosives himself? Won't the immortal still be able to come back to life, even if he/she is blown up? 

**Overall thoughts about the show so far:**

1) I really love how the different strands of the plot are woven so deftly together and then resolved one by one. Everything about the plot makes sense and there's a reason for each detail that's included.  

Vino uses the transcontinental railway to get to different cities and kills people on the train en route. Over time, he becomes an urban legend, the Rail Tracer. It just fits together so neatly.

2) Also love how the women in this show are portrayed. They're all sensible and strong characters (both emotionally and physically). None of them are anime stereotypes. Then again, this really isn't a typical anime. 

3) My only complaint so far: not enough Firo.

From /u/Revriley1:

Except in the anime I guess they represent more of a psychic connection between Chane and Huey that I dont think exists in the LNs. 

Also yes, more Firo please.

Well, episode 9 and 10 certainly clear things up quite a bit- particularly regarding the identity of the rail tracer, the mysterious lady in fatigues and Chane Laforet's relation with Huey. Chane and Ladd's entire exchange was awesome; her dodging all shotgun shots reminded me of [FMA:B spoilers](/s "Wrath/Bradley taking down the Briggs soldiers armed with tanks and machine guns with a single sword"). 

Also, did Miria and Isaac drink the immortality potion? Regardless, that entire passage of Isaac explaining how he'll eventually die was hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
True. Lots of answers, and I do think Isaac and Miria drank the potion. That's what it seemed like, although it's possible when Isaac was shot that the bullet missed his head somehow and only hit the hat.

**Oh boy. Were getting close to the end now, and I dont think Im ready to say goodbye to all you wonderful people. Hey, /u/angel10701 ? Is there going to be a separate thread for people to express their conclusions and impressions, etc., for the entire series, rather than just making the episode 15 + 16 rewatch the last thread? I feel like that would be a good idea. Lets do that. Please?**

**And even after that I wouldnt want to say goodbye. Its been a blast talking with you all and I hardly know anything about you. Dammit, Im getting sentimental about a rewatch thread. Ignore me. ~~NO seriously though Im honest to God picturing some sort of chat group this is how far Ive sunken~~**

.ah, er, lets just get on with it, shall we? Onto episode 11:

Maybe every encounter is some sort of miracle in its own way. Dammit Maiza, that was so sappy and pithy but I love you for it anyway. 

I really love the scene where Ladd drops down and ambushes the Black Suits. Its justcool. Super cool. And Ladd is entertaining as always. Dont get cute. Put down the gun. That means you too bright boy, put down the gun *right* now.

In the LNs, Czeslaw uses the name Thomas instead of Benjamin in front of Claire. (I wanted to take tons of screenshots of this scene but I know you guys have me covered). 

Chanes face as Ladd needles her. My word. He knows how to get under someones skin. Ohwhen Chane stabs her knife into the train to climb back up, she manages to nick Claires ear through the metal, because he happens to be in the conductors cabin (as I said yesterday hes making the scheduled light signals in between killing people). This takes place after he tortures Czes. (This is why he says you nearly lopped off my ear.)

Right before Claire grabs her knives: 

> The impact of the threats hit Chane both physically and mentally. If the previous provocation was like turning on an engine, this was like hitting an ignition switch. Chane put all of her strength into the tips of her knives as she made to charge at Ladd.

> But the her knives would not move.

 Okay fuck it [Im](http://imgur.com/EZNZBJ9) [screenshotting](http://imgur.com/7gdVPQ7) the [shit](http://imgur.com/nBBXoN5) out of this scene because [Maizas](http://i.imgur.com/9MfwU3q.jpg) one of my favorite characters and this entire confrontation is so important can you IMAGINE the shock and horror hes feeling right now? 

IdId better explain why [Szilard doesnt die](http://imgur.com/aVTMQCi) when the Martillo fellows shoot him multiple times, though my understanding of it may prove unsatisfactory. Szilard has been experimenting on his body over the past two centuriesfor one thing, Szilard has been training himself to ignore severe pain, and two, immortals can recover more quickly from types of injuries theyve had before (e.g. if I was shot in the head, the second time I was shot in the head Id recover more quickly). 

Sotheoretically, if Szilard had people shoot him enough times, maybe the recovery time would be almost instantaneous after 50 or so machine-gun deaths. 

 Claire pushes practically all of Ladds buttons. 

Andthats right! Claire is a solipsist, which means that he believes only he exists and the entire world is of his own design. The world is his. All the people are creations of his own mind.  

I think the whole scene with Maiza, Szilard and Firo plays out slightly differently in the LNs. In the first LN, Maiza, Firo, and the other executives (the non-executive Martillos arent allowed in the speakeasy) are eating lunch in the bar when the door opens and Szilard stands in the doorframe. No one recognizes him except for Maiza. Its been a long time, Maiza Avaro! Or should we say its been more than two hundred years! Through the doorway, the Martillos see the honey shop owner, Sena, lying on the ground. 

The Martillos get angry: 

> Only Firo, who was by Maizas side, noticed something. Anxiety and grimness showed on Maizas face, emotions Firo had never seen him express in the five years he had known that man.

> When he saw the burning fury in Maizas eyes, Firo was at a loss of what to do... at the same time the flames of anger also raged in Firos heart.

> Mr. Maiza... I dont understand whats going on but... Putting it simply, this guy is Mr. Maizas enemy, am I right?...

They shoot him, he doesnt die, Firo tries to physically fight Szilard but fails, Maiza uses his seniority as the *conta  oro* to order Firo to escape. Firo tries to protest, but then: 

> Although for a moment he was torn by indecision, just one glance at Maizas eyes was enough to make Firo dash out the door.

> ... At that moment, all hatred had disappeared from Maizas eyes... he just tranquilly smiled.

> That gaze was one of preparation and determination. If someone inside the organization had that kind of look in his eyes, whether his intentions were right or not... no matter what one did it was useless. Do as he said, because the only way to stop him would be to kill him yourself. It was a simple case of choosing one of two options.

Fire runs toward the back door. Szilard points the military-issue submachine gun at him and pulls the trigger. 

Fire makes it through the door just as Maiza manages to shield him from the bullets. 

> ... Youre really baffling. Is that youngster really that important?

> Standing before Szilard, who had a look of complete disbelief on his face, and blocking the gun fire was Maiza. His body was wrecked with the pain of the countless bullet holes, and crimson fluid gushed forth like a fountain.

 (Damn I wish I had gotten to see that animated)

 So essentially Firo was in the Alveare for the confrontation in the LNs. I think both the anime and the novel version have their merits, so Im not fussed by the change. At any rate, the tussle between him and Ennis happens after he exits the building.

Haha you thought I was done screenshotting Maizas and Szilards confrontation, did you? You thought wrong! I can never be stopped! [Here's](http://imgur.com/oOdA1HB) [Szilard](http://imgur.com/Cs4kq3D) [breaking](http://imgur.com/oNnWJBd) [Maiza's](http://imgur.com/SI07Zek) [wrist](http://imgur.com/xR3N3yI).

Ennis cut off explanation as to how Szilard constructed her is a glimpse of the LNs detail on homunculi. Its complicated.

Claire is capable of squeezing someones neck to the point of blood gushing out of it like it was an overripe tomato. Incredible. By the way, after Czes comes back to life that first time he tries to ask Claire someth

> I refuse. [] "You want me to kill the passengers in the dining car, right? Fraid I cant do that.

Then he buries a scalpel into Czes forehead. And then they have almost the exact same conversation they do in the anime, including the part where Claire bites off Czes fingers. 

> Czes unconsciously began to shed tears, paralyzed by fear.

> "I will grant you a kind of pain you have never known." Claire said gently, wiping Czes's tears. "Until you forget how to come back to life."

 **Oh Jesus that was long. I hope my notes for episode 12 wont be as long.**

**EDIT** They were. I was 7000+ over the 10000 limit. Sorry, looks like I'll have to be putting episode 12's in the separate post. I tried cutting down on the length, but I couldn't do it.

Been a good group. I'll probably mention it again in the final thread, but you (or anyone else) is free to PM me anytime with discussion stuff about any show or whatever else you'd feel like talking about. Sometimes you wanna chat about something and it's just not worth it to make an entire thread.

> IdId better explain why Szilard doesnt die when the Martillo fellows shoot him multiple times, though my understanding of it may prove unsatisfactory.

You know, I wondered why he didn't fall down when it happened. This makes perfect sense though. He's probably been shot tons of times. And he was essentially torturing himself to up his pain threshold? Jesus. Maybe he just had somebody continually shoot him. Like, one day he just decided he was going to be shot to death 50 times in order to get used to it.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't be surprised. He told Maiza that he wasted his years, while Szilard's have been fruitful

**And here's episode 12's notes**


**Episode 12**

A bullet grazes Rachels thigh when she rescues Natalie and Mary Beriam in the LNs. Apparently it caused her much pain. Remember how I talked about how she confronts Mr. Turner, the man who framed her father (a railway engineer) for an accident caused by him ignoring the engineers advice? That happens after she rescues them. 

It doesnt look like Mrs. Beriam took off her high heels while running. Badass. 

While Nice and Nick were climbing up the cars, in the LNs Jacuzzi and Donny laid the injured Jack (their fellow gang member in the LNs that Ladd beat the crap out of solely because of his name) in a Second Class cabin. Im mentioning this cause Jack recalls a little background info you might be interested in. 

(theres no reason for you to care about Jack since he hasnt appeared in the anime [yet] but screw itwhen Jack was a child, he buried his parents bodies under the floorboards of the slum he lived in. They had died of malnutrition. The foundations under the old apartments in immigrant districts were probably filled with hundreds of thousands of corpses"). 

Nick lived nearby, so Im assuming he grew up in the same conditions. Jack and Nick would go around making nuisances of themselves. 

Jack also says that its been half a year already since we met Jacuzzi in Chicago.  I had always assumed that Nick was old friends with them. (I like my idea better). 

Trivia: Nick has good eyes, which makes up for Nices less than stellar eyesight. Thats why hes the one to spot Chane, and probably how he could make out the Rail Tracer on the side of the train after throwing up. 

Nice and Nick have a longer dialogue with the Black Suits in the LNs. 

Rachel is caught by Wolverine on the roof after she helps the Beriams get to safety, and since her thigh is injured she goes with him rather than run. Instead of her coming to their rescue, she lies down alongside the Ns in the First Class Cabin. Goose accuses her of being the Rail Tracer and she laughs in his face. 

Goose and his fellows leave to investigate the dining car, Rachels ropes fall to the ground as its revealed she used her fingernails to cut through them. Nick with his good eyes can see that her nails had been sculpted strangely.  They were long and sharp like blades, and some of them were serrated like the edge of a saw.  It was almost as if she had been *expecting* to escape from being bound in ropes. Then she unties them.

After Jacuzzi leaves after [talking](http://imgur.com/RlJ1QsE) to Fan and Ian/John about Nice and how hes going after her, Fan quips: 

> Isnt he worried about Nick at all?

> (John) Maybe its because Nick doesnt have much in the way of presence.

Fucking ouch, [John.](http://imgur.com/HlOomNZ) You hold no punches. (John is great in the LNs. He doesnt mollycoddle Jacuzzi, and he can be blunt and opinionated.)

[Luck](http://imgur.com/p7chOYK) and [Berga](http://imgur.com/UDWqU3x) looking pretty suave pointing guns at Dallas and his goons. And [Keith](http://imgur.com/xfjJvnC) looks pretty badass except for the animation/editing blunder in that shot that kills me every time I see it. I cant believe I missed it the first time I watched this episode. 

Its fixed in the [next shot](http://imgur.com/MPKelz8) we see of him though. (I like [this](http://imgur.com/l7Es4DA) [scene](http://imgur.com/5Du61YU) [a](http://imgur.com/Dya8ZB8) [whole](http://imgur.com/qAPiFOC) [lot.](http://imgur.com/uEtre13) 

Czeslaws right arm and legs are missing. 

Ladd v Claire. Now *thats* a duel for the legends. LN exchange:

> "She's my fiancee, you bastard. Now hold on just a damn minute! Whaddaya want with my girl?!"

> "Nah, I was just wondering how a piece of trash like you could even find a girl of your own. 

> "What, is a mass murderer not allowed to fall in love like a regular person?"

 Okay, so regarding Luaprior to the train, she couldnt imagine Ladd being killed by anyone. But the moment her eyes met those of the red shadow, Luas heart was violently shaken. She becomes convinced that if Ladd confronts the monster he will die, and that terrifies her. 

You know, Ive been saying that certain characters have been cut from the anime, but perhaps a better way to think of it would be that the characters werent cuteverything thats happening in the LNs is happening in the anime, just off-screen.

So when Lua [climbs up](http://imgur.com/TlFmQkU) onto the roof, you should know that just prior shed been talking to the grey magician, the doctor Fred from the light novels whos been treating the injured (Black Suits, White Suits, doesnt matter) in one of the 2nd class cabins that Ladd graciously lent him. Both he and Lua recognize that they share the same wishthey both want to die. At any rate, the doctor says to Lua: 

> "Looks like you've found yourself a purpose. Your eyes are different now, so full of life. Although I can't say for certain if it's fear, or anger, or sadness."

 She is certain now, that she loves Ladd and that she cant allow him to fight Claire. 

The doctor says this of Lua: 

> "That girl and I have something in common--we both wish to die. But there's one fundamental difference between us. I often saw men with eyes like hers, back on the battlefield--the eyes of those who wish to die themselves, but have someone they care for greatly. Those eyes belong to people that can help other. Compared to me, a man who treats people out of nothing but a sense of duty... she is someone many times more valuable to the world."

 And here is what Lua is thinking in the scene: 

> Lua had finally found Ladd as she climbed up onto the roof from the coupling. But Ladd was already facing down the red monster.

> 'I finally found him. I have to hurry. I have to tell him. Before the red monster kills him. To get away from this train--at least one step further from that monster. We have to escape--no, I have to at least make sure Ladd gets away.'

> Ladd was someone essential to Lua. It wasn't only so because he was pledged to kill her--even discounting this fact, Lua could not imagine a world without Ladd. Life and death were as one, and through the act of killing her Ladd would find joy in his life. For Lua, who had nursed fantasies of this one-way cycle all this time, Ladd's death would mean the destruction of her world. She was a fanatical believer and martyr of her own world, in a somewhat different sense from Claire--after all, her world was part of the larger whole of Ladd.

 Lua has a kind of sixth sense in the novels, or rather an intuition that proves eerily accurate at times. 

Bonus LN trivia: Ladd [was](/s "close to another girl before Lua. Her name was Leila.")

Before Jacuzzi arrives to Nice (and Nick, I guess), Goose points his gun at Nick and forces Nice to put all her remaining explosives (a dozen or s) in front of her. Then Goose smacks her. 

> Bastard! Nick roared, and took out his knife.

> *Bang!*

> At the sound of the gunshot, blood splattered from Nicks raised arm.

> ArghAgh!

> Silence, you piece of shit.

> Goose mercilessly put the gun to Nicks head. 

Its then that Jacuzzi bursts in. 

Claire tied a simple magic trick of a knot for the noose around Luas neck. It comes unraveled instantly. Ladd fell for a clever trap, poor bastard. 

Ladd actually thinks about his engagement ring as his fingers are flying off. 

> In the force of the movement Ladd saw his [left ring finger](http://imgur.com/EWcfWyv) flying off. Even as they fell he desperately tried to pull the ropes off Lua's neck, but it was no use. The knot was too difficult.

> 'Damn it. Some engagement ring I'll need after this.' Ladd thought, as his right hand, glistening with his own blood, began slipping. The rope instantly grew taut and threatened to tighten its coil around Lua's neck.

And then: 

> Lua struggled to get under Ladd, in order to try and protect him from the incoming impact.

> *'Stop acting like someone else, Lua. Don't look at me with eyes so full of life. You're making me want to kill you now, dammit.*  Ladd thought, his consciousness growing dimmer by the second.

Holy crap do I love [this scene](http://imgur.com/5ESLDQR) with [John and Fang.](http://imgur.com/nux5QCU) They are such a great duo, honestly they are. (By the way, only their guns are loaded). 

Rachels incredible, managing to hold onto a rope while clinging to the side of a moving train with an injured leg. 

I really wanted to make a stitch photo of Maiza when his [kneecaps](http://imgur.com/ofjACOR) are blown out but I failed. ~~if someone does this Ill be very happy~~ Ah well, here are some screenshots. Poor Maiza. Szilard [broke his wrist](http://imgur.com/u6v03Q3), [shoots out his kneecaps](http://imgur.com/xng4E8u), and relentlessly insults him. I cant believe how *stupid* you are, Maiza youre worth even less than that insect and he witnessed all his fellow camorristas gunned down by the man whos devoured his brother and friends. All because he wants Maizas knowledge.

Ennis has this weird warped impression of Szilard in the LNs. Its interesting when were in her perspective. 



Bonus! [Little Czes and slightly younger Maiza at what I think is the Avaro manor during a party in1705? 1710, maybe.](http://s797.photobucket.com/user/benachr/media/1710/bwscan2.png.html)

Damn, son. Poor Nick.

Nice catch. I didn't notice. I guess it just seemed like another nearby body at a quick glance.

> but perhaps a better way to think of it would be that the characters werent cuteverything thats happening in the LNs is happening in the anime, just off-screen.

This is sort of what I've been doing, and it's one reason I really enjoy reading your posts.

> Claire tied a simple magic trick of a knot for the noose around Luas neck. It comes unraveled instantly. Ladd fell for a clever trap, poor bastard.

After reading everyone's comments and learning that Claire's not actually making shit happen because he's magic or whatever, I love that scene even more. I thought it was cool when he pulled the rope back, but knowing now that he just tied a fancy knot that comes undone is even better. Poor Ladd.

So I finished Attack on Titan. Please, if you were even remotely interested in it and still havent watched it, do.

For Baccano!, could someone explain ahead of time: Does the series end at episode 13, and then the OVAs are extra? Or are the OVAs considered part of the series? If its the latter, why is that? Anime seems to have a really strange way of listing its series/episodes. Example; a lot of anime break off season 2 into a technically different series, e.g., Sword Art Online, Sword Art Online II.

**--- Episode 11 - Chane Laforet Remains Silent in the Face of Two Mysterious People ---**

Isaac and Miria are allowed downstairs? Just like that?

[Heartwarming.](http://i.imgur.com/NEiCeha.jpg)

Ladd falls from the ceiling. He really doesn't look like he should be, but he's agile.

Haha, The Rail Tracer just sits next to Czeslaw. Ah, good lucking killing him.

["Right?" ... "Yeah, that's right."](http://i.imgur.com/xsFuios.jpg)

Glad they didn't drag out the Ladd/Chane fight. Chane just climbs right back up.

Oh shit The Rail Tracer. Will he kill them?

Szilard mowing 'em down.

This is such an interesting meeting on top of the train.

[Fantastic edit back to Szilard/Maiza.](https://a.pomf.cat/ojkjjs.mp4)

"I'm not that smart." Yeah, me either, Firo.

Poor Czes. He trusted that guy.

Gandors gonna help Eve?

**--- Episode 12 - Firo and the Three Gandor Brothers Are Felled by Assassins' Bullets ---**

Be more professional, Nicholas. You jerk.

Jacuzzi. Seriously. One hell of a man. Go save your girl.

Glad the Gandors are getting some action. They're cool guys.

Oh bam, Szilard! Driven by Isaac or Miria?

Ok, Just who the fuck is Claire? The world is his dream?

Poor Czes. Ugh, that guy really turned out to be a sick prick.

Seriously tearing up a tiny bit because of how loving/caring/genuinely nice Isaac and Miria are. They barely know Czes, but still risk their lives to save him. [Bit long, but it's one of my favorite scenes so far.](https://a.pomf.cat/rblums.mp4) The blood in the beginning is like Czeslaw's tears. T_T

Lua, what *are* you doing up there?

[Shirt bomb, you're so dreamy!](http://www.gfycat.com/VapidCheeryDove)

Great voice work in the car. Yes! It was Isaac and Miria who ran them over! In the same car that ran them over. Ha.

So Claire really can just materialize anything. Wtf? Why? And I really don't get why Lua wants to die. I get why Ladd loves her so this scene was a pretty big moment for him. I love how Claire just takes the rope back.

Nice keeps a bomb in her eye hole? Gross. Jacuzzi, be a naughty boy.

Damn, Rachel attempts to save Isaac, Miria, and Czeslaw. What a hero she really is. Oh now Claire is saving them. He's really a good guy. The way he's been setting things up, watching all of this play out is so satisfying.

Firo's still "dead."

Maiza nooooo!

I wonder how the conversation will go between Isaac, Miria, and Czeslaw. I imagine Isaac has no idea that he can absorb other immortals. Hell, he still might not even know that he is immortal, though I think he might. Czeslaw is going to be afraid of him or try to absorb him even. Gonna be a fun scene.

So Claire, The Rail Tracer, Vino, whatever, I'm really liking him now. I don't know if there's any truth to the whole "the world is my dream" thing, but hell, there's a whole bunch of other weird stuff going on so why not? He's like a fucking god at this point. Kills people with ease, materializes objects by thinking them, and sets up events so others can do the work themselves.

[no spoilers, just speculation](/s "Ennis won't kill Isaac and Miria. She'll instead distract Szilard for a moment, and Maiza will be forced to absorb him.")

Still unsure how Firo is going to get his hands on the formula. Can giving it to him after he's been killed still bring him back? I guess we'll find out. And I'd still like him to be the one to absorb Szilard, but I'm not sure that'll happen. How would Firo even know how to do that?

[oooooooooohhhhh](/s "What if Ennis tells Isaac and Miria to be quiet. She sneaks up on Szilard while he's monologuing to Maiza. She's got the jump on him, and she's the one to absorb Szilard.")

* Isaac: \*pats Czes on the head* You're safe now!

* Czes screams and tries to devour him. 

Yep, it'll be fun. 

[Reply to your speculation](/s "It would be great to have Ennis be the one to absorb Szilard, especially since he's been treating her like dirt. But she mentioned that she can sense his thoughts, so it might work the other way as well. Really hope that she or Maiza can take him out soon.")

> Isaac: *pats Czes on the head* You're safe now!

Hahahaha! I can see that happening.

The speculation stuff: You're right. I do think Szilard has to die though. I guess we'll see tomorrow how/if it happens.

> So I finished Attack on Titan. Please, if you were even remotely interested in it and still havent watched it, do.

I saw it when it was first airing back in 2013, before it exploded into the mainstream. I thought it was a good show. Not amazing but not bad either. It's a great show to get into anime, though, I'll give you that.
>> ARTICLE
> I thought it was a good show. Not amazing but not bad either.

This is more or less what I thought too. AoT was very good, but definitely had a few flaws that kept it from being incredible. It caused me to reevaluate the way I've rated some shows. But besides just talking critically about it, it was an absolute blast to watch.

The series basically ends next episode, and 14-16 are more a preview of the next arc in the LNs that were unfortunately never animated.

> Isaac and Miria are allowed downstairs? Just like that?

Well, they did almost kill Isaac.

> Fantastic edit back to Szilard/Maiza.

Wow, we posted almost exactly the same clip. (But with me making a clip of *everything*, I guess it's not too unlikely.)

> Ok, Just who the fuck is Claire? The world is his dream?

He's stronger than you.

> Seriously tearing up a tiny bit because of how loving/caring/genuinely nice Isaac and Miria are. They barely know Czes, but still risk their lives to save him.

That's one of the reasons people love them so much. They're so genuinely nice and decent people. No wonder Claire immediately saves them.

> So Claire really can just materialize anything. Wtf? Why?

It's not really that. It's more that he's so intelligent and agile that it *appears* that he can just do whatever he wants. Even he's convinced that he can.

> And I really don't get why Lua wants to die.

The LN just explains it as, "Lua wanted to be murdered. So much that even she had forgotten the reason." So even she doesn't really know why she wants to be killed. She just knows she wants Ladd to be the cause of it.

> I don't know if there's any truth to the whole "the world is my dream" thing, but hell, there's a whole bunch of other weird stuff going on so why not?

I don't know if I like that or not. Ladd's point of view makes sense, but hers doesn't. She can't remember why she wants to die? That's just, eh, boring? I don't know. Maybe if the LNs eventually get into a little back story on her then it'd work out, but if she really doesn't know, that's lame.

Actually, it was Billy the Kid.
>> ARTICLE
Eps 14-16 aren't actually from the next arc, they're from LN...14? I think? I'm pretty sure that's when Graham first appears in the novels. 

There are a lot of arcs. I don't know the exact number, but let's see...

LN 1 - "The Rolling Bootlegs" - covers the events in 1930.

LNs 2 and 3 cover the Flying Pussyfoot in 1931-32.

LN 4 - "Drugs & the Dominoes" - covers the events that happen in 1932, with Dallas and Eve and the drugs and the Daily Days. Big plotline from this LN cut from the anime. 

LN 5 - "The children of [the] Bottle" - is a stand alone arc set in 2001 (this one is the most like an action movie out of all the novels). Deals with the 1711 immortals Maiza, Czes, Sylvie and Nile as they investigate a suspiciously medieval village in the mountains (and try to figure out what hand Elmer has in all of this). 

LNs 6 and 7 cover the Slash (aka the Mist Wall) arc. (I need this one be animated. I need this one animated ASAP, it's just too good).

LNs 8-9 (and 10?? can't remember?) cover the Alice in Jails arcs. (10 covers the Peter Pan in Chains arc). Also fantastic. 

LNs 11 (The Ironic Light Orchestra), 15 (Crack Flag), and 17 (Whitesmile) cover events that happen in 1705, 1710, and 1711. Very tricky stuff, and very enlightening when it comes to certain characters (especially Huey, but also Elmer and Maiza and Fermet).

LNs 12 and 13 are the Bullet Garden and Blood Sabbath arcs.

**Edit** - The rest of them:

LN 14 (thanks /u/accordionheart for affirmation)- "Another Junk Railroad" returns to the year 1931 and is the novel that the OVAs are adapted from (mostly).

LN 16 - "Summer - Man in the Killer" is set in 1932 and recounts how the serial killer "Ice Pick Thompson" is terrorizing the people of New York.

LNs 18 (Deep Marble 1935-A) and 19 (Dr. Feelgreed 1935-B) are set in 1935 and bring back characters introduced in the first four novels, and from what I remember these are the LNs that start hinting at a looming big showdown.

LN 20 "Winter - the time of the Oasis" is *again* set in 1931, which clearly must have been a helluva year. New characters. Lots of them. I can barely keep them straight (this is one I really need to reread). 

LN 21 - (1935-C, The Grateful Bet) is as you can see back to 1935. Big things happening. Read it so long ago I barely remember it.

14 is Another Junk Railroad, so you're right! There's also a couple of scenes from [1932](/s "with the dominos"), but that's fairly insignificant. And some anime only scenes, iirc!

How the heck was there never a second season of this show? Did it just not do well when it aired? Too confusing for most people? It seems now that everybody loves it so I've gotta wonder what the heck happened.

The DVDs apparently never sold that well in Japan. :(
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know, the DVD sales in Japan for Baccano! were pretty sub-par. I think someone also said that Baccano! aired on a less well-known channel at a dubious time slot (not sure whether this info is correct). 

I guess Japan just isn't too interested in 1930s America. Not their cup of tea. (It might have also been too confusing). 

Now, Durarara has gotten two new seasons, so it's more popular in Japan than Baccano!. I had hoped that with the new seasons Baccano! would get more attention (Durarara makes several [references](https://www.google.com/search?q=durarara+baccano+cameo&hl=en&biw=1280&bih=370&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMI-7Hpn_yDxwIVy5eACh3rWAA1) to Baccano!, with Isaac and Miria making cameos in the show more than once) and somehow, somehow it'd be popular enough to warrant at least one more season, but alas, so far no dice. 

Though I am wondering why they suddenly decided to license the light novels. Is this a good sign? I hope so, but to be honest I don't think the Western market has any influence on the Japanese one.

#Thoughts on the Episodes:
Episode 11:

Soo Vino is a really brutal guy, poor Czes he had a really rough childhood, fucking Fermet how could you do something like that to a child? 

Episode 12:

I don't know why but I really love Vinos worldview, and he is really overpowered, atleast he isn't immortal. Also I really don't understand Lua could be her definition of romance to have boyfriend who wants to kill you one day...

Why did the sentence: "your gonna throw yourself off this train" 
remind me a bit of Joseph Joestar?

And Nice just looks so cute when she's "admiring" the sound of explosions :3  
damn you Nick stop spoiling Nices fun.

I love it too. It's so fascinating, and after seeing some of the things he's capable of doing, can you really blame him for thinking he's a divine being? And just imagine if he *did* become immortal...

> I really don't understand Lua could be her definition of romance to have boyfriend who wants to kill you one day...

Because she also *really* wants to be murdered. So much so and so much by Ladd, that she's willing to risk her life for him.

I doubt he's going to die too. He just seems like someone who needs to stay alive.

Prelude: [Episode 10 Preview](https://a.pomf.cat/gvnqdo.mp4)

Episode 11

* [I didnt know Isaac and Miria were Irish.](http://i.imgur.com/Gl1iRkA.jpg)

* [HOLY SHIT!](https://a.pomf.cat/mmainr.mp4) CHARACTERS THAT ACTUALLY ASK QUESTIONS!

* [So smooth.](https://a.pomf.cat/ndlevk.mp4)

* [The guys almost as limber as Claire.](https://a.pomf.cat/kzsphe.mp4) Almost.

* [Ive been here this whole time. How bad is your peripheral vision?](http://i.imgur.com/9o7fwrG.jpg)

* Why did Claire suddenly lose a lot of the blood that he was originally drenched so thoroughly in that he at one point looked like a blob of red smoke?

* I love how Claires just like, [I know you cant die, but trying to kill the other passengers was a dick move, so enjoy getting strangled.](https://a.pomf.cat/pqxgck.mp4)

* [Ladd is such a good ventriloquist.](https://a.pomf.cat/cuggef.mp4)

* [Lets hope you can get ahold of some immortality elixir then if you wanna chance, pal.](https://a.pomf.cat/ntuxsc.mp4)

* [Hes right.](https://a.pomf.cat/fslkoq.mp4) That always seems to be the catch for any immortal in fiction. Youd think whatever method they used to become immortal would be nice enough to include painlessness.

* You know, Ladd sure was quick to believe the whole immortal story.

* [Seriously, Ive been here the WHOLE time!](http://i.imgur.com/MItr9nL.jpg) Does nobody use their eyes?!

* [Lia:](https://a.pomf.cat/dqjmoa.mp4) I dont care if we was immortal. You idiots are paying for those glasses.

* [IS EVERYONE IN THIS SHOW THE SUAVEST MOTHERFUCKER EVER?!](https://a.pomf.cat/agyepr.mp4)

* [Everyone is buying the immortality story surprisingly quickly.](https://a.pomf.cat/vynkon.mp4) Yeah, its true, but Id probably ask for a bit more evidence. Just a little.

* [Firo acting for the audience very well there.](https://a.pomf.cat/xpbych.mp4) And Szilard pretty much forces all his children to obey him by mentally holding them at gun-point. Prick.

* [Wait, they dont?](https://a.pomf.cat/kxwueo.mp4) Huh, I guess my dad and I need to have a talk.

* Why is Szilard so determined to get *these* bottles of the formula? Now that he knows how to make it, cant he just gather the necessary materials and make more himself?

* [Claire.](https://a.pomf.cat/tacwnx.mp4) Always planning ahead.

* Remember in episode seven with Czes said [this](https://a.pomf.cat/bihdjw.mp4) about Fermet? [Yeah.](http://i.imgur.com/YCQxi83.jpg)

* [Always planning ahead.](https://a.pomf.cat/xhmljm.mp4)

* [Remember why Claire is doing this.](https://a.pomf.cat/fcisqv.mp4) He considers it Czesaws just reward for trying to convince Ladd to kill the train passengers. His methods of justice are barbaric, but in his mind they make sense.

* [The guy on the left just watched Highschool of the Dead, and is expecting too much.](https://a.pomf.cat/cnfjzw.mp4)

* [The President already said, girl, dramatic tension!](https://a.pomf.cat/bgmzqj.mp4) Also, sorry, /u/Neawia, that your Eve is immortal theory was a bust. I admit that it was intriguing to think about, but in the end her supposed immortality was just the result of Japanese animators being a bunch of loli-lovers. (But, then again, whos not, right? Right?)

The philosophy that only you are sure to exist and everything else is just a figment of your imagination is actually such a popular idea that it has its own name: solipsism.

Good point. Perhaps he doesn't want anyone else to have access to the perfect formula.

You bum! What if she doesn't know she's immortal? Are you trying to throw me off the trail again? Don't tell me if you are.

Is that what we're supposed to believe? I don't know. I can't be sure anymore. There's a chance Claire is telling the truth, but it's also likely he's just crazy.

Oh god, how awful.
>> ARTICLE
> There's a chance Claire is telling the truth, but it's also likely he's just crazy.

Seeing as how we're this late in, I think I'll just explain that Claire is just crazy. CRAZY AWESOME, but still crazy. However, his idea that he is the creator of reality makes him such a unique and intriguing character to watch. I love him.

There's actually a scene in a later section of the LN where a guy tells him that he must be grateful that God blessed him with such extraordinary abilities of agility, strength, and stamina. Claire actually gets insulted and says something along the lines of, "Blessed? You think I just happened to be born with my skills? No, *I* thought up God, and *made* Him give my abilities!" Then he shanks the guy.

Yeah, Claire actually does get offended if someone tells him something along the lines of 'wow you were lucky to be born with such talent' (like artists and writers today who hear this sort of thing) and he always snaps at them, "do you have any idea how much work I put into this?"

I managed to miss the big reveal yesterday, but I'm back again!


Claire's philosophy is just a really extreme form of solipsism. But I think it's a pretty interesting view for a character to have, and I especially enjoy his speech about how "mercy and compassion are virtues that only the strong are allowed to possess", even if I think he's wrong. And of course, the moment when he makes Ladd throw himself off the train. 


"Could this be my punishment? ...For having devoured him?" Oh Czes. I started liking Czes back in episode 10, when I realised just how devious he is. But these two episodes made me love him. He has a super tragic backstory, and really just...fuck Fermet. [](/s "Seriously.") Czes also has the memories of Fermet torturing him...which makes his trust issues super understandable. Poor kid. 


Rachel is such a hero, saving the Beriams by smashing the window, then rescuing Nice and Nick, and then trying to save Isaac and Miria, and Czes.. I really like Rachel, because she's just an ordinary girl, who is theoretically just an information broker, just there to observe...and yet she manages to be one of the most heroic people on board the Flying Pussyfoot, just with a little knowledge of trains. Good job, Rachel!


Jacuzzi is also a little bit of a hero here, running in and saving Nice at the right moment, and then climbing on top of the train to face Goose. Good job, Jacuzzi! And let's give some credit to Isaac and Miria for risking their lives (er, sort of) for Czes, someone they barely know.  


Aaaand...everything is going down in 1930. I love the moment where Isaac & Miria run over everyone in the car, and then hit Szilard. And if you didn't hate Szilard enough, him calling Ennis a "useless piece of garbage" is pretty terrible. What a terrible "father"!

*Fuck Fermet so much.* 

He's even more despicable in the LNs. Eurgh. The 18th century arcs, oh man oh man oh man. 

Plus, the fact that [he's](/s "still ALIVE. The only way I can see how, after he was 'devoured' multiple times is that he's a homunculus, which is the fan theory that makes the most sense. Plus, Firo remembers this one line from Fermet's memory, something like 'we are many' or 'one is more' or something like that.")

Eh, well, actually, the timelines each have their own book. I mean, occasionally within a light novel he'll jump back a day or so, like he does when he cuts to Chicago, 10 hours, prior, but...yeah, the non-linear thing was all the anime. 

Though, there's so much shit going down in the light novels that it's impressive enough he can keep all the characters and events straight.

Some of my favorite moments from these two episodes:

**Ep 11 - Chane can't reply you without her birds**

* [Are they drinking the elixir?](http://i.imgur.com/2TgaIlg.png) 

* [Firo x Ennis, yaaass.](http://i.imgur.com/fqOEzaT.png)

* [Jacuzzi (and Donny) save the day!](http://i.imgur.com/Xlulo3P.png)

* [What happened to your awesome knife-fighting skills, Maiza?](http://i.imgur.com/l4s9LXj.png) 

**Ep 12 - These titles are so spoilery**

* [No wonder he's so messed up, poor Czes.](http://i.imgur.com/v4EzG1U.png)

* [If anyone can thaw him out, it's these two](http://i.imgur.com/LVGto6e.png)

* [Nice really likes bombs](http://i.imgur.com/mylGO1i.png)

* It's funny how Vino uses ropes to both [rescue people](http://i.imgur.com/MS8QMPW.png) and [throw them off the train](http://i.imgur.com/HKxjdCJ.png).  

* [Poetic justice](http://i.imgur.com/kIowmJA.png) 

[Speculation](/s "Maiza knew Szilard was at the restaurant (and even poured a drink for him). He's just pretending to be weak to lower Szilard's guard.")
>> ARTICLE
I like your speculation. Maiza's a smart guy. I think we should expect a little more from him.
>> ARTICLE
Czeslaw had a really bad immortalhood it seems. So much so that he doesn't even trust his friends. And yet, even then Claire is able to scare him- he and Ramsay Snow would get along alarmingly well it seems. 

Szilard killed 18 immortals during the last 200 years, I wonder how many died aboard the ship? 

Also [spoilers?](/s " I could've sworn during one of the earlier episodes seeing Maiza and Firo get gunned down in a book shop, and then they recover...So Firo doesn't die does he? At least the Gandors are gonna be alright, they're chill dudes.") 
>> ARTICLE
> Szilard killed 18 immortals during the last 200 years

I was a little confused about this. Maiza had said Szilard killed 13 of his "friends," and then Szilard say it was more like 18. So are they specifically referring to Maiza's friends, the people aboard the ship maybe, or has Szilard actually only killed 18 people in 200 years? I thought he'd have a much higher kill count by now.
>> ARTICLE
We don't really know whom Maiza would consider his "closest friends." I agree that Szilard likely killed many more than 18 people in 200 years, but were ALL those 18 people immortals? Or maybe Szilard has been hunting Maiza for 200 years, and during his hunt, he killed some normal people who became closely associated with Maiza, like Firo.
>> ARTICLE
I interpreted it as Szilard had hunted down five more of the immortals from the ship over the last 200 years, but yeah it was pretty vague.
>> ARTICLE
I think they're referring only to those who were on board the Advenna Avis. There were about 30 of them, and Szilard has killed 18 - which is a pretty high proportion. He probably would have killed more, but most of the survivors have been on the lookout for him for the past 200 years and have been hiding. 
>> ARTICLE
The scene you're remembering was actually Firo and Luck Gandor.  If I recall correctly, it happened in 1932 and it's why Gustavo and his goons were so surprised to see Luck alive when they paid the Gandors a visit.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh...understood.
>> ARTICLE
I have no clue how the OVA's tie into the main series, but it seems like we're rocketing right to the conclusion of our 3 arcs in 1930, 1931, and 1932.  Maybe more the first two.

**Ep. 11:**

* Ladd is a lot stronger than I thought.  Szilard is *also* stronger than I thought, to get Maiza like he did.  Firo, too, or else Ennis let herself be taken off-guard because she doesn't want to hurt him.  They both wiped the floor with Dallas and his goons individually, so that's a wash...

* So the Gandors *do* know where Dallas is.  And even Isaac and Miria discount Berga and Keith.

**Ep. 12:**

* Hot diggity, it's Sugarcube!  [I was right again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3f2tdc/spoilers_baccano_episodes_9_10_rewatch_discussion/ctkufuo)

* Poor Czeslaw.  Fermet was some kind of bastard.  Getting cut trying to rescue Czeslaw is a nice way to confirm Isaac's immortality, even though Episode 1 showed it anyway.  Rachel and Vino (and Donny) each doing their part to rescue our favorite blonde duo was neat.

* Szilard, you are a terrible person and you somehow deserve to be under that car more than Dallas.  

No real speculation this time.  Go Team Bomberman!  (Really, Nice is probably my favorite alongside Ennis and just ahead of Isaac/Miria.)
>> ARTICLE
> Hot diggity, it's Sugarcube! I was right again.

Damn fine work.

Also:

> I have no clue how the OVA's tie into the main series

I was wondering this too and /u/The-Sublimer-One and /u/Revriley1 explained it:

> The series basically ends next episode, and 14-16 are more a preview of the next arc in the LNs that were unfortunately never animated.

> Eps 14-16 aren't actually from the next arc, they're from LN...14? I think?

>> ARTICLE
Aha, I see.  That does sound neat.  Looking forward to it!
>> ARTICLE
Just finished watching episodes 9 and 10 while on two different trains.

Bad idea, especially during the early morning before sunrise. And even worse when in the cab car (which is usually the back).
>> ARTICLE
How much more do the light novels go and are they worth it?
>> ARTICLE
/u/Revriley1 posted some stuff about the LNs [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3f7i6n/spoilers_baccano_episodes_11_12_rewatch/ctm1tbe) I can't personally say if they're worth it or not since I haven't read them.
>> ARTICLE
Hallo, I see that /u/Neawia has mentioned me in passing; you rang?

Well, there are 21 LNs published so far (I don't know many Narita's planning on writing in total). 

The anime covers LNs #1 (1930 arc), #2-#3 (1931 Flying Pussyfoot arc), and LN #4 (1932);

The OVAs/eps 14-16 deal with LN #14 (also set in 1931) mostly, with elements from another LN. 

So indeed, the light novels cover a lot of ground. A lot. Neawia linked you to a post in which I talk about a few of the arcs (I should edit that with the rest of the LNs), which give you an idea of the scope the LNs cover.

Are they worth it? Well, I'm obviously quite biased as I'd answer that with a resounding 'yes'. If I try to be slightly more impartial, well...honestly, if you're invested in these characters, if you're well and truly interested in this premise and want to see not only what happens in future years but you want to learn more about what happened in the past, the LNs really are worth the read.

There are the 1705, 1710 and 1711 arcs which give you insight into the events of Lotto Valentino, and into the histories of some of the 2nd generation 1711 immortals (*especially* Huey, Elmer, and Maiza but not only them), while introducing you to the older (first, I presume) generation of immortals from the 1300s-1400s. 

You've got the arcs that delve into what happens in the years immediately following the anime, 1934-1935, such as the bloodbath at the Mist Wall, and you've got arcs set in the modern day--the 2001 arc is like an action movie, starring Maiza, Czes, Nile and Sylvie as they investigate a suspiciously medieval village and what Elmer's got to do with it all...

...the 2002 arc set on a yacht [where (major major spoilers for characters' futures)](/s "Firo and Ennis, accompanied by Czes, are on their honeymoon. The yacht is also where Claire and Chane's great-grandchildren Claudia and Charon Walken are filming a movie, and Jacuzzi and Nice's descendant Bobby Splot is leading a gang of ragtag misfit children stowaways, and where Sample (a group designed to act like the cult that tortured Elmer 300 years prior) makes their move").

I'd even recommend reading the first four novels because the anime cuts out a major plotline from the 1932 arc and several important characters that show up later in the LNs. 

If you or anybody else is interested in the LNs please message me; I'll be happy to help out! (At least four people have contacted me already about them). 

**Postscript:** I'm thinking that for the last Baccano! rewatch thread it might be nice if I revealed what happens to the cast after the anime (spoiler tagged if desired) for those who don't plan on reading the LNs and are interested in finding out what happens. I guess it would have to be the 15 + 16 thread, but I'm kind of hoping there'll be a separate thread for thoughts on the entire series as a whole...seeing as my contributions to the 15+16 thread would be uncomfortably long. Opinions? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm considering heavily picking up the LNs, but I'd definitely be interested in you filling us in on what happens to the characters after the end of the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Well, as I said, if anyone's at all interested in reading the light novels please don't hesitate to message me. So far five people have contacted me about where they can read them and I'm absolutely here for more LN readers. 

(You should definitely read them). 

I mean, a lot happens after the anime, I mean a lot, but I figure I can give people some sort of idea of what the characters go on to immediately do and what their lives are like 70 odd years into the future. I just don't know if this particular info would be taking up too much space in the 15+16 thread. It might have to though. 
>> ARTICLE
So there hasn't been any word on whether we'll have another thread to talk about the series as a whole, then?
>> ARTICLE
> (I don't know many Narita's planning on writing in total).


I think 1935 is going to be the last 30s arc, and then Narita is going to write an arc in 2003 - so that probably translates to about 3 more books, maybe more? He could change his mind, of course, but that's what he's been suggesting. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree that I'd like to see a final post for a full series discussion. Perhaps we should vote on it. Let's just call in /u/angel10701. Whenever you answer is fine, and maybe we'll inquire tomorrow as well.

Well, you should know by now that I love your posts. I would read everything. All of the bonus information is interesting, and you present it coherently. We are late in this thread, so perhaps ask everyone tomorrow, though I don't know why anyone would turn down such an offer.

And I'll likely be asking about the LNs myself, but not yet. I'll wait til the rewatch is over.
>> ARTICLE
All am thinking is, can't wait for next episode :D
>> ARTICLE
We're heading towards the end... Luckily all the LNs are fan-translated, with the official translations forthcoming.

That rope scene is probably my favorite part of the entire anime.

Okay, first-timer here, and I have a question for people who've already gone through the series: Should I watch the dub or the sub?

Usually I'd watch the sub for shows, but apparently Baccano's dub is regarded as one of the best dubs ever (As-in, equal to or above Cowboy Bebop-tier).
>> ARTICLE
I'm a sub-only kind of guy. In all my years watching anime, I've yet to see a single series where the original japanese dub was inferior to the english dub. No matter how you put it, the anime is still tailored to the japanese VA talent. The English voice actors are replacements, they're like a U2 coverband. For every good one there is, there's 10 bad ones, and even that one good band is still going to be inferior to the real deal. I'm not saying English VA's are necessarily bad (Pixar movies for example have some great voice acting), they're just not suited to dub anime, because it's not meant for them to be its VA. Cultural differences are too big, what sounds good in Japanese comes over as cringeworthy overacting most of the time in English.

My rant about dubs aside, Baccano definitely has one of the better english dubs out there, which has a lot to do with the setting of the series. So if you don't mind your average english dub, then you're definitely going to like the Baccano dub. Whether or not it's better than the original is still something I'd contest though.

Edit: Ofcourse I get downvoted, because for whatever mystery reason criticising dubs is a really touchy subject.
>> ARTICLE
I think one of the best dubs out there is the School Rumble dub. Some of the jokes came across better not being read but heard. Otherwise I agree with you about subs being preferred.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's for "whatever" reason. Most of the time, English VAs put just as much effort into their lines as the Japanese VAs do, and sometimes even more (Dragonball is a good example). I'm not saying that you're wrong that anime is originally made to be spoken in Japanese, but to outright dismiss *all* dubs as inferior is where I'd say you are mistaken.

For a good example of a dub that's much better than the sub, I'd recommend you watch Ghost Stories. The sub was bland and uninspired and just flat-out boring. The dub added a *lot* of humor and life to the show that just wasn't there originally, and the English VAs all did a stellar job.
>> ARTICLE
No I'm not dismissing all dubs as inferior, I'm saying that there is a trend where every dub I've seen has been inferior to the original. I have not seen Ghost Stories, so I have to take your word on it, but I'm not going to bother with deciding between sub or dub everytime I watch a series, when from experience none have managed to be up to par, let alone impress me. An example is Code Geass, I was told that Code Geass had one of the best english dubs out there. Yet I couldn't make it even two episodes in. As for Dragonball, I think that's not a great example because it has very little to do with quality. Dragonball is a long running series that a lot of us grew up with watching. And as it was aired on national television, it was aired with the english dub. We've just grown accustomed to it.

Also I'm not saying that the english VA's don't put any effort into their lines, it is their job after all. I'm saying they just aren't as good as the original simply because the original was tailored to the anime. Think of it like an american television show where halfway through the second season they replace the cast with Japanese actors playing the exact same characters. Japanese actors have a completely different style of acting that doesn't fit into western television. Is their acting therefore worse? No the role simply does not suit their style.

Lastly, I don't think my criticism is unfair. I'm not blindly bashing english dubs, nor am I telling other people they shouldn't watch the dubs if it pleases them. I'm using solid argumentation as to why I strongly dislike english dubs based on experiences with dozens of anime series.
>> ARTICLE
> I was told that Code Geass had one of the best english dubs out there. Yet I couldn't make it even two episodes in

That's weird. Johnny Yong Bosch as Lelouch is probably one of the greatest casting choices I've ever heard. But, hey. Preferences.
>> ARTICLE
People on this sub think you're a weeb if you only watch subs, but to be honest, even as a new anime watcher I feel that subs are pretty much always superior. Because it's made to be spoken in Japanese, dubs will inevitably feel awkward at points, either because they have to speak at an unnatural pace or use strange words/sentence structure to match the mouths of the characters. I would rather watch it with natural feeling voices even if I can't understand the language.
>> ARTICLE
I don't disagree with that. I'm just saying that not all dubs should be immediately disregarded.
>> ARTICLE
I went for the sub. I've seen clips from the dub and in my opinion they're not as good, although I might just be biased because I felt the characters didn't fit with different voice. All I can say for sure is that the sub's voices are fantastic. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching the dub this time since I've seen the sub a couple of times.


I wonder how Miria and Isaac will do their thing.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely dub.
>> ARTICLE
OK thanks :)
>> ARTICLE
Yes I would definitely say that it is worth watching the dub, all of the characters do different accents based on where in the US they are supposed to be from and it is very enjoyable to hear IMO.
>> ARTICLE
My first time watching it was sub. I tried switching to dub in the middle and switched right back because Isaac and Miria duo didn't sound as fun. I'll do this rewatch on dub and stick with it this time. (Except for episode 8)
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I will try it subbed this time then... good luck with the dub! Personally I think the whole Isaac Miria thing is one of the best parts of the entire dub but maybe that's just me.
>> ARTICLE
the dubs are definitely better than the subs if your main language is English. That said, I like subs better and I think the voices for most of the casts in japanese have a lot of character. You can probably watch the dubbed episode 1 first and when you rewatch it, because you'll probably do it after watching more episodes, you can try the other way.

And Isaac and Miria were responsible for that scene with Maiza, too. If they hadn't convinced Czes to stop being paranoid, he likely would have tried to devour Maiza.

So /u/revriley1 had the idea of showing what happened to the characters after the original airing of Baccano!, which would be the continuation of the Light Novels. So, I'm here, ask you guys, on whether you want a separate post a day after the last couple of episodes and discuss the show as a whole, as well as /u/revriley1 to give us on some *juicy* info of what happened afterwords.

I was thinking of doing a strawpoll, but decided against it as I want everyone's opinion on the matter.

YES YES YES! I've been really enjoying the LN commentary. I actually didn't know that there were LN's for Baccano, so those are definitely what I'm picking up as soon as I can.

* Am I the only one mentally adding a Claire Stanfield name card every time I see him in the OP?

* [Eh, itll be fine.](http://i.imgur.com/rYprN8B.jpg) Just ice it a little.

* [Chane:](https://a.pomf.cat/txbahu.mp4) Did you listen in on my telepathic conversation?

* Claire: Yes.

* [Claire apparently just watched Beetlejuice.](https://a.pomf.cat/lpmgox.mp4)

* After seeing some of the stuff this guys pulled off, [you sort of have to at least consider his viewpoint.](https://a.pomf.cat/sqpvca.mp4)

* This is probably the most title-like [title](http://i.imgur.com/J0ub0Gu.png) weve gotten so far.

* [Son of a bitch, this guys awesome.](https://a.pomf.cat/xwiybb.mp4) Even when he was a little kid.

* [Well, youd be sort of right.](https://a.pomf.cat/lysjfj.mp4) It is a direct result of the Rail Tracer.

* [Is everyone in this show the coolest person ever?!](https://a.pomf.cat/amfdwg.mp4)

* [Its normal that I cant stop smiling, right?](https://a.pomf.cat/pxerfh.mp4)

* [NO ONE IS THIS NICE!](https://a.pomf.cat/oglsee.mp4) STOP BEING SO FUCKING NICE! YOURE MAKING EVERYONE ELSE LOOK BAD!

* [Fuck your dramatic monologue, bitch! Weve got flour!](https://a.pomf.cat/tqstcm.mp4)

* Chalk [this whole thing](https://a.pomf.cat/xiyhxt.mp4) up as one big FUCK YEAH! moment. Seeing that all come together is *so* cathartic and satisfying. Not sure why it took them so long to get up, though. I guess realizing that youre not dead for the first time can take a few seconds.

* [Claire:](https://a.pomf.cat/eelvhz.mp4) Lol, I aint gonna do nothin. Just felt like trolling ya.

*  [These two really make everyones lives better.](https://a.pomf.cat/rnkdmt.mp4) Again, unless youre a prick like Dallas. And Im sure Elmer would love Miria for that last line.

* [A HAPPY ENDING THAT ISNT A DEUS EX MACHINA?!](https://a.pomf.cat/kdtvih.mp4) WHAT KIND OF INSANE, TWISTED WORLD ARE WE LIVING IN?!

* [I think Im dying of badass overload.](https://a.pomf.cat/kvkhuz.mp4)

* [Oh, and remember his name card in the OP?](https://a.pomf.cat/nfjrcy.mp4) It was a spoiler all along.

* Eve is way too fucking forgiving. Like, even I wouldnt be so quick to just instantly clear my brother of all charges if he did something like that.

* [And the badassness has now killed me.](https://a.pomf.cat/xcwngr.mp4) Someone pass me the elixir. (Wait, that doesnt work post-death.)

* [Why do I have the strangest feeling of dj vu?](https://a.pomf.cat/rqjlta.mp4)

* [This](https://a.pomf.cat/xzonts.mp4) is like a really extreme version of buying something for a friend in the train station gift shop.

* [These two](https://a.pomf.cat/mgblpj.mp4) dont give a fuck about physics.

* [Isaac and Miria just saved one of these guys from getting eaten.](https://a.pomf.cat/vxevog.mp4) Think about that.

* [You sneaky magnificent bastards.](https://a.pomf.cat/sucomg.mp4)

* [Thats Ronnie](https://a.pomf.cat/jyuyko.mp4), for anyone whos forgotten. You can recognize him by how he often ends sentences with no matter.

* [And one last redub to close off this arc.](https://a.pomf.cat/okfqfk.mp4)

* [It appears these two liked the seventies so much that they got stuck there.](http://i.imgur.com/FRt0aWL.jpg)

* [One of these things is not like the other.](https://a.pomf.cat/ptccsi.mp4)

* [Can I buy the cake?](https://a.pomf.cat/rymvwl.mp4) I prefer chocolate over vanilla, and no else seems to understand that.

**Episode 13**

Claire even gives her a set of options in the LN:

> "So here we have three choices. You can fight me here and now, or you can hire me and make me your ally with a bit of suspicion, or you could marry me and we can protect Huey together. You got all that?"

> *'Not a word. What is this man thinking?*

> She could not make sense of him. His skills and personality were all completely different from any human being Chane had met before--or perhaps he wasn't human to begin with.

> "I mean, I could probably narrow down the choices to fighting you or getting married, but that just sounds like a threat. Nothing an upstanding man should be saying to a lady. If I did, Keithd cut me outta the family for good.

Well, Keith has a wife, so Id guess hed know. Or maybe he just has good manners for a mafioso. 

In the LNs, its Spike whos sniping them, and he actually manages to shoot Chane's shoulder in the LN.

Chanes not the first woman Claires [proposed](http://imgur.com/eD9oCIP) to. Apparently hes proposed to several women in the past, much to the Gandors exasperation. 

> You rascal, did you say something like marry me again to someone you met the first time?

> Something like that.

> "Something like what, you idiot! How many times do you think you've been dumped?"

 Jacuzzi was prepared to die when he charged at Goose in order to light the cherry bomb. 

The hand-firing mechanism normally is only capable of shooting one shot, but Huey had custom designed it to hold three. After hes 'shot', Jacuzzi rams Goose in the head again and Goose retaliates by jamming his fingers into Jacuzzis wound. 

> He was already prepared for this kind of pain, from the moment he had determined to defeat these people. That was why he would never cry. Ever. 

Jacuzzi understandably thinks all the blood could only be something monstrous, like the Rail Tracer. In fact, the sludge-mass of flesh and blood is, as you soon see, Czes right arm and legs catching up to him.  

Holy crap. I swear, [Nick](http://imgur.com/nG6onDP) is the mouthpiece for the audience at this point.

Alright, hands up, how many people here think Goose Perkins survived falling off the train and the ensuing explosion? As it turns out, [he](/s "does. For a little while, anyway").

When Ennis is holding I&M at knifepoint, she tells them to escape after that old man touches Maizas head. I&M refuse, telling her we have to save Maiza. Why, she asks? Because yesterdayhe invited us to a mealEnnis, hes a good guy!

Szilard has a pretty good one-liner when hes about to devour Maiza. Farewell, Maiza. Andwelcome."

Szilard did indeed create other homunculi (Ennis 'brothers') before Ennis. They all betrayed him, Szilard believes, because they were all derived from his cells alone. When Szilard created Ennis, he (I think) captured a random female and used her raw components when designing Ennis, mixing in his own immortal cells in the process. (his cells make Ennis immortal). Since Szilards cells are part of Ennis, he knew she would betray him as well.

I&M are throwing lumps of pepper at Szilard. 

Firo is more unruffled in the anime than he is in the LN. In the LN, Firo rushes into the alley, calling out (Mr.) Maiza! Are you all right? while pulling Ennis and Maiza far away from Szilard. By this time, the holes in Maizas knees are already half-closed. The reason its taken so long for them to heal is because its the first time theyve been damaged (like this; at least I assume so).

Hey, Maiza? How come killing us didnt make us dead? - Ghost Randy, 1930. The quote of a lifetime. 

I think Narita has a thing about fingers. Firos fingers sliced off in episode 1, Czes fingers bitten off, the Russo goons hand broken by Donny, Ladds fingers burned off, and now Firo slicing off Szilards fingers. What next, Narita? What next? 

When Claire shows up, Jacuzzi whispers to Nice no matter what happens in life, no matter how painful things might be, don't ever cry, Nice, 'Cause I've already cried for you. I can't stand watching you cry, snatches two of the new grenades Nice somehow managed to make in the time since she was tied up, careens into Claire and the two of them roll off the side of the train. The ensuing explosion blows off Nices glasses.

She starts to cry, and then Jacuzzi appears in front of her. Its implied Claire saved his life despite Jacuzzi trying to kill him. Nick and Donny show up, Jacuzzi asks them to take him to Doctor Fredand then he catches sight of his own blood, screams, and faints. 

You *could* say that Ennis is now half-Firo, since when Firo touches his hand to Ennis head he essentially replaces all Szilards cells with his own so that shed live. Whether Firo actually *comprehends* what he did is another matter. 

Firo and Claire and probably others constantly like to say the Gandors arent cut out to be mafiosos (well, mostly they mean Luck but they do include Berga and maybe Keith in that)  

 (admittedly maybe theyre not-in the 1932 they were [trying](/s "to figure out a way to punish Edith for being involved with drugs on their turf (Keith loathes drugs) but they don't want to kill her. Tick suggests cutting her hair because as someone puts it hair is really important to women and he ends up making her hair more stylish than it was before."))

 but you have to admit, shoving [Dallas](http://imgur.com/COibFGP) and his goons into barrels, filling them with cement and throwing them into the river is pretty gruesome. Though, Luck is very protective of his men and will *not* be happy if, say, you gunned them down in cold blood.

 This entire scene just does not happen in the books, though Bartolo killing Gustavo like that was stone-cold ruthless. In reality, the confrontation between Gustavo and Luck (and Eve) is much more amazing. After Gustavo and Luck (& co) exchange words and violence, Gustavo hunts down Eve (who had been hiding with Roy in the apartment) and is about to kill her when Luck clobbers the back of his head with a chair leg and continues to beat him with it. Its in this situation that Eve asks if Dallas is still alive. 

Gustavo, whos somehow still alive, picks up a sofa and throws it at Luck, action stuff, Luck shoots Gustavo six times in fatal areas but hes somehow still fucking alive, Gustavo shatters Lucks ribs by stomping on his chest, more action, Luck tells Eve to run but shes picked up the fallen gun, points it at Gustavo (I cannot forgive him), pulls the trigger but Luck diverts the muzzle at the last second, pointing it at his own hand as he doesnt want her to become a murderer. Luck scoops up his left hand from where it has fallen onto the ground, rushes toward Gustavo and he **stabs Gustavo in the throat with his own [severed hand](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dd/2e/ca/dd2ecae6a47940fff06945b78de3ef78.jpg)** (using the jagged bone from the wrist end) (then he passes out). 

Poignant reunion between Maiza and Czes. [Their reunion in the LN](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/baccano/images/4/45/CzesMaiza.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130304232626). 

Ive actually discussed on another website how Im a bit miffed with how the anime adapts Maiza and Firos talk. Maiza is pretty messed up after all thats happened, and thats not even referring to the [physical](http://imgur.com/4GkknA8) [pain](http://imgur.com/WzDH0yR). Hes been suffering from massive guilt for the past 200 yearsif he hadnt summoned Ronnie, Gretto would have lived and had a happy life with Sylvie and his friends would still be alive, for one thing. 

What the anime leaves out, though, are a few lines that I think are pretty important to Maizas character. In the anime, its literally a five line exchange between Firo and Maiza:

> FiroI

> No, Maiza. Iunderstand everything.

> in that case, I dont need to explain. You, of all people!

> Maiza? Hey, whats the matter with you, pal?

> Ive passed this curse to all of you

Maizas come to regard immortality as a kind of curse, the animes not wrong (he says in the novel: Giving the pain of eternal lifeof all things, to you people). But this is what the anime leaves out:

> But the look of distress did not disappear from Maizas face.  Firoyou should understand with Szilards knowledge, rightTruth be toldIm tired of livingMy brothers grudge, Szilard, is also dead, so now theres no more meaning to my lifethats it, Firo, I

Maiza is straight up asking Firo to devour him. Assisted suicide, if you will. This is *heavy stuff* the anime chose to leave out, and it kills me that it does. Maia has to know the consequences of asking Firo to devour him - Firo would absorb *his memories* and would that be even worse - but Maizas in a pretty dark place in this scene and he doesnt care. He believes his existence is without purpose and hes exhausted from the guilt and the grief. He wants it to be over.

Hmm, maybe Randy should be Nicks second in terms of relatable one-liners. I dont understand, but yahoo!  I feel like that should be my new life philosophy. 

Bonus: [Keith actually smiling for once](http://imgur.com/pkegOys). I think Keith is one of my favorite characters. [As one person has put it](http://gunmaestro-smith.tumblr.com/post/77167074917/baccano-30-day-challenge-day-3-who-is-your), everything he does is just impressive considering his role in the novels is pretty small compared to others. 

Bonus: [Firo](http://imgur.com/Esawu37) devouring Szilard in the LN. 

As Narita puts it in the LN, regarding Szilards fate: "This ending was far too simple for a man who had lived for over 300 years." 

**Im going to post my thoughts on the scene with Czes, I & M as a reply to this post. Its too long.**
>> ARTICLE
The conversation between Firo and Maiza in the LNs made me really sad. Poor Maiza! But I also do love the way it concluded, so I'm going to post that:


>No way!...If you werent here, which one of us would deal with the accounts?... Mr. Maiza, are you trying to ruin this organization?

>... Damn, we need a conta  oro ... Ah, wait a moment please, if you ate me, then my accounting knowledge would...

>No way. Im stupid, so even if I received the knowledge I'll probably forget it soon enough... Right now, Im already starting to forget the knowledge I got from Szilard...

>Why is it always a no...?

>You know, Mr. Maiza... One of the laws of the Camorra states that, no matter what the reason, if one kills a friend they would be rewarded with death... I dont want to die yet, so please forgive me.

>... How troublesome... Just because you cant find a conta  oro...
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, thanks for that. (Not enough space for it in my post). 

> "damn, we need a conta  oro...Ah, wait a moment please, if you 'ate' me, then my accounting knowledge would..."

He even sounds upset when he realizes the problem if he died (no bookkeeper) and tries to brush it off (well, if you ate me then it'd be okay). He's actively trying to **persuade** Firo to eat him, which shows he's not kidding around. 

(yet another snippet of dialogue the anime should have included, ye gads)
>> ARTICLE
**On Czeslaw**

The part where Isaac says the Rail Tracer "realized Czes is a good boy" gets me every time. Its so poignant, and I believe its this scene where I always end up empathizing with Czes most. Sure, living for 200 years has given Czes the experience of at least two adult lifetimes, and hes definitely got the critical thinking skills and the talk a normal kid his age wouldnt have, but *jeez* does this scene hit you. 

Czes is a good boy. Its something youd say to a typical child, but to a child who deals in bomb trading and contemplated blowing up civilians? Czes is painfully and abruptly vulnerable, feeling sharp guilt for even considering that hed try to eat themall the qualities of a child that still reside within him are brought to light. He confesses to lying as a child guilty of stealing cookies might confess, his head bowed, and his eyes lowered, his voice trembling. What he confesses to lying about seems equally childish. 

Czes, you really are just an incredibly good sweet boy! 

["really?"](http://imgur.com/dcde2wL) - with one word, hes just a child looking for approval, for soothing acceptance, looking to an Adult in disbelief, as he probably had long since abandoned such puerile thoughts. Czeslaw would never act like this normally; now, he is at his most emotionally exposed. For the LN readers, its a reminder that he really did use to be this sweet little boy before the Advenna Avis and Fermets torture. 

Wow, youre a lucky duck! Once Isaac takes charge, you can just relax! Its okay, you can go ahead and smile again! - I wonder if this is a reference to when Miria thought shed never be able to smile againuntil she met Isaac. 

With Mirias tender hand on his cheek (like a mother, or an aunt) Czes is overwhelmed to the [point of tears](http://imgur.com/cBdGqTR). He probably hasnt had such genuine kindness and love directed at him...well, since the Advenna Avis (hed been avoiding Maiza for decades, so that wasnt Maizas fault).  

(You can see that it was indeed Czes' [right arm and legs](http://imgur.com/4tYgz59) that had been ground up.)

Yeah, that was brilliant. And they were pretty generous as well,gifting them playing cards so they don't get bored.

>Well, Keith has a wife

I like to imagine he's secretly very romantic.

>but Luck diverts the muzzle at the last second, pointing it at his own hand as he doesnt want her to become a murderer.

Eve would make a good immortal mafia boss (   ). On a more serious note, I am sorta getting to understand why Luck is not thought of being a very good mobster. But then again,it might be their weird code of honour Keith has drillled into their heads.

The simplicity of these two just puts me at ease. Just watching them be the absolute nicest people makes me feel so good about everything in life.

> careens into Claire and the two of them roll off the side of the train.

Im surprised Claire even allowed that to happen at all. He pretty much toyed around with everyone else, but Jacuzzi knocks him off the train. Nice of him to save Jacuzzi though.

> Whether Firo actually comprehends what he did is another matter. 

At least in the anime it seemed like he knew. Thats some other kind of magic though.  A simple tap rearranged her cells.

> picks up a sofa

What.

> Hes been suffering from massive guilt for the past 200 yearsif he hadnt summoned Ronnie, Gretto would have lived and had a happy life with Sylvie and his friends would still be alive, for one thing. 

Ive obviously never summoned the devil and caused a bunch of people to gain immortality, or at least I wouldn't admit it to you all if I did, but I cant help but feel like Maiza should have gotten over all of that after 200 years. Thats a long time. Theres a lot of truth to the whole time heals all wounds saying, and even though Maiza went through some messed up shit, Im just surprised he never came to terms with it after that long. 

> Maiza is straight up asking Firo to devour him. Assisted suicide, if you will. This is heavy stuff the anime chose to leave out, and it kills me that it does.

That wouldve been great to see. What a wonderful topic to explore. Even with all of the other stuff already in the show, perhaps they thought it was too dark to add in.
>> ARTICLE
> allowed that to happen at all

You got it. Claire looks into Jacuzzi's eyes and is so dazzled he waxes poetic: 

> Suddenly, the morning sun began to rise from behind Claire. The sunlight shone into the young man's eyes, and Claire felt as though he were being drawn into them.

> *'Hate to say it, but this guy's eyes are way stronger than mine. Like some kinda hero in a fairytale. Like a knight who's killed a dragon. Feels like my eyes are gonna shatter if I don't look away.'*

> With this, Claire decided to allow himself to fall at the young man's attack. He was the Rail Tracer, who disappeared at sunrise.  That was part of his duty as the storyteller who drew others into this tale. **(yeah, Claire basically invented his own legend. He turned himself into a legend all on his own, by spreading the tale of the Rail Tracer around)**

> The young man tackled him head-on, and the two of them rolled off the side of the train.

> seems like he knew

Eh, he may have known what to do, but I don't know whether he knew what he was doing/why it worked.

> What. 

Precisely.

> Maiza should have gotten over all of that

Yeah, okay, I don't think Maiza was getting up every day for 200 years and lamenting his perceived wrongdoings. I'm sure it was very hard for him at first, though. Perhaps it would be better to say that sure, he moved on and went on with his life, but I think there was maybe always a vague sadness he carried with him. 

Of course, knowing that Szilard was still out there doing what he pleased probably didn't help. Anyway, by the 20th century Maiza probably has come to terms with it (he may not have forgiven himself though). 

I mean, I guess you'd have to move on after at least fifty, one hundred years. ~~try telling that to Sylvie though~~ 

> That would've been great to see. What a wonderful topic to explore.

I know, right!? It's not even a passing whim, or a 'oh crap I take that back turns out I just feel guilty as hell right now' - he is serious about it. He actually tries to persuade Firo to eat him by saying that, hey, if Firo devours him he'll have the knowledge to be the next *conta  oro*. 

I think Maiza's one of the Baccano! characters most frequently overlooked/passed over as 'that kindly so-and-so that's seen with Firo and Czes a lot' (he's actually one of the more important characters in Baccano! when you think about it) and thus he's nowhere near as popular as, say, Claire or Firo.  I really do believe the anime should have included those lines--they are essential to our understanding of Maiza. 

(my computer screen is flickering again. Yikes. I hope it's not a sign of worse things to come. Like it was back in January).

Fair enough. That's a good point.

> I think Maiza's one of the Baccano! characters most frequently overlooked/passed over as 'that kindly so-and-so that's seen with Firo and Czes a lot'

Maiza seems like if there was enough time focused on him, he'd easily be the most interesting character. He is incredibly important to many plot points, but we just didn't get to see enough of him.

> my computer screen is flickering again. Yikes. I hope it's not a sign of worse things to come.

Uh oh.

**Episode 13**: Marriage! It's the only way! Jacuzzi has a hard head. Quite powerful cherry bomb. Jacuzzi wins! Szilard deserved every last bit of it. Now his memories are Firo's. Time for celebration! 2001: Isaac and Miria still stealing! And the moment they realize they haven't aged! Haha! This was as good as I remembered it to be. Now it's time for the specials! 

**Episode 14**: Dominoes are a serious thing! "Popular thing for kids." And everyone is doing it. Oh yes, Graham. I really like Tomokazu Sugita's voice but the dub one feels like it fits even better. Yes, he is like a younger version of Ladd. Ladd is going to *have a word* with them. Graham is tough but Ladd is tougher. We *finally* get the backstory of Chane.

#Thoughts on the episode

Episode 13:

Ahh Jacuzzi is such a cute guy, and it nicely explains why he is such a crybaby.


Dallas got the classic Mafia treatment...

I love how the 1930 story ends in: "being immortal is awesome, why should we be sad about it?"

71 Years, they needed 71 Years to notice that they are immortal and don't age...  
my god how I love these two.


Episode 14:

Specter Graham is my second favourite character in this show, I just love how he  spits bullshit nearly all the time, and how he is such a drama queen.

> I love how the 1930 story ends in: "being immortal is awesome, why should we be sad about it?"

That's really the reason why C.C. in Code Geass wanted to die so much before meeting Lelouch. She didn't have anyone to share immortality with. Here, they've got over twenty people to be pals with forever.
>> ARTICLE
Aw man, I forgot how well episode 13 does tying all the loose ends together, and making one awesome, consistent episode. It's perfect. It's super hard to choose my favourite moment of the episode, but I'm giving it to Maiza and Czes' reunion, because it made me cry like a baby. But there's so many other awesome moments, like Firo, the Gandors and the Martillos strolling up unharmed, Jacuzzi being a badass, Ennis defying Szilard, Isaac and Miria rescuing Czes (literally and figuratively), the Gandors putting Dallas & co in the river, Randy & Pecho lighting their "first human head" on fire...I could go on and on.


Episode 14 never really interested me my first time around - I think Graham bored me (!) and I wanted to go back to the "real cast". But he has grown on me, so this was more entertaining this time! Chris Patton also does a fab job.

I also really like the domino scene at the beginning, with all the Martillos taking it so seriously. This is actually from the 1932 novel, the Drug and the Dominos...hence the title. 

>> ARTICLE
**And heres the notes for episode 14, the beginning of the OVA adaption of LN #14, which introduces the anime viewers for the first time to Graham. Oh *boy*. Most people Ive come across seem to either love or hate him.**

**On an unrelated note, I'm counting down the days until our kitchen ceiling collapses, like how the roof did in our patio (which hasn't been fixed for at least a year). This house is really falling apart. Still, I love it anyway.**

(hey /u/accordionheart, I know you and I thought that he first appears in LN #14, but he definitely has a presence in #8 and #9. #8 gives us his first appearance, in which he monologues about Ladd and Lua on the train, and he shows up in #9 too. 14 is the first to have him feature in a sizable chunk of the story). 

The blaring trumpets and car horns representing how it feels to be startled/scared by a sound when youve been in complete silence is pretty accurate. 

Even [Ronnies](http://imgur.com/Rqu1wD9) intently setting up the dominos. I love it.

Firos slow dramatic head-turn at Maizas admittance that *he* was the one to design the impressive pattern was hilarious. But, on a more pleasant note, I think this is the most relaxed weve ever heard Maiza in the anime. 

[Maizas thumbs up though. Theyre all so serious. Its perfect](http://imgur.com/eohfWw7).

The dominoes scene the anime is showing does in fact appear in 1932 and is entirely innocuous. A year later, however, in 1933 (the Slash arc), the dominoes are set up (yeah, I guess the charm didnt fade after a year of playing around with them) againand in 1933 things proceedless than smoothly (and thats an understatement).

Graham is a ~~very~~ extremely verbose person, and whether you hate or love him youve got to give his VA the credit he deserves. 

The scenes with Ladd and his uncle (here were seeing 1929 of all years) always give me that live-action feelalso Ladds fluid movements as hesways? moves around the room are great.

I have to say, the fight scene between Graham and Ladd is pretty coolmainly when Ladds running around, swinging on hooks and being badass (can you picture *this* live-action? Wow. [This bit](http://imgur.com/z79bOa6) with Ladd just hanging there with one hand I for some reason find amusing). 

The fact that Ladd can talk normally with a wrench buried in his side astounds me. 

Yeah, after all that, Graham kind of hero worships [Ladd](http://imgur.com/I3EjLPb) now, (he also [idolizes](/s "Elmer and Raz Smith, the gun maestro from LN #16") and he has this sort of younger brother relationship to Ladd, I guess you could call it. 

As you can tell, he really likes to dismantle things. He also likes to dismantle people (by which I mean he likes to dislocate their limbs). He hates the idea of killing, though. He wont do it, and if he does hell feel incredibly guilty afterwards. 

Why is [Elmer](http://imgur.com/1YnNyIF) at the Grand Central Station? (Ooh, they fixed the mistake from the first episode) No, hes not following Maiza aroundit was revealed in the DS game (and in LN #14) that *he was on The Flying Pussyfoot too!* (Along [with](/s "Fermet")). What he got up to on the train is...a story for another day. (It was amazing). He got off the train with the others and happened to notice Maiza there. 

Oh God. That they actually have a scene with [Elmer and Huey](http://imgur.com/q97PeXw) together is incredibly bittersweet considering what happens in the 18th century arcs. Ha-ha! Its painful just thinking about it. Hoo boy. 

[Elmer looks almost sinister here. Oh, the irony.](http://imgur.com/mV4RwKb)

[And Huey looksdisappointed](http://imgur.com/vaviypK), I think. A little bit. Again, very interesting considering his personality. 

The more you change, the more you stay the same. well, I imagine Hueys relieved by that, considering what he asked Elmer to promise him at the end of Whitesmile. 

[Oh, you know me. Ill do anything for a smile!](http://imgur.com/hyPB2O1). Yes, you would. Thats the terrifying part. (I wish it wasnt terrifying, I wish you were just what you seem, but damn it its the fact that you arent that makes you all the more interesting). 

[The novels establish that Huey considers Elmer to be his only friend in the world.](http://imgur.com/g7PkbC7). Granted, Elmer is one of the only people in the world not thoroughly creeped  the fuck out by Huey, so, y;know. Being Hueys only friend gives you special benefits like not being seen as a potential guinea pig for his experiments, and actually having your feelings taken into his consideration (Huey doesnt sacrifice innocent bystanders in the name of his experiments because Elmer would be sad, or so he tells Chane.

 My Chanemy little experiment. God*dammit* [Huey](http://imgur.com/y5uURHq) ~~this is why we cant have nice things~~ this is why everybody considers you to be Baccano!s problem child. (Okay maybe not everybody). Either people think youre a fascinating and multifaceted character taking your past into account, or people hate you for the later atrocities you commit and your dubious treatment of the worlds inhabitants even after taking your past into account. Even [Elmer](http://imgur.com/5PArRTa) is judging you right now. (Okay, no, I dont know what Elmer is thinking - probably something along the lines of how to make both Huey and Chane smile). 

Im fairly certain this scene between [Huey](http://imgur.com/xuOXFW5) and Elmer was entirely original to the anime, as in 2002 Elmer comments that he hasnt seen Huey in 300 years. Thats something worth noting. 

Listen ElmerSmile Junkie, Mister Happy Endingtell me: what happy life can come to a poor guinea pig? Fucking hell, Huey. Youd easily kill Chane if it would sate your curiosity. 

Huey. Ive learned that happiness is something like unhappinessit can strike anytime without warning. (Im sure that your daughter cannot escape either one of them). I wonderis Elmer perhaps talking about himself here? He did seem somewhat down after Hueys Its So Easy When Youre Evil speech. 

Nah. Im not sure whether Elmer even has that wide a range of emotions at this point. Thats something Im very uncertain to give a statement on. After all, one of the reasons hes so obsessed with peoples happiness and getting them to smile is because he honestly cant tell if hes actually happy or not when hes smiling, and maybe through making people smile hell learn (someday) to identify when hes happy and when he isnt. [Heres](http://rabbitinheadlights.tumblr.com/post/49682036130/why-elmer-is-evil-rewritten) a very good analysis someone wrote on Elmer that may be of interest to you (*slight* spoilers for the light novels but only slight). (Somebody wrote in [reply](http://fradine.tumblr.com/post/49755172316/why-elmer-is-evil-rewritten) that while they agreed with what was written in the essay they dont agree Elmer is Evil.

[Shaft,](http://imgur.com/slfIeye), Grahams right hand man, [aka](/s "a vessel of Sham") is a fun character. He does get the short end of the stick, putting up with Graham being a little shit.

**I'm forgetting things again, I'm sure. If I do, I'll see if I can fit it in.**
>> ARTICLE
> Most people Ive come across seem to either love or hate him.

I'm honestly in the middle. I want to like him a lot, but we already have Ladd. If the two can team up, and it looks like they're going to, then I think things will be ok. Otherwise he's just obnoxious since we already have Ladd.

> This house is really falling apart. Still, I love it anyway.

Oh no. In real life? Hope it holds up.

> Oh, you know me. Ill do anything for a smile!. Yes, you would. Thats the terrifying part. (I wish it wasnt terrifying, I wish you were just what you seem, but damn it its the fact that you arent that makes you all the more interesting).

Wow. Were we not supposed to deduce this from the anime or am I just an idiot? Elmer just wanted smiles. Guess he wants more than that.
>> ARTICLE
> In real life?

Yeah. The plaster is peeling away and crumbling to the floor. (It's doing it a little in my room too). 

> Guess he wants more than that.

No, no, Elmer wants precisely that--people to smile. People to be happy. It's just that he cares about the happiness/smiles -- and that he doesn't actually care about the people. (I believe his ultimate goal is to get everyone in the world to smile, though I think he knows on some level that's impossible). 

"I wish you were just what you seem." - I sometimes wish he actually is what he seems at first glance -- a selfless, cheery, kind man who just wants people to be happy.  But no. 
>> ARTICLE
> No, no, Elmer wants precisely that--people to smile. People to be happy. It's just that he cares about the happiness/smiles -- and that he doesn't actually care about the people.

Ok, interesting. Sort of a weird thing to just want to see smiles. Even if Elmer doesn't actually care about the individual, there's still a chance they'd be happy if he's able to make them smile. Simply smiling can affect your mood.
>> ARTICLE
> sort of a weird thing to just want to see smiles

Well, it's all really due to his own selfishness. Seeing people smile and be happy makes *him* feel 'good', and that's why he does it. Well, also because he doesn't know whether or not he's actually truly 'happy' when he smiles - he's not sure if he knows what genuine happiness is - so maybe if he gets enough people to smile someday he'll learn for himself what it feels like. 

So far, no dice. He still has trouble understanding why people don't smile when they're inflicting pain on others. He "doesn't really get it himself," but since the victim isn't going to be smiling, the inflicter might as well enjoy themselves. This sounds fucked up, but it makes a ton of sense when you learn [that](/s "Elmer's parents and all the rest of the villagers always smiled when they tortured him for the first ten years of his life.") 

No *wonder* he thinks it's perfectly natural for someone to smile while they hurt someone else. His childhood was absolutely fucking horrifying. 

And sure, it sounds harmless enough if all he's doing is making people happy. Thing is, if you think suicide would make you happy Elmer will readily help you out (provided you smile). Doesn't matter to Elmer if you're a serial killer or a saint--he wants everyone to smile, even the scum of the earth. 
>> ARTICLE
Well that all helped clarify things. I guess I was still a bit confused. What an awful childhood.

> Thing is, if you think suicide would make you happy Elmer will readily help you out (provided you smile). Doesn't matter to Elmer if you're a serial killer or a saint--he wants everyone to smile, even the scum of the earth. 

In a way, that is sort of nice of him. It's kind of a touchy subject I guess, and there's obviously a bit more to it than "should I or shouldn't I die." Who's to say you shouldn't be allowed to be in control of when you die. The serial killer part is where I kind of realized just how much Elmer wants to see a smile. It makes sense after what you said about his childhood though. Someone killing innocents with or without reason should not have their behavior reinforced by having someone tell you you should be smiling. I suppose Elmer would love to watch Ladd work.

Love it when a discussion forces some heavy thinking.

>  I know you and I thought that he first appears in LN #14, but he definitely has a presence in #8 and #9.


Ah, whoops! Thanks for reminding me. 


> Im fairly certain this scene between Huey and Elmer was entirely original to the anime, as in 2002 Elmer comments that he hasnt seen Huey in 300 years. 


Definitely anime original. I'm really hoping that we get their reunion in 2003 though. Because I find their really weird friendship oddly endearing. I guess it humanises Huey a bit, which he definitely needs [LN spoilers](/s "after all the terrible things that happen in 1710!") And Elmer calls him a "good friend" and [](/s "keeps his promise that he made Huey in 1711"), so I guess it's reciprocated. At least, as much as it can be.


Edit: 

> it was revealed in the DS game (and in LN #14)


Now, I'm not sure if this is me reading too much into things, plus I don't have my LN copies to hand, but at the beginning of 2001...B?, there's a chapter with [LN spoilers](/s "someone (I think it's implied to be Huey?) and the Copycat where they discuss the recreation of the events of the Flying Pussyfoot, and which character on the boat is playing which character on the train...The other person asks something like "and you and Elmer? Who were you meant to be? Yourselves. Oh, of course." I only picked up on this on my reread, but I think it could confirm that Elmer and the Copycat were on the Flying Pussyfoot earlier than #14.") Of course, it's only a really vague hint, and #14 was more explicit, but I thought it was interesting, nevertheless! 

>> ARTICLE
> oddly endearing

Odd is a good word for it. I never know how to feel when Huey thinks of or mentions Elmer in the LNs (or someone mentions Elmer in his presence). I want to think of it as endearing (and it...kind of is) but at the same time I remember who Huey is and then I'm weirded out again. (Huey is an interesting guy to be sure. I have a hard time figuring out how I feel about him). 

> [and](/s "kept his promise")

That promise still intrigues me, because Elmer says to [Huey](/s ""do you know how hard it's going be to try and never change from the way I am?") and I always wonder about the implications of that. Elmer seems to be so effortlessly constant, as if it was perfectly natural for him to stay the same for 200 years. As if we were to expect he'd never change. 

His line really makes me think. Did Elmer truly think he would change, as it would be natural for any typical person to do? How did *he* think he would have changed had he not promised Huey? (Has Elmer had to consciously try to stay the same over the years?)

 How do I even try to work my brain around this? I don't know. 
>> ARTICLE
Of all the marvelous ways the characters dished out pain, the Gandors filling up Dallas & co. with cement is probably my most favourite one. I mean, they're just so cold and businesslike, as if this is their favourite hobby/sth. And to think, they'd have grown old in there- even Ladd/Vino would be proud with the ingenuity of it.

Wasn't there supposed to be a package in the Pussyfoot? Was it Czeslaw, or something less valuable like a ton of liquor/explosives/sth?

>> ARTICLE
There was. 

The whole reason Jacuzzi & Co. were on the Flying Pussyfoot was to steal a certain secret cargo in a freight car on the Flying Pussyfoot. This cargo was a new model of explosives "and the bombs that were refined from them." 

That's why they had a recovery team ready by the river to retrieve the boxes of cargo Donny and Nick (and Nice) were dumping in the river (the boxes that Nick and Chane were clinging to in eps 12 and 13). 

Why did they want to steal the cargo? For one thing, they could make a huge profit by selling it (after discarding the insides). For another, they wanted to prevent the deaths that would inevitably occur if the cargo were to reach New York.

From whom are they unknowingly trying to steal the cargo from? Czeslaw Meyer. He intends to sell the explosives to the mafia (the Runoratas) in New York (his other reason for being on the train is to devour Maiza). 

Actually, that's the other reason Claire is so hostile to Czes (the first being that he's a threat to the passengers). Claire was there when Czes told Ladd he was planning to sell the explosives to the Runoratas. If the Runoratas were to get a hold of those bombs, it would prove to be pretty bad for the Gandors (Claire's adopted family). 

Czes would easily have the passengers killed. Strike one. He's an ally of the Runorata family. Strike two, and that's enough for Claire to give him hell.

(this is also why Claire turns a blind eye to Jacuzzi's gang stealing the cargo of the train. Given Claire takes his job as a conductor seriously, you'd think he wouldn't tolerate train robbers. But, since Jacuzzi's gang dumping the cargo is good news for the Gandors, Claire's willing to let it slide.)
>> ARTICLE
**Ep 13 - All good things come to an end**

Noooo it can't be over yet! I'm not ready to say goodbye to these characters. 

[](#elsieqq)

Still, this was an extremely satisfying last episode. We get to see Szilard finally get his comeuppance from Firo (you were right, /u/Neawia!), finally solved the mystery of Dallas' whereabouts and had a happy ending for everyone else. It's so heart-warming that Czeslaw and Ennis find a family in the end.  

**Ep 14 - Oh wait, there's more**

Can't tell who's crazier, Graham Spectre or Ladd. I guess the OVAs will mostly be focusing on Graham, but I'm just glad that there's some continuation from the anime. We more Huey and Vino. 
>> ARTICLE
> We get to see Szilard finally get his comeuppance from Firo (you were right, /u/Neawia!),

Awww, yeah, baby! Still wrong on so many other things, but that's half the fun of it.

> Can't tell who's crazier, Graham Spectre or Ladd.

I personally think Graham is crazier. Ladd at least seems to have a sense of composure. He's smart, and precise, and knows what he's doing. So far Graham just seems a bit out of control.
>> ARTICLE
So, I believe around when Baccano first came to the states, Graham was really unpopular. I guess people saw him as a cheap Ladd Russo substitute, or they were annoyed by his constant rambling. However, I find him hilarious. Not as hilarious as Ladd, but still pretty damn funny. So what's the general opinion on this thread so far? 
>> ARTICLE
I really do like him, but he does fill a bit like Ladd #2. I think if/when the two of them team up it could be entertaining though. For now, Graham is a little annoying, but would be amazing if we didn't already know Ladd.
>> ARTICLE
So far nobody's said they can't stand him yet, so that's something. A fair few seem to like him. 

I remember being initially indifferent to Graham when I first watched the anime, but having read the LNs I think I've grown to like him more than I did before. 

Sometimes he can be a bit much.  The scene where he repeatedly smashes his wrench into the ground is not one I enjoy watching, for instance.  His philosophical ramblings oftentimes prove pretty interesting in the light novels.  
>> ARTICLE
Graham got an unfairly bad rap because he only had three episodes to build on his character. Had there ever been a second season, I'm sure he would have been more popular.

Ok. Huey's a traitor to the US. Wonder what exactly he did.

Jacuzii's crew is new in town. With the Genoard's though? Hmmm. I don't remember if we knew that already or not.

Graham is crazy. He's a bit crazier than Ladd, I dare say.

Jeez, take off your fatigues, Rachel.

Czeslaw. Now why would you tell her everything?

I like Graham, but we already have Ladd. They're both crazy.

**--- Post Episode Thoughts on the Future ---**

Well, the "final" episode of the series wrapped everything up pretty nicely. It definitely left some things to be further explored so it sucks there was never a season two. I guess that's what the light novels are for.

Am I just forgetting something here? What was the "item" that was on the train? A bomb? The formula? Is this even important?

No more crazy speculations.

- The one I was clinging to for a while now... I guess Eve is not immortal. The way Dallas looks much older and she the same is probably just because of the way the characters are drawn.
- Ennis finally turns on Szilard. She does distract him, but Firo was the one to absorb him, not Maiza.
- Firo and Ennis did get together, but Carol is not their child, Czes sort of is, kinda.

Isaac and Miria really help everyone out, don't they?

Us again posting the exact same thing.

> FUCK! YES! ISAAC AND MIRIA! FUCK YESSER! FIRO AND EVERYONE! THE MUSIC! OMG THEY WERE ALL DRINKING IT! ISAAC AND MIRIA GAVE IT TO THEM!

It's only fair.

He made a huge crater from just one hit. Think about how much power that takes. That's something I could only imagine Claire or Donny doing.

He did say that she would find out eventually from the President or somebody, so I guess he decided he would tell his side of the story first.

I always thought that it was the bomb Nice hid behind her eye, but I'm probably wrong, seeing as how she herself planned to steal it.

> Firo and Ennis did get together, but Carol is not their child, Czes sort of is, kinda.

Something interesting that we learn in the 2001 arc. Firo and Ennis never actually ever have sex. Had to due with the trauma she suffered working under Szilard that just made things too hard. They're together, just not intimate.

I also like to believe that Isaac and Miria are just too innocent to have ever had sex. I just can't see them getting physical like that for some reason.

Ugh, so satisfying. Szilard always came across as such an intimidating man, always in control. He's in arms reach (literally) of his end goal, and everything falls apart spectacularly. So good.

> He did say that she would find out eventually from the President or somebody, so I guess he decided we would tell his side of the story first.

Good point.

That honestly makes sense. Firo's one hell of a guy. An eternity without getting any. As for Isaac and Miria, I don't know, man, I can see it.

But I think it's not just Ennis, Firo also has a few issues relating to being intimate in the LNs, due to [him](/s "being kidnapped by a paedophile (who thought he was a girl on top of it!) as a kid.") But I do enjoy watching his attempts at being smooth in 2002. And Czes trying to be his wingman.

Here's the 'official' reason that Huey was locked up:

> Huey Laforet was a terrorist who had, some time ago, caused a moderate amount of commotion. He'd been arrested on charges of purchasing vast quantities of weapons to use in an attempt to overthrow the U.S. government, but nothing about him had been revealed after his arrestnot the details of his interrogation, not the results of his trial, not even his current status.

> There were rumors, of course, that he'd been sent to the military prison on Alcatraz Island, but as for concrete information... Neither Nicholas nor Henry had been able to find any clues.

> "What that tells us is that the man known as Huey Laforet represents something quite special to the United States of America. What's more, Huey Laforet does not care about being captured. It's possible, in fact, that even his arrest at the hands of the police was part of his plan. That goes for the decimation of his organization, the Lemures, as well."

I suspect that the more pertinent reason Huey was locked up was Victor Talbot, one of the immortals on the Advenna Avis (spoilers, I guess? He wasn't devoured by Szilard. This isn't relevant at all to to the anime). Victor works for the Bureau of Intelligence (which later will become the FBI) as the head (?) of the 'immortals division' (can't remember if it has a name). Due to his very rigid sense of duty to his adopted country (he's British by the way), he does not tolerate things that put innocent civilians in danger and so he's very suspicious when it comes to everything concerning Huey.

I believe that Victor managed to get Huey behind bars in an effort to limit his influence and contact with the many groups/factions that follow his orders. (The Lemures are NOT the only followers of Huey. In the LNs, there's at [least](/s "four others: The Lamia, the Larvae, Rhythm, and Time."). (This [naturally](/s "doesn't work. Victor can't figure out how Huey is still issuing orders from a cell. Even moving him to Alcatraz doesn't work. This is why Victor 'arrests' Firo and sends him to Alcatraz as an 'inmate' to keep an eye on Huey and figure out how the hell he's doing it."))
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the Huey background info.

So an immortal is the head of the immortals division of the FBI. Interesting. Does the rest of the FBI know he's an immortal?

I want to respond to some of the LN spoiler tagged stuff so [](/s "Is this what you were talking about with the birds? Huey is still able to send orders because his other daughter sends them or was that something only meant for Chane? Maybe he wasn't even giving his followers orders since, at least in the anime, he wasn't doing so.")

Well, that's a rap on the main episodes of the season!

This was not only my first time participating in a rewatch, but also my first time watching Baccano--so I was a newbie all around.

I've mentioned my love for the show in previous threads, but I wanted to say something about the rewatch in general. I know that  this is reportedly the last rewatch (do I have that right?) thread that  /u/angel10701 will be in charge of. Well, I'd like to say thanks for introducing me to such a brilliant forum in the rewatches. You've been extremely helpful--you also introduced this show to me so....I am ever grateful.

And all you other great people who have been fun to chat with about the show and discuss the episode...you truly gave us some extraordinary insight into the source material. I hope to see you all again in another rewatch!

I had to watch these episodes yesterday because Friday is a busy day.  Or maybe I just wanted to binge a little.  One or the other.

**Ep. 13:**

* Don Runorata is cold as ice.  Gustavo probably deserved it, but right in front of Eve?  Come on, Don.  At least we know how Dallas ended up drowning forever now.

* I wasn't expecting Vino/Chane.  Straight out of left field.  Why not?

* Ah, Isaac, Miria... you two might be the dumbest couple I've ever seen.  I'd say "Never change", but if 70 years are any evidence...

**Ep. 14/OVA 1:**

* Nice to see that Guns & Roses hasn't gone anywhere.  And also that Isaac and Miria haven't lost their touch in bringing others to their level.

* Graham Specter feels like a less charismatic, more obsessive-compulsive Ladd Russo.  I'm sure they're perfect for each other, even though Ladd always made sense in his own way and Graham... doesn't.

I have no clue what Czeslaw's goal is in talking to Rachel, apart from maybe getting everything off his chest.  I'm sure we'll find out soon.  #JacuzziNiceWhere?

That finale was awesome! The OVAs (episodes 14-16) are basically previews of the undapted novels, aren't they?

Yup. The OVAs primarily deal with LN #14, though they borrow a few scenes from others (the domino scene comes from #4).

Many of the VAs for the Baccano! dub were reunited in the Kekkai Sensen dub. [Six, to be precise](http://avac.aksumka.com/index.php?id1=2251&id2=24439&lang=2).

I don't think I've posted since the recap for Episode 1, when I was pretty confused about what was going on in the show. I finished up through the main story, episode 13 yesterday.

I have to say, it was really, really hard for me to push my way through this series.  My main issue with the show is it gives you very little to hook into as far as characters and story.

There are some wacky characters, but none of them have any depth at all. If they do have some depth, you have to go digging for it in the form of at least a rewatch, or maybe reading LNs. Very few of the characters are actually memorable. Isaac and Miria, Firo, Ladd, Jacuzzi, Ennis, angry alchemist old guy, Czes, and Chane were the ones who caught my attention by the end of the series. Everyone else pretty much had zero character development.

I think the main flaw of this show, in my opinion, is that the disjointed time jumping serves no purpose except for the author to show off how smart he thinks he is, while confusing the viewer to the point where it's really tough to actually enjoy the show. When you have to do so much work to actually figure out what you're supposed to be understanding, I find it tough to enjoy something that's supposedly entertainment.

For whatever reason, this stuff hasn't bothered me as much in Durarara. I think it's far less egregious there, as you're usually only jumping back and forth over the course of a few hours instead of a few years. Also, the characters in Durarara stand out much more from each other. Almost all of the mafia guys in Baccano look and sound exactly the same, and it was very difficult for me to keep the several different families, their motivations, and their members straight.

I just didn't enjoy any part of the show that much. I laughed out loud once during the entirety of the show, and that was when Ladd played ventriloquist on top of the train with a dead guy's body, because of the pure absurdity of it. This was weird, because I actively hated Ladd for much of the show. His voice acting (English dub) was consistent monotone over-accented yelling for the entirety of the show. It became really annoying.  Isaac and Miria made me smile pretty often, but they were more slapstick than substance.

I also thought the ending of the show was extremely weak (talking about episode 13 only). They never circled back to what started off episode 1...wtf? Maybe I missed something there, but what is the point of starting off from the point of view of the Professor and the little girl in the future, and then never coming back to them? Maybe this is addressed in episodes 14-16, but from what I understand, those are DVD only, and not part of the main first season run. There was supposed to be a nice moment with Czes being accepted by Maiza, and Isaac and Miria being nice to him after what he'd gone through, but I'd only really figured out his character's backstory and episode or two earlier, so I wasn't exactly invested in him getting a happy ending.

I also didn't understand why I was supposed to care about Firo and Ennis getting together? Yay, he found her cufflink, and somehow drank some secret immortality juice and devoured her evil creator, so now they're in love, or something? Don't get why that's supposed to be moving. There was zero buildup to that. I also don't understand why Maiza is so okay with Firo gaining all of the evil old guy's memories through devouring him. They're just gonna be bros now? Firo doesn't care about the secret to immortality and giving it to others? Or does he know how to concoct the formula now as well, since the evil old guy figured it out?

Sorry to be so brash about the show, but I was actively disliking it ever since the end of the first episode, and it never turned me around. I've been following the reaction threads since then, and have seen very few negative comments. I don't know if that means that everyone is loving the show, or other people who are disliking it don't care enough to comment. Either way, maybe I'm missing some keys to why the show is considered so brilliant, and someone could shed some light on me.

Oh and for one final annoyance with the show. Firo Prochainezo. Going purely by Italian pronunciation conventions, Prochainezo should be pronounced - Pro-kah-nay-zzo. I mean, it's the kind of Italian name that Italian Americans would mispronounce all the time though (I'm Italian American and typically don't pronounce my last name correctly by Italian conventions). But, I kind of doubt that was intended, and was just a mistake.

>> ARTICLE
Good post. Somebody needed to point out some of the flaws. I think I've been waiting to do so, and I'll probably point out a few things I didn't like during the final series discussion. As I first-timer I was focused on simply trying to enjoy the show rather than watch through it like I was going to be writing a review about it.

For what it's worth, I actually agree with almost all of what you wrote, but for what I don't agree with I can still understand why you'd feel that way.

I'm a straight up mutt in terms of ancestry, but my last name is also Italian. I'm 100% certain my entire family has always pronounced it incorrectly. Curious though as I don't remember; how were they pronouncing Firo's last name in the anime?
>> ARTICLE
They were saying Pro-cha-nay-zo. Pronouncing the ch as we do in English, whereas "ch" in Italian is usually a hard "k" sound, i.e. Pinocchio.
>> ARTICLE
Right. I feel like I barely heard anyone even saying his last name. I guess it was during his ceremony if nowhere else. Maybe in the beginning of the show. Now you've got me wondering too why they didn't get the pronunciation right. Such an ultimately unimportant piece of information really, but still interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I can't really say anything that could change your mind. You saw annoyances and problems where I and others didn't. Nothing wrong with that. It just means that this is one show where your opinion differs from others. No problem there.
>> ARTICLE
> very few negative comments

Can't argue with you there. The large majority of people (who are commenting) seem to regard the show favorably. It does make the tone of the comment sections a little lopsided. As much as I adore Baccano!, I know from experience that plenty of people don't like it, so it obviously doesn't click with everyone. 

> disjointed time jumping serves only for the author to show off how smart he is

Ehhh, if you don't like the non-linear storytelling you're going to have to point the blame at those who made the anime, not Narita. Each timeline (1930, 1931, 1932) gets its own novel (the train arc two novels). 

Some people have a really hard time understanding what's going on their first watch. Some people understand it without a problem. You had a hard time following the multiple plots and keeping track of the characters--and well, if you don't get what's happening 
you're of course not going to enjoy it too much. I understand. 

Many people in the rewatch threads knew that some newbies would be confused, so each new episode some would be posting lists of characters and what happened when so that the newcomers could keep them all straight. Did you check them out at all, or did they not help?

> never circled back to episode 1

The OVAs (eps 14-16) do. The Vice-President and Carol come back, and the OVAs eventually revisit episode 1. (Stick around for the last two eps!)

> no depth to the characters ; why should I care about Firo and Ennis

That is a valid point and I myself have struggled with this one multiple times. I have a friend who enjoyed the anime but pointed out that "the characters are static." We ended up having a huge debate over whether or not that was true. As someone who has read the light novels and is pretty biased in favor of the anime, I'm not sure if I'm the right person to talk to on this. It would probably make more sense if another newbie chipped in their two cents. 

It does sound like you did have varying degrees of interest in a substantial number of the cast, though. 

As for Firo and Ennis, well, I guess that's mostly subjective. I don't think the anime intends for you to think they're magically in love after the little time they spent together (though it's clear Firo has a crush on her) - after all, Ennis has no idea how to even be in a relationship. I don't think 'moving' is the right word to describe that scene, but again, it's probably better for a newb to respond to that.

> Maiza is so okay with [...]

He isn't. "You, of all people...!" he says to Firo. He's very much not okay with Firo knowing Maiza's role in all of this and whatever else is in Szilard's memories, but there's not much he can do about it. 

> Firo doesn't care about the secret of immortality...'concoct the formula'...

If by others, you mean the rest of the world/making it publicly known, that wouldn't really cross Firo's mind. As for whether or not he knows the formula...this is better explained in the novels. He doesn't like having Szilard's memories and tries not to think about them. Plus, he's not exactly book-smart.

> Sorry to be so brash about the show

Don't be sorry. It's your opinion and you're entitled to it. Every single show has its fans and non-fans, and there's no reason why Baccano! would be any different. 

Although you don't like the show, I hope you stick around for the final two episodes and the final wrap-up thread. The final thread is intended to be a place where newcomers (and oldtimers) can share their final thoughts on the series as a whole and whatever else they can think of, and the opinions you've expressed above are just that. 

It's likely there will be others who share your sentiments, too. I hope to see you there. 


>> ARTICLE
Thank you for taking the time to craft an extremely well-thought out response to my little rant. I'm very surprised to hear that the time-jumping was something that came about in the anime instead of the original source material. What a huge decision to make. I wonder how the writer felt about it.

Regarding the lists of characters and recaps, I did pay some attention to those, but in general I didn't want to be the least bit spoiled on anything while I was going through the series, so I avoided some of the more detailed posts so I could form my own opinion without outside information. I will go back now and read more about the nuances I probably missed.

I forgot that Maiza said that about Firo. I think it's a little unfortunate that Firo just doesn't like to think about Szilard Quates' memories. Devouring someone else's memories and all of their experiences, you would think, would change you forever. It seemed to be a big deal when Czeslaw devoured his torturer, and thus found that the guy was getting enjoyment out of torturing Czes, etc. Then again, you have to retain some sense of oneself, even when you absorb the memories and experiences of another person...you don't actually become that person, so it follows that your motives might not change with the new information.

I'll stick around for the last thread, and I may watch the final 3 episodes, to finish out the series. Thanks again for responding in so much depth!




>> ARTICLE
> go back now and read

I hope they'll help with any questions or confusions you may still have. At any rate, I know some people that struggled with the show the first time they saw it, and enjoyed it the second time because they had a better grasp on what was happening, so maybe they'll be of some use. 

> just doesn't like to think about Szilard's memories

It's a bit understandable why--they're not the most pleasant memories to sift through, though he does try occasionally. In the LNs, Firo is clearly struggling with having Szilard's memories in his brain, and in a conversation with Maiza he says he doesn't really understand them. He's especially creeped out by how much Szilard enjoyed taking away things that mattered to someone else. 

"He enjoyed it so much, so much more than I ever enjoyed anything in my life! I don't know what to think.  My memories've changed. It feels like he was happier when he ate someone than I was at the moment I became a capo."

> would change you forever

You betcha. In fact, Firo's terrified that Szilard's memories will corrupt him, that eventually he'll be as warped and as twisted Szilard was. It's this fear that leads Firo in LN 6 to do a 'test' to see how much the memories have affected him. And it's this test that ends up kicking events into motion.

> Czes devoured his torturer. 

Well, acquiring the memories of the one who tortured you--that is, experiencing your own torture from the point of view of the torturer (who really enjoys torturing you) is going to fuck you up no matter how to look at it. 

> I'll stick around for the last thread, and I may watch the final 3 episodes

Hey, glad to hear it! If I don't see you tomorrow I better see you in the final thread, you hear me? Heh.  Whether you watch the last three episodes is up to you, but since one of your problems with the show was how episode 13 ended, I'd recommend you watch them. Episode 16 does a fantastic job of bringing the anime full circle...at least, in my opinion. It may not be the same for you.

Hey so I actually went and read through a bunch of the past threads and some plot summaries on the Baccano wikia, and I was hoping you could help me to understand Jacuzzi.

I'm really confused as to why Jacuzzi jumps into action so quickly on the train. I don't really get what his motivation is at all. The instant he hears about the rail tracer, he instantly runs to go save the conductor, and he yells at Ladd that everyone is in grave danger, etc. Why is he so sure of what is about to happen? Does he have experience with something like this in the past? Is Jacuzzi's backstory something that gets explained more in the LNs because it was one of the main things I didn't understand as the show went on.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I think you've misunderstood the situation a bit. He doesn't rush to go save the 'young conductor' -- how could he? He has no way of knowing what's happening in the conductors' car. Nor is he sure of what's going to happen. 

The reason Jacuzzi got up and bolted is really very simple, and well, you might not like it. Jacuzzi's a bit gullible and he's easily scared (when he's not being a badass). Everybody else - Mrs. Beriam, Nice, John, etc) takes the Rail Tracer story as a simple urban legend, but Jacuzzi is truly frightened by the story. 

Do you remember the exchange from episode 2? Isaac says there's only one way to stop the Rail Tracer. What's that/ Well, Isaac has forgotten. This is not what Jacuzzi wants to hear. Scared, and caught up in the moment, Jacuzzi runs not to save the young conductor but **to ask him how to stop the rail tracer from eating everyone on the train.** 

When he yells at Ladd that everyone is in grave danger, he's literally just saying this because he got too caught up in the scary story and actually believes that the so-called Rail Tracer is going to 'fuck shit up.' (I mean, it turns out the Rail Tracer does exist, and people are in grave danger, but...)

Jacuzzi hasn't had any experience regarding monstrous beings before. He's only 'sure' in that he believes that the urban legend is true. His motivation is to learn how to stop the Rail Tracer because it could kill him and everyone else, according to Isaac. 

That's pretty much it. 

If you have questions about anything else at all about the series/if you're confused about anything at all, feel free to ask me whenever and whatever it is I'll do my best to answer.

Baccano! We've finished it! What a load of fun this rewatch has been. Nobody spoiled *anything,* and nothing was hyped up. I felt like I had the freedom of watching the show alone, but with all the extra discussion with all you wonderful people.

Thanks to all veterans, first-timers, and lurkers too. You all read my silly reactions and theories, responding to me and correcting my mistakes and confusions. I'm appreciative as always. You are all awesome! I don't usually like to drop names because I know I'll forget someone who deserves a mention. However, /u/Revriley1, you earned one. All of the extra (spoiler free) information and clarification you provided was fantastic. A veteran through and through to guide us on our Baccano! journey. Thank you. Every rewatch needs someone like you.

And of course, a big thanks to /u/angel10701. Another successful rewatch. On a slightly more personal note, I just want to say thanks for putting together that Code Geass rewatch. You could chalk it up to chance, but you were still the one who hosted it. It caught my eye and caused me to start posting. I wouldn't be participating on /r/anime without you, so thanks. Your rewatches have been great. I'm sure we'll still see you around, but the best to you in whatever it is you're off to do.

Alright, sappy thanks over. Onto my thoughts and crap.

**--- "Neawia Doesn't Know If He's Writting A Review or Just Rambling" ---**

**- The Good -**

The story was fantastic, and I'd argue the best thing about the show. Unique too. How many 1930s gangster stories set in NY can be found in anime? I actually loved the jumping around between different years. It gave the opportunity to be able to speculate some crazy things because all of the holes weren't filled in yet. It was like slowly putting together a huge puzzle. One event would happen, and I'd be able to look back a few episodes and go, "oh, that's what that scene was about." I didn't care any less about the characters or events that were to transpire even after watching the first episode and knowing who lives. If anything, I wanted to know even more how everything would play out. It was a solid tale of gangsters and immortals played out by unique characters over the course of just 13 (well 16, I guess) episodes. Things wrapped up nicely in the end.

What a unique bunch of characters. Isaac and Miria are the obvious standouts. They're so cheerful and fun. I can see how they could be viewed as annoying, but I loved them. Then there's Claire who was one of the more interesting characters once you get to know him. Chane too. Jacuzzi is the most loyal, protective, all around best friend you could ask for. Ladd was a lovable maniac. Really, each of the main characters had a fairly distinct personality, and they all received ample screen time. Not many are forgettable, and the main ones are damn memorable. If I were to rate them based on how much I personally like them: Ennis, Jacuzzi, Claire, Firo, Miria.

I think the show did a good job with the 1920s-1930s aesthetic. From the streets, to the alleys, to the rivers, even the train, everything felt authentic. Haha, not as much alcohol consumption as I'm used to from this time period, but when you're in the immortal business, I guess you don't have time for such things.

The music was great. There's not much to complain about here. An authentic style that got my blood pumping during the big scenes. Oh, man, when Firo and co. came back outside to confront Szilard. Fantastic. I'm going to have to give the entire soundtrack a listen to, but it's more or less already one of my top favorites. It fit perfectly. Oh and that OP! It grew on me fast. Both the song and visuals were perfect for the show, and are incredibly memorable. I've been whistling that sucker all week. Strong contender for my top 5, maybe even 3 OPs.

**- The Bad -**

There isn't much to the characters. They just kind of "are." Background information is lacking on a bunch of them, and only a few of them see any actual development. A lot of the secondary characters looked similar. I was confused at parts, like mistaking the demon in human form for Luck Gandor as well as Claire and Dune during that scene where we learn Claire's The Rail Tracer. There also wasn't that strong of a focus on the mafia families. That's probably because the focus of the story wasn't on the families themselves. Even with the help of the veterans explaining things it was still a bit confusing who was involved with which family.

All in all, I think the anime suffered from being only 13 (or 16, sure) episodes. There was such a large cast of characters who are each individually interesting, but there wasn't nearly enough time to portray each of them they way they deserved.

I'm still not happy with how they revealed who The Rail Tracer was. Like I said, I really like Claire's character by the end, but I had no clue it was going to be him. He barely had any lines up until that point. He was an important part of the story before we knew who he was, moving about the train and killing the "bad guys." Then it's revealed The Rail Tracer's some (basically) new character. Egh.

The animation was average. I think everything was well choreographed, but the animation itself was nothing special. Especially the mouths. Half the time they weren't even fully opening, just showing teeth, but the lips were moving. It also suffered from the low detailed characters at points. [Something like this guy.](http://i.imgur.com/nnuWKWk.jpg) I'm sure it's a technique used to save money since not everyone is going to be analyzing the show frame by frame, but it happened a bit, even with main characters at times.

And while I don't personally agree with it, you could easily make the argument that the disjointed storytelling format was a bad idea. Even from just reading comments here it seems it turned off a lot of people, and even those who pushed through still found it frustrating and confusing.

**- The Ugly -**

**--- "Newia Realizes That the Review Cannot Have an Ending" ---**

Oh, wait. Yes it can. This is it.

Baccano! was a good show. Solid 9/10, or something like an 86-87 out of 100. I'll definitely rewatch it at some point as I'm sure I'll pick up new bits of info each time I do. I'm glad I joined this rewatch though. I wouldn't have watched it anytime soon without it. I remember /u/The-Sublimer-One suggesting it during the TTGL rewatch, and I had no idea what it was. Turned out to be a pretty great show.

I can't help but feel like Baccano! would be a perfect show to bring to the west. If Japan doesn't want it, they can suck it. I doubt this would ever happen seeing as anime, afaik, is always Japanese first, dubs second. Still, if HBO (*maybe* Netflix) picked this up somehow, people would watch it. It's thought provoking, violent, has interesting characters, has plenty of source material to already work with. If they kept it animated they could likely get back a good chunk of the original voice actors. Hell, I'd take a live action version as well. *Sigh.* This is all wishful thinking, I suppose.

Oh, and I saw Ant-Man the other day. Meh.

Anyway, what else has everyone been watching? What are you planning to watch next? Why should the rest of us give it a chance? You probably remember I watched Attack on Titan, and I'd recommend it for sure. I think next I'll probably move on to Space Dandy.

If anyone cares, here is my [MAL.](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Neawia) Maybe we have high compatibility, maybe you hate the way I rate shows. Take a look if you're curious.

If you were wondering, it's pronounced Nay-uh-wee-uh for Ne-a-wi-a.

Please, tag me, friend me! Everyone here was so friendly. I'd love to keep chatting outside of /r/anime threads. Send me a PM anytime, and I'll always respond. You wanna talk about a show we've both seen or some random show you just watched? Done. You wanna talk about why C.C. is or isn't best girl? Done. ^(Hope I don't come to regret that one) You want to talk about where to find that freaking English dub torrent for Nagi no Asukara?!? **DONE!** ^(seriously, help me out if you know)

I mean it though, I've chatted with some other users through PM, and it's been great. Don't feel weird about shooting me one anytime about anything. Who doesn't love seeing that orange envelope?

One final thanks to all of you for putting up with me. I do love doing these write-ups so I have to wonder what the next rewatch I join will be. Until then, it's been fun!

>A lot of the secondary characters looked similar. I was confused at parts, like mistaking the demon in human form for Luck Gandor

Yup,till episode 12/13 I was having difficulty identifying some of the mafia characters mainly. Berga resembles that Runorata jackass a lot while I still have hardship differentiating Nicholas from Ladd if focused on their faces only. Also, is it just me or does Keith in the OP/ED look a lot uglier than in the anime?

>There also wasn't that strong of a focus on the mafia families.

This was perhaps my biggest disappointment- I was expecting a lot of background info into the families and how they operate, their strengths and weaknesses, etc. They could make a Game of Thrones-esque series set in the 40s/60s where they fight for power/do whatever crime syndicates do, and I won't rate it below 8/10. This stuff intrigues me tbh.

>If Japan doesn't want it, they can suck it. I doubt this would ever happen seeing as anime, afaik, is always Japanese first, dubs second.

Sometimes, I think that the marketing executives in the anime industry don't have any idea of what would sell outside Japan.


>> ARTICLE

I guess that just wasn't the plan for the story. It wasn't supposed to be about crime. It was supposed to be about immortals. Perhaps the light novels go into more detail about the families.

> Sometimes, I think that the marketing executives in the anime industry don't have any idea of what would sell outside Japan.

I'm sure that's part of it. I wonder if they also want to keep all of their works to themselves. If, hypothetically of course, Baccano! were to come to the west, how much input would Japan be able to have in it's making? Would we even be allowed to call it anime if it isn't being made in Japan? What would it mean for the industry if more and more shows were adapted *only* in the west? Lots to think about, I guess.

I'm following the Madoka rewatch, watching it for the first time. Might pick up Durarara next, like a few people recommended.

Thanks Neawia! I really enjoyed your detailed write ups, and it was so much fun reading your speculation.


> Anyway, what else has everyone been watching? What are you planning to watch next? Why should the rest of us give it a chance?


I feel like I'll be watching Hunter x Hunter for the foreseeable future! I think I'm on episode...78? out of 148. It's pretty good so far, but it's just really long. Still, I feel that if I've gotten so far, I might as well finish it. 


I checked out your MAL - can I recommend that you watch Cowboy Bebop soon? (I can see you've got it on high priority, but still!) It's very different to Baccano! in storytelling structure, but it's also got a fabulous cast, a really cool setting and a great dub. Plus, if you liked Baccano!'s OST, I think you might like Cowboy Bebop's - which is just as jazzy, but more varied. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the kind words and reply!

Hunter x Hunter, I'm not against subs, but I'm a little intimidated by a series that long. I really want to watch it, but I'm not sure I could do it without a dub.

> Still, I feel that if I've gotten so far, I might as well finish it. 

Good attitude.

Ah, Cowboy Bebop. The anime everyone knows about before they watch anime. Yeah, I need to watch it already. You replied and convinced me. I think I'll watch Space Dandy, A Lull in the Sea (I've had my eye on it for a while, but I really don't want to stream it), and then Cowboy Bebop. Bebop comes second if I cant find a good download of A Lull in the Sea.

So yeah, I'll end up watching it this month probably. I really did enjoy Baccano!'s soundtrack. I actually listened to it while writing up most of today's post. Looking forward to the soundtrack for Cowboy Bebop now.

Haha, me too! That's why I decided to challenge myself. Yeah, I think a dub may have helped me out a bit here. I do watch a lot subbed, but Baccano! reminded me how easy it is to watch something dubbed. I don't know if HXH 2011 will get a dub though...but the 1999 series has one, I think. 


> You replied and convinced me

Yessss, success! Well, I hope you enjoy it! I don't think it's perfect by any means, but it's one of the few shows I've given a 10 to, just because it is one of my favourites.

I wonder if Bryke could handle something like this. The tone shift from TLA/LoK to Baccano! is pretty drastic. Hmmm, I bet they could, but they seem to do well with the younger crowd. Then again, Nick screwed them over so I wouldn't be surprised if they've gone somewhere else where they can explore more mature themes. I think I'd rather them create their own thing than spend the next five years adapting Baccano!

I'm just going to imagine you are actually printing it out and framing it. Anyway, you're welcome! You did a great job.

I too saw him post a slew of comments on the Madoka thread. I've seen it before so it's fun watching the reactions. I'm considering writing up a little something on it for it's final thread because I actually didn't like it nearly as much as everyone around here seems to do. That's my personal opinion though, don't let it discourage you from watching it. Madoka Magica is quite a good show. Maybe I'll see you two in there at some point.

> Like, I don't even know, man. Too many at the same time, that's for sure

How does everyone do this? Is it because most of your watched shows are currently airing? I don't know, I just can't focus on more than one at a time. I don't think I've ever had more than 2-3 at the same time. Example being recent; SAOII is airing on Toonami (so that's weekly and doesn't count), Baccano! was our rewatch show (so it sort of counts), and Attack on Titan was my main/binge show.

PS

I'm totally sending you a PM regarding the LNs.

I honestly could not care less what show you pick (if you ever do one again in the future). I will 100% join in the rewatch. These three shows you picked were all fantastic choices.

Okay, here it is, this is it--(holy crap)--this is where we all say goodbye and our final thoughts on the series and the *rewatch* and...and wow. I'd never participated in a rewatch thread before, and I have to say this one was a helluva time. The people participating in it have been swell--from fellow LN reader /u/accordionheart correcting my mistakes and being generally great, /u/Neawia's highly entertaining speculations and general camaradie, to /u/The-Sublimer-One ~~shitposting~~ GIFing the entirety of every single episode to /u/Mepwn to /u/matchamoon, /u/magnusarcanum, and oh God I'm going to run out of characters again aren't I?

Ahem. A big thank you once again to /u/angel10701 for hosting the rewatch. I loved it. 

Anyway, following in /u/Neawia's vein here's [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Revriley) -- please don't hesitate to send me a friend request if it suits your fancy (and/or on Reddit)! And don't ever hesitate to message me on Reddit or on MAL or whatever if you want to chat, whether it be about Baccano! or anime or anything else you can think of. I like meeting new people, and I'd love to stay in touch with you fellows in the future. A wonderful group of people. (Please excuse the CSS on my list--it's a work in progress)

(And once again, if you have any interest in reading the light novels, do contact me. Six others have already). 

Well, I don't want to make this too long since I'm not a newcomer to the show, but I guess maybe my thoughts might mean something to those who don't like the show or like it but don't love  it. Why is Baccano! my favorite anime and LN series ever? Good question. Sometimes I'm not really sure myself. I love the premise. I love the setting (immortal gangsters in 1930s New York? How could I not?) I love the music. I *love* the music.

I love the characters. All of them (well, okay, maybe not Fermet), even though you can make the argument that they're static or without depth (they get more in the LNs). Gosh do I love them. I could rave about them.  I love how the anime weaves the timelines together and brings it all to a conclusion that works. Are there flaws? Of course there are, and I accept them fully.

I'm still holding out hope that someday we'll get another season. I think I have to hold out hope, even though the odds are next to none. There's so many fantastic scenes just begging to come to life on screen. Maybe Japan will warm up to it. I don't know.

Please talk to me about stuff. I'm dreading the time when the conversation comes to a halt on this final thread, so lets make merry while we can. I feel like we're old friends, and at the same time, I feel as if I hardly know anything about you at all.

I'm going to edit this post with pictures from the LNs, so keep an eye out.

Hi! Thanks for your posts, it was a joy to read through them. I just had a couple questions about the LNs..

Do the LNs retain the same character that the anime presents and do it well? By this I mean the kinda zany comedy mixed in with the drama and action? I know its weird to ask if the source material is similar to an adaption, but if it has the same vibe to it, I'd love to read through them. Also are the LNs ongoing?

Thanks so much for everything.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like /u/accordionheart stepped in and answered when I was unavailable (thanks!), and I'll add to their comments that I think it definitely has the same vibe to it, one of the reasons being that the dub actually really captures how the characters talk in the light novels. Claire in the dub talks exactly like how Claire talks in the light novels, the President/Director of the Daily Days is as courteous and diplomatic as ever, and so on.

I have to say that ended up being pretty important, having the characters' 'feel' coming across so. When I read the light novels I absolutely get the same vibe I do from the anime (heck, sometimes I can even picture the scenes play out as if they were animated). 

> I'd love to read through them

Shoot me a PM and I'll help you out with that no problem. I think there's about 3-4 more light novels we should expect in the series, but for now there's 21 novels for you to get through. 
>> ARTICLE
> Do the LNs retain the same character that the anime presents and do it well? 


I think so! The drama and action is done pretty well, and I think every novel has at least one scene that you can point to as a climactic action scene. I also think the comedy is just as good, but I know that's more subjective. Isaac & Miria are just as hilarious as always, there's some really funny interactions between characters that didn't meet in the anime, and there's some new characters that are also pretty entertaining.


> Are the LNs ongoing?


'Fraid so. The last novel published was #21, 1935-C, in October 2013. The English translation was finished a few months ago, so we're all up to date, just waiting for Narita to publish 1935-D, which is meant to be the last one set in the 30s. I think he did say in a tweet that he wanted to publish something Baccano! related this year, but he's been focused a lot on DRRR!! recently.

God, that is so accurate.

Discussion. Let's do it. Your least favorite character. Fermet. I get it. It's not like I like him either. Guy's a dick. However, I think his character is fairly interesting. I guess it's possible the LNs will do some explaining, but for now I'm quire curious as to why he turned out like he did. He seemed so nice on the boat. He and that other man were Czeslaw's guardians. I suppose even then he was a dick, and he was just acting nice. I have to wonder why he's a dick. What the hell did he go through that as soon as they all received immortality, he tied down a child and being torturing to him. God that hot spike through your eyeball. Holy shit. That wouldn't even kill you unless he pushed it through your brain. Just pain. Just a lava hot spike in the center of your eye. Why am I typing this all out? I don't want to think about this anymore. Still. It was messed up. What made him messed up? Fermet's sick, but I'm curious.
>> ARTICLE
(Oh dear, sorry about the very late reply. We got some bad news yesterday and I had to go address it). 

Heh, I don't think he's my *least* favorite character, but I definitely don't like him. 

Fermet gets a few appearances in the 1705 and 1710 novels but its in 1711 where he really gets to work. Everybody thinks of him as a good and gentle person, to the point where he's even telling them the truth ("I don't think I'm like a father to Czes") and they all think he's just being humble. 

The narrative keeps telling us things like "nobody realized that this was a lie," etc, but the first time you see him being clearly manipulative is when he confronts Maiza and Gretto's father. He utterly destroys this man to the point where he raises his pistol (knowing it was empty) to his temple, clicks it impotently, and is reducing to a frail and weak nothing. 

As for his past...I'm not sure. I know that Fermet is supposed to be the child of (an) Inquisitor(s) (the Inquisitors were the ones who killed Huey's mother). I still don't know if there was something that twisted him into the way he is now or if he was 'born' that way. 
>> ARTICLE
Any reply is a good reply. Hope everything's going well.

Again, great info. I find it a bit comedic that Fermet tries telling them "I don't think I'm like a father to Czes" and everyone's all, "oh, you!"

I like to think that no one is "born" evil, so hopefully there was something he experienced when he was young that made him this twisted. Then again, it's a work of fiction so maybe Fermet is inherently evil.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your extremely informative and well-written posts - you reminded me of a lot of things that I had completely forgotten! You are very well versed in Baccano! knowledge.


Plus, you managed to convert a lot of people to reading the LNs, and we always need more LN readers! 


Can I ask who your favourite Baccano! character is, since you've spoken a bit about them? (Plus the characters are my favourite thing about the series!)
>> ARTICLE
I don't have a singular favorite--it would just be too hard--but think I have a few firm favorites and those would be: Maiza, Elmer, Keith, and Tick, with others like Begg, Elean, John & Fang, and Nile coming in close seconds. 

Then you have the characters who are larger-than-life or something along those lines, like Ladd, Claire, and Isaac & Miria, whom I'll always be (to varying degrees) attached to. 

I think I probably love them all in their own way.

What about you? Favorite character/s?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, singular favourites are pretty difficult in Baccano! I think mine do tend to vary depending on which arc I'm watching or reading, but I'm going to go for Maria, Czes and Firo, not really in any order. Other close favourites are Eve, Jacuzzi, Ennis and Victor. 


I really do love Isaac & Miria, but I think that's pretty much a given, considering how much I've talked about them, and yeah, I feel like they have such big personalities that I feel almost uncomfortable putting them on my list! 
>> ARTICLE
How much more of Issac and Miura do we see in the LNs, if any at all? And if so, what do they do?

Not really answering the question, but here's some pictures of everyone's favourite couple from the LNs - [1935-A](http://40.media.tumblr.com/efefb26a0c9293de61e09c8fc0fa61b4/tumblr_njv7tyKuMr1u6uas9o1_r1_500.png), [1935-B](http://41.media.tumblr.com/7e6120524b0143d00836d90e29e4ef87/tumblr_njv7tyKuMr1u6uas9o2_r1_500.png), [1931-Winter](http://40.media.tumblr.com/515d7acab1a4891da92e6921104e064e/tumblr_njv7tyKuMr1u6uas9o3_r1_500.png), [1935-C](http://40.media.tumblr.com/dc26c804138fcd394674e46281350b66/tumblr_njv7tyKuMr1u6uas9o4_r1_500.png).


For what it's worth, I think they actually have a speaking appearance in all (or almost all - I think there might be one exception) of the post-1700s LNs. Sometimes it's fleeting, but sometimes they have a prologue chapter dedicated to a conversation between them.
>> ARTICLE
They definitely continue making a scene. In 1933, after Firo knocks down their dominoes and yells at them, they rush off, upset, and decide to 'kidnap' Ennis and Ronnie to teach him a lesson. As to be expected, this ends up having...consequences. They end up getting caught up in the bombings of the Mist Wall and stuff.

They are pretty prominent in 1934, when they're (gasp) **seperated** of all things. Isaac is sent to Alcatraz (supposedly as comeuppance for him being a thief) so that Firo (also in Alcatraz) won't try anything funny. Miria's pretty shook up about it (she cried for three days straight) but resolves to be cheerful for Isaac and Jacuzzi's sake (she's staying at Jacuzzi's because her and Isaac's apartment is no longer safe).

It looks like they'll be involved in the 1935 arc too.

My typing won't convey it, but I'm laughing so hard at this. Firo just ruined their dominoes, well, really just stole their chance of knocking them over, they turned out fine. So Isaac and Miria kidnap Ennis and Ronnie. How the heck? Did they just not put up a fight? Funny stuff. Total IsaacxMiria stuff.
>> ARTICLE
One of my favourite shows, so many unique characters and a rich story, also kickass soundtrack and a really great dub. 

I love how this show handled the topic of immortality, and Miria and Isaac best pair, the only other pair who could even dare to challenge them in my opinion are Celty and Shinra.

By the way to everyone wanting a similiar experience, watch Durarara made by the same author, only the setting is not as interesting but some of the characters are a real treat.

**The following contains information as to what happens to the characters after the anime in the short term and long term. If you are planning to read the light novels and wish not to be majorly spoiled, I suggest scrolling past this now.**

**If you have any interest in reading the light novels, message me.**

**Note. Since this will be focused on the future, I will not bring up the 18th century novels in any way. Im also not touching the event of 1935 with a ten foot pole. Ill try to keep it as simple as possible.**

::

*Q. Szilard ate a lot of the 1711 *Advenna Avis* immortals. How many of them are still alive?*

There are ~~10~~ 9 immortals remaining, [](/s "depending or not whether you count Fermet as an immortal"): Maiza Avaro, Czeslaw Meyer, Sylvie Lumiere, Elmer C. Albatross, Huey Laforet, Nile, Denkuro Tougo, Victor Talbot, and Begg Garott.

**Dallas and Eve Genoard**
(Short term) *Q. Why wasnt he in the barrel that was dredged up? Did he escape?*

Nope. As soon as Dallas and his cronies were pulled out from the river, the Lamia (another group that follows Huey) showed up, knocked everyone out and kidnapped him. Thus begins the Slash arc in 1933.

Long term: Well, we dont hear anything about him in 2001-3. However, its said in a character sheet that he eventually becomes a well-liked philanthropist. Dont look at me, I dont write this stuff.

**Eve** gets taken hostage by Tick and Maria (well, mostly by Maria, since it was her idea, and she ends up more like a group member than a hostage) during the Slash arc so that Fang will take them to Jacuzzi. 

*Q. Do they EVER finally reunite I mean Jesus Christ*
Yep. At [the](/s "end of the Slash arc. Somewhat after the scene between him and Tick.")

**Ladd Russo, Lua Klein, and Graham Specter**
Short term: Ladd is sent to Alcatraz in 1934 and gets a robot hand. Okay okay, not a robot hand, but a hand made of metal. Hes fine with being there, because Hueys supposed to be there too and Ladd really wants to kill Huey. Graham ends up having to fill in for Ladd back home, and Lua is sort of held hostage.

Long term: Dunno. No mention of them is made in the 2001-02 arcs. (I said Im not touching 1935). 

**Firo and Ennis**
Short-term: In 1933, Ennis and Ronnie are kidnapped' by Isaac and Miria as revenge for Firo knocking over their dominoes and being a jerk in general. Firo doesnt know that its I&M who kidnapped them, and this becomes a major plot point in 1933. (He was a jerk because hes having trouble dealing with the implications of having Szilards memories). 

In 1934, Victor Talbot arrests Firo and sends him to Alcatraz as an inmate to keep an eye on Huey, who is somehow managing to keep in contact with his followers. 

Long term: Firo finally worked up the courage to propose to her after about fifty years (so around 1980). It takes them another twenty-two years to go on their honeymoon in 2002 on the yacht ship *Entrance*, accompanied by wingman Czes. 

**Claire and Chane**

Short-term: Claire, not wanting to go by Claire anymore (besides, hes legally dead since Dunes body is so mangled the officials identify it as Clairesand if youre legally dead you cant get married, can you?) buys the name Felix Walken and expects everyone to call him by that name (except Chane). Chane stays with Jacuzzis gang in the Genoard manor (more on that below), and grows fiercely protective/loyal towards them. Since they mean so much to Chane, they kind of fall under Claires sphere of interest too.

Long-term: Both of them are still alive (in their 90s) in 2002. Firo, on the yacht, bumps into [Claudia](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100830232950/baccano/images/e/ee/ClaudiaWalken.jpg) 
 and [Charon](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/baccano-charon_8910.jpg)
 Walken, their great-grandchildren. According to Claudia, great-grandpa Felix is salvaging a shipwreck in the Caribbean. He says hes going to find a pirates treasure sword to give to great-grandma.

By the way, Claudia and Charon are young stars in the film industryClaudia as a child actress, Charon as a stuntman. (Charons hair is naturally red, he just dyes it black). (Claudia is growing up to be just like Claire, solipsism and all; Charon takes after Keith). 

**Jacuzzi and Co.**

Short-term: After John Panel and Fan Linshan were fired (due to TFP being covered up), Chef Gregwall (their employer), through his connections, got them jobs at the Genoard mansion in NY. Thus, Jacuzzis gang ends up staying there as housekeepers in 1933. They get in a bit of trouble with the Martillos and the Gandors for their illegal brewing and get caught up in the events of the Mist Wall (the Slash). 

Long-term: I have no idea if theyre still alive by 2002 (though based on what Bobby says it sounds like Nice is), but if its any consolation they have a great-grandson Bobby, who in 2002 stows away with his small gang on the *Entrance* to get revenge on the Martillos.

**Maiza and Czes**

Short-term: Maiza is a supporting character in 1933 and 1934, but the way things are looking with 1935 its possible hell have some major role in the climax of the 1935 arc. Czes too seems to have been relegated to supporting character in 1933-34. At any rate, he lives with Firo and Ennis as Ennis little brother. Firo says that in the decades following the 30s Czes puts up a wall around himself, putting on his innocent child act. 

Long term: In the 1970s, Maiza and Czes go off in search of the remaining 1711 immortals to tell them that Szilard is no longer hunting them (and hopefully to round them all up). Its a road trip spanning a few decades. Maiza appoints Firo as the *conta  oro* in his place. In 2001, still looking on the hunt, [they](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/baccano/images/3/3c/029.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130709204807)
 (along with Sylvie and Nile) get a tip about where Elmer might be and the four of them head off to retrieve him from a odd village andthings are not as they seem. Action flick material.

In 2002, Czes acts as Firos wingman on their honeymoon on the *Entrance*. As things getbloody (you didnt think their honeymoon would go smoothly, did you?), Czes finds himself helping out Bobbys gang (it turns out that Czes is one of the targets' of the cult group Sample, which is supposed to be related to the cult that tortured Elmer when he was a child 300 years prior.) 

**The Gandors and Co.**

Short-term: Keith married a woman named Kate (shes great) who was an accompanist for silent movies until the advent of talkies, which of course put her out of business. Berga married a woman named Kalia. The brothers arent there for the 1933-34 arcs, but Tick Jefferson & Maria Barcelito, the Mexican assassin working for the Gandors are major players, confronting Jacuzzis gang and getting involved in the events of the Mist Wall. (Ticks climatic scene with Dallas is a thing of glory). 

Long-term: Dunno. I assume that the Gandor family had to change its policies like the Martillos did after Prohibition ended and the police started cracking down on people. (The Martillo family also had operated several casinos in the 30s - Firo had been the overseer of one - but gambling isnt as popular as it used to be). After Don Molsa invested in futures trading, they reaped a big profit that allowed them to create a chain of Alveare restaurants, which became their main source of income (the Camorra business a second source).

**Isaac and Miria**
Short-term: In 1933, they kidnap' Ennis and Ronnie as revenge for Firo being an ass, and get swept up in the Mist Wall incident. In 1934, a plainclothes cop comes by the Alveare to arrest them. Isaac, in a moment of insight, instantly recognizes him as a cop and sends Miria away, leaving only him to be arrested and sent to Alcatraz. (Its a great exchange between Isaac and the cop). While Isaac, Ladd and Firo get to know each other in prison, and with their apartment no longer safe, Miria goes to stay with Jacuzzis gang (Chane consoles her). 

Long-term: Thy dont show up in the 2002 incident, and its the very fact that they werent there that Huey believes is the reason [that] (/s "Fermets") plan didnt work.

**Vice-President and Carol:**
Short-term: In 1934, Carol and the VP happen to be on the same train headed to Chicago that Graham attempts to hijack. Graham gets to their cabin and after the VP reveals hes a badass he tells them the OVAs story starring Claire and Co. Events in Chicago eventually lead to Carol being held as collateral by Placido should Gustav do anything funny (she ends up locked in the same room as Lua). 

Long term: Apparently Carol will grow up to become "a famous reporter from the annals of history."

**The Daily Days:** They continue to be awesome. 

If you have any questions about the anime, want to request passages from the LNs or want to know what happens to other characters like Elmer and Huey, ghead and ask away! 

You might also want to check out Baccano!s [TvTropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano) as it has very useful stuff (check out the head scratchers tab). 

Ill post my personal thoughts in another post. If you'd like me to change something I've written above, please tell me. I'll see if I can include some pictures from the LNs.

Would be so great to see this internal conflict, since Firo's been such a nice guy so far. Having that twisted old man in your head would mess anyone up, I guess.

>Long-term: Both of them are still alive (in their 90s) in 2002.

Sometimes I forget that Claire and Chane are not immortal.

Questions:

Is Claire's real name ever revealed? 

What happens to Luck?

What was Fermet's plan that didn't work out? 
>> ARTICLE
1) Claire Stanfield is his real name. He abandons it in favor of Felix Walken, a name that he buys off one of the other Felix Walkens (assassins). That's why his great-grandchildren are Claudia and Charon Walken, not Claudia and Charon Stanfield. 

2) He's still around. I don't think he ever gets married like his brothers. In 1933 he sends Tick and Maria to 'negotiate' with Jacuzzi's gang. At the end of the arc, he calls Maria into his office, where he's already been talking with Tick.

> "Wow, what's the occasion? You want to congratulate me over my victory too, Luck? Thanks so much, amigo!"

> The smile on Luck's face stayed fixed there like a mask. "Mister Tick tells me that the two of you went through quite a lot these past two days. It must have been very demanding."

> "Nope! It was a piece of cake, amigo!" Maria replied, grinning rakishly back. She was so excited that she didn't notice how Tick's ever-present smile looked a tad strained.

Poor Tick. Luck is so done with everything. I think he's have more of a role in the 1935 stuff. 

3) Oh cripes is the 2002 incident complicated. [ ](/s "Fermet's") a double (triple?) agent working for all three of the main factions involved in the hijacking case. So complicated. I believe he was trying to replicate the events of the Flying Pussyfoot on the sister ships *Entrance* and *Exit.* (Possibly he was doing this all just so he could torment Czeslaw). 

I might spoiler tag this. I'm tagging [ ](/s "Fermet") because he's probably one of the biggest walking spoilers in the series aside from Claire. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for these answers! For some weird reason I was under the assumption that 'Claire' wasn't his real name haha. 

[](/s "Wait. Fermet's still alive in 2002?? I thought he had been devoured by Czes.")
>> ARTICLE
What a ride! 

Mafia shows aren't my usual cup of tea, but I'm so glad I stuck with this one. The storytelling was intricate, confusing (on purpose), subtle and just so well done. It was able to make me fall in love with so many of its quirky, complex characters in such a short amount of time. I wish there were more episodes so that each one of the MCs could have been fleshed out more. 

Thank you all for making this show so enjoyable for this first-timer. Your webms, gifs, recaps, timelines, LN info and discussions made a great show even better and really helped me make sense of some of the confusing bits. This was my first rewatch on r/anime, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but everyone has been just so awesome and friendly. Gonna miss discussing Baccano with you guys! 
>> ARTICLE
It was great. Fun to read the first timers' comments. Sadly didn't have the time/energy to write something to the last discussion thread since I was involved with two 2h movie discussions that night. 

As for the show, my opinion hasn't really changed. It's still my favorite show. I just love the style of it so much. Was kind of shocking how much they showed during the first episode. It was much less confusing this time. Really surprised me how well the dub was done. But then again I'll probably will wait a few years before I watch it again because of diminishing returns. Yes, it is kind of sad that there most likely wont be a second season but I don't think this series needs one. I'm fine with how this ended. 

To those who liked Baccano! I can only recommend [Durarara!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6746/Durarara!!) since this is such unique show. Same original creator although I don't find it *as* good but there is much more episodes to it since first season was 24 and now airing 2nd cour of 3 cour second season.

> Yes, it is kind of sad that there most likely wont be a second season but I don't think this series needs one. I'm fine with how this ended. 

I suppose I agree. The series ended quite well and can stand on it's own. I'd still love to see more, though.

> I can only recommend Durarara!! since this is such unique show.

Oh, Durarara!! gets a sequel, and five years later no less. Well, guess I'll just have to watch that at some point then.
>> ARTICLE
I love Baccano! 


The anime may have flaws - the production values aren't massively high and it can be pretty confusing at times. But, still, I love it. The characters are all really interesting, despite how numerous they are; the setting of 1930s New York is really cool; the soundtrack is amazing; the plots are really entertaining; and it manages to go from light-hearted and funny to tense horror, from non-stop action to emotional highs, all in the blink of an eye.


I do think the characters are what makes Baccano! so enjoyable to me though. I know I've said that almost every cast member is my favourite throughout my comments, but here is my official top five (from the anime): Isaac & Miria (because...they're Isaac & Miria, and I love their relentless optimism), Czes (because he went from the cool evil kid to managing to make me cry in 2 episodes flat), Jacuzzi (super selfless and heroic and way too nice for Baccano!), Rachel (I really liked her little arc with the train tickets) and Firo (because he's main character-ish). 


 I rated it an 8 after my first watch through, but I think I'd be tempted to bump it up to an 8.5/9 after a second time around. 


If anyone's interested, despite the amount that some of us may have already talked about the LNs in these threads, I'd thoroughly recommend the LNs, especially since they've just been licensed by Yen Press and will have official English translations soon!!! I know I'm super excited about this because I honestly never thought the day would come. I can have real physical copies! And support one of my favourite Japanese franchises. 


Finally, to everyone on this thread - thank you! I've enjoyed every second of it - whether it's been reading first time watchers' speculation, reading useful timeline notes, watching really awesome gifs, or reading the absolutely fantastic LN posts of /u/Revriley1. I also want to say a big thanks to /u/angel10701 - you were a great host and thank you for the rewatch! Hope it's a good way to go out on. 


That's about it. If anyone has any questions/ideas/whatever, feel free to message me about them! And, [goodbye](http://31.media.tumblr.com/5d456fdf226f432ee0e8dee9528395a8/tumblr_nkuv3hGytx1r5o4ldo2_r2_400.gif)!

Yeah, that's a really good point. They did a very good job with that. It all meshed together quick well. Didn't feel weird at all.

> and Firo (because he's main character-ish). 

I really liked Firo. I remember really liking him after the first few episodes, and I don't usually like characters with undying affection. Firo stuck out, though. I wish we got to see more of him since he is main character-ish, but he wasn't present much in the middle of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I agree with you there! I think he was the first character I ever liked in the show, the first time around, and I think it's pretty hard for me to put my finger on why I like him beyond the fact that he just is very likeable. And I still like him immensely - all of my favourite LNs are the ones where he has a major role.


He does drop out a bit during the middle, since he's not on the Flying Pussyfoot, but I think his actions at the end of 1930 do make up for it, because he's so instrumental in the climax.


>> ARTICLE
Hope the first time watchers enjoyed this as much as I did. Love this series!
>> ARTICLE
Baccano is a reminder to why I love anime. The setting, story, soundtrack and the characters are all wonderfully mixed together into something that's unique to not only other mediums, but is also unique to many other animes.

The show is a fun ride and I can't recommend this series enough.

**And here we are. Episode 16. The last episode. Someone hold me.**

**As I said, Im going to be restricting my notes to the events happening in the episode and save the rest (what happens after) for tomorrow.**

**So if youre wondering, for example, what in the fuckity fuck happened with the [barrel](http://imgur.com/VagVYke) *and where in the world is Dallas Genoard what just happened*youre going to have to wait until tomorrow.**

And nowFIN: Episode 16: Carol realizes the story cannot have an ending. (How Apt). 

::

To clarify what Nicholas is saying, everything that happened on The Flying Pussyfoot was pretty big and secret and it wouldnt do if the public got wind of what happened. Strings are pulled. Records are destroyed, people are paid off, the train cars are dismantled and bam. Gone. TFP legally no longer exists. (Hiding the evidence means firing the employees, which includes Fan Linshan and John Panel).

(from the anime) Nicholas: the funds can be traced back to Nebula and Senator Beriam.

 Hhhholy shit. I completely forgot that Nicholas name drops Nebula in this episode. Where do I even begin to explain Nebula? Its thisbig and mysterious corporation in the light novels. To the public, its a R & D company for military equipment. Behind the scenes, Nebula is heavily involved in the scene of studying immortality. It has ties to both Manfred Beriam and Huey Laforet. I wont say much more than that.

By the way, in the anime its implied Senator Beriam is interested in becoming immortal. In the light novels, he absolutely hates immortals and wants to exterminate them all. The reasons for this are unclear. At any rate, he has more of a role in the novels.

I believe thats Sullivan talking to Ladd.

I already talked a little about [Js gang](http://imgur.com/eqPbBqe) and the Genoards in the Ep 15 notes. Again, expect more on that tomorrow. 

Even the other fictional characters call him Sugarcube. Incredible. His real name is Rubik. And he knows what the President looks like. Screw Claire, forget Ronnie, clearly Rubik is the most powerful character in Baccano!. 

Senator Beriam genuinely doesnt get why Rachel doesnt want his money. In the book, his wife is basically like look, sorry ~~my husband is a douche~~ about that, Manfreds not very good at expressing himself and you really should take the money. 

Also I think at some point or another Manfred sees his daughters smiling face and is actually glad theyre safe. (Hes still a terrible person, but I guess this humanizes him a little?)

And finally the anime gives you the backstory on her father, who as Ive said was framed by Mr. Turner for the equipment failure that he (the father) specifically warned him might happen. 

Rachel only uses half of the money he gives her to buy all those tickets (which represent the fare for all the times she stowed away). The other half she keeps for herself (she needs the money for a doctor to treat her injuries after all). 

Even Ronnies [having fun](http://imgur.com/KRMLAVb). I live for the moments Ronnie Schiatto, demon extraordinaire, gets caught up in the little things.

[Maizas face. Firos face.](http://imgur.com/7iYxXWS) Theyre all so into it. 

[Look, both Maiza and Ennis are happy.](http://imgur.com/rYdZBRX) My heart. 
[Claire](http://imgur.com/TnEU6kL)
 and Rachel actually (return to) go to the Alveare for lunch instead of a random restaurant. You anime watchers missed out on seeing [Rachel in a dress](http://imgur.com/79vgXXP). (Randys eavesdropping like anything. No shame).

Claire will indeed eventually start using another name that he expects everybody to call him by. Only Chane is allowed to call him by his real name. 

Ah, Claire. Unknowingly tactless as always. 

> Well, theres this girl Im in love with.  How do you think I should confess to her? Oh, but dont worry, Im not talking about you.

> I think you should start by learning the meaning of tact. But thank you for the warning.

> Though his lack of sensitivity was astounding, Rachel decided to be frank with him. 

Actually, the anime cut out a scene back on the Flying Pussyfoot, when he and Rachel have a talk. Rachel pleads with him not to kill any more people on the trainif he wants to kill someone, kill her. Claire asks why, she says hes dirtying the pride of the train and starts to cry (talking about how she and her father shared a love for trains). 

Claire in the end fished around in his pocket and gave her a bloodstained ticket, effectively legitimizing her being on the train (after the passengers arrive at the station, the police officers and station workers were going around checking their tickets. Claire did Rachel a huge favor.)

And then he says something that Im sure the romantics out there will find exciting:

> "You're a pretty impressive dame, too. If I hadn't met the knife lady just now, I mighta fallen for you. Though I guess we might meet again one day. 

Oh yeahyou know how I said the Flying Pussyfoot was dismantled and taken apart? Well, not entirely. Theres one scrap of physical evidence remaining from the train and that is the message Chane carved into the roof. If I remember right, Claire literally ripped the message out of the roof of the car and keeps it somewhere. 

Anyway, back to the episode.

[Both their expression in this conversation are the best](http://imgur.com/cPEQ1Ip). Actually, the fact that this meeting even exists in the first place is the best.

And for the sake of argument, lets say she is trying to kill me.  I dont necessarily think that necessarily means that she isnt in *love* with me.

Ah, Claire. Puppy love and bashful. Its amazing that the guy who so easily kills the shit out of people in the most brutal way possible is also the same guy who ends up blushing about his crush to someone hes asking girl advice from. 

> The conductor slowly began to reveal his humanity. Rachel almost began to like him as a person being at this point, but what he said next completely vaporized such sentiments.

> "Well, I know I'll get things my way eventually. It might take some time, but if she doesn't like me back, I'll make her love me, no matter how many years it takes."

> This was a kind of thinking that might get him labeled a stalker in later generations. Though Rachel was nonplussed by Claire's tone, completely lacking in any sort of tenacity, she decided to give him some advice. 

In the light novels Nicholas never goes to eavesdrop on the showdown because that particular showdown doesnt happen and LN Nicholas is actually a decent guy. ([He looks a lot like Ladd in this shot](http://imgur.com/Bwivnnj)) - hey, youd think a guy who worked in military intelligence would be able to better defend himself. 

What the animes doing here is basing this scene off Claire kidnapping the information broker *Henry*, whod been blackmailing Edith (and saying things like I gotta get the Rail Tracers testimony) because - hey, youve been being all unfriendly asking to talk to me, well, here I am - and to ask him where Chane was. So it was Henry who nearly met his maker, not Nicholas Wayne. 

Aw, that son of a bitch. I just like how Nicks VA delivers his lines. Gets Nicks personality down to a T.

This encounter between Elmer and Sylvie also doesnt happen in the books. Sylvie and Elmer dont actually have a reunion [until](/s "2001"). 

In the LNs, Sylvie Lumiere is stated to be extraordinarily beautiful. I think the anime conveys that successfully. 

Sylvie doesnt take any of Elmers shit and its great. Still, the two continue to be friends. Also you can tell a little by the dialogue that Sylvie really never really gets over Gretto. Basically she drank the immortality elixir because she wanted to live solely to avenge Gretto by devouring Szilard. Now that hes dead, shes got to come up with a new, lesssingle-minded goal. 

Both she and Maiza see a bit of Gretto in Firo. 

I dont think Ronnie and Elmer have this particular chat in the books, but holy hell do I love it and Im very glad the anime includes it. I love everything about it - from Elmer slapping the Demon on the back to Ronnie coughing up a storm (everything Ronnie does, basically) it's just swell.

 Ive lived over 200 years now and theres probably no meaning to life. So isnt much better for everyone to smile and enjoy themselves while theyre here? Free from the hatred and the sorrow that consumes, them, yeah?  *proceeds to smack the devil on his back again*

I dont think its specified whether [Ronnie](http://imgur.com/RDzOL3J) is actually The Devil or just a demon. Since the novels refer to him as the demon I guess Ill go with the latter. 

Such an arbitrary fellow. - Love that line. 

I like how they have the Vice-President and Carol [pass by Elmer](http://imgur.com/8BKhG2h) and [Ronnie](http://imgur.com/F9UipOv). I almost forgot that they actually exist within the setting and that they aren't just meta characters. 

Speaking of those two, at one point in the novels they're on a train which is kinda hijacked by Graham and his crew and the VP reveals he's a badass. 

I love the ending message from the VP, though it's kind of sad because the chances of a 2nd season/remake are almost none and this hits hard. Disregarding that, it's a great way to end an anime.

Actually no, it's the "what's next on Baccano!" that's both perfect and soul-destroying at the same time. 

I also love the fade-out on the mouse and then the music suddenly returns for the last hurrah by Isaac and Miria. Everything about how episode 16 ends is wonderful.

(I'll edit in the screenshots)

Of course Claire ripped the roof of TFP right off since it has Chane's message to him on it. That's so perfect.

Doesn't Ronnie imply at some point during the [LNs](/s "that he was once a normal human being/turned alchemist/turned immortal/...turned demon? Can't remember which book that's in though, sorry!") I guess he could be lying about that though.

[A bit late, but IIRC:](/s "Ronnie was one of many clones of a ~300BC alchemist (greek or roman or something, probably) that figured out the grand panacea and several other things and somehow Ronnie got out, consumed his creator and his sibling clones and gained omniscience and omnipotency.

All the extra info about Claire just make me like him more. He and Chane are so sweet in their own strange way. 

> "You're a pretty impressive dame, too. If I hadn't met the knife lady just now, I mighta fallen for you."

Rachel would be a good match for him too. They both really love trains. Now I'm imagining them riding off into the sunset together, on the rooftop of a train...

Can't wait for your post-series notes. :)

As always, A+ post. Amazing. You are awesome.

Awww yeah. She finally took off her fatigues!

That's some pretty important stuff. Claire's definitely a good guy but in the weirdest way.

> And then he says something that Im sure the romantics out there will find exciting:

Yes. After learning about Rachel and Claire's love of trains (from both you and the anime), they seem like a good pair for each other. Plus they're both heroic and acrobatic.

> In the LNs, Sylvie Lumber is stated to be extraordinarily beautiful. I think the anime conveys that successfully. 

Hehehe, I thought she looked old. Still beautiful though.

> from Elmer slapping the Demon on the back to Ronnie coughing up a storm

That scene was hilarious. I know he's a human at the moment, but it's still the freaking devil. He couldn't get a word in he was coughing so much.

> the VP reveals he's a badass

Like, I don't even want to know what he does. The way you stated it, "oh, the train is hijacked and the VP *reveals* he's a badass." Like he's making an announcement. "Everyone! Everyone gather round. I... am a badass!" *gasps*

> Also--should they be spoiler tagged or not? They're not spoilers for the anime, so I dunno....

At the very least, as I'm sure you already planned to do, put a clear warning at the beginning of your post telling everyone you'll be talking about spoilers from the light novels. It'd definitely be annoying to spoiler tag all of that.

I still feel Devil is poor word to call him by. I stick to Entity because he's far too ambivalent, some could even say benevolent to be a devil.

** Well folksthats a wrap! Almost. We still have tomorrow. **

**Congrats, everybody. Congrats to the newcomers whove stuck with the show until the end, to both those whove been commenting every day and to those silent folks whove been watching the show with us the whole time but kept their peace (speaking of which, I hope to see you fellows in the comments section  and that means tomorrows wrap up thread too!).**

**And most of all, congratulations and a sincere thank you to /u/angel10701 for hosting this rewatch. Its been a blast. Expect more cloying sentimentality from me tomorrow.**

And nowepisode 15.

Yep. Nices [injuries](http://imgur.com/EcjZTOk) were a result of her own mistakes, as opposed to her earning them in some turf war. She was afraid shed never be able to recognize anyone again, as her left eye was badly damaged by the shrapnel. 

The [white-haired guy](http://imgur.com/gdkqUf8) with Nick? Thats Jack from the LNs! 

The talk between Chane and Jacuzzi in the hospital (he was treated by Doctor Fred, by the way) uses elements of a previous [conversation](http://imgur.com/p5djU2w) they have in the LNs. In the novel, Huey is moved after the train incident, and Chane shows up at the place where the transfer will take place fully prepared to bust Huey the hell out of custody when Huey spots her and mouths at her to not worry. She hesitates, loses her chance to rescue her father, and Jacuzzi appears out of nowhere. 

By this time, Jacuzzi is already letting Chane stay with his gang in NY, so thats not why hes there. No, hes there because he figured out on his own that 1) shes probably related to Huey and 2) it was likely shed try and rescue him. Chane doesnt get it. Jacuzzi explains that they were worried since she went on her own, and that if shes really that determined to rescue Huey, well, shed need help. 

*Jacuzzi was prepared to help Chane rescue Huey.* This is incomprehensible to Chane, for reasons Ill explain in a little bit. 

Nice and Nick were acting so strange. You bet they were. The first few days Chane stayed with them the two were visibly terrified. This, Chane expected. That Nice and Nick would gradually lose their fear is something she didnt. She doesnt understand the gangs treatment of her at all. 

This is because Chane has trouble with the concept that relationships dont have to be utilitarian. That people will do nice things for other people without expecting anything in return. Why would Jacuzzi want to help her? *Theyre trying to use me. To use my father. To protect himself.* There must be a reason.

Im confused. I dont understand you people at all. Of course she doesnt. Theyre helping her without expecting anything in return.

 Poor Czes. Claire terrifies him. 

Speaking of CzesCzes isnt actually scared of dying. He doesnt care; after all, hes lived for a long time. The reason hes scared of being devoured is because hes:

>  afraid of another person discovering the twisted horror that existed between Czes and him. Czes considered this the greatest humiliation and terror that could ever occur to him.

If some of you are confused as to why Ian/John is afraid of making trouble for the Genoards, thats not your fault; the anime never actually bothers to explain what he means. Ill go over this in more detail tomorrow. The short jist of it is that John and Fang are now working for Eve and, with her consent Jacuzzis gang is now [staying](http://imgur.com/Ln7zlrf) in her manor in New York (she has at least one other manor in New Jersey). 

When Chane receives the dress in the novel a bunch of Jacuzzis gang members crowd around her in a noisy commotion, all talking to her at ounce. Once Chane realizes that theyre there, shes shocked that she didnt notice so many people enter the room. Had her senses dulled? Why wasnt she on guard?

> *It cant beI couldnt have accepted these people into my world!*

The Hyaah girl is Chaini. Shes part of the gang. Thats literally all she ever says. 

Just as Chane doesnt understand Jacuzzis gang, she doesnt understand Claire and his sincerity toward her. 

Shaft (the driver; Grahams right hand man, [&](/s "a vessel of Sham") has become more bold and outspoken ever since Graham slammed a wrench into his gut, as Graham notes. 

There is no middle ground for Graham. Either hes incredibly apathetic and down (death to tedium!) or hes gunning to go, all energy and fire. 

[Poor Nick](http://imgur.com/QHu3hkh). In the novel, its a random friend/gang member that was whopped with the wrench. Im glad they made it Nick (someone we recognize) in the anime.

Apparently, Nice is the one who most wanted to stop Jacuzzi, and she was also the one who most wanted to respect his determination to go alone.

Chane is subconsciously attacking Graham as though he were Ladd, which is why her attacks arent quite working. (She does realize her mistake, though).

Thats right, Jacuzzi got a tattoo (what kind of guy gives a tattoo to a kid is what I want to know) so that people would stare at his face too and Nice wouldnt have to feel so self-conscious. What a guy.

Why does Chane still want to fight Graham? She doesnt understand it herself, but she knows that if she defeats Graham, Jacuzzi will be safe. This is where Chanes eventual incredible loyalty to Jacuzzi and his gang begins. 

There are about 30-40 members of Jacuzzis gang in total. Its pretty something that Jacuzzi knows all of their voices well enough to pick a strangers voice out from the crowd.  

You may have noticed that Claire also told the Gandors in New York that he no longer goes by the name Claire Stanfield. Ill explain why tomorrow, since the anime never tells you his reasoning. 

 During Claires little spiel Chane is internally monologuing like no one has ever internally monologued before. The important part is that she realizes right now she feeling the same way about Claire and Js gang as she does for her father. She felt that she never wanted to lose these people who had entered her world.

But then againIm not ordinary. I cant tell whether Claire is the smoothest motherfucker to grace this planet oror something else. His confidence is extraordinary. 

> Not even Chane herself knew if this was the emotion called love. After all, she had never once heard the words I love you from her father as she lived in her world. 

You can understand why shes having so much trouble with this.

Dont get Claire wronghe knows Chanes perfectly capable of handling herself. This isnt man rescues damsel in distress, this is: Js gang is part of Chanes world, Chane is a part of my world, so if you mess with them you mess with me, you got it, pal? 

[What a reaction](http://imgur.com/5w8fezE). Though, anyone who manages to take down Ladd Russo is clearly someone you dont want to cross.

We have reached the penultimate Baccano! thread. The one in which there are no episodes left to watch. I'm sad now.

**--- Episode 15 - The Delinquents That Arrive at the High-Class Neighborhood Are the Same as Always ---**

Wow those were some fantastic screams when Nice blew her face up.

Jacuzzi's so funny. So nice. So adorable. Hahaha! "I'm confused. I don't understand you people at all... Understand you people? Does she mean Nice and Donny?"

"Hiya!" Who the heck?

"I'm scared. What am I afraid of?" Ummm, a crazy murdering stranger covered in blood proposed to you on top of a train.

[I love this guy's face.](http://i.imgur.com/4bdQ74X.jpg) He knows Graham's just messing around, and it's likely something he has to deal with on a daily basis.

"Hiya?" "Hiya." "Hiya!" Who are these hiya kiddos? [The one looks like a mini Jacuzzi.](http://i.imgur.com/ra7SSzf.jpg)

Jacuzzi's really making a case for my favorite character.

Oh, man. He tattooed his face for Nice. What a guy. How did it take the two of them so long to kiss?

Donny talking sense. Nice, you crazy bomb lady.

Haha! Claire just blocking out Graham.

Chane you deserve happiness. Say yes! God I hope Claire doesn't have ulterior motives.

Tell him what you did to Ladd, Claire... yes!

**--- Episode 16 - Carol Realizes That the Story Cannot Have an Ending ---**

I'm going to miss this OP. [Especially the Miria shuffle.](http://www.gfycat.com/FancyGorgeousArthropods)

[This right here,](http://i.imgur.com/HKmJE6l.jpg) this is the face of a man who is so utterly happy with everything in his life. He deserves it.

Fantastic. Sugar Cube is the only one to see the president because he offered him a sugar cube. Someone finally accepted! Success!

Czes, you big crybaby.

Watching Claire act "normal" is great. He used to be bloody and acrobatic. Now he's eating penne and talking about marriage. Ha! Even Rachel agrees he's acting human.

Claire and Graham playing catch.

The old lady. Finally. Sylvie! Wow. Wait. She's not old?

The promise! Good one. Maiza's safe, and Elmer can try to make the devil smile.

Carol and the VP. Really interesting conversation about stories (as they walk past the devil). The mouse!

No way! Dallas got out! How the hell...

[Impressive, Maiza.](http://i.imgur.com/2leANvS.jpg)

[Merry Christmas!](https://a.pomf.cat/ozicit.mp4) These two. They're too much.

**--- Post Episode Thoughts on the Future ---**

Well, we're at our end. Quite an enjoyable series. As well as episode 13 wrapped things up, the ending to 16 did it just as well or better. It was great to get a little more info on some of the lesser developed characters like Chane and Claire. Graham was an interesting addition, but with only three episodes to get to know him, it was a little awkward having him there. That scene with the VP and Carol was fantastic, only to flow into Isaac and Miria being their usual awesome selves. Good way to end things.

I actually have one last [speculation, no spoilers](/s "I don't think we were told the details of what kind of daughter Chane was to Huey. Homunculus or normal conception? If she was conceived normally, I'm going to say that Sylvie is her mother. Similar accents, and they look the same. Could be.")

Claire is too crazy to have ulterior motives.

He had over a year to struggle around down there. Give someone enough time and they could beat their way out of a jail cell.

It was cement! I'm curious though as to how Dallas' and the others' immortality works underwater. Would they stay dead after drowning or come back to life and immediately drown again? Would coming back to life mean the water empties from their lungs only to come back in? I don't know. Curious thing, that.

Yeah, since immortality preserves their bodies at the time they drank the elixir (according to one of the LN context posts a few threads ago).

Claire is so confident it's scary. He's pretty much earned the right to be, though. I thought maybe he'd just headbutt the wrench and it'd go spinning back to Graham.

The end is nigh, everyone!


Jacuzzi's actions in episode 15 make a good case for him being my favourite character. "That's Jacuzzi. He's always thinking of everyone else instead of himself, and then he'll just do something. So he's on the losing end a lot, y'know. But he's always got lots of friends around him." He is, by far, the most selfless character in Baccano! and it just gets me. 


I also love the scene where Claire declares his love for Chane, and Graham is just bobbing around in the background, trying to get a look in, but Claire is having none of it. 


Gotta say, my favourite thing in episode 16 is Nicholas and Elean's faces when Mr Sugarcube goes behind the stack of papers to the President. It's perfect. Closely followed by Senator Beriam throwing cash at Rachel and saying "a token of my gratitude" in the least grateful voice ever. 


Nice one, Claire, you induced a pathological fear of redheads into Czes. I do love Claire and Rachel's dinner date though. According to the LNs, Rachel becomes Claire's second-closest female friend, after Chane. Another weird friendship, that's strangely enjoyable. Also, Claire is a huge romantic dork when he's not murdering or torturing everyone.




I like that Baccano! actually answers [TV Tropes warning] [What Happened to the Mouse?] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse) very literally. But the reason that I like episode 16 as the ending of the series, is that the framing device comes to a conclusion, with our two meta guys, Carol and Gustav, discussing the importance (or lack thereof) of endings. Episode 13 does have a great ending, but I just love how this rounds everything off - "it's a lot more fun to imagine the rest!" And the story leaves lots of loose ends too - how will Claire and Chane's relationship go on from here? What is Ladd's plan? What happened to Dallas? I guess you'll have to imagine it! ~~Or read the LNs...~~

All things come to an end, I suppose.  At least it was a fun ride!

**Ep. 15/OVA 2:**

* Poor, little Nice.  I expected the exploson.  I did not expect the screams. :(

* It seemed like Jacuzzi knew Eve.  Am I just forgetting when/how they met, or was it just based on common information/the ransom note itself?

* Graham, it's like things just come out of your mouth at random.  You were just saying how muteness could be a blessing because so many people waste their energy on unnecessary words...

**Ep. 16/OVA 3:**

* I know it's just an act, but seeing Ladd so low-key was weird.

* **EDIT:**  Oh, Jacuzzi's gang is working for Eve now.  Got it.

* Dallas escaped?!  Well then.  Sad to see he didn't take Keith's gift with him.  What about his two friends?

* They actually answered [What Happened to the Mouse](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse)!  Both literally and Carol-y.

Not much else for me to add.  At least, nothing else that comes to mind.  I probably won't post any diatribes tomorrow, but I look forward to reading and replying to all of yours.  :)

**Ep 15**

* Yay, Chane's making more friends.

* I wonder if drinking the elixir makes you stop aging mentally as well. Like, does Czes think like a 200 year old man, or an incredibly a worldly-wise kid?

* I love how Graham's lackey doesn't even bat an eye when Graham starts to fake-assault him and shout 'Die! Die!'. He's used to this shit.  

* Graham is such a drama queen.

* Jacuzzi offers himself in place of Chane AND got that tattoo on his face just so that Nice would feel better about her scars. How can one person be this awesome????

* Vino interrupts the fight to propose to Chane while Graham hilariously tries to butt in (and gets swatted away). Their fight is gonna be epic!

**Ep 16**

* Is that Senator Beriam in the car with that Runorata dude? He's so shady. 

* Vino having lunch with Rachel while asking for dating advice. It's fun to see him clueless about something. 

* He gets to show off some fancy acrobatic moves while fighting with Graham. Wait, it's over? And no one got hurt? That's probably a first for this show. 

* Graham is a really interesting character too, although he talks too much.

* Whoa, Sylvie was planning to devour Firo so that she could be reunited with Gretto! Glad she changed her mind. 

I wasn't expecting to enjoy the OVAs this much - I thought the focus would just be on the new story-line - but we got to see more of everyone including Rachel, Vino/Claire and Huey. Even if they did leave us with 'open-ended stories', this was a fantastic ending.

I thought by "being together with Gretto", she meant that she was gonna ask herself to be devoured by Firo so she could share mind-space with Gretto.

Just finished  episode 13, about the watch 14.

Really, really loving the show. Don't want the rewatch to end!

Can one of you experts fill me in on something, though?

So we know that the special cargo on the train (I think!) were cases of bombs. Now...were these bombs placed by the Black Suits or the White Suits? I know the black suits were followers of Huey and were kidnapping the train to get to the congressman's family so that Huey could be released and so forth. The white suits were trying to random money by taking over the train and...I want to say crashing it? So they're just happening to be bombs has nothing to do with the fact that Nice is sort of a specialist with bombs. Her and the gang took the cases and it was revealed in episode 13 they they sold 'em off for some good cash.

Secondly, and I think this maybe has been explained, but I forgot....who are those kids hanging around Jacuzzi and the gang?

The special cargo was a new model of explosives/bombs. They were not placed by either the Black Suits or the White Suits--no, they're actually there courtesy of Czeslaw Meyer, who's transporting them (illegally) to NY to sell to the Runorata family.

Jacuzzi's gang was on the train in order to steal the secret cargo because 1) as you said, money, and 2) people would die if the cargo reached NY. 

As for the kids, they're part of Jacuzzi's gang. The entire gang probably consistents 30-40 people in total. 
>> ARTICLE
Gotcha!

So how did Jacuzzi's gang know about the bombs being there? Was that explained?

Also, and I'm sure this is answered in the LNs, how has Czeslaw...come about all these years? His prominence? How did he get the bombs? What's he been up to for 200 years?
>> ARTICLE
> How did he get the bombs? 


So in the LNs, Czes says that he created the explosives for his work. I think his absorption of Fermet's memories may have helped, but he's become a pretty good alchemist and a bomb expert at some point over the past 200 years, and I think he's just been making bombs and selling them as a business. 

>> ARTICLE
Ah /u/accordionheart explained, Czes makes his living by making and selling bombs. Here's the passage from the LNs:

> Czes immediately thought of the cargo he had hidden in the car behind this one. It was going to be sold to the Runorata Family, with half of it in a special container in powder form, and the other half processed into dynamite and ceramic grenades. They were practically handicrafts he had made as a hobby, but Czes had heard before that ceramic grenades were actually used in Japan.

> The Runorata Family was currently involved in a struggle, and as such urgently needed powerful, simple explosives.

> The new explosives Czes created as a byproduct were more powerful and stable than any other before them. But in the end they were nothing but byproducts. He was just about to dispose of them for peanuts when the Runorata Family's offer came in.

> One hit from these new products would easily rend limbs from torsos. It wouldn't be strange for bodies themselves to be shredded in one of their blasts. Of course, this possibility was ruled out by the fact that, other than his missing legs, the corpse was unharmed.

I actually don't know how Jacuzzi and his gang caught wind that there'd be explosives being transported on the train, considering that since it's illegal there wouldn't have been a press release or anything. Maybe Nice has connections with others in the explosives industry?

The beginning is the best place. The anime adapts novels #1, #2, #3 and parts of #4, but it leaves out characters and plot points that become crucial later on.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and Hunter x Hunter.

Hell yeah, Jojo and HxH, all day, err day.
>> ARTICLE
Same! I don't get people who love FMA, but think HxH isn't mature enough or worth the time investment.

Jojo is a fantastic show for anyone who is even slightly interested in shounens.
>> ARTICLE
HcH does have a more childish 
aesthetic, and doesn't get really, really good until the Phantom Troupe Arc. FMA meanwhile establishes its tone as immediately darker than most shounens, and sticks with it at a quick pace for its entirety. It doesn't help that FMA incorporates its fights more naturally than HxH (less structured) and is less reminiscent of classic battle shounens than HxH.

I think it's quite clear why people get the wrong first impression of HxH as a childish series. Doesn't mean they're right, of course. HxH is a great show with some mature themes come its later arcs, and anyone who claims it isn't mature is either ignorant or lying through their teeth.

Personally, I like the 1999 version. The character development and the overall progression was handled better than the 2011, IMO. I just like how Mito, Kite, and the other side characters were handled. Even the fillers like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BhLmdbL4A8) made the 1999 version so much better. Also, I also think that 1999 beats 2011's overall soundtrack (some of those metal music on the 2011 version just don't fit on some occasions). 
>> ARTICLE
Well the manga is better than both so lets all agree on that. And all be sad together forever, Hiatus x Hiatus.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the story, but the art and sound certainly weren't.
>> ARTICLE
I would take HxH's manga art over anime art anytime.
>> ARTICLE
Haha I wonder why the sound wasn't better? And the story is all that matters in a manga, art is just a bonus.
>> ARTICLE
I was trying to make a joke. 

Art might not  matter to you, but it does to a lot of people. It's all part of the experience. I personally have started some shows solely for the animation. 
>> ARTICLE
I am speaking of the manga in regards to art, I 100% agree about anime though. I have to struggle through it if the animation is lousy. 
>> ARTICLE
It's funny how people advocating the 1999 version always get downvoted for pointing out that it's better at certain things. It's as if the people downvoting haven't even watched it and just take the 2011 remake as an undefeated and unchallengeable victor in every regard.    
I mean, just looking at filler episodes like 18-20 and you could basically get mad that these episodes weren't adopted for the 2011 remake. Many of these filler episodes were just that good and actually gave some more insight into characters and added to the show as a whole, making it really hard to believe that they weren't actually canon.    
I really do love the 2011 soundtrack and i think it fits perfectly with the show but when you put it against classics like "Kaze no Uta" or "Hunter no Tema - Densetsu" you'll at least have a hellish time choosing between the classic and the remake.  



People should just learn to embrace both versions more.  

 



>> ARTICLE
I think its because the 1999 *isn't* actually better. 

Its like the people who say the original FMA is better. Sure, they're entitled to their opinion and shouldn't be downvoted... but we all know the truth, they watched the original first and thats why they like it better. 

The 2011 HxH developed the relationships better and the characters motivation made more sense. If your only problem with the series is that they didn't adapt a *filler* episode, then thats a sign (to me) that its the superior series.  
>> ARTICLE
Its not that I don't want to watch the 1999 version of HXH. Its just after going through the 2011 version trying to catch up with it, only to hear both the anime and manga are going to be on hiatus when I was 10 episodes away from being caught up killed my drive to see the 1999 version.
>> ARTICLE
If it's not written by Togashi it's not worth having in the show. Although there's some elements that was adapted better in the 1999 version, the 2011 version is overall better.
>> ARTICLE
I highly disagree.  Colored Nen wasn't part of the manga but it adds to the feel still.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's not like Madhouse would adapt Hunter x Hunter in fcking black and white... Manga is usually made without colours, the adapter is free to add colours and shit as they please. It's not the same thing when you change a part of the story.
>> ARTICLE
You know what's also funny?

> made the 1999 version so much better

> it's better at certain things

How these two are not the same.
>> ARTICLE
The character development wasnt better, in that aspect there was hardly a difference ( except the story in 2011 goes further so it naturally develops the characters more ). Also the cinematography in the new version is superior in my opinion. No offense, but im pretty sure u just think the old version is "so much better" since u have nostalgic feelings for it ( which noone can blame u for ) .
>> ARTICLE
Is it still nostalgia if I watched the 2011 first before the 1999? You're assuming too much of me. 

One of the main reasons the 1999 anime's character development was so much more effective is that it spent a lot more time on building an engaging atmosphere and emphasizing the character's feelings. The 1999 version took you right inside their heads and gave you the impression that you're right there with them. In contrast, this was absent from the 2011 anime. 

If you've seen the 1999 version, Gon's characterization was far more complex. He had stronger reasons to wanting to become a hunter because his feelings toward his father went farther than what 2011 did. He also had greater and more emotional conflicts with his aunt. Because of Mito's expanded character, her and Gon's attachment was greater in that version which made the separation much more emotional. In 2011, it felt like it was just nothing. 

Another is Killua. In 1999, he was a more dark and cold, bloodthirsty killer that wanted to kill his family to get out of the family business that changed after meeting Gon. In the 2011 version, he was a much lighter character that just happened to be part of a family of assassins and ran away from them because he didn't want that life. Moreover, the "filler" episode where a girl sneaked aboard the airship to get revenge on Killua for the death of her father, and the contrasting specifics on what happened to Killua during the final phase of the exam significantly changed who Killua was as a character at that point in the story. Since those scenes where nonexistent in the 2011, Killua was not as convincing in his development transition.

Kurapika's mental deterioration and instability during the Yorknew arc was also far more pronounced. Hell, even minor characters like Hanzo were given much more focus and development.

Samurai Champloo. It's relatively short, unbelievably great and had a great soundtrack.

When people always say to watch Cowboy Bebop, or recommend Cowboy Bebop to friends, I always tell them Champloo instead. I think it's a similar type of show but I love Champloo so much more.

Honestly, anything by Watanabe I try to recommend. Ever shows people consider worse than his others (Ex. Terror in Resonance, which is one of my favs) are better than 90% of existing anime.
>> ARTICLE
Even Kids on the Slope, which is nothing like Bebop or Champloo 
>> ARTICLE
Terror in Resonance is good, but requires a greater psychic investment than his other works. Both Bebop and Champloo are highly episodic in character, so you can just jump in and enjoy the swordplay/gun fu/Faye's tits/whatever. Terror has a very serious, serial plot, and requires more patience.

I never did get into it, but I could see the quality. It just isn't good for "turn brain off" time... though I'd probably watch it if there were a good dub. (Is there a good dub?) Something I can look away from without missing dialogue. And I'm not normally a "dub" guy.

This is probably the first show I would recommend to someone who has just started watching anime and would like to see more. The story and characters are just so great without having to resort to over-used anime tropes and fan service.

The other show I'd put on the same level is the first season of Darker Than Black. It's a classic in my books and I can never stop raving about it. 

For people completely new to anime, Studio Ghibli is definitely the safest and best way in.

Ghost in the Shell, now more than ever with all the sci-fi newbies going gaga over Psycho Pass

For everybody who is commenting that they don't know what order to watch GitS in: [CLICK HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/watch_order#wiki_ghost_in_the_shell)
>> ARTICLE
I don't care what people say, I loved Arise. From the 1980s movie to Arise, I have loved all the GITS shows 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, save me [real quick please](http://imgur.com/RL9IiWw)? 

Which order do I watch Ghost in the Shell in? Theres about 5 of them on netflix right now :/


>> ARTICLE
The movies and the TV series are separate continuities. I'd watch the movies first (Ghost in the Shell and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence) and then the TV series (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG, and Solid State Society (a movie, but part of the TV series universe). The movies and TV series are pretty different thematically, with the movies focusing much more on what it means to be a human (Ship of Theseus paradox and all that) while Stand Alone Complex focuses more on the world.
>> ARTICLE
> Ghost in the Shell

If you are talking about movie. 100% agreed, but if you are talking about Stand Alone Complex I would disagree to a degree. 

While both seasons of SAC are miles better than season 2 of Psycho-Pass I prefer first season of Psycho-Pass over both seasons of SAC.

Don't get me wrong I don't dislike SAC but it sometimes feels way too slow and somewhat episodic nature of SAC makes it hard to marathon. But when it comes to Psycho-pass it feels they managed to hit perfect balance between action and slower parts of the show. 

And main thing that made Psycho-Pass so interesting was world design, both visual and structural [](/s "with Sibyl, use of holographic tech...")
>> ARTICLE
GITS is not a show you should be marathoning in the first place. If pacing really is an issue, watching just the Complex episodes and skipping the Stand-Alone ones will probably handle that. 

In general, I agree with the others. Psycho-Pass is a pretty good detective show with some interesting characters, but most of the depth related to the Sibyl system felt quite forced. It felt the system existed to enable the show to reach some degree of depth, rather than the show existing to explore the how technology affects us (which is what i feel GITS does very well.)
>> ARTICLE
Usually if I can't marathon show I don't feel like watching it. It would have been different if I had chance to watch it while it was airing. 

In the end I managed to finish both seasons of GitS and I am happy about it and also relieved.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, I'm having a hard time swallowing some of the things in Psycho Pass, like how disgustingly inefficient/slow the Dominators are and *why* the society accepted a system as hilariously flawed ad the Sibyl system. GitS's world building is leaps and bounds more acceptable than Psycho Pass'.  

I'm only 8 episodes in Psycho Pass though, so I hope the story will build a more concrete/acceptable world as it goes on...
>> ARTICLE
So Dominators being slow is really interesting point. I was kinda asking myself if there is reason for that, and maybe they are slow because of decision making. Giving people with Dominators time to think before pulling trigger. It may also be connected with things that are in spoiler territory.

When it comes to Sibyl, I don't remember really what was episode when they explore Sibyl more but I think it's near the end of the show. You should really finish it first, I really don't want to spoil something for you. I found it really interesting.

>  hard time swallowing some of the things in Psycho Pass

I had same thing with both shows, but still I like the way Psycho-Pass world looks more and for instance the way they used holographic tech in homes. That's the kind of thing I am interested in, futuristic tech. On other hand GitS looks like tech we have today that's more advanced. 
>> ARTICLE
The transformations and shots from the Dominator are only slow to show the art behind them. In truth they are a lot faster. It's like how Transformers used to take 30 seconds to transform so that the animators could show off, when in actuality the robots did it in under a second.
>> ARTICLE
Did you not like Psycho Pass? Or did you just mean that because of Psycho Pass there are more people interested in the sci-fi genre of anime?
>> ARTICLE
Both. Psycho Pass season 1 was just a painfully obvious imitation of GitS and a lackluster one at that. I'm one of the select few who actually liked season 2 more than season 1 purely because in season 2 they dropped all pretenses of trying to be a hard sci fi show and just exposed itself for what it always was - an action/detective/police procedural with a sci fi overtone.

Psycho-Pass isn't bad, just not as well written or executed as GitS

I would definitely agree. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm obviously not him, but I feel like while Psycho-Pass was a pretty good show, it just does not compare on any level to GitS, movie or SAC.  
I'm of the opinion that there's not much point having watched Psycho-Pass and not GitS, so whenever I come across someone who's in that position I'm fairly insistent they watch GitS.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching Psycho Pass right now.  

At the moment 8 episodes in, it literally feels like a generic detective series. The Sibyl system feels like a disposeable plot device, and although it certainly can generate some dialogues around the usage of the crime rating, it's nowhere as interesting or deep as what GitS offers.  

Feels like a baby version of GitS lol.
>> ARTICLE
Id agree. The Sibyl system is an interesting concept but by the second season you could tell they ran out of ideas over how to incorporate it into the story.




>> ARTICLE
You're focusing too hard on the superficial plot. Look at the people instead. The show is literally about the people. It's more of a psychological show than a sci-fi show.

I have always been put off Ghost in the Shell by not knowing the relationship between the different films and the series-should all of them be watched and in what order?
>> ARTICLE
There are three different continuities and are best watched in release order.  The first continuity is the two movies, being the original film (there is a remake called Ghost in the Shell 2.0 but I don't suggest watching it) and Innocence.

Next is the Stand Alone Complex continuity which contains two anime seasons and a movie.  This being Stand Alone Complex, 2nd GIG, and Solid State Society.  There are also two OVAs that recap each season but I don't suggest watching it.

The most recent continuity is Arise, which consists of four OVAs, a compilation series, and an upcoming movie.  This being the Arise OVA series, Alternative Architecture (which is just the OVA series with the exception of the last two episodes which are new content that will tie into the new movie), and the upcoming movie.
>> ARTICLE
To add on to what you said...

The Mamoru Oshii films are what inspired a lot of The Matrix. Stand Alone Complex is also really similar in tone but has more character development and action.

Arise is a "reboot" reinterpreting all of the characters. I think it's the weakest of the franchise.

Also, the manga the franchise is based on has a much lighter tone than everything else. There's way more humor.

Couldn't agree more. It's the one thing that my opinion seems to diverge the most from /r/anime's mainstream. I thought it was just okay, kinda fun, but far too wacky with ultimately no characters that I truly liked or cared about. It was like that one fight sequence in any shonen anime, where the music starts blasting, the character does something awesome, and the audience goes wild. And I love that sort of thing. But Gurren Lagann was that scene stretched into an entire series, and for me that was just too much.

I tell all of my friends who watch anime to get into the Fate series.
>> ARTICLE
Now this is story all about how I got really obsessed with the King of Britain.
>> ARTICLE
Someone told me this and I was totally let down, the Fate series really isn't anything special. Peple act like the worldbuilding/plot is so complicated/intriguing/interesting, while it's as easy to grasp as the one in Hunger Games. It's just people fighting over the wishfulfilling grail, and man, seriously guys, that [Zero end soiler](/s "the grail actually doesn't do that") was so obvious from the start. 

Just because the company decided to run multiple of their stories in 'that same world', doesn't make it any more deep. The fate series is not deep, sorry to break it to you.


The characters in the series are no good either. If you don't care about the characters, why would you care that they die? 

Or the whole nothing-happens-first-season of Zero, or the really boring and even more predictable UBW. 

Or the fights that people call cool that are actually: clash swords twice. Talk about respect and honor or humiliate your enemy. Clash swords once and stare into each others eye. Talk. Switch scene to something boring. Go back and they clash swords three times, then are done fighting.

Stories like this, about people fighting each other for a goal or survival, have been done better by Hunger Games, Btooom and even Mirai Nikki. And that's just the ones I know. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so you took a wild shot in the dark and said [F/Z](/s "the Holy Grail is corrupted.") Great, now how did the story fuck that up for you? You went out of your way to try and predict the ending with the story not even foreshadowing it at that point in the story, thats not something the show is to blame for.

I'm not sure what you're talking about with "deep" here. The magic system and the intricacies as well as the lore is what make the series deep (albeit both of them will get stretched to the creator's desires.), the amount of information we have of the stories we have yet to seen is what makes the world building so great. For example we know so much about the third holy grail war despite it not even being a full story, or when we had so much information about the fourth holy grail war before it was even adapted into a story.

This isnt really a criticism. Saying the characters are "no good" doesnt give your reasoning as to why you think that. Of course if you dont care about the characters you wont care that they die, that goes for every show ever.

I always hate the complaint that nothing happens in the first season of Fate/Zero. Battles in that season were meant to have us get to know the characters, why would you introduce a character, have them fight a battle, and then die without us having ever being able to know them? Especially when these characters are supposed to be heroes from legend, you atleast want to see these characters fight and interact with eachother twice or more.

Oh wow... You summed up all of one fight. Now heres some counter examples: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zrv6y_-v9Qg), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7OYPb3fTP0), [3](https://youtu.be/UjIrVDLYpgQ?t=2m23s), [4](https://youtu.be/kCbOaE-p49E?t=6m26s), [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dCFpPyrSIQ), [6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc6yEzpXnJs), [7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkvauvbFYj8). 

I feel like you missed the main drawing point of the Fate series, which is the characters themselves and not the conflict of the Holy Grail War. The clash of Ideologies is a staple in the Fate franchise, the [Banquet of Kings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogNZtIAeDmM) is a good example of this. The characters are what make the show, you cant have Fate/Zero or Fate/Stay Night if the characters arent there and dealing with whatever conflict or clash they get in.
>> ARTICLE
I did not try to guess anyhting, don't lay words in my mouth. It was just obvious to me. No need to get so aggressive.

The magic system isn't really anything special, and intigues? Come on, what a political one, then yuou see intrigues. Watch Game of Thrones if you want to. An interesting magic system would be in Negi Magi (and no, I mean the manga, and especially more later on). And a really interesting world in general would be Twelve Kingdoms (Juuni Kokuki). And multiple stories in the same world (similar to the third grailwar we know about), has been done by Fushigi Yuugi with the Genbu Kaiden manga, which is great (and no comparison to the rather silly, old and comedish Suzaku anime one).

Yes, it is very strong criticism if the anime doesn't make you care about characters if they're meant to die. So why did SteinsGate succeed at it, and Zero failed? Because pretty much every character in Zero has a mental disability or is a douche. The only people you'd care about would be Rider and Waver. Why did even Mirai Nikki succeed at it, and Btooom? For the same reason. You can't just put negative/evil/crazy characters into a show, trying to make it edgy and serious. You say the characters are the highlight of the show, yet it totally failed at making proper ones. Now if you like it, I don't care, but there is no reason to get so aggressive because people have opinions.

I wasn't complaining that nothing happens in the first season. It bothers people, but I don't care much. If you had looked at my MAL, you'd have seen that I actually gave the first season a point more than the second one.

And with those videos, you're actually proving my point that the fights are always interrupted for talking, haha, that's funny. The only exceptions are 2 and 7, but in 2, the only thing that's actually happening is Berserker following him and some shooting. Mario Kart is more interesting, it's also a race with shooting, just more fun. And 7 is fine, an okay battle, not a lot happening, but fine. Of course the music is good, and monologue about startegies and fighting is also fine.

Also, I think this is a nice response and you took your time writing it, however, it does not really apply to me at all.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry if it came off as aggressive but you're wrong. You did guess because there was no hint or foreshadowing of the ending at that point in the story. If thats not guessing then what is?

What makes a special magic system then? You can take an entire course in Nasuverse magic and you would still walk away with a lot of information you still dont know that there is to learn. Same with the Nasuverse in general. I havent read any of the manga you listed (Not really big on manga) but they cant be *sooo* much more complex than the Nasuverse. To me complexity is one of the things that makes a world so interesting, which is why I love the Nasuverse.

Every character in Zero has a mental disability or is a douche? Okay here is a couple that are not: Waver, Rider, Irisviel, Saber, Diarmuid. Now you have a whopping 5 **main** characters to care about. Did you just call Fate/Zero "edgy" and then mention Mirai Nikki as an example of a show that wasnt? lel. Besides that, having serious characters isnt bad nor is it "edgy". Having a character like Kiritsugu clash with a character like Saber is mature, the entire cast isnt one cess pool of amoral characters. Even the truly evil ones arent completely evil, hence why the show would be "mature" rather than "edgy". [Learn the difference.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33jwhi/what_exactly_is_wrong_with_a_show_being_edgy/cqlmdwl) Just because you dont like the entire cast personally, does not mean the show is bad. In fact it should've been easy for you to like some of the characters such as Waver,Rider, Irisviel, and Saber who all had important roles in the story.

>Or the whole nothing-happens-first-season of Zero

Yes you were.

What are you talking about? Firstly you said "Talk about respect and honor or humiliate your enemy." that didnt happen in any of the fights listed above, they were always explaining something. In **1** they talk about Berserker's agility and then the rest of the fight goes on without interruption until Tokiomi calls Gilgamesh off and then after that is an entirely different fight. You're complaining about 2 being uninteresting, but thats *exactly* what happens when you have no talking or exposition in a fight, it becomes two people *just* fighting. In **3** they were talking leading up to the fight, the fight was interrupted and was a slaughter from there, I dont understand your complaint. In **4** cutting to Kariya wasnt exactly boring but whatever, and with the exception of revealing Berserker's identity the fight went uninterrupted except for when it crossed with Kiritsugu vs Kirei and Gilgamesh vs Gilgamesh which were interesting on their own. **5** is an example where talking inbetween certain parts of a fight arent necessarily bad, it was Rider's sendoff and before that, that was just talk leading up to the fight. So one conversation in the fight was not a bad thing. I dont understand how **6** was bad at all. From your comment you perfectly described Saber vs Lancer, all of those other fights were counter examples of every fight in Fate/Zero being like that. Sword clashes, talk honor, sword clashes, cut to something else, more sword clashes, honor, climatic finish. That was Saber vs Lancer, not the other fights.

Thanks for replying. And I understand if you didnt personally like Fate/Zero, but I feel as though your reasoning for it is flawed. I can accept disliking it, but presenting flawed reasoning as fact just seems silly.

Read the Fate/Stay Night Visual Novel -> Fate/Zero (LN or anime, doesnt really matter.)

Thats pretty much the one constant order you can stick with for the two in the main series. When it comes to the anime-only order then its just down to personal preference and therse no concrete order there.

I have. Gilgamesh is straight-up abusive, but I like to think that he takes care of all his treasures, Saber included (if she submits). Prior to the events in Fate/Zero, he had at least some decency in him...

If only Gil had Ko-Gil's personality... I actually prefer Saber with F/Z Lancer, come to think of it.

Meh, raping someone while they're bleeding out on the ground seems a bit worse than abusive.

In what order would you suggest I watch them? I've been meaning to get into the series.
>> ARTICLE
http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate

Summary of what the link says: Fate Stay Night was originally released as a Visual Novel with three routes. Fate Zero was a Light Novel prequel that was released after Fate Stay Night. Fate Zero got an anime adaptation in 2011. One of the Fate Stay Night routes called Unlimited Blade Works is currently airing. So technically the intended viewing order of the series is Fate Stay Night and then Fate Zero, even though chronologically the order is the other way around.

Recently, I'd say watching Fate Zero before Fate Stay Night might be a bit more beneficial than the watch guide makes it out to be. This is simply because the Ufotable animated Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works (one of the three routes of the original Visual Novel) makes many references back to the Ufotable animated Fate Zero (the original source material for this was a Light Novel). If you want to do anime first, you have the option of choosing either Fate Zero first or Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works first. But you could also start straight with the Fate Stay Night Visual Novel (the original source material) or just read a walkthrough (http://lparchive.org/Fatestay-night/).
>> ARTICLE
The Nasuverse is one of those things that gets better the more you get into it. When you've read/seen/played through multiple franchises and can recognise the subtle references they all have to one another, you know you can never go back.
>> ARTICLE
It's the fact that the series are set in the same universe, and if they aren't, they are set in different universes in which the exact same rules apply. Knowing that each series has such a different storyline, and yet still connects to the other Type Moon series through the mechanics of the world and the magic is just very satisfying.
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen any of them. Sell me on the series?
>> ARTICLE
and I would say that Fate Stay/Night and Fate/Zero have the best battle scenes I have seen in an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Battle royal set in modern Japan where seven "masters" (mages) each summon  a "servant" (ancient famous warrior) into the present to fight for the Holy Grail, which grants the winner one wish. That barely scratches the surface.

It literally took me years to get into the Fate series but I just played the Fate route in the VN and I feel so dumb for waiting this long
>> ARTICLE
I'm halfway through the Fate route right now. Absolutely loving it. Saber best girl
>> ARTICLE
Oh man if you enjoyed the fate route it's probably only going to get better for you.
>> ARTICLE
Not "probably", it WILL. 
>> ARTICLE
I used to actively avoid the Fate series because the fans seemed way too hardcore.

I am really glad I got into it though. It isn't like those animes where there are 400 episodes and you feel too intimidated to even begin watching.

Instead, it is several quick anime seasons with all different routes. Don't like one ending or story? Watch the others.

Still confused? Look at one of the wikis since everybody wrote every single detail from the visual novels for all of the characters. There is so much content that it is really one of those special franchises that you can feel truly satisfied.

Also, the prequel isn't just good, it is *amazing.*

Legend of the Galactic Heroes.  Unfortunately, I have not gotten a single person I know to watch it.  Its age gets it an almost instant write off, which is unfortunate.

I think a remake was announced, so once that comes around people will stop immediately saying no due to the age aspect.
>> ARTICLE
I think people don't watch it since its quite long and notoriously slow

Oh that's definitely accurate as well. When you look at the episode count and see 110, you definitely question whether or not you want to be making that big of an investment into a single series. I'm sure people will hop on once the remake of the series starts airing though; because an episode a week is a lot less daunting than a precompiled 110 episodes.

Monster

The show sits on the more dark, suspenseful side of the spectrum and really challenges one to push their boundaries a little and step out of their comfort zone. It had me on the edge of my seat for the duration of the show and whilst it can be considered mundane at some rare points (It's a 74 episode show so it's to be expected) for the most part I found it extremely enjoyable.

>> ARTICLE
Not only is Monster a pinnacle anime it's superior entertainment that measures up to the best that television has to offer in any genre.  I tell people they should watch it before they die.
>> ARTICLE
While it is very good ( I gave it an 8), I'd hesitate to call it the pinnacle" of anime. It has bad pacing issues about 20 episodes in where it slows down considerably. I actually dropped it after episode 24 because it got so boring but later picked it back up and finished it. Still a great show though.
>> ARTICLE
I agree completely.  The length did not deter me from watching the whole thing, and I loved every minute of it because of how it built upon itself.  I ranked it as my number 1 thriller/horror anime for its suspense and story.
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul because then you'll eventually read the manga. 

>> ARTICLE
It's hard to pick one, but I think I would pick Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Not because it does anything special with romance or comedy, but because it explores the theme of "talent" and its effects on the talented and untalented so damn well (See: Sorata and Mashiro, Misaki and Jin, Ryuunosuke and his unnamed middle school friends, Mashiro and Rita, Chihiro and Kazuki, Nanami and Sorata; the list goes on). Regardless of how poorly the LN continued Sakurasou, I consider the anime to be one of the most powerful and relevant anime series I've had the fortune of viewing.

There are some good shows that I feel like a lot of casual anime watchers are missing, like Gintama or Hunter x Hunter.

So I'm trying to convince more people to watch that currently (although I think there's the problem that Netflix bought the rights to stream it so Crunchyroll does not have it).
>> ARTICLE
Trust me, everyone knows about The Seven Deadly Sins. Well maybe not on /r/anime but many have seen it already.

Likewise, most of them are turned off by the slow start :C

Haha, at that point, I'd be far too hyped to like it.

I can't bring myself to recommend it to non - video gamers. The show is worth it only to those who can relate to it -- anybody who's save stated and banked on messing with the RNG to save that one character's life understands the pain and frustration of Okarin just a little bit more. 
>> ARTICLE
Out of all my friends that watch anime, here's how my convincing has gone:

-One has finished it (although he wanted to drop it partway through), but after completing it his comment was "This is beautiful"

-One has it on their Plan to Watch list.

-Two refuse to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
This. Every time I meet someone who watches anime but hasn't seen Steins, my first reaction is to recommend it to them.

What I usually do is tell them is that it is an SoL with sci-fi elements and let them watch it by themselves. Strangely enough, I convinced several people to watch it just by sending them [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsYUa3JJwI). I avoid mentioning the time traveling aspects because they only appear a few episodes in and I think Steins is better the less you know about it before you watch it.

Well I mean try to look at it from their perspective as well.

A friend constantly pesters them to watch a show and maybe it's starting to tick them off as well.

I am all for suggesting shows to my friends and stuff but I try not to be overly pushy about it because I've been on the other side and know it can get a little irritating (especially to people who are not hardcore anime fans). I just ask them once in a while if they've watched it or not and leave it at that. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, when you're constantly pestering them, it's annoying. I meant once or twice. They just refuse and never touch it. 
>> ARTICLE
Never force people into things. Offer it as a suggestion if they want something to watch. Also best to offer multiple things.

Multiple suggestions would've been a better approach.

It's waaaaaaaay overhyped. I watched after a few months of pestering, and it fell flat on.

The start of it is what killed me. I only made it through 7 episodes first time before I got something spoiled so I kept watching other shows until I forgot it.

Madoka Magica.

I went into it with the only spoilers being "This show will make you care about the characters." 

[Spoilers](/s "So I recommend it to people based on the same idea. They know I'm sorta soft, so I tell them 'It's kinda like a generic, happy magical girl anime, but it does a really good job at making you feel for the characters. You should give a shot.'")

I wanna say Kyoukai no Kanata, but I understand that there's a personal reason why it resonated so much with me. So, instead I'm gonna say Kawai Complex! Go and watch it! It's hilarious! And beautiful! And heartwarming! And just all around awesome!

when i finished boogiepop phantom i didnt know what to do with myself! i loved it so much and i wish it would've been longer

Agreed on Patlabor. IMO the most "realistic" Mecha anime..
>> ARTICLE
Haruhi I can talk about for hours on end and recommend to friends. 

However JoJo's bizarre adventure is the go to anime when dealing with filthy casuals. Eventually they get into it. 

If all else fails I just force them to watch the shaq versions of the openings for part 3.

[Sabagebu!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20709/Sabagebu!)

[And this is the reason why I picked it up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOiTlXjBK70&ab_channel=x4gottenmemoirsx) That show has a so many funny moments.

That would be the one anime I will keep forcing people to watch because it's underrated.
>> ARTICLE
Recently, HxH 2011. Anyone I've told this about, could not stop watching it until it was over.

For over 10 years, I've been watching and reading One Piece. This was my gateway and I keep telling people to watch it. Since it was part of the big three, usually they know about it. It's up to the point where I consider the art as the standard for anime but most people say the designs are very weird.
>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf. Holo is just so damn amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Ange.

It's really that good. It's action-packed and has great character writing. Too bad the first couple of episodes are mediocre. It's so good that I even tried to get non-anime watching friends to see it, but it's a show that tends to leave a negative first impression, so I haven't been successful yet.
>> ARTICLE
OP, what if I told you.... I dropped Baccano
>> ARTICLE
You're not alone. I dropped it too after dedicating about 8 episodes to it. The plot was all over the place and there were too many characters for me to become attached to any. Might finish it some day but it's not a priority.

lol, I 'unno. Just wasn't my style. I personally do not really find enjoyment in non chronological order shows. Although I'm sure Baccano is the best of its kind in that regard.
>> ARTICLE
it's pretty good at having a flow and only jumps backwards or forwards for a brief bit to set up the plot. it has great theme and ending and is pretty short 13-16
would recommend as the anime durarara has alot of references and shout outs to this show (made by same people or some jazz) and it is also a great anime

That's fine. It's great imo but like a lot of niche/obscure anime it's an acquired taste.

Same here, Baccano it is. Every single friend (who could actually be arsed to finally watch it) liked it. Those, who didn't like it, are my friends no more (almost not joking).

Just one!? I guess it has to be 5 cm/s. It's the only anime that I will recommend to anyone and everyone regardless of who they are.

Go watch Suzumiya, now. It's brilliant. The movie is even better.

It's a toss-up between Hyouka and The Tatami Galaxy.

Kyoukaisenjou no Horizon! I've watched both seasons a ton, and am currently reading the prequel "Owari no Seraph". The world is interesting, you have tons of different genres mixing, the storytelling is pretty unique (as are the as are the fights) and I'm just in love with the world it's taking place in!

I'm just sitting here every day hoping for a season 3 to be announced.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say force, haha, but I always recommend Golden Time and Tiger & Bunny! Both are two of my favourite shows and I recommend Golden Time for being my all-time favourite, and Tiger & Bunny because I think anybody could enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
tamako love story a best. But that means I have to get people to watch a series (Tamako Market) before they do. I'll keep on talking about how "worth it" it is though.
>> ARTICLE
I dont know about if I will force people to watch it but Trinity Seven just starstrucked me and i cant get enough for some reason, outside of that i would say Shingeki no Kyojin

>> ARTICLE
i try not to force people too much as it can make them just not want to watch it, but i always highly recommend kill la kill and madoka magica.
>> ARTICLE
FLCL
>> ARTICLE
other than the many other more popular anime mentioned by others here,  i'm going to say Sasami-san@ganbaranai. sadly underappreciated anime that has all the classic shaft weirdness and visuals, quirky unique characters, a story that i'd say can be surprisingly deep at times, and finally throw in some japanese mythos. sadly i think its not for everyone but definitely a memorable anime for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Clearly the show I'm watching right now... "Hey, I have watched this anime, that... !!!" xD

Depending on the (dis)likes of the other person. Mostly Log Horizon S1, Girls und Panzer, SNAFU, Chuunibyou, D-Frag, Ben-To... just too much :D

Madoka Magica,  Such a great show.

I have two:

Higurashi no Naku koro Ni - It's not just "cute girls doing cute things!".

Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro

Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer

I'll always recommend Scrapped Princess. That anime hit all the right notes for me, and I feel like it was pretty underrated at the time it originally aired.
>> ARTICLE
Sword of the Stranger. It's my altime favourite anime movie and it has a soundtrack that's just [glorious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjOatCkrT1M)
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion. Such a good show and Lelouch is my favorite character out of any anime I have ever watched.
>> ARTICLE
legend of the legendary heroes.just skip episode 1! i dont know why they put that one as the first episode, makes no sense. episode 2+3 were the best anime episodes in the history of anime IMO. the ending is bad (you have to read the light novels after) wish there was a second season... that show had so much potential T.T (wars on an epic scale etc etc)
>> ARTICLE
Birdy the mighty: decode the second season is particularly good and it has a nice English dub. The show is one of my favorites it's a shame how little it's mentioned and how few people have seen It. It does some cool things and the two seasons also feel vastly different. Season one had a romance subplot with a guilty crown feel but done much better imo. Second season has a sort of serious death game feel a la mirra nikki, again done much better and with more action. I highly recommend it to anyone I feel like it has little bit of everything to satisfy anyone.

http://myanimelist.net/anime/3974/Tetsuwan_Birdy_Decode

It also has a few pretty memorable tracks and season 2s op is still one of my favorites.

Bonus fact: the final battle in this anime actually inspired the final battle in the man of steel super man movie. 

Disclaimer: romance isn't between the two main protagonists but they do develop a wonderful relationship.

I could go on about them for hours after all the research of I've put into them. Watamote is another one I'm always recommending and talking about, maybe because I'm hoping I'm not the only one out of everyone I interact with that can relate to Tomoko?

I'm going out on a limb here just to say Highschool DxD is the best anime ever.

Wow i cant believe it hasn't been mentioned before.. Berserk of course. Violent. Mature and alot of mistery. Great character developement and deals with themes like human emotions and the dephts of deprabation.

[Kimi ga Nozomu Eien](http://myanimelist.net/anime/147/Kimi_ga_Nozomu_Eien). It was one of the first serious animes I watched after mostly watching senien and shonen anime. It is also a heart breaking anime about watching people make terrible choices and get screwed over emotionally by them.

People get hurt, people make mistakes, people backstab their best friends for love. Its not for everyone but damn did it make me sad when I first watched it.

Its like White Album 2 lite, and I will fight anyone who says its a stupid show.

Jojo's is something i love recommending and i could go on for hours upon hours talking about JoJo's and how much i love the characters the music the artstyle in my mind it doesn't get more fun than JJBA

FMA:B i would recommend to friends since i think it's good for people newer to anime and a really fun watch.

Gurren Lagann is a really fun ride and a good introduction to mecha anime i could go on about the awesome music that amazing last fight scene in the movie overall amazing in my book.

Samurai Champloo Great 1st episode gets things going immediately and keeps that pace going perfectly only episode i don't like is the zombie one but i love the ending i love the characters and love the ending and also the episode Gamblers and Gallantry was what really made me love the show along with it's amazing soundtrack.

1) Akame Ga Kill! I know it got a lot of smack for not being executed good enough and ending poorly but it's one of the few animes that I have been able to re-watch and not get bored. There's so much to it and I can easily classify it as my favorite.

2) Spice And Wolf. Do I need to explain? Holo 4 life.

3) Another. One of, if not, the best horror anime I've seen. From the start you're met with a dark, cold, environment and it stays that way throughout the entire show. Visually stunning as well.

I'm hesitant, namely because I don't like shows that require you to watch ten or twenty or thirty episodes before 'it gets good.' That, and I have never been a fan of the HxH aesthetic/visual design which has so far kept me away from the show.

Code Geass, and Code Geass R2

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood

Soul Eater 

These are all great anime, but they're each a 50-episode series (if you combine CG and CG:R2). If you'd like a couple smaller series so you don't burn yourself out: 

Fate/Zero (Season 1 just ended. Season 2 is coming out in Feb.)

Steins;Gate

They're all pretty recent anime and have received a lot of good reviews from the people here and elsewhere.

EDIT: Fate/Zero Season 1 has ended. Season 2 will begin airing in February.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with every thing this guy says except Steins gate. That is not a user friendly anime. I love almost any anime, but i'm like 7 episodes deep in that show and I still hate it because its incoherent as Fuck.

uh fate zero season one has ended. the next season will release in feb.
>> ARTICLE
You know what, I got it mixed up with Guilty Crown. Thanks for the clarification!
>> ARTICLE
Flcl. Cowboy Bebop.

Thank you!  I will add it to the "list"!

Make sure to watch the dubbed version for both of these shows.
>> ARTICLE
Add Ghost in the Shell to that and you should be ready to hit the ground running with your new found addiction 8)
>> ARTICLE
Ghost in the Shell was much more of a refined taste, not really something to mention to a newbie.

>> ARTICLE
I feel like the depth is part of the draw that can pull people in regardless of whether or not they are new to anime. You don't have to know anime to appreciate GiTS. It doesn't have any of the normal cliches or stereotypes. It's not based around you liking moe characters or the slice of life genre. It is a really great story that happens to be anime. That's not to put the others down, I just think it is very easy to enjoy and gets better the more you watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you!  Also added to the list!
>> ARTICLE
I will say that Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the shell, and FLCL have some of the best dubs if you're not into subs.
>> ARTICLE
No worries, feel free to message me for specific suggestions if you ever are looking for something similar or different to what you just watched. Any of us could probably spit out a huge list, but it's probably best to start with something you have time for and then watch more as you can. / First world anime downloader problem, I definitely suffer from too many anime choices.

Looked at the comments thus far. I'd add Death Note to the recommendations, for good measure. Most people seem not to think of it because everyone and their mother (and little sister, and dog) has watched it.

welcome to a new world my friend. onced i watched an anime, i cant ever go back to real tv. anime is where the shit is at. want a deep dark anime? try elfin lied. all time awesome anime? darker than black. clever and dark? try deathnote.

Going to Ohayocon in a few weeks with my friends, so I should have a good opportunity to get most recommendations. 
>> ARTICLE
Baccano is a great series. Just watched it recently myself and I enjoyed the presentation style they chose to use. It is also apparently very good in both English and Japanese. 
>> ARTICLE
Texhnolyze.  Not easy, but it's not exactly traditional anime either.  It's something that you can really see as art, though.
>> ARTICLE
[The Tatami Galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tatami_Galaxy) (or, "Yojohan Shinwa Taikei" the Japanese title) by director Masaaki Yuasa.
I actually suggest him in general, such as [Mind Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_Game_%28film%29) (a movie) and [Kaiba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiba) (an anime).

>> ARTICLE
Baccano! is pretty much my favorite of all time and also force feed it to anyone and everyone who I come across.  

A lot of good suggestions here, some OK ones IMO, but give them a try and if one doesn't suit your fancy the next one probably will.  A lot of great stories to be found here.
>> ARTICLE
Big thanks to everyone who gave a recommendation!  It is very much appreciated. You all rule!
>> ARTICLE
I just want to say this in regards to some people mentioning FLCL:

It is a good anime.  I recommend that you watch it *after* you've watched some other stuff.  It plays off of anime tropes quite a lot, and I think you'll get more out of it if you're in on the jokes.

Edit: was discussing this with my roommate and he came up with a good way of describing it: you'll get more mileage out of it if you have more anime context in which to mentally frame it. It's also one of those anime that you'll either love or hate.  Most people seem to like it, but some do genuinely dislike it.
>> ARTICLE
Watch Gungrave
>> ARTICLE
thats an interesting first pick, many people start from the mainstream (shit) animes like naruto or bleach. but im sure you found baccano! enjoyable. 
>> ARTICLE
Yah, I was thinking that's like the **opposite** of "easing into anime" myself
>> ARTICLE
Baccano! was really a much more laid back anime in my opinion. Other that the storyline behind the 'rail tracer'. Try watching Elfen Lied for your first anime, I shat bricks for about a week. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, Elfen Lied is certainly in another category altogether. I was thinking more about how many people, even dedicated anime fans, had a hard time of getting "over the hump" with Baccano's early episodes. The seemingly endless characters and storylines thrown at the viewer at once was frustrating at the onset.

It has but I swear it was like...close to a year ago.  I quite willingly watched it again.

[Yeah](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2eggtm/attack_on_titan_x_baccano_opening/), 5 months ago. I like [this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT92qscRYZ4) better though.

Glad you like it :d! not my work but I'm the one who uploaded it on youtube.

Oh really? Cool man, it really is great.

This reminds me that I really need to finish Baccano!
>> ARTICLE
Watch it maybe Baccano will get the Durarara treatment
>> ARTICLE
I highly doubt it. Baccano! ended really well anyway and I'd be somewhat worried that they'd ruin it. If they did it right though I would watch as many episodes of that show as they'd come out with (possibly even if they didn't, I've rewatched the existing show so many times already).
>> ARTICLE
You really really do. It's so good!

How can you start Baccano and not binge watch it?

Well, it definitely wasn't bad, but it just wasn't what I was looking for at the time. I'm certainly going to finish it eventually.

I started binge watching but then life got in the way

Its a reeeeeaaaally awesome series.

This reminds me of that awesome Final Fantasy VII parody of the Baccano OP from nico. That one is still my favorite but it's not on YouTube anymore and I can't seem to find it anywhere else :(

The Eren and Mikasa shipping that seems so common among the fanbase kinda bugs me, but other than that, that was incredibly well-down, and hilarious.

I would enjoy it more if the animation wasn't so choppy it's almost stop-motion. Hell, if it were actual stop motion, it might look better.

Nothing against Baccano or AoT here, just the animation and it's choppiness.
>> ARTICLE
Don't expect too much from a fan-made cross-over!
>> ARTICLE
Animes usually run around 12 frames per second. In animation studios, artists create key frames every x amount of frames and then basically interns draw up everything in between. The person that did this essentially created all the key frames. What you're asking is that the person draw over 720 images for about 2 minutes of video to make it smooth
>> ARTICLE
Thats... Really cool

What I said was only the Cliffs notes version. It's actually a little more complex. The final stream is rendered at 24fps. Main objects are animated anywhere from 8-12 fps and secondary objects 6-8 fps

Man you really need better title for this. I almost skipped it because I was expecting Combo between SnK (AoT) music and Baccano animation. 

This must have taken a lot of time to make.
>> ARTICLE
Did you watch the [specials](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3901/Baccano!_Specials)?
>> ARTICLE
The specials aren't nearly as good, imo.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but they are the perfect example of the one character's statement: "The story has no beginning and has no end". 
>> ARTICLE
Consider them an epilogue. Against the 13-episode TV run, they are relatively weak, but if you watch them knowing they don't weave together with the original run then they become a great mini-series. Also, the story just doesn't feel complete to me without seeing that little white mouse scurry away one last time!
>> ARTICLE
Yah I did , it made me satisfied a bit further until there are no more episodes.
>> ARTICLE
With every Baccano thread must come a favourite character discussion, and with every favourite character discussion we must exclude Isaac and Miria for being by far the most obvious choice!

Mine is Ladd Russo for incalculable, wicked, bloody madness. Loved watching him, almost like he came right out of a Tarantino movie! **"YOU'D STILL! HAVE! TO! PAAAYYYYYY!!!!!"**
>> ARTICLE
Well , Ladd is clearly the most insane character in the show , on the contrary is Vino who is insane but in a very enigmatic and intreresting form and isn't as clear as ladd so that's why I find him a bit more appealing , but it really is difficult choosing a favorite since everyone is really good. 
>> ARTICLE
I also like Vino the most.  But my favorite would be the White Mouse.
>> ARTICLE
In that case you need to watch the [Specials](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3901/) and [Durarara!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6746/Durarara!!) (Same author).
>> ARTICLE
And then Durarara season 2 when it comes out! :)
>> ARTICLE
Damn I just watched Durarara! and Baccano! this weekend and I must say those two are now one of my favorite shows.

Man I wish there were more of Baccano! I know that the show ended in a good way but man I want too see what the gang is doing in modern times.
>> ARTICLE
There are fan translated light novels. Google it
>> ARTICLE
Nice. They are both excellent shows . And yeah, Baccano is just fantastically put together.
>> ARTICLE
*"ISACCUUUUU"*

*"NAN DA MIRIAAAAA?"*

It never gets old.
>> ARTICLE
This show is definitely in my top 10. It has one of the most memorable and entertaining character casts I've ever seen in anime.

Like everyone else is saying, you need to watch the three specials to get the real conclusion. And I've found that rewatching right afterwards is a good way to connect everything and figure out the order of events. 
>> ARTICLE
Should I watch this? I watched the first 3 episodes and it gave me a headache trying to figure out who is who and didnt really pull me in. 
I also watched Durarara up to about half way that has a similar style I believe. Honestly it's style wasnt really my cup of tea.
>> ARTICLE
I gave up after two episodes for the same reason, but came back a week later and actually paid attention to the OP. That helped me figure out who was who and make it enjoyable and thus show shot right up onto my favorites lists.
>> ARTICLE
Just try to pay attention to the opening credits, seeing who is associated with who and getting their names. You may be unclear on some of the faces, especially Claire Stanfield (known also as [](/s "the young conductor and Vino")).
>> ARTICLE
By the middle of the series you should be able to recognize all the characters and begin to see how the scenes connect to each other.
>> ARTICLE
adding onto TheDlBinc's comment, watching the OP helps a lot as well
>> ARTICLE
That's what I did. It helps that the theme's catchy.
>> ARTICLE
Low chance of getting a season 2 =(

Pretty sure they're concentrating on Durara for another season.

Gintama episode titles are fucking wisdom:

Alright, that's it. I'm watching Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
Like the other guy said I recommend starting at episode 3. You can go back and watch the first two episodes later with more context. While they are filler they are pretty funny.
>> ARTICLE
I went back and watched the first two episodes around ~60 episodes in and thought they fucking sucked. 
>> ARTICLE
That's relative to the rest of Gintama. When you finish catching up to Gintama and try to watch other similar comedy shows it's just not the same.
>> ARTICLE
A few of the early episodes aren't that good especially if you watch later episodes first,which is 100% ok aside from characters that stick around getting introduced since Gintama only has a "story" arc every 20-ish episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Nice, start with episode 3, the first 2 are useless fillers and the beginning of the show is quite slow, it's getting better and better the more you progress, enjoy!
>> ARTICLE
Lol, when there are literally hundreds of episodes, I don't think you are saving yourself from much by skipping 2. 
>> ARTICLE
Except the first 2 episode is no cannon(sort of?) and it may make newcomer bored since you won't get some of the joke yet.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose so, but it's hard for me to understand the mindset of a person who decides to start a 200+ episode series that's really highly rated & acclaimed, but would want to purposefully avoid less than 1% of it because it might be boring. It's only 40 minutes and it's part of the whole. It'd be the equivalent of skipping the first scene of a good movie because you heard that one part wasn't that great.   
  
If people want to do that, that's fine, I won't try to stop them and it doesn't affect me at all, I'm just saying I don't understand it. 
>> ARTICLE
1) The thing is the first 2 episode was never part of the whole,they are sort of a ova to celebrate the birth of the anime and only manga reader will get it.              
2) About the part where you say the mindset of a person who decides to start a 200+ episode series,i think the mindset is more of a " i'm gonna try the first few episode to see if i like it",Rather than a "let just watch everything since i heard it's good and i'm sure  it won't disappoint me"                
I'm drawing this conclusion mainly people always say they are gonna try the first few episode,thus i want them to ignore Ep 1&2  first and maybe return back to Ep 1&2 after they get to know some chara introduced later in the series.
>> ARTICLE
Because if the movie was 100 hours long and the first hour sucked total dick youd be less inclined to finish it. The first hour was a struggle, why wouldn't the next 99 be? This happens in alot of good animes where people never make it past the first 1-2 episodes of character intros and plot building where its boring as shit but picks up later because if you fail to capture peoples attention at the start they're not going to stick around. 
>> ARTICLE
One of the things that's really baffling me is that the first 2 episodes weren't even *that* bad (just my opinion - it's cool if the world disagrees, I just didn't realize the world did).  
  
My friend and I had never read the manga or knew anything about Gintama before we decided to just start it and see what the hype was about. The first 2 episodes were a bit far-out (jumping right into the middle of things; it was clear that this was a cast of characters who already met, had inside jokes and recurring things and all that; that the first 2 eps were not the "beginning" despite being the first 2 eps).  But we weren't confused by it; we just assumed that anything that *needed* explaining probably would be explained eventually. If not it wouldn't be a great show, so why not trust it until it gets its groove going? I assume the creators made those episodes and called them 1 & 2 for a reason worth examining/experiencing? It didn't even take much trust anyway, within 40 minutes I don't even think we'd had time to finish eating the snacks we'd started the night with. 
>> ARTICLE
I think a more convincing explanation might be to say that the first two eps just don't fit with the rest of the series because they were meant as a juicy, delicious pickle for the manga readers. And if you haven't read the manga you're just left wondering what the hell is going on until Episode 3.
>> ARTICLE
Just remember that a lot of people agree that the beginning is slow - which it is.

> episode titles that sound like mid 2000's Metalcore albums.

As someone who likes mid 2000's metalcore, I'm slightly offended at this comparison.
>> ARTICLE
nah, no need to be slightly offended. the three pronged "x the y" approach to metalcore naming trends in the 2000s is basically undeniable, with such names as Protest the Hero, Haste the Day, Beneath the Sky, After the Burial, Escape the Fate, Blessthefall, Bleed the Sky, etc, being basically everywhere in the genre. heck, even really good metalcore bands aren't safe, like with Poison the Well and HORSE the Band. 
  

>> ARTICLE
All sound very much in Post Hardcore rather than Metalcore. For the most part.

Edit: I say this mostly because it seems to be more of a thing for Post Hardcore imo. Protest the Hero, Capture the Crown, Crown the Empire, The Bunny The Bear (close enough?), Pierce The Veil, Haste The Day, Hail The Sun, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh...

I'm more of a Killswitch Engage / Darkest Hour / All That Remains (*Fall of Ideals* album only) kind of guy.  I don't recall those groups doing that.

you see, I, on the other hand, was a MySpace scene chick, so unoriginal christcore bands were all I listened to back in the day and the result was a lot of what is basically AgK: The Musical. you spared yourself from the Dark Era of hxc. if it weren't for the fact that those bands were my entryway into bands like Converge and The Dillinger Escape Plan, boy do I wish I never...
>> ARTICLE
I've always found math metal amusing in concept, but any time I try listening to some I find it off-putting. Mind sharing what you find interesting about it?
>> ARTICLE
I think a big part of it is that it's supposed to feel off, and whether or not you enjoy the discordance and harshness of it is almost totally dependent on taste/preference, as well as what your views are with art in general. I'm a big fan of the idea that form necessitates function and structure should reflect the human condition (aka I'm pretentious af), so something really chaotic and weird and all jumbled up makes more sense to me emotionally than something with a cohesive flow to it. that's why books like Slaughterhouse Five or shows like Evangelion appeal to me and why it was so easy to get into things like [The Number Twelve](https://youtu.be/CmMRahc_uLI) that are sort of their musical equivalents.  
  
granted, the older I got and the less angry I am in general the less I feel compelled to listen to the genre, especially since now I realize that lyrically most of math metal has pretty backwards views that I no longer find even remotely okay. I've gone back to listening to math rock (like [This Town Needs Guns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhPljk5EZ0Q)) and twinkle daddy emo shit (like [Algernon Cadwallader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyTflQSjRnA)) since they generally embody all the things I liked about math metal but are less aggressive and is a lot more accessible at any given moment. I have my soft spot for math metal looking back, but I generally believe that outside of a few outstanding examples (those named above + a few others like Converge, Rolo Tomassi, Genghis Tron, and Daughters), the genre delves too much into masturbation rather than artistry for me to keep vouching for it. 
>> ARTICLE
So since I first replied to you I've been trying to think of a word to describe what I find odd about math metal. I think what I'm going to go with is "mechanical." Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the band or songs Pandora was playing for me a while back, but they were instrumental and decidedly proggier than that The Number Twelve you linked. To be honest, most of the elements in that song are things I don't have a problem with, it's just that I found their style of harsh vocals grating, and I thought the shifts kept coming way too fast; "hyperactive" might be a good word for it. At any rate, to get back to what I was originally saying, I think the nature of math metal in general has a sort of mechanical, unnaturally ordered sense to it, and I get put-off by an uncanny valley-like effect.

Anyway, that comment gave me some insight, and while it wasn't quite as helpful as I might have liked, I think that's because we were on very different ends of the math metal spectrum and there are too many other differences between our tastes for me to get a real read on it.

Loved all the ["session"](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop/episode) names in Cowboy Bebop.

Ballad of Fallen Angels and Real Folk Blues have great titles for such iconic episodes.

Huh. I had no idea that the Aerosmith episode title ("Toys in the Attic") was only in the English version. Damn good translation choice though. It really fits the episode AND matches the other titles.  
  
Just one more reason I think the dub of Cowboy Bebop is better than the original.

Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist (both versions) are the two shows that I feel absolutely no hesitation grabbing dubs for over subs.

Baccano is also on the list of acceptable dubs for me.

Gochiusa has some fucking weird and awesome episode titles. My personal favorite is, "Do You Remember the First Day You Got Drunk? You Tried To Light a Campfire In Your Own Home, Didn't You?"

Cross Ange has some amazing titles. If im not mistaken, the title of each episode tells you EXACTLY what the episode is about but most the time its phrased in a way that you dont understand it until the end of the episode.

Do you have any examples of this? I watched through the first cour and didn't notice this.
>> ARTICLE
yeah 

[Ep 1](/s "The Fallen Imperial Princess-- episode where she loses her Princess status and gets anally probed")

[Ep 2](/s "Defiant Soul- episode where she refuses to accept she is a Norma and keeps pissing everyone off")

[Ep 3](/s "Wilkiss Awakens-- She reawakens the Wilkiss")

It goes for every episode.

[Ep 8](/s "Bikini Escape- They escape the island, wearing bikinis")

[ep 10](/s "Goodbye From the Gallows- She sings the song, and escapes from being killed")

Samurai Champloo's alliteration is nice

"Tempestuous Temperaments"

"The Art of Altercation"

"Elegy of Entrapment"

"Evanescent Encounter"


Fitted well with the hip hop / rap theme of it all too.

Trigun had some pretty nice sounding ones:

Love & Peace

Escape from Pain

Diablo

I always appreciated "Diablo" and "Murder Machine" for their misdirection.  You expect that "Diablo" refers to the murderous criminal with the giant gun, but [spoilers](#s "at the end of the episode it actually refers to Vash when he gets angry").  "Murder Machine" isn't stated outright, but the title sure fits [spoilers](#s "Wolfwood, who is introduced in that episode better than the security drones")

>And Between the Wasteland and Sky...

Sounds like a quest from Fallout
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget Lost July and Hang Fire

I realllllly loved [Another](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11111/Another)'s episode titles:
    
    "Rough Sketch"
    "Blueprint"
    "Bone Work"
    "Put Flesh"
    "Build Limbs"
    "Face to Face"
    "Sphere Joint"
    "Hair Stand"
    "Body Paint"
    "Glass Eye"
    "Makeup"
    "Stand by Oneself"

I was like, these are weird titles, until I realized they were about building a creepy mannequin doll like in the show and then I was like oh my god this is amazing...


But, I think my single favorite episode title belongs to the Nagi no Asukara finale-

    "The Color of the Sea. The Color of the Earth. The Color of the Wind. The Color of Your Heart. Your Color. ~Earth Color of a Calm~"

Such a beautiful title, especially in context with the series.

How can you change the font ? 
>> ARTICLE
Four spaces in front turns the text into HTML code format.

Like:

    this.
>> ARTICLE
It's really meant for code of any kind. It uses a monospace font and keeps formatting (spaces and paragraph breaks), which is more or less necessary to make code interpretable to humans. It also has uses for other situations where you want to keep formatting though. 

I assume this guy wanted a list, one item per a line, and didn't want reddit to delete his paragraph breaks and squash it all up into one line (or to insert two paragraph breaks, which was the route most people in this thread seem to have taken). The same thing can be accomplished by adding in two spaces after a line, though, without the monospace font and stuff being thrown in.

That's like the secondary title to the whole series.

Isaac and Miria are definitely what took Baccano from good to great

That was a pretty awesome episode. You got to see Ladd Russo talking a lot, and slaughtering a lot. It was wonderful.

I liked Parasyte's episode titles which were all famous literary works.

* White World

* Black World

* Grey World

I love Neon Genesis' Japanese titles. Even if you're in the camp that doesn't think there's anything deep about the series you have to admit these titles are delightfully cryptic: 

* Episode 3: The Phone That Never Rings
* Episode 4: After Escaping the Rain
* Episode 11: In the Still Darkness
* Episode 14: Seele, the Throne of Souls
* Episode 22: At Least, Be Human
* Episode 24: The Final Messenger
* Episode 25: A World That's Ending
* Episode 26: The Beast That Shouted "I" at the Heart of the World

or EoE Part 2: "My purest heart for you". though the English titles are also pretty good.

I always found the Madoka titles to be wonderful representations of the episodes plot. [Madoka spoilers](/s "I was stupid. So stupid.") Is easily my favorite.

I love that the Madoka episode titles are quotes from each episode, but also that they are lines spoken by the character who said the last line of the preview for the episode. Just a cool little thing to pick up on if you're re-watching the show! 
>> ARTICLE
Prison School comes to mind.

* A Mighty Spurt
* Take Me Out to the Sumoland
* Full of Bodily Fluids

And my favourite:

* Eryngii Brockovich

Oregairu has some of the best episode titles:

* His Beginning With Her Finally Ends.

* One Day, They Will Learn the Truth.

* Thus, His and Her and Her Youth Continues to Be Wrong.

* The Scent of Tea Doesn't Fill That Room Anymore.

* The Thing That the Light in Each of Their Hands Shines On.

* Still, the Thing He Seeks Is Out of Reach, and He Continues to Mistake What's Real.

* Spring, Bound Beneath the Thick Snow, Begins to Sprout.

And my favorite

* His and Her Confessions Will Reach No One.

**Cowboy Bebop** session #2 - Stray Dog Strut (Nora Inu no Strut) Cowboy Bebop has many great titles but this is my absolute favorite. I love the imagery and the ideas that this title invokes. 

**Kanon (2006)** - All the titles use musical terms to help convey meaning. My favorite being episode #12 - A Strange-Looking Waltz
(Igyou no Waltz)

Honorable mention:

**B Gata H Kei** for having two titles per an episode. My favorite, episode #12 - Year 2 Class H's Christmas Eve! Take Me to Bed! / Kanejo Is Watching?! A "Live" Broadcast That Pushes the Limits!

**Serial Experiments Lain**  All the titles are a single word. These simple titles suits the strangeness that is Lain. My favorite, episode #5 - Distortion

how is this series? I've been meaning to watch it, but I also realize there was an OVA series before it. should I watch that first, or should I go straight to 2040?

Its a really cool series if your into cyber punk (Ghost in the Shell, Armitage III, Mardock Scramble).  I saw it back when it came out 15-18 years or so ago and really enjoyed it, and i think i rewatched it about 6-8 years ago and still enjoyed it (i own it on dvd, i should give it a rewatch some day again).  I feel it holds up well enough.  I would say to give it a shot, just keep in mind it is 15+ years old.  It has the same feel as Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw Star (They all came out about the same time and have similar story telling) if you liked those.
>> ARTICLE
The TV series is a remake, so they are separate continuities and you don't need to watch one before the other. A lot of people consider the series to be inferior to the OVAs, but I found the series to be fairly entertaining cyberpunk.

I've seen both, and I just completed the series last week.(OVAs were either very early this year or last year). It was enjoyable, and I preferred the art in the series(god Priss' hairstyle in the OVAs were garbage), but something about the original OVA just felt better imo. 

Though fuck the A.D. Police series, fuck it with a wax shooting spiked dildo. That was fucking garbage. It didn't even fit with anything in the plot of the series! It made no sense!(not talking about the AD Police OVAs, those were great)

Since a lot of good ones have been said, ill toss out something i enjoyed but dont see around much.  

[Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/306/Abenobashi_Mahou_Shoutengai) is a show made by gainex right after FLCL came out and i feel it is a series often overlooked but is a real gem.  Its about 2 kids from the "Abenobashi Shopping Arcade" who end up jumping through parallel worlds trying to find thier way back home.  [The episodes are the names of the parallel worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Shopping_Arcade_Abenobashi#Episodes)  

"Mystery! Abenobashi Shopping Arcade" is the original world, then each following episode takes place in a different world based on pop culture and nerdy interests.  

"Hook Up! Abenobashi Great Milky Way Shopping Arcade" is filled with tons of amazing sci fi referances from [all of your fav animes (and also panties... possible nsfw)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paY2PMDhOyU)

"Fire it Up! Abenobashi Hong Kong Combat Shopping Arcade" is filled with [shounen tropes and hilarity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5v_DFN-ARo).  

"Set your Heart Aflutter! Abenobashi Campus Shopping Arcade" dateing sim world would make even the [God of Conquest](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/kaminomi/images/0/0c/God_of_Conquest_Mode.png/revision/latest?cb=20110910064041) tremble.  

And finally "Huge Reversal!? Abenobashi Hollywood Shopping Arcade" is probably [the single most hilarious episode to an anime ive ever seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_tMD5bTbLM).    

[So do yourself a favor and go give the anime a watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfKMN7rLJpY), you will not regret it in the slightest.

I like Kuroko no Basuke's episode titles, as they usually correspond to something a character is going to say during the course of the episode. Then you're wondering who's going to say it and what effect it has.

* "I'll Win Even If It Kills Me"

* "I Surpassed You Long Ago"

* "I Will Defeat You!!"

* "Useless Effort"

The amount of times I've paused the episode to remind myself of the title whilst waiting for it to be said...

Eureka 7 AO 
I am disappointed but damn I can't stop watching it at this point
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty much only watching it bc of E7... I keep hoping it will hook me the same.... buuuuuut... just don't see it happening. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm begrudgingly keeping it up too. I keep telling myself it won't be a Truth appears/secret appears/Truth runs away episode again but damnit am I wrong 90% of the time and it makes me sad :(
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much. Eureka 7 is one of my top 3 favorite animes, really fond of it.
I dropped E7 AO after like 8 episodes. I don't even care about it anymore.

At this point I am just watching it because I want to see Eureka and Renton again :\

Second season of Haruhi. After the great first season...

Seriously? 8 episodes of nearly IDENTICAL content, for a 14 episode series? You have got to be kidding me. I understand Endless Eight, but did they really have to do 8 whole episodes instead of two "compilation" ones?
>> ARTICLE
I have yet to finish season 2 because of Endless Eight, was so long ago too. I should prob. go back to it and skip them. 
>> ARTICLE
I try not to remember the endless 8, I think that would be an effective method of torture. Forget water boarding, chinese water drip, and barney the dinosaur songs. Just make one episode of a show for the victim to watch and keep remaking the same episode for him/her.

I wasn't around for Endless Eight, but I have a bit of a question regarding that particular arc title.  When S2 was airing, when Endless Eight was airing, was the arc's name at the time actually Endless Eight?  Or was it named that afterwards?
>> ARTICLE
It's always been called Endless Eight. I think even in the light novels. It was amazing to watch as it slowly dawned on everyone that it was really going to be eight episodes of endless eight. 
>> ARTICLE
/a/ was in a shit storm for weeks. It was glorious.

The best thing was how they actually expended 8 episodes worth of budget doing it instead of just recycling animation heavily. Troll level: Haruhi

So what did the Eight originally represent?  August?

Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino 

I enjoyed the first season of Gunslinger Girl a fair amount, and didn't realize that it had been switched to a different studio between seasons. The difference was... kind of jarring.

Guilty Crown.  It had tons of hype, pretty animation and great music.  But, oh god the writing was terrible.  It was like the writer for Heroes was given an anime project to work on.

The second season of Maria Holic. I absolutely loved the first season but how the hell did that show fall apart so badly after the first season?
>> ARTICLE
I cannot figure out what went wrong. The seconds season was difficult to sit through and I couldn't even finish it.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the show just became too wacky. I was never fond of the supernatural aspects of Maria Holic, and the second season really runs with those.

In my case it's just no longer fresh nor "unique"

D.Grey Man. I tried to get into it, I really did, but I just couldn't get myself to like it. 
>> ARTICLE
Haha I did the exact same thing! So they search for the Marshall Cross bloke - but demons appear. Said demons drop like flies. Rinse and repeat. I feel like there just wasn't enough variety in the arcs, and no skill improvement on anybody's part. At least in Naruto and Bleach they learn bankai, rasengan etc. Also, the characters weren't that good. They were okay, but okay isn't going to keep me enthralled when there are better anime to watch out there.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean, but I can't--in good conscience--let you walk away from this anime. I found it boring in the beginning, but I pushed on. Now it's one of the best series I have seen. Tell me: which ep did you watch last? 
>> ARTICLE
I had this same problem, I am currently halted at episode 53... there just isn't any tension in the story for me to want to move forward.
>> ARTICLE
High School of the Dead. Episode 1 was probably the best first episode i have ever seen. Episode 2 and 3 are good as well.
The rest are just horrible.


>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed it for the most part, but I found the total fanservice episode a little unnecessary.
>> ARTICLE
If you're complaining about HOTD because of the fanservice, there's a good amount of "you really didn't expect fanservice when you picked it up?" Zombie and fanservice are kind of the premise.

Granted, it does both pretty horribly.
>> ARTICLE
There was some real hope for the anime if it didn't have that much fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
>but I found the total fanservice episode a little unnecessary.  
  
I felt like *every* episode was a total fanservice episode, and it just took away from what would otherwise have been a fun coming-of-age/zombie survival mashup.
>> ARTICLE
See I kinda like the series, at least on paper, but I just couldn't get over the amount of fan service. It felt like you were never more than two steps away from full fledged porn.

The second season of Black Butler would be mine. While I absolutely adored the first season, the second season didn't sit well with me at all; I blame it upon young sir Trancy, a thoroughly detestable character.
>> ARTICLE
Xam'd was very disappointing

I thought I was going to watch something good from bones, or that it would live up to its MAL score, but I had no clue what was going on the whole time and the anime just seemed bland.

Additionally, the art wasn't as good as people said it would be, but the Xam'd (monster like things) looked pretty good.

>> ARTICLE
Second season of Darker than Black. Loved the first season, I was giddy when I found out there was a second season only to be severely confused and disappointed. 

Also SAO, I know a lot of people like it, so I decided to give it a try. Cool concept, good potential, but the story is terrible (so far). I've heard good things about the book, I'll probably end up picking that up instead. 

Edit: I accidentally a word
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad that there are other people who aren't enraptured by SAO. I'm not too sure about the novels, but in the anime, Kirito is an extremely overpowered main character who renders almost everyone else useless and the story boring and without tension. There's nothing wrong with kicking your main character's ass once in a while.
>> ARTICLE
>Kirito is an extremely overpowered main character who renders almost everyone else useless 

Well, he did spend all of his off-screen time power leveling., it would be a surprise if he not one of the most powerful players in the game. 
>> ARTICLE
Does it make sense within the context of the world? Of course it does. Does it make for a good story and character? Not quite. The two are far from mutually inclusive.
>> ARTICLE
If it continues to follow the Light Novel from now on he will have some problems.
>> ARTICLE
If so, I'm looking forward to these problems- however, as it stands so far in the anime, all that I've said is true.
>> ARTICLE
I think you have to go into Darker than Black a certain way, otherwise it's pretty abrasive. You can't really view it as a *direct* sequel, more of a subplot that happens to involve the first season, it becomes more enjoyable. also, dat soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
The SAO novels are excellent, and the anime is barely getting into the "main plot", as the first few episodes dealt with isolated events that happened in Vol 2 of the LNs, so expect it to get better.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I figured, and why I included "so far". Like I said, it has pretty good potential, but as of right now, it seems very disconnected and in a way rushed. I might pick it up again when the "main plot" starts, but for now I'll just wait and see how peoples opinion of it progresses. 

edit: changed wording
>> ARTICLE
Did you watch past episode one of baccano? I couldn't 'get' it either at first, but reluctantly I watched a couple more and it became my favorite.

I have to say the Code Geass falls into this category for me. Maybe I'll give it another shot soon though.
>> ARTICLE
Thirded, I didn't like the art style very much either.
>> ARTICLE
I watched to episode 3 as I always give an anime 3 episodes before I give it up.
>> ARTICLE
Alright then. Different strokes for different folks I suppose.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass...but how?!?
>> ARTICLE
Well, mechs already don't hold enough interest for me, and the rest of the anime I didn't find appealing at all. I heard it's like Death Note, which is why I gave it a shot (and I think I'll give it another shot soon).
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, the mechs are a complete side-note. I completed it, and then was really surprised to see it described as a mecha anime, as if that was at all important in it. 
>> ARTICLE
I would suggest you reconsider it, looking at it not in a Mech vs Mech combat anime way, but rather as a political/relationship style anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Seiken no Blacksmith. Expected beautiful animation and a Lord of the Rings-esque fantasy plot you could lose your self in. Got cheap boob jokes and a shitty plot.
>> ARTICLE
Soul Eater was a good one overall, but the ending... THAT ENDING killed it for me

>> ARTICLE
It's a filler ending as in it deviates from manga. Which btw is much better.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you so much for saying that. I didn't even know that existed. I had always thought THAT ENDING was just some messy way to finish it all.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano spends a few episodes introducing many characters, you really need to give this one a go till the end as it only starts to make sense once all the stories start intertwining.

In response to your question, I just couldn't get into Texhnolyze, I even tried two separate times. There's little dialouge (from memory, it was a while ago) and no actions are explained, you are just watching people do stuff and thats about it.

For me Guilty Crown had high hopes and it all came crashing down

Clannad. So boring, and half the characters were just flat out annoying.

Clannad. Is a beautiful anime especially the After Story

To each his own, Clannad and AS are among my favorites!
>> ARTICLE
I've tried a couple time to get into Clannad, and the farthest I've gotten is episode 4.  I then took a look at an episode list, realized I had 5 more episodes to go in Fuko's arc, then just lost interest in continuing.
>> ARTICLE
One of the main reasons I didn't finish Clannad till this year was because of Fuuko.

If you want, you can just skip to episode 8-9 and watch those, as the other episodes don't really do anything but drag out Fuuko.
>> ARTICLE
After Story is much, much better. The pacing is better, the characters feel realer and more fleshed out, and the arcs are actually gripping.

Yeah, Clannad, the original, sucks though.
>> ARTICLE
okay i agree the Fuko thing was annoying, but Clannad is still my favorite anime. especially the After Story
>> ARTICLE
Elfen Lied watched a couple episodes the cousin was annoying and the character development was just off for me
>> ARTICLE
As someone who enjoyed the series, I will say:


-Fuck that goddamn cousin of his.-

Not just the fact that she's annoying, but she isn't dynamic either. She doesn't help advance the story, and really, has no reason to be in the series.

Bakemonogatari. :/

Edit2: My reasoning behind not entirely liking it mirror RyanFirpo below, I was expecting too much when watching it and in the end didn't find it appealing. 
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely this. It's so overhyped. The art is cool and creative, and the characters are original and interesting, but the dialogue isn't as witty and fun as people make it out to be. I also may have been expecting too much when in regards to plot. Still a good anime.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of the wittiness in the dialogue is dependent on who's doing the subtitles.  I know GGs subs were pretty decent, but there were others that didn't capture it as well.

>> ARTICLE
I don't really get Bakemonogatari either, it had a bit too much of the crazies. I can watch stuff without action like Spice & Wolf, but Bakemono just bored me a bit, though it was pretty funny.
>> ARTICLE
It's a show that's better than the sum of its huge amount of parts. And it kinda needs that the viewer enjoys each of those parts.

For example, not being able to enjoy its comedy would most likely lead to making it a torture to watch. People have different sense of humor and Bake's plays too much around different fields. Kanji/Pun jokes, self aware jokes, sexual jokes, manzai comedy, big-ass long etc. It's a weird mixture of different humor that's everywhere. Also, it doesn't help that Shinbo/SHAFT make the whole delivery absolutely unique. So it's natural that a show like that won't appeal to everyone.

I liked the show when it aired, but came to love it when I gave it a re-watch recently.

If you don't like some aspects of Bake, you should try Hidamari Sketch. It's a different kind of humor. I would describe it as more "consistent", but with a similar delivery to Bake's. Less sexual, more lighthearted SoL.
>> ARTICLE
An unpopular opinion should be backed-up with details. 

Otherwise it's defaulted to "hater's gonna hate".
>> ARTICLE
To me it's Berserk. It has a good story and it builds up perfectly towards the end but the way they ended it was awful. It's like 1 more episode and it could have been godlike but the lack thereof makes it lukewarm at best. Atleast that's how I remember it

If I remember correctly there's a remake in the making.

the golden age arc is in the middle of being released in [3 films](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-07-12/berserk-golden-age-arc-to-be-made-into-3-anime-films)

it seems the first has been released on bluray

The anime was cut short and left out like, 80% of the entire story. If you really enjoyed the badassery, I would suggest reading the manga.

If you enjoy good fiction, read Berserk. Badassery is just a byproduct.
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats. Too much Key-brand melodrama (read: sob stories that tried too hard to be tear-jerking), too little character development, and a shitty ending. Not to mention a horrible and out-of-place OP vocal.

Key is not my thing, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Cannot upvote this enough

I was watching it and was like - do people seriously find this sad?

Give a over-the-top sobby backstory (with barely any other character development, i should mention), add in some sad music, show characters bawling their eyes out - oldest tricks in the book. Come on people, this is the emotional equivalent of a laugh track...

There was, up to the the end, really no mention at all of romance between tenshi and the MC, but in the last ep they just throw it at you and all of a sudden you're supposed to be sad about their separation? Given, that last ep has to be the most masterful use of these tear jerking plot devices I've ever seen, but that doesn't change what they are - cheap plot devices with no real substance...

>> ARTICLE
I was laughing pretty badly at the last few minutes of that final episode. The beginning was surprisingly well-paced for once, and I thought it was going to end on a pleasant note. But nope, had to finish on that pitch-perfect, "STEEELLAAAA," wail.
>> ARTICLE
People downvoting when their favourite series got mentioned.  Stay classy. 
>> ARTICLE
That'd be [/r/anime](/r/anime) for you. Unless you specifically mention probability of being downvoted for your opinions in an extra eloquent manner or are extremely polite about it and write 20 pages about why you didn't like it, at every step highlighting good points of the show, you're bound to get downvoted.
>> ARTICLE
I downvote comments that are controversial, and have no detail. 

Hear me out.

I have no problem with somebody having a controversial response, that's fine. I have a problem when they don't back it up with anything, because that tells me that that person most likely put in a controversial reponse, just for the sake of being controversial. They don't have any real strong feelings towards the series, but just said "fuck it, I'll probably get some attention, and get some upvotes for being so edgy". It just serves to tick me off.
>> ARTICLE
I like Baccano, but I also think it's very overrated.

Other than that, I didn't like Shuffle, Haruhi, or Lucky Star, and I'm almost certain that with the things I've heard about K-On, I'm not going to like that either.

EDIT: Also, guys, I'm seeing a lot of downvotes for people who simply answered the question. If you don't like their opinion, that's okay, but don't go downvoting everyone just because they don't like the shows that you do.
>> ARTICLE
not many people know Baccano. I think it's one of the most underrated gem that is easily one of my top 10's or 5's and the fact that it never got a second season just proves that no "moe anime with poorly made story" loving otaku gave it a chance.

D gray man, akatsuki, and every anime that was discontinued.

Campione! I watched 3 episodes then stopped completely. The explantion of the story (from which animes are suppose to explain what the fuck is going on) went way too fast, all most as if it was forced to a point. I mean, am I missing out on anything? 'Cause the first few episodes were really disappointing.
>> ARTICLE
I have to say, my disappointment is in the anime community in general. I've always loved anime, and watched it just like I do any other medium. I have never taken part in the actual anime community though.

Now I find that talent has been scrapped for fan service and lolis

Same here. Most fans seem to care about anime like Yuri Yuri or K-on! than anything else.

Shakugan no Shana and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. I kept trying but just couldn't get into either of them. 
>> ARTICLE
Here are two from me:

The first is Evangelion, but my reasons for not liking it are pretty different from everyone else's:

To start with, I didn't think that Shinji was really that whiny or anything. To be honest every time he didn't want to pilot the mecha, he had legitimate reasons for it, however, the show tried to pass the reason he didn't want to to his 'weakness' or his issues with his father. Also, EVERY character's flaws supposedly coming from dead/bad/both/nonexistant parents strained credibility WAY too much for me. 

The next issue I had was with the philosophy. Everyone says that it's really deep, meaningful, and intelligent, but it's really kind of just... not. I'd even go so far as to say that Hideaki Anno isn't nearly as smart as he thinks he is, and that's really what killed the show for me. It wasn't deep, it was kind of just... fake deep, like fortune cookie text or something. All deepities (http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deepity) and no real substance.





The second is Last Exile. I liked the setting with the steampunk and the airnaval battles and stuff, but it was just plain BORING. The second episode was that lame plane race, and then it took 7 episodes for the whole 'im dying take this child' thing to happen, and the plot to seemingly start, after which it continues to do fuck all. I dropped that at that point.
>> ARTICLE
Zero no Tsukaima. Good VAs, excellent music, dialog/animation was mostly well written.

S1 was good, if a little slow. S2 had awesome plot at times, devolved into fanservice and boob jokes at times. S3 was complete trash. I watched the first 5 minutes of the newest season and quit.
>> ARTICLE
School Rumble. First season was hilarious with all its awkward moments (especially the last episode) but then the second season seemed like it was trying too hard to be cool and funny.
>> ARTICLE
The original Hellsing series, the voice acting was terrible
>> ARTICLE
Clannad mostly because of the amount of hype people put into it. I watch the original series which is decent, I enjoyed it, and am told to also watch AfterStory because it's *amazing*. So I watch it, and it starts with side stories that are fairly sub-par compared to the original series in my opinion. I then have to wait to get 2/3 of the way through to get the the "good" part, and then that's it. Then there's the whole thing with [spoiler](/s "Ushio dieing, and honestly that really felt shoehorned in and was only there for forced tears.").

Good series, and it was worth it to get the the later parts of AfterStory, but you guys may want to stop advertising it by saying you cried for weeks.
>> ARTICLE
Whattttt?

I really, really disliked Clannad, the original. It was boring, none of the characters developed in a natural way. It was more of, "here's a character's arc so they can develop, then we'll shove them off to the side!" I didn't like the main heroine too much (I find it hard to dislike Nagisa since she's nice and all, but fuck her character was boring, and just *too* fragile). Honestly, when the best characters by far are supporting (Nagisa's parents), a show has a problem. This isn't even mentioning the uselessness of Fuko's arc (and how fucking annoying she was).

Anyways, transition to After Story, and they actually give depth to the supporting characters, the pacing is much faster (1-3 episode arcs for each character), and the writers don't have to give any exposition, so the characterization feels more natural. I don't feel many "feels" necessarily (I'm only on episode 10/whatever), but I'm not really that emotional (sometimes my eyes water up or something, but that's the limit). 

Yeah, anyways tl;dr, can't believe you liked any part of Clannad better than any part of After Story.
>> ARTICLE
it wasn't forced in for tears that what happened in the visual novel that the anime is based on.
>> ARTICLE
I hear where you're coming from, I really hate it when people say things like "omg all my feels, you have to watch this, oh man I'm still crying" when trying to explain clannad or any kind of emotional anime of this sort. And I mostly agree with your points on clannad, but I enjoyed the ride.

Oh man im so gonna get downvoted now, Neo genesis evangelion isn't really that great and I had very high hopes for it.

FLCL and School Days.  FLCL was mostly just inane, but School Days is a steaming pile of shit.

School Days ending was probably one of the good parts of the show. The rest was basically the MC fucking girls.

I've heard rumors of a second season, but I don't think I'll watch it because the 1st season was garbage.
>> ARTICLE
How would there be a second season?

You have to go into watching FLCL expecting nothing and only ridiculousness to enjoy it.

I hope you watched FLCL more than once. It's definitely not a one hitter quitter. Agreed that School Days is shit, however.

People advertise Ano Hana for being a tear-jerker like Clannad. It is not good for being a tear-jerker, don't watch it for those comments. I like it for the atmosphere it gives off and how much I can connect with the characters. Essentially the feels are all subtly placed within the series. It's never fun to grow apart from your friends or to see your friends being bullied.
>> ARTICLE
>  It's never fun to grow apart from your friends or to see your friends being bullied.

I feel like I would like the story more if it focuses on the fragile childhood friendship instead of "what does menma want?". But oh well,  different expectation can ruin an viewing experience I suppose.

Neon Genesis Evangelion. The show is really polarizing for the anime community, and I realize why. I feel that it was a great idea, but was executed so poorly. Overuse of symbolism, mentally disturbed characters who are surrealistic and hard to believe. Random "wtf?" moments scattered throughout. Idk, I "got" the show, but it just wasn't for me at all.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. Supposedly the author was heavily depressed when creating NGE and, suffering from heavy depression myself, I know how it works - you just continue working without any specific idea or reason in mind, without the desire to polish details, bleeding stuff about yourself everywhere around and doing a lot of stuff that makes little to no sense to others. You don't think what you're doing is great, but you won't redo it because thinking that perhaps what you are making is in fact crap makes you feel even worse.

To me, NGE wasn't *that* bad, but I really feel that 99% of show popularity is hype. The symbolism itself is as deep as literally anything else that you are willing to research about, pacing is way too slow, there are pretty much no side characters and the main ones are almost all annoying in one way or another and the ending feels somewhat forced.

As a disclaimer, I didn't read the manga or watch the movies, just the main show.
>> ARTICLE
>overuse of symbolism

What symbolism exactly? I can see the cross symbol as being illogical and somewhat overused, but the rest can mostly be explained with the secret organization's attempts to give everything religion-inspired names.

>mentally disturbed characters

That's what the show is about.

>who are surrealistic and hard to believe

I found them to be very realistic (even though not always likeable). It's the usual anime characteres that are not.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that most anime characters aren't believable either, so that was a poor choice of argument. I do respect the unorthodox character approach, as it defies convention (no "hero" character is refreshing for a change). But still, while I respect that aspect of the show, it didn't contribute to my enjoyment of it.

Noir.

Goddamn noir.

Yeah, I got to the fourth volume and gave up. It just became a bit boring, in comparison to the first couple of episodes. One of these days I will finish it...

That's me exactly, over and over. I bought it a decade ago (geez, 2002 is a decade already?) due to Yuki Kajiura's music, but I just cannot get through it.

I feel the same way, and I can't even be mad at the show because I loved Mireille's character design and it gave me Kirei na Kanjou, which has been on my playlists for 10 years now.
>> ARTICLE
toradora.

[taiga](/s "is a huge bitch. i would rather ryuji have ended up with minori or ami, who are not.")


>> ARTICLE
I didn't like toradora either.

The first half was good but it quickly went downhill. Plus, Taiga's design is complete nonsense. If the diehard fans want to convince themselves that her stature represents "How she has a small body but a HUGE personality! :3" then let them. But to me, she's nothing more than fanservice to the crowd that enjoys prepubescent girls.

And looking back on the story, the anime gets even more ridiculous. All that crap happened in *one* year. It's too damn over the top. [Toradora Spoilers](/s "From strangers to wanting to elope in one year?")

Oh, not to mention how that one model chick's character development is essentially dropped after the first half.

Did not like the series. 4/10, would not recommend.

Overhype was definitely a part of this.

And people seemed to love the kissing scene. I cringed during the scene. It was so darn predictable. A tsundere character has a slightly controlling attitude during a kissing scene? So original.

Even though the episodes were 20 minutes long, it felt like an hour. I don't think high school romances are for me. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched solely for ami
>> ARTICLE
i fucking hated Ami

she went from a raging bitch to a raging bitch that thinks shes above everyone else
>> ARTICLE
I think you have that backwards. Besides, she really loses the bitchiness factor as the series progresses. Seems like you just have it out for her.
>> ARTICLE
She certainly is. I guess the enjoyment hinges on you being able to get over that, and over Ryuji being her doormat. (Which I did, in fact.)

Gurren Lagann. I was told that it was really good. Some said it was their most favorite anime of all time. For me it was bad. Really bad. The plot was horrible. Every episode I watched I hoped for a redeeming factor, but none was found. It became worse and worse. Even after mercilessly powering through the whole series. There was no payoff. Just me sitting on the couch staring at the complete series dvd set on the coffee table in front of me wishing I never bought it to begin with.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed. TTGL was extremely disappointing to me. Sure, it's a brilliant show for 10 or 11 year old boys, but, sadly, I'm a bit older and things just getting bigger and bigger(ahem) don't really excite me.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. I thought the same thing. I figured if I was an 11-13 year old boy I would have loved the series. The show was just was not for me.
>> ARTICLE
You're not alone. After all the hype, I was disappointed to find it was just another shounen anime with fan service, childish humor, and melodrama. I would have loved it when I was 15, but I just couldn't get into it now. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah for me it was over hyped, but I gave it a chance. Hey, at least I watched the whole series and didn't give up on it. lol. I think the problem was the last guy to tell me I had to watch it was a huge fanboy of the series. I think it was one of his first introductions to anime. I can't fault him for that. Of coarse there was an age gap between us. He grew up on Pokemon and such. Good series imo. I haven't watched it all, but if an episode was on. I'd watch it. I grew up on Voltron, Robotech and such. I think when he watched Gurren Lagann the first time. He was in the age group that the anime was targeting and I understand that. I think we can all understand that. We all have our childhood shows we like that we won't turn our backs on. For him Gurren Lagann was one of them.

Quick,  someone link that analysis on the evolution of the spiral theme throughout the series.

Yeah, *Baccano* and (no surprise) *Durarara*

Although I think a big one for a lot of people, including me, is **K-On**. for a show with so much hype, a lot of us found it to be very boring...
>> ARTICLE
I somehow enjoyed Durarara!! even though I didn't for Baccano! I might give Baccano another go sometime though.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the first half of Durarara, but then they quit focusing on the cool characters. 
 
>> ARTICLE
I agree about Durarara, I watched I think about the first eight episodes but it had already lost my interest before I got that far, I wasn't really paying attention after the fourth or fifth one.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka Magica.

I was expecting some sort of mind-blowing anime that I would marathon and finish in one day. Sadly, I was wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious to see how far you got through the series, because I started off thinking the same thing.  My reaction to the show went something like this.

Episode 1 - This is about what I expected.

Episode 2 - Why am I watching this?

Episode 3 - That's it, I'm dropping thi-... wait, what?

Episode 4 - ...This is not bad.

Episode 5 - This is actually pretty good.

...

Episode 12 - FUCK YEAH!

Madoka Magica turned into something *completely* different than what I was expecting, and defied my (admittedly low) expectations.  I think that's why I liked it so much.  If you never got through at least episode five, I'd recommend giving it another chance.
>> ARTICLE
Hardly mind blowing, but I found it interesting and fun enough to watch. You did get past the first ~5 episodes, right? 

Also the soundtrack is fucking godly. 
>> ARTICLE
Elfen Lied and Umineko no Naku Koro ni are the only anime which I've watched most of the episodes of yet still felt were very disappointing. 
>> ARTICLE
Yup, recently finished Elfen Lied, I was really disappointed, the storytelling felt horrible, the animation during the last few episodes was bad, some characters were really useless or underdeveloped, anyway it's just my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Umineko was an amazing story, but the anime really butchered it. It lost almost all the charm points from the original story and felt really rushed. The first arc was okay moving at such a fast pace, but novels 3 and 4 are both about twice the length of volume 1 and shouldn't have been given so little screen time.

If you liked the concept, hit up witch-hunt.com to get the translation patches of the novels and give it a shot.

It was a very disappointing anime though. :/
>> ARTICLE
I loved elfen lied but thats just my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Umineko was disappointing with the way the anime just cuts off from the novels and never actually ends.  Elfen Lied isn't everyone's cup of tea.
>> ARTICLE
Eureka 7 and Deadman Wonderland.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed about Deadman Wonderland. Watched it about halfway, and got bored by the ridiculous situations (specifically, I remember something about the MC talking to the little sister of another character, and how that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me), and the fact that it was just another goddamn shonen, except this time with BLOOOOOOOD OMAGAD. 

It's disappointing because I really did like the setup and the premise of it. 
>> ARTICLE
Why Deadman Wonderland?
>> ARTICLE
Samurai 7 would have to be mine.. i loved the Kurosawa movie and it looked like the anime version got good reviews but i absolutely couldn't get into it and i hated it.
>> ARTICLE
For me it would have to be:

5 cm/s, I guess I just couldn't relate.

FLCL, flipping symbolism everywhere and I'm no good with it.

Shakugan no Shana after season 1

Haven't finished it but so far FMA Brotherhood can't even come close to matching the original series.
>> ARTICLE
Soul Eater. Heard a lot of positive things about it, so I bought the first part of the first season when it was on sale at Walmart for $10. I watched the first two episodes and I was just so disappointed by the lack of character quality. Maybe it gets better, I'm not sure, I was just so surprised by how underwhelming it was. 
>> ARTICLE
The ending of Soul Eater is just teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrible.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, you're disappointed in the characters after only watching one episode per character?  You didn't even get out of the prologue before dropping it.

Steins;Gate.

Naming a couple that have already been mentioned in this thread:

Lucky Star, Bakemonogatari, Angel Beats!, Spice and Wolf, Summer Wars, and Panty and Stocking.

All good anime, but also overrated. In no respect would I call any of them "masterpieces".

EDIT: Huh. Why am I being downvoted for my opinion? My internet points! D:

Eureka SeveN

Sakamichi no Apollon. It's just not my kind of music which ruins pretty much the whole anime for me.
>> ARTICLE
I'm completely the opposite. I was an absolute classical guy when I went into it (ie. Nodame 4 lyfe) but after hearing some of the music in there. I can't believe I missed out on such great stuff for so long.
>> ARTICLE
Music bad? Well I guess we can't all like jazz, but damn that was one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
If you don't like jazz, then I'm curious as to why you watched it in the first place? I thought it was pretty clear from the beginning that it was going to be about jazz.
>> ARTICLE
I tried to give it a chance, as I usually do with a new series.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely Nisemonogatari, Bakemonogatari was great IMO... but i just don't get it at all.

In my opionion, it's plot was bad/non-existant (until the last few episodes) and they have rampant fan-service and fucking incest.


Can someone explain to me why people like Nisemonogatari?
>> ARTICLE
>plot was bad/non-existant

Maybe we haven't watched the same series. No matter; the plot is exploring...

- what happens to the characteres in Araragi's world after Bakemonogatari?
- how does Araragi's relationship with Senjougahara develop?
- especially now that Araragi still likes to solve the problems of his harem members, despite being in a binding relationship with said violent sadistic fascinating tsundere?
- what does Araragi do when confronted with the fact that (fake and real) supernatural forces invade deeper into his life than he would have ever imagined?
- especially now that his YLMF (yoda-like mentor figure) is gone?
- and what's up with Araragi's power source, anyway?

>they have rampant fan-service

I don't see how anybody could see this as anything but a good thing. Are you asexual and/or a puritanic American?

>fucking incest

They *played* with it. As with any joke, the majority of the fun comes from the delivery. Just like when in Lilo & Stitch the mad scientist says "So, tell me, my little one-eyed one... *on what poor, pitiful, defenseless planet has my monstrosity been unleashed?*" and the movie switches to Hawaii.
>> ARTICLE
I second all of the aforesaid points of the plot. Also I really liked that Shinobu became more major of a character than she was in Bakemonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
Here goes my karma, but i strongly disliked code geass, everything from the pseudo intelectualism, to the emperor of the wold being a high schooler, to the meh fight scenes . I know im in the minority here, but to me its probably the most overrated anime.

Gurren Lagann. Disappointing at the end. Ruins everything
>> ARTICLE
It didn't really have a lot of talk about being 'great', but the most disappointing for me would have to be Starry Sky.


I went in thinking it would be fabulous like UtaPri, but oh, how it failed to live up to my expectations.
>> ARTICLE
It's never been an anime with a lot of hype surrounding it, but Popotan was very disappointing for me. 

I'm a big fan of Poyoyon Rock's character design, I thought the concept sounded interesting, and Momoi Haruko, one of my favourite seiyuu, had a starring role as well as performing the OP, so I was expecting great things. 

To this day I'm not sure how or why I bothered to watch the whole series - it wasn't without its positives, but it was highly disappointing.
>> ARTICLE
Tenjo Tenge. That fight scene at the beginning is so insanely bad ass but then nothing but boring boring boring unlike-able characters.

And yes I tried the manga, less of a disappointment but I wasn't interested in the echii, which seemed to be all it was about so it makes sense when the anime took it out all we were left with was nothing.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi. I hate to say it because the concept is absolutely fascinating and the stories are great. But it is just WAY too dense for me. I couldn't keep up with how slow it was and it makes me sad :( I really like those types of shows (ie. Aria/Natsume). 
>> ARTICLE
That's a huge shame. Adored Mushishi, wish there was more like it out there. Found myself with a huge longing for more after it ended.
>> ARTICLE
> I couldn't keep up with how slow it was

If you think that's slow, watch Bartender. It moves at a snail's pace and when you thing the episode is at the half way point, you'll discover that it's only been 6 minutes.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano!, Eureka 7, and Haruhi. Eureka 7 was good, but nothing spectacular. I dropped both Baccano! and Haruhi very early on. I don't remember why I couldn't get into Baccano!, but Haruhi was just  tooslow. Even watching the original air order, I felt it was badly-paced and quite boring.
>> ARTICLE
The second season of Honey and Clover. I really enjoyed the first season but the second just kind of left me empty. It depressed me a bit and though some series can do that and I enjoy them immensely this just didn't do it for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
Haruhi Suzumiya S2. I was so hyped up for that one, and then they pulled that whole Endless Eight thing. I don't care how 'creative' or 'ballsy' it was, then and now it still feels like a waste of time to me.

Umineko no Naku Koro Ni. I love love *love* the sound novels and made it through volume 4 before the anime ended... the anime was a dreadfully paced, butchered adaptation. They tried to cram far too much into a two cour anime and tried to fanservice up all the girls in the art/merchandise for the series.
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka. I wanted to like it so much but it was just really boring to me.
>> ARTICLE
Huge shame. Enjoying it a wondrous amount, here.

Yumekui Merry.  It had so much potential and had such a nice and surprising build up only to end early and not go anywhere with it.
>> ARTICLE
Nisemonogatari. I just finished watching Bakemonogatari after seeing so much praise for it and really enjoyed it. One of the things I was worried about was the harem feel of it since it's basically one guy and a ton of girls but I didn't get that with the first season. 

The second season, however, the dialogue seems too drawn out and the episodes are just far less interesting. This is natural since introducing characters is more exciting and already happened in season one, but some things just take forever to happen.  Also there's too many sexual scenes which gave off that harem vibe I'm not a fan of.
>> ARTICLE
guilty crown the second half tried to hard to be like code geass (protagonist being hated by those around him but is doing it for the greater good sorta thing) and failed imo i felt like i was supposed to be feeling sorry for him and instead i just hated him

Any anime that has a decent story and a good climax, then keeps on going. DBZ should've ended with Frieza, Death Note should've ended after L, ect. The endings would need more rounding out, of course. Also I get *very* disappointed when I find out a series doesn't follow the manga. Only just recently learned that the original Full Metal Alchemist was an original story. When I'd heard of FMA: Brotherhood I'd just assumed it was just some kind of rehash of the story kinda like the whole Tenchi Muyo / Tenchi Universe / Tenchi in Tokyo for some goddamn reason.

Guilty crown or bleach for me.
Guilty crown was good up to I think episode 12?  Where they save the day   and everything is well and good.  But then they just jumbled everything and then got ridiculous.  The ending espesically.
Bleach up to the Aizen fight.  Strictly speaking about the anime that is, they just had to end it on a BS arc as they did.  WHY.
>> ARTICLE
Every season of Saiyuki was disapointing. Thought the anime would be great since the Manga is my all time favorite, but the characters were stale, the animation was beyond terrible.

Fullmetal Alc (2003) purely because of the ending  hated that ending, the anime did such a great job with building up characters stories and just killed the anime. However, Brotherhood was incredibly well done.

I agree on Baccano!. It was a good show, I'd give it a 7/10, but not 8.69 it's averaging on MAL for me. 

Another one is Clannad. I like slice of lifes and some good romance, but it just really didn't work for me.

BlackRock Shooter OVA. After seeing so many picture and talk all I got was a stupid sob story about 3 girls and their shitty drama and in between that (yes, IN BETWEEN! BlackRock Shooter wasn't the focal point!) was bad unrelated fight scenes. I was so confused and absolutely destroyed by the end that I almost went on a killing spree. It broke me. The series partly made up to it (it took me a lot of guts to give it a try) it was what I expected. Two stories that knit together nicely with cool over the top fight scenes. But still to this day (I'm a fairly mellow passive guy) I beat anyone senseless who jokes or is serious about BlackRock Shooter OVA being good. I can understand different tastes an I'm a music player who loves music and I can handle when you diss my favorite band but I completely snap when I hear someone compliment o remind me of that disappointing anime that took away some of my emotions. I've never cried since. Not once. I simply can't feel anymore.

Alright, ill probably be shamed as a hipster for some of these, but here we go:

-Clannad. didnt make it past episode 3. it was THAT boring.

-Evangelion. the only show i have ever given a 0, though i will be called an "idiot watching something too deep for him" like the last 4 times if i say why.

-Bakemonogatari. it wasnt that bad, but it just didnt catch me and i really disliked a few of the characters. Also Arararagi has Shinji Matous voice, so i had to hate him.

-Rosario + Vampire. expected an atleast decent harem, got 2 seasons of steaming piles of shite.

-Kuroshitsuji, both seasons. First season was really good until it stopped following the manga, then it got awful. 2nd season was just plain horribad.

-the Gurren Lagann movies. they left out too many things, rewrote too much and Lagann-Hen took the perfectly executed final fight and made it stupid.
>> ARTICLE
I wish I knew evangelion was meant for people into hidden meaning and wutnot, I was waiting for the guy to finally uppercut his dad and shit but instead its full of psycho babble...I guess im kinda simple -_-
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion is just a primordial soup of everything i hate about anime:

- every character is either a whiny fuckhead or an asshole. The one that isnt is an emotionally dead clone.

- over 90% of the episodes are monster of the week episodes with the occasional clash of assholes.

- Shinji is more hateable than Nina Einstein, Inori from Guilty Crown, The non-Saeko girls from Highschool of the Dead,  Alois Trancy, Fifth from Mirai Nikki, Tsukune from Rosario + Vampire and Femto from Berserk combined.

- 1 episode of Evangelion contains 10x the amount of whine that people think Guilty Crown contains.

- Both the endings are worse than those of Mass Effect 3.

and thats just the tip of it.

I love Baccano, but it does start off pretty bad. I bet I've tried to rewatch it 5 times but I've only watched the whole thing twice because I got so bored watching the first couple episodes. It might just not be your thing, though.

So far, Clannad mainly. I knew After Story was better, but Clannad was bad.

I agree with Baccano! too. I loved the writing/plot design, but when I pieced everything together, I was a little underwhelmed. I also didn't really like the characters besides Isaac and Miria much. I think it's a fantastic show, but it just didn't appeal to me.

What the hell? that was completely obvious from the first 5 minutes of the show. Even the shows name gave a pretty big hint.
>> ARTICLE
If you've made it through the whole series make sure you check out the OVA.  It leaves open the possibility that Niwa may be wrong about her after all.
>> ARTICLE
Use the spoilertag next time. The comand is written in the sidebar.
>> ARTICLE
Downvoted for having horrible spoiler warning. 
>> ARTICLE
Baccano as well. Couldn't get past the first two minutes.

Durarara!! and Angel Beats!, too. Though I watched both and thought they were ok.
>> ARTICLE
that's everyone's favorite couple
>> ARTICLE
I find it to be 51/49 between Isaac/Miria and Claire/Chane. My preference changes constantly.
>> ARTICLE
I agree.

Both of those pairings are just awesome.

>> ARTICLE
I think expressing Isaac/Miria took a helluva lot more effort though. Superb job from their seiyuus. Anything less and it would have just been cheesy.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget [Ray and Charles Beams](http://i.imgur.com/sIZK2.png) from Eureka 7. They eclipse Isaac and Miria in my mind.
>> ARTICLE
holy shit. We need a battle royale to see who is on top. It can't be combat though.
>> ARTICLE
I personally like Firo and Ennis
>> ARTICLE
Glad someone else agrees.  They always seem overlooked. 
>> ARTICLE
MIRRRRRRRIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
>> ARTICLE
[ISAAAAAACCC!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=7veE9IV93vo#t=249s)
>> ARTICLE
They also have a cameo in Durarara!!
>> ARTICLE
Great moment considering how Durarara seems to be based off Baccano! (not saying it is but there are similarities).
>> ARTICLE
Not really *based* per se, just the same production crew who threw the linkage in as sort of an homage to their previous hit.  Really, no great similarities between the two stories imo.
>> ARTICLE
Structurally. the way that there are many characters (some more promintent that others leading independent lives that are interconected by some misterious factor that you come to understand over the length of the anime. Pretty similar.
>> ARTICLE
Structurally, you are correct.  However, "based off of" typically indicates a foundation of inter-connection between *story* -lines, not typically a reference to the structure of a story.
>> ARTICLE
I loved that cameo. [I love how they didn't figure out they were immortal until like 80 years in the future when they finally notice they weren't aging](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
They do? What episode?
>> ARTICLE
It's during an episode in which fireworks are going off across the district.  I can't remember which episode, though I think it was near the one when our protagonist gathers his "gang" in public for the first time via the cell phone network.  I haven't seen it in a while, so my recall is too fuzzy on the particulars.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or is Baccano confusing as fuck?
>> ARTICLE
Watch it a second time through and it makes a lot more sense.  I was confused as hell the first time through.
>> ARTICLE
I thought this for a while, I think I've watched the first two episodes three times trying to understand it properly.

It all starts to make (a bit of) sense once you get to about episode 4... kind of :P
>> ARTICLE
If someone ever asks you if you want to watch a show called "Evangelion," RUN!
>> ARTICLE
When does it become confusing as fuck? I just watched episode 19, and while it's disturbing and things are unanswered, it's really not too bad.
>> ARTICLE
The whole time, most of the major antagonists' motivations and actions are unclear, but when you watch episodes 25, 26 and the movie End of Evangelion, if you know what happened, then you probably know more about the series than the writer did. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I can accept that. I've heard the ending is one of the biggest WTFs in anime, and, quite honestly, I'm excited for it.
>> ARTICLE
He should probably stay away from Memento while he's at it.
>> ARTICLE
Chaos head gave me a huge headache

And of course Fooly Cooly, (FLCL)
>> ARTICLE
SE: Lain and Texhnolyze would be totally fine, though.
>> ARTICLE
Texhnolyze you're fine until near the last episodes. Lain tho....I just got a migraine thinking about it

What show is this?
>> ARTICLE
[Link to more info about it](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4897)
>> ARTICLE
Baccano!
>> ARTICLE
Easily the best couple ever, *easily*.
>> ARTICLE
only couple ever, i was so happy to see them in Durarara!!, any word on what they are makeing next?
>> ARTICLE
Wait what. Durarara!! just moved to the top of my "to watch" list.
>> ARTICLE
What. I saw DRRR!! before Baccano! Where the hell are they?
>> ARTICLE
in that bit when the headless...biker rides down the building and all the people are standing around
>> ARTICLE
Isaac/Miria and Ray/Charles Beams are definitely my two favorite couples, can't ever choose between the two of them.

Love 'em both.
>> ARTICLE
[Miria](http://myanimelist.net/character/3796/Miria_Harvent/pictures) looks super weird in this sketch.
>> ARTICLE
You mean in my drawing or in the ones you posted, because I thought she looked a little off in mine.  
>> ARTICLE
Yea, she looks a little weird. Her cheek looks funny.
>> ARTICLE
That would be it!  Thanks for pointing that out, I couldnt pinpoint the exact problem. :)
>> ARTICLE
Her mouth is too close to her ear/not enough cheek it seems.

Either way it's a nice picture
>> ARTICLE
looks like she is chewing gum. 
>> ARTICLE
That would be a lock of hair
>> ARTICLE
Protruding from her ear
>> ARTICLE
Like it Love it!!!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah who doesn't?

>> ARTICLE
Those two have such a passion for life, everything, and each other. I thought Baccano was beautiful in no small part because of these two.
>> ARTICLE
What's wrong with her face?
>> ARTICLE
I would of upvoted you for "Anime! My favourite couple!" too.
>> ARTICLE
Is the dub of this any good?
>> ARTICLE
I've heard the dub actually got better reviews than the original because the VA's were able to actually get the accents and make them sound original. Whereas the Japanese actors had trouble making the voices sound right. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
> gives it a lot of authenticity that you don't really get as much with the Japanese dub

This. IIRC they hired actors who originated the regions that their characters did, so their accents sounded natural.
>> ARTICLE
I keep hearing of this anime, but never watched it. It looks interesting. What is it about? Is it worth it?
>> ARTICLE
It can express itself better in the first two or three episodes really than anyone can explain it. It's honestly in my top five easily(spelling?).
>> ARTICLE
Ok. Maybe I will check it out here soon. Spelling?? You spelled everything very well. :D
>> ARTICLE
The word easily didn't look right to me. The best I can do is say it's an extremely non-linear adventure with several main characters with intertwined plots.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good to me.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the couple. But Miria reminded me of a girl I had a crush on. :(
>> ARTICLE
Those guys were locos. :)
>> ARTICLE
fact
>> ARTICLE
An awesome duo, but I never got a couple vibe from them. I know they were meant to be lovers, but it felt more like he was her mentor uncle who she worshipped and listened to all the time. He also looked way older than her.

SO BRAVE.

Only shipping Shinji deserves is [UBW minor spoiler](/s "Shinji x Lancer's Fist.")

That was the most satisfying thing I'd ever seen in an anime. I kept watching it over and over again.

That's true. There's a reason why he's taken number 1 in every popularity poll.

My personal favourite three:


* Code Geass


* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann


* Puella Magi Madoka Magica




I think that whatever I watch in the future, Code Geass will always be my favourite. 
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah, Code Geass for the win.  However, I'd also like to take a step back and say that I recognized I have a bias towards Code Geass and it would seem you do too.  Going into an anime thinking it can't possibly be better is only setting you up to play down the anime a lot.  So while currently Code Geass is also my #1, I accept there can be better.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that there are many anime better than Code Geass, however I doubt anything will remove the nostalgia and emotional attachment I have to the series.

Its my favourite anime, all-time. Albeit I'm new to this. I just wish there was more. Like 100+ episodes more.
>> ARTICLE
From what I heard, it was the best decision to end it the way it did, I was told that a second season would only be bad for the first one because of the way the light novels continue. Maybe I am wrong but looking at how poor the sales were for the anime, I don't think we will get another season anyways, although I wish we would =/

I've heard a lot of positive remarks about pet girl and I've tried about 4 episodes and didn't find it any good. Does it get better or is it just not for me?

IMO it really gets good/better at ep. 5. So maybe try giving it another chance? I don't want to spoil anything but this show really manages to create some fuzzy feelings later on in the show. Might be a bit cheesy at times but never to much. All in all great writing and the ending was heartwarming =)

Katanagatari is awesome but a little bit of a heads up, each episode is like 45 minutes of talking with 5 minutes of action.  And I mean talking.  The conversations never end but this is probably why it's so good.  The characters are all so well written and have fun chats with each other it really fleshes out their personalities.  Cheerio.

**Obvious monogatari series spoilers ahead, not for those who haven't seen up to Monogatari Second Season!**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*I'm sorry, I'm horrible at writing, but I hope it's not a total mess and actually give you some answers. I could write a ton more (and I did) but to keep it from being an even bigger wall of text/even more boring, I'm excluding a lot of stuff that I wrote that was probably not that important... Keep in mind that this is just my interpretation of the series, and I'm open to other perspectives!*

...Also, I'll include a short summary!

Now on to what you said.

>I find it really creepy how there's no one ever around

I don't think it's not because there's no people around, it's just that they aren't important to Araragi.

**First I'm just gonna explain why I think the main characters perspective is important to the series:**

[Spoilers](/s "*I believe that the monogatari series can be very original in the aspect  that the whole series is constructed around the main characters obervations of the world, the characters and the situations they are involved with. I don't think the viewer is supposed to be an outsider spectating the story, or even someone reading a story that has happened/is happening. We're something else, we're seeing whatever is happening inside the main characters mind and how he/she perceives the world around him/her. Almost every time we see Araragi blink we hear the iconic shutter sound, i.e his eyes are cameras that sends the information. Plus he often takes mental images of whatever he sees. *click click** ")

[Spoilers](/s "*You can also see how the whole series varies and deviates based on whichever person is the main character in that arc, but since Araragi is the protagonist and we spend most of the time watching everything from his perspective  (Bake, Nise, Neko Black etc.) people who only watch Bake won't get to acknowlegde the fact that the series is presented from his POV.*")

[Spoilers](/s "Araragi's POV can be quite cynical, because he is mistrusting of people  and don't really care about them. So whenever he is around people he just ignores them. (A good example of this is the scene where Black Hanekawa is about to kill him and he won't call for help because he thinks people only really help themselves). Therefore monogatari's focus instead lies on the character interactions between him and the few other characters. Despite being quite cynical he he notices and often cares deeply about this handful of characters. ")

[Spoilers](/s " The big POV changes happens in the Second Season. Like in the arc where Hanekawa is the "main character" she has many monologues about her idenitity, and contemplates about who she really is. We get a glimpse of her true feelings, which means we're probably deep inside of her mind experiencing whatever she is. The POV change and the fact that we're experiencing wha the characters experience  also comes forth whenever Black Hanekawa takes over the unconcious Hanekawa and we lose parts of the story that Hanekawa herself didn't actually experience.")

[Spoilers](/s "Further, when it comes to visuals there are almost no erotic imagery like we had with Araragi, and the shots themselves are completely different when it comes to angles and what is in focus, rather than looking at and making Kanbaru's shorts or legging sexciting like Araragi did, Hanekawa keeps most of Kanbaru in focus and she seems like a slower and more quiet and intimidating version of herself. There's far less change and variety in the otherwise colorful palette. Which is probably explained by the reoccurance of Hanekawas identity problems. She thinks of herself as a boring and plain white. She lacks many of the emotions that Araragi feel, she doesn't have the same substance and thus there's far less variety in the colors and mood changes.")

[Spoilers ](/s "Another example of how the lack of or perception of people (and the whole series) change:")

[Spoilers](/s "Later when the story shifts over to Nadeko, like with Araragi, there's no-one around whenever she's in open public spaces. However when she arrives at school there are students walking around. However they are faceless. Which is because she don't really trust people in general and she is insecure about herself.  Therefore they're all just the same faceless people that cursed her, who take advantage of the fact that she's so shy and quiet, and don't really care about her. (Some of the reasons that finally snaps in the Second Season).")


**So to answer your question in short and to add some more obvious reasons to why there's never really anybody around in the series:**

[Reason 1](/s " **One:** Araragi is a special character, he can be quite cynical and don't really care that much about people in general. He just don't care about them, and therfore almost everybody becomes invisible/nonexistant to him. Which is an important factor, because as a compensation for the low amount of people you instead get a heavy character focused series which relies on select and unique characters that stand out from each other. ")

[Spoilers](/s "(Further proof: There are cars driving around, but no people in them. In the Second Season you can see people standing around Araragi when he's waiting at a stop light when we're taken to Ononoki's perspective. *I think that happens in the scene when Ononoki meets Araragi, but I can't really fact check since I haven't got the episodes available right now*). ***see my really long post***")

[Reason 2](/s "**Two:** is that background characters aren't really that important. You often or not don't take notice to the people around you. Sure, you see people everywhere, but do you care about them? Can you clearly remember the people that walked by you ten minutes ago? Are you concious of everyone around you at all times? You usually focus on the event and not the people at the event.")

[Reason 3](/s "**Three:** Probably because of Shaft's budget and time limitations, and them wanting to show off their gorgeous visuals without having too many distractions or maybe they didn't want to lower the quality to up the realism.")

[Reason 4](/s "**Four** It could be a stylistic/thematic choice ***see my really long post*** (Which I think they use to represent the different characters perspectives about the world and people around them).")

It's got some decent metaphysical explorations and philosophical discussions, at least for the first 2-3 sections. Second Season while still being philo in nature is more action drama.  Different strokes
>> ARTICLE
One of my friends dropped it because they fell asleep while watching it. It mostly depends on if you like the dialogue and humour or not.
>> ARTICLE
As other people have said its not an anime for everyone, there are some episodes that are 25 straight minutes of dialog and not much happening, so I can see why some people might not like it.  But if you like that sort of thing the dialog and character interactions are fantastic and the visuals and music are top notch as well.

Yea alot of my friends can't get into it for that exact reason. Don't worry, not all things are for everyone, so just watch whatever you enjoy!

Is Hunter x Hunter really that good? I tried watching the first episode, I just couldn't get past the character designs. I only ask because I like the fact you have such a varied list of favorite anime. Do I need to give it another go? Like how many episodes will I know I will like it, or hate it?
>> ARTICLE
I've heard really good things about Hunter x Hunter, but I didn't get past its first ep either. But I do fully believe the people who say it's extremely good, and I know that the author is a good one (since he did Level E, which is amazing). I just don't know how long it would take for me to get hooked on it. 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I'm not really sure how many episodes you should give it. The first arc, the Hunter Exam, definitely isn't my favorite material of the series but I guess I'll say give it.....about 8 or so episodes? There were some pretty great moments there but, again, my favorite stuff comes later down the line. 

That not so great first episode definitely isn't a great indicator of how great the series becomes, though. That I can say for sure.

>> ARTICLE
The following, with my reasoning:

1. Neon Genesis Evangelion. This anime is not without fault, but as this show had such a profound impact on me having watched it as a child and cemented my interest in anime in place for life, it is more than deserving of the top spot for me.

2. Steins;Gate. This is perhaps one of the most engaging shows I have ever seen, anime or otherwise. Once it gets going it does not let up until the very end. I had to have rewatched it 4 times   since I first found out about it a year ago.

3. Toradora. Easily one of the best romantic comedies I've seen, with some of the most grounded and believable characters in its class. Still tugs on my heartstrings even after my second time through.

Runner up would probably be Welcome to the NHK. Which reminds me, I need to watch that again.

Wow, you do like drama. I'm planning on watching Nagi soon, how does it compare to the other 2? (I'm not exactly a drama guy but I'm in the mood for that right now).
>> ARTICLE
Nagi no Asukara is really good when it comes to drama, I'd say. However, making you cry isn't exactly its goal. Sure, you might cry here and there, but not at the same levels as the two others. Nagi no Asukara is much more story-based than that.

In fact, the only reason Nagi is number two on my list instead of number one is because the character development is just a *tad* bit higher in Clannad. That is something you should expect in a 47 episode anime, though. Had Nagi no Asukara been 4-cour, like Clannad was, it would've been number one on my list.
>> ARTICLE
That's good for me, since I tend to prefer story-driven anime. I didn't cry in either Clannad nor AnoHana, and I'm not expecting to do so in this show unless it does something really unexpected.

Thanks for replying.

1.) [Hajime no ippo.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo) The most inspiring anime to me, and I don't even like boxing. This includes everything. The movie, the OVA, the special, New Challenger, and Rising.

2.) [Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3002/Gyakkyou_Burai_Kaiji:_Ultimate_Survivor) Gambling has a price. When Kaiji loses, he **REALLY** hits bottom. Kinda like Game of Thrones, you keep expecting a happy ending, but it reality checks you.

I've only watched 5 different anime shows and 3 of them are on your list. The other ones are Anohana and Steins;Gate. Is there anything you would recommend that I watch since I really liked the 3 you said are your favorites?

Edit: I am very new to the genre of anime and I prefer dubs but I don't mind subs. English just usually sounds better to me since it's my first language. Thanks. 
>> ARTICLE
English is my first language and although I love subs there are some dubs that easily surpass subs. Claymore is definitely one of them! All the ones I mentioned all have dubbed versions on watchcartoonsnsonline.com :)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah sure :) Claymore is a really good one, half monster, half human female warriors who kill "Youma". Really intense fighting scenes. 

Code Geass: L2 brilliantly concludes his "game". 

Ergo Proxy philosophical, post-apocalyptic, crime-drama of a woman seeking answers to crimes all somehow linked to one immigrant. 

Monster is a 75 episodes-long (I think) anime about a neurosurgeon who treats a boy with a gun shot to the head, after him and his twin sister come through a&e . The story unravels from there bit by bit.

Other ones I've watched are good but maybe not to everyone's taste:

Shiki - interesting vampire story 
Solty Re - Mysterious girl land on humanity's first city on a different planet and a bounty hunters life takes a detour to say the least 

Hope this helps and enjoy!

Why Haganai Next specifically? I found the 1st season to be slightly better actually  (just because Yozora had her beautiful long hair intact of course).
>> ARTICLE
Finally found someone who like Yozora with long hair!!! And i agree.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, she looks a lot better that way though I'm already used to the short hair.
>> ARTICLE
I liked it better bc we have the whole club already there now so we got more story with them all together, Yozora and Sena's fights are less hostile and I like how it progressed Kodaka and Sena's relationship. 
I actually prefer the short haired Yozora, but it's not a big reason why I like Next better than season 1.

I know most are like what? Naruto. I mean I have to be honest with myself I love it to death. I've been watching it since it first aired on Toonami back in early 2005, or 2004, one of those. Have been watching it since. If I made a list of top 10 or 20 anime with more objectiveness then it would be lower. As a kid growing up, this show got me through so much and it didn't make me the person I am today, but it certainly created a piece of me I wouldn't have otherwise.  

Edit: Guys there seems to be someone down-voting everyone's post, it's childish, so please stop, everything here is an opinion and a recommendation for some new great anime to watch ourselves. Up-vote all posts you see to counteract this please!

...Akito over Lelouch of the Rebellion? Peculiar choice. How come? I thought it was a bit of a mess- even compared with R2. 

The animation and general production values were amazing, but it didn't feel like anything all that special. 

...Unlike Planetes. Christ, what a lovely show. Really recommend the manga, if you've not read it already- it carries on a fair way beyond the end of the show, and expands on the events of the anime a fair bit beforehand. Much more satisfying ending, as well.

2. Gurren Lagann: Hype, hype and more hype, also Drills/Kill la Kill: Naked-ness, super powered clothes and, nudist beeeeeeeach.

3. Fairy Tail: My first proper anime I've finished and started reading the manga.

1. Steins;Gate: One of the best plots coupled with very great pacing, interesting characters, the whole 9 yards. I felt the plight of the various characters keenly.

2. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Does this really need explanation? I used to watch this to get motivated before finals. It worked every time.

3. Kokoro Connect: This show, man. It gets a lot of love from those who have seen it, but it's uncommon to recommend except by way of the "I've masturbated to you, too" gif. I watched it because of that gif, and was therefore blown away by how amazing the show was. I have NEVER cared so much for so many characters at the same time. Toradora came close, but I only cared for Ryuuji and Taiga; in Kokoro Connect, I cared for all five main characters, deeply.

I know I wrote more for my third but everyone knows the first two already.

Log Horizon - Special mention cuz i'm an MMO gamer D:

Monogatari

My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU

Damn, this was hard. I guess i had to put the best of each genre, then compare them and finally selected what i thought deserved to be chosen... I don't honestly like the idea of "top Anime" I watch a lot of completely different shows and comparing genres is hard... D:
>> ARTICLE
1) Hellsing Ultimate OVA - the Manga and Anime will always remain my favorites ... probably.

2) Darker than Black (All of them) - I'm not a huge anime watcher but this one struck a chord in my heart.  The music was really good too!

3) HxH original (I like how 2011 goes further into the story, but I prefer the original).

Cowboy Bebop is probably my favorite of all time, but that's a pretty generic answer!

1.   Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann / Kill La Kill

2.   Puella Magi Madoka Magica

3.   Danshi Koukousei no Nichijo

I put TTGL and KLK together in the top spot because the shows are companions to each other. Besides the obvious similarities, TTGL is about the process of growing from a boy to a man and what it means to be a man while KLK is the exact same but for girls and women. They thematically complement each other.

Honorable mentions are Steins; Gate, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, Azumanga Daioh, and many many more.

I've watched DRRR once and I loved it (twice I guess cause I watched it on Adult Swim). I've watched Eden of the East and all the movies twice, and something about Jormungand makes me so hyped, I enjoyed every episode.

I think NHK ni Youkoso! would've been up there but its been so long since I've watched it, but its coming up on my rewatch list.

1. Death Note  - I really like these types of shows with the MC's outwitting others. I watched One Outs and Akagi shortly after based on recommendations and loved both of them due to the similar MC's. I hate baseball (One Outs) and still know nothing about Mahjong (Akagi) but I loved both shows, and all three were shows where I couldn't wait for the next episode.

2. Ghost In The Shell - My first anime and one that I want to rewatch. It had awesome philosophical/political messages, plenty of sci-fi gadgets, and good action.

3. No Game No Life - Tough choice between this and Steins;Gate, but I chose this show because of my love for the MC's outwitting others (see 1), I liked the colorful artstyle, and also I think me watching it recently was a factor. Steins;Gate would have to be 4.

Guilty crown is the first anime that I really liked.
No Game No Life has an interesting setting,story and characters. Also some other stuff. 
Nisekoi is really interesting, and always leaves me waiting for the next episode, also there is the occasional laugh.

Was really hard to choose, there are a lot of good anime out there. Also really liked: The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, Gundam 00, Log Horizon, Hyouka, Kuroko No Basuke, Suisei No Gargantia, Blood Lad, Ao No Exorcist, Nagi No Asukara, Tokyo Ravens and Code Geass. 
There were other anime, but I really liked these.

Neon Genesis Evangelion

I'm very picky when it comes to these things so I only have one at the moment.
>> ARTICLE
As of currently I have 5 animes that I rank 10/10 and the ones that I find are the best among them are.

**Clannad: After Story** - Best fucking anime in existence, maybe not from an objective point of view but OHH THE FEELS!!!

**Kuroko no Basuke 2nd Season** - I'm a sucker for sports anime and this one is super exciting and well made so it got me.

**Durarara!!** - Interesting mystery series and was a very neat watch, also has some of the best characters I know of. harshly competeing with Madoka Magica for #3.
>> ARTICLE
1. Deadman Wonderland
2. One Piece
3. Fairytail

Im planning to watch Death Note, Steins Gate, Elfen Leid, and Clannad eventually so my top three may change but for certain ive always loved One Piece and have watched Deadman Wonderland just recently and found it amazing

There is one couple from an anime that really stand out for me, and that's **[Holo and Lawrence](http://i.imgur.com/YACJCYd.jpg)** from [Spice and Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou)

The chemistry between these two is simply amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I second this notion hur umph!!!
>> ARTICLE
Yup, this is mine.
>> ARTICLE
First things I see when entering thread are Isaac and Miria and Holo and Lawrence.

Seems about right. Definitely right.
>> ARTICLE
I remember starting that show, expecting typical anime nonsense. What I got was a shockingly compelling story about medieval economics, and two really interesting main characters that could have held the entire show on their own. Put together, they were even better.
>> ARTICLE
Came in here hoping to see best couple. Was. Not. Disappointed.

I love that the show had a healthy, "we like each other and we're just going to enjoy that" couple without all the "anno.." and blushing and girls yelling "baka!" and running away.
>> ARTICLE
how hard is it to get an OVA for this fucking series
>> ARTICLE
Can't agree more I love the fact that during the course of the show their relationship slowly evolved from just two people travelling together to so much more. At no time did I ever feel the show rushing things or trying to force a connection between Holo and Lawrence.

"If I were a man, I'd be so jealous of your manliness that I'd kill you." -Senjougahara. The chemistry between the two is both amazing and hilarious. I could honestly just listen to them talk about paint drying all day, there doesn't need to be a story.

Too bad we almost certainly won't get a second season after all the drama that happened with the studio.

The show is on my plan to watch list. Just curious though, what happened with the studio?
>> ARTICLE
I may be a wrong, but as I remember they offered a voice actor a job up until like a publicized interview with all the voice actors and then dropped on him in the middle of the show that he didn't actually have any part. 

I don't remember the details since it was awhile ago, but I think that's pretty close.

They pulled a pretty dickish joke on some guy, I don't remember the details but I'm sure you could find it pretty quick on google. I saw someone post their sales figures before and after... it wasn't pretty.

They're regular novels, not light novels. But yes, I agree with you that he needs to get working!
>> ARTICLE
Oh cool, I didn't even realise there's a difference :P
>> ARTICLE
What's the difference?
>> ARTICLE
Light novels are the "manga of novels". Obviously much cheaper to produce than manga, with very similar content. They usually release in small volumes, much like manga. The writing style is sometimes discriminated as less "formal" or "refined" compared to a novel (though this is usually because light novels are an easy outlet for breakout writers, as it's a relatively small step from short story competitions compared to a novel), and similarly is usually targeted to a more adolescent demographic, who will eat up lower-reading-level but wildly fantastical works.
>> ARTICLE
Light novels are typically shorter and have simpler writing.

To be fair, since a good majority of Anime have their couples form in the later episodes, almost everything here will be a spoiler of sorts.

It's a malformed spoiler tag (no quotation marks), not a condemnation.

[Mako and Ryuuko](http://i.imgur.com/APk7HMq.jpg). 



If we're going by canon couples though, I pick [Shinji and Kaworu](http://skullcaps.deviantart.com/art/Shinji-and-Kaworu-254301402). Wait no, that's not technically canon either.



I guess my favourite canon couple would be [Yamazaki and Pururin](http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/bkz6504BKng/mqdefault.jpg).

Especially since we don't know who's the sane one between Rock and Revy anymore, but I'm gonna bet it's Revy.

My favorite would probably have to be [Ryuuji and Taiga](http://hqwallpapers4free.com/wallpaper/aisaka_taiga_toradora_takasu_ryuuji-hq-wallpaper-1160945.jpg) from Toradora!

Runners up:

[Asuna and Kirito](http://operationrainfall.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Sword-Art-Online-Kirito-and-Asuna-Together.png) - Sword Art Online (Come at me)

[Akatsuki and Miu](http://kawaii-mobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Aesthetica-of-a-Rogue-Hero-Hagure-Yuusha-no-Estetica.Miu-Myuu-Ousawa.Akatsuki-Ousawa.640x960-1.jpg) - Aethetica of a Rogue Hero (How can you not love Akatsuki)

[Shiroe and Akatsuki](http://i.imgur.com/eLfOIul.jpg) - Log Horizon (Not a couple yet, but the romance is budding.)

[Akira and Saki](http://moesucks.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/edenkiss.jpg) - Eden of the East (Saki is adorable)
>> ARTICLE
The sexual tension between Shiroe and Akatsuki is palpable, I just want it to happen already! 
>> ARTICLE
They better make another season of aesthica so I can see more of that suave motherfucker he must be the most badass and confident MC I've ever seen without being a douchebag
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean man. Akastuki is easily the coolest MC out there. He's strong as fuck, suave as hell, makes the ladies swoon, doesnt' take shit from anyone, and on top of it all he's a super nice guy. Along with not being some stupid "I NEED THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP TO WIN!" type of character. He wins fights because *he's fucking strong* not because he gets a random power up just because he's not foreveralone.  I hope they make another season. He's everything I want in an MC.

The fanservice in that show was godly too. Miu #1.

Upvote for Kirito and Asuna and Saki and Takizawa. :)

I don't care what anyone says, the romance in SAO was great.

And Saki was absolutely adorable in Eden of the East. I was rooting for her the entire time!
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Well that's the thing though. People don't really get SAO wasn't *supposed* to be solely an action anime. The primary focus was the romance side of it, with the action part as the side story. SAO was about drama, romance, the fear of death/losing your favorite characters, etc. The action with Kirito fighting things was just part of the setting for all of the above. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Well there was a big part of action in it. It just wasn't the main focus. It's also based on a light novel series, so they assume you'd at least know something about it beforehand. 
>> ARTICLE
I love Kirito and Asuna, they're really sweet together
>> ARTICLE
Me too. It's why I loved SAO so much. 
>> ARTICLE
It had potential but it got screwed over in the time skips. In SAO it jumps from crush to end of dating in maybe 2 episodes(?) with almost nothing in the middle. I think that if they replaced some of the useless filler with more of Asuna and Kirito getting together and falling more in love it would've been much better overall.
>> ARTICLE
That's a fine disagreement. I found it to be a fine progression because of the situation they were in, but some people don't. 

Overall though, it was still cute and heartwarming for any viewer. 
>> ARTICLE
The pacing is really the only thing I dislike about SAO. It's great otherwise. If they had simply done a whole 24 episodes on the Aincrad arc it could have been just about perfect.
>> ARTICLE
The author is writing an expanded series of books to give more depth to the entire Aincrad storyline. Every floor gets a story. Hopefully when that's done, we can get a longer version of SAO without the unnecessary ALO tacked on as the other half instead.
>> ARTICLE
As always, Umineko VN only.

Agreed 100% although if you think about it [More major Umineko Spoilers] (/s "she is both his aunt and cousin so.... wincest? Yeah Ryu07 is pretty sneaky. He managed to make a Mystery/Fantasy/Love Story/Tripple Tragedy (Tragedy of Yasu, Ange, and Toya). The show has so many layers on which to look at it, it's truly a masterpiece like no other")
>> ARTICLE
I know that they always have a hard time being adapted, but it's so much harder to sell people on the show enough to get them to read the VN, than it would be to get them to watch a second series.
>> ARTICLE
Umineko is literally only half adapted, and that half is done extremely poorly. Combine that with the fact that Umineko is a complete masterpiece of a VN, that relies heavily on it's narration and it becomes almost impossible to adapt well. Plus it's got a phenomenal OST that was almost nonexistent in the anime adaptation. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say it's nonexistant, as many of the great tracks are still on there, they're just talked over, rather than texted over :). I do agree through, I know why they haven't and probably won't do it, it's just very hard to spread the word about something essentially VN only in my group.

>get the fuck over themselves and admit it...

Haruhi clearly doesn't want this. She would much prefer to live on the balance, letting the emotional energy build until somebody professes their love, and then forget about is so that she can start all over again. 

Remember, this is a girl who just wants an exciting life. The uncertainty of love is much more exciting than an acquired relationship

[Daisuke Namikawa](http://myanimelist.net/people/87/Daisuke_Namikawa)'s voice's versatility is insane.

These four characters are COMPLETELY different from each other.
>> ARTICLE
WHAT. He can go from seemingly pre-pubescent Waver to manly Chris-senpai? That's crazy
>> ARTICLE
Amazing how he makes each voice distinct.  He plays a great Hisoka.
>> ARTICLE
He really is a great VA. He played Squealer in Shin Sekai Yori and Kazehaya in Kimi ni Todoke. That is a crazy amount of range.
>> ARTICLE
Would have never connected the dots between angsty teen magus>down on his luck salaryman turned mercenary>horny joker>megalomanirat.

>> ARTICLE
Kana Hanazawa voiced Seryuu from Akame ga Kill and Onodera from Nisekoi
>> ARTICLE
Well that being said, the voices of those 2 characters are quite similar, and it was obvious from the start that they had the same VA when you heard her. Personalities are quite..different though. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't that the point of this thread? 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah lol, but I'm just saying there are a lot of characters where the personalities AND voices are so different that you would never think they'd be voiced by the same person.

Not to mention that when Seryuu is in her ''non-crazy'' phase her personality is actually quite similar to Onodera's. 
>> ARTICLE
SHE'S EVERYWHERE
>> ARTICLE
IT'S NOT FUNNY

Also Rize from Tokyo Ghoul, Mayuri from Steins;Gate, and Akane from Psycho-Pass. They're all pretty different. Onadera and Mayuri would be the closest and I still couldn't tell they were the same person.

that's pretty intense

Yeah she's an amazing voice actress. She's been in everything too: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana_Hanazawa

her kanade from angel beats and fuwa aika from zetsuen no tempest is quite close to onodera, mayuri and nadeko

A character as pure as Mayuri and a character as pure evil as Rize. This tops the thread for me.

I've heard KanaHana's voice so often that I can identify it almost instantly lol. There's a certain quality of her voice that's distinct from all other seiyuus out there; I think it's the most evident as Kuroneko.

Oh god yea, [Tittyko](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhyu6XoBADM) by KanaHana was awesome. Really enjoyed every episode of it and KanaHana's voice made it even better especially when her character starts screaming for almost the whole episode.
>> ARTICLE
I love [crazy KanaHana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y7MAh9c0pU).
>> ARTICLE
EEEHHHHH!?!?

My favorite bit about that scene is the quick switch back to cutesy for "huh, who just shouted?"

and the fact that she uses *ore-sama* as a pronoun that whole time like the snake does.

and that her hair starts to float up and look like snakes...

and when the vague outlines of ultimately unimportant people gather at the back of the classroom as far away from her as they can get.

She also just kicks the fucking door in. I always liked to think of that as a combination of Shaft/Monogatari exaggerative imagery as well as the snake monster giving her actual super strength, kind of like the Karen vs. Koyomi fight. 

and at the beginning just after she shouts she looks so small in front of the adult, just to make sure you know that she really is just a child throwing a fit. 

this is just a really awesome scene.

He also voiced Ling from FMA:B, his VA capabilities are rediculous. 
>> ARTICLE
Vic Mignogna with Ed Elrich and Keldeo. Ones an alchemist and the other is a talking horse
>> ARTICLE
He is probably one of my favorite English VA's. He seems to always do a really good job. Don't forget, he was also in Soul Eater as Death Scythe/Spirit Albarn.

Another cool English VA who did two VERY different roles is Maxey Whitehead, who did Al in FMA:B and Crona in Soul Eater. The two characters sound almost the same but they act completely different.
>> ARTICLE
Wow I never noticed him as Death scythe. Guess I never really payed attention to it
>> ARTICLE
I noticed it about halfway through the series, and then couldn't UN-notice it for the rest, which was... interesting.
>> ARTICLE
He's also Tamaki Suoh in Ouran Highschool Host Club, Broly in the DBZ movies, and a billion other people in a billion other shows.
>> ARTICLE
I knew those. Tamale was obvious for me and Broly is kinda famous for being Vic mignogna 
>> ARTICLE
Johnny Yong Bosch was the english VA for both Vash, the pacifist gunman from trigun, and Ryunosuke Uryu, the child murdering psychopath who was Caster's master in Fate/Zero.

Can you believe that Sanageyama (KLK) and Viral (TTGL) are voiced by the same guy?  Wait, yes?  Ok...
>> ARTICLE
Also "voiced" Link from the Legend of Zelda.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised no one has brought this one up:  Happy from Fairy Tail and Taiga from Toradora are voiced by the same actress.
>> ARTICLE
Well if I don't get killed for mentioning a dub...

Lelouch (Code Geass) and Vash the Stampede (Trigun) are both voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch, a fact witch makes me smile every time I think of it.
>> ARTICLE
He's also the voice of Renton Thirston from Eureka 7 and Rossiu from Gurren Laggan which threw me off JYB is one of my favorite English voice actors
>> ARTICLE
Also Yu and Adachi from Persona 4, damn I love that guy
>> ARTICLE
And Ichigo from Bleach. He was also the second Nlack Ranger from Power Rangers. 
>> ARTICLE
He's pretty much everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Amamiya Sora Voiced Fujimiya Kaori from isshuukan friends. then went on to voice kirishima touka in tokyo ghoul.

And akame for that matter

Izaya from Durarara!! is also Natsume from Natsume Yuujinchou...
(Also voice of Arararagi from monogatari series and Levi from Shingeki no Kyojin)

Gendo Ikari from NGE is also Madao from Gintama (Gintama even made a joke about this during an episode)
>> ARTICLE
Shuu Tsukiyama (Tokyo Ghoul) and Okabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate) voiced by Miyano Mamoru.

They're not all that different...

Koshimizu Ami voices badass [Ryuko Matoi](http://kill-la-kill.wikia.com/wiki/Ry%C5%ABko_Matoi) and brainless [Tsukamoto Tenma](http://schoolrumble.wikia.com/wiki/Tsukamoto_Tenma)
>> ARTICLE
The person who does the voice for Ussop from One Piece also does the voice of Fietan from Hunter x Hunter.
>> ARTICLE
From a couple of my guilty pleasure anime's Itsuki from Shuffle! And Yamato from Suzuka. 

Edit: so I looked up the VA and holy crap I didn't realize all the other characters he did like Death the Kid(soul eater) and Marlo (AoT). Also cool to see how many games he's been in like the voice for Vamana in smite!
>> ARTICLE
Aizen from Bleach and Ichiya from Fairy Tail, I was disturbed when I realized that

Johan Liebert and Julian Minci (from LOGH) share the same voice actor...

English VA did Vash from Trigun and Ryunosuke from Fate/Zero.  They're a bit different.

Chris sabat plays vegeta and armstrong.

Laura bailey voiced keiko from yu yu hakusho, then lust of fma .

Crispin Freeman plays Kyon from Haruhi and Sundowner from Metal Gear Rising.  That fact blew my mind.

He's been acting longer then some of us have been  alive.

And Alucard from Hellsing.  
>> ARTICLE
And Jeremiah Gottwald
>> ARTICLE
And Togusa in Ghost in the Shell.

Scar (FMA:B version) and Isaac (Baccano!) are both voiced by the same guy. I don't think you could ask for a bigger difference between two characters.
>> ARTICLE
J. Michael Tatum is an amazing VA
>> ARTICLE
Sweet awkwardly lovesick Renton Thurston and the gunslinging saint Vash the Stampede are all voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch, the same guy who voices the vile chess(?)master Izaya from DRRR! and the psychopath Ryunosuke Uryu from Fate/Zero.
>> ARTICLE
Guess I'll throw some English voices out here since a majority of it seems to be Japanese actors.

Yusuke from Yu Yu Hakusho is Raditz from Dragonball Z. (Justin Cook)

Dr Gel from Space Dandy is Isaac from Baccano. (J Michael Tatum)

Usopp from One Piece is sometimes voiced by Lupin III (Sonny Strait)

Orochimaru from Naruto is Spike from Cowboy Bebop.

[Mayumi Tanaka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayumi_Tanaka):

Monkey D. Luffy (One Piece)

Kuririn (Dragonball, Dragonball Z, Dragonball GT, Dragonball Kai)

Pazu (The male MC of Castle In The Sky)

And guess what ? She is a woman !

She was also voice actress(dub) for John Connor from Terminator 2 : The Judgment Day 

>> ARTICLE
If one includes English dub VAs:

**Monica Rial** played Miria from Claymore and Michiko in Michiko & Hatchin, who are both noticeably different from the cute high-pitched girls she usually voices.

**Colleen Clinkenbeard** is probably most well-known for playing Luffy in One Piece's Funimation dub, but otherwise tends to get cast as mature women (Yuuko Ichihara, Hana in Wolf Children) and action girls (Erza Scarlet, Riza Hawkeye).

**Crispin Freeman**, the voice of Alucard, also played Kyon.

**Matthew Mercer**, the voice of Levi in AoT and Leon in Resident Evil, got cast as Aikuro "NUDIST BEACH" Mikisugi in KLK.

well bossun from sket dance is the same person as favaro in shingeki no bahamut...but theyre both clowns.

different personalities, tomokazu sugita was Kensei from bleach, and also plays gintoki from gintama, and switch from sket dance.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised no one's mentioned Mizuki Nana yet. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone hasn't mentioned this already, but the VA for Onetruetatsuya is the same for Kyousuke from Oreimo 

Not exactly different, but I just find it funny that this guy keeps landing roles for siscons 
>> ARTICLE
Nagisa from clannad and Rena from higurashi. I still can't imagine how she pulled off the crazy laughs...
>> ARTICLE
Kana Hanazawa, who voiced Kamishiro Rize from Tokyo Ghoul also voiced Tachibana Kanade from Angel Beats! That surprised me. Although later I learned that she also voiced Sengoku Nadeko, which wasn't as much of a surprise.
>> ARTICLE
Crispin freeman voices both Alucard from hellsing and kyon from Haruhi
>> ARTICLE
The woman who voices Haqua from TwgoK also Voice Ononoki from Monogatari, now that's impressive.
>> ARTICLE
a recent one would be Princess Seylum and Touka
>> ARTICLE
Ryuko Matoi's seiyuu, Ami Koshimizu, was into economics before she entered the world of fashion. She voiced Maou-sama in Maouyu, and Holo. Yes, that Holo. She also is the best girl in P4, Yukiko Amagi.

You know Negi from Negima? He's voiced by Rina Sato, the voice of Misaka Mikoto. Rina Sato also voiced Mayumi in Kawaisou.

Remember Mamiko Noto? Before KanaHana's rise, Mamiko Noto was the quintessential Dandere seiyuu. She voiced Nodoka in Negima, and Sawako in Kimi no Todoke. She then voiced Jigoku Shoujo. Recently, she has voiced Schere from Akame ga Kill.

You know Sinon from SAO? You might recognize her voice from another anime last season, you know, as that annoying senpai Wakamatsu is so annoyed with in Gekkan Shoujo. She is also Kanbaru in Monogatari, Shinku in Rozen Maiden, and Maria in SZS. She voiced Ayane in Kimi ni Todoke as well. If you were an anime fan in the early 2000s, you would also recognize here as Mint in Galaxy Angels, and as Petit Charat in Di Gi Charat. Interestingly,she was voiced the same character in Di Gi Charat for both the sub and the dub.

You know ~~Onii-sama~~ Miyuki in Mahouka? That's Ayase from Oreimo, hence Mahouka being essentially Magical Oreimo. But did you know she also is Haqua in TWGOK/Kaminomi and Saki, the main character of Eden of the East.

You know Miho from Girls und Panzer? She's also Iona in Aoki Hagane Arpeggio. She's also Petrarca in Outbreak Company.

Finally, there is Hajime from Gatchaman Crowds. She voiced Minori, the JSDF officer in outbreak company. This explains the scene where Minori mutters gatcha, gatcha in that one scene in Outbreak company.It's a seiyuu joke.
>> ARTICLE
Go one step further with Ami Koshimizu and we also get Meltdowner.

Tetsuya Kuroko (Kuroko's Basketball) = Raichi Todoroki (Ace of Diamond)

I was shocked when I learned that Ohara Sayaka voices both Elza from Fairy Tail and Alicia from Aria, their voices seem so different

Garaa from naruto and Katsura from gintama

I stopped watching One Piece because Usopp sounded too much like Krillen.

Moffle (Amagi Brilliant Park) = Saber (Fate/Stay Night)

Luci Christian played both Truth from Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and Nagisa Furukawa from Clannad. So... I think that counts for something.
>> ARTICLE
Marina Inoue is Yoko from TTGL, Yozora from Haganai, and Armin from AoT/SnK.

From a badass sniper to a Tsundere to a wimpy kid who barely gets by.

Takekito Koyasu as Dio the most love to hate villian ever, and voices Shingo from King of Fighters who is a comic-relief fanboy worshipper.

Megumi hayashibara voiced ranma fom ranma 1/2, then rei from evangelion not long after.

While not an anime in The Boondocks Riley and Huey who are polar opposites in the show are voiced by the same VA and she can just switch between their voices [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va0zGQXyVPs)

Yuno Gasai and Holo. Both were voiced by Brina Palencia
>> ARTICLE
Genkai from Yu Yu Hakusho and Frieza from dbz share the same English VA in both original series. That only helps justify my childhood belief that Frieza was a chick all along.

They're all like this.

One VA in particular that's real fun is Hikaru Midorikawa.

No one mentions Touyama Nao? Seriously?

For on topic reasons, the comparison of a hyper genki Kujou Karen (Kiniro Mosaic) to Chiho Sasaki (Hataraku Maou-sama) is clear as day.

But for (slightly) off topic reasons, she earned my total respect voicing 8 characters at once in a drama CD with different voices and personalities (Kantai Collection Drama CD Side Kongou). 
>> ARTICLE
If you think about it though, BB Kongou is just Karen.
>> ARTICLE
Steve blum voiced spike from cowboy bebop and guimon from digimon.
>> ARTICLE
Ai Kayano

Shiro, Shiina, and Inori... 

Oh wait, they're all the same...
>> ARTICLE
But then also Mayaka and Capt. Magbaredge.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama. 

I've seen a few clips from the show and they were hilarious. Haven't seen it yet because of the amount of episodes it has... Same reasoning for Hunter x Hunter too. :/
>> ARTICLE
Same for me and Gintama, its intimidating.
>> ARTICLE
Just start it. Starting is the hardest thing with Gintama, then it consumes you.
>> ARTICLE
This is so true
>> ARTICLE
I can't watch more than two episodes before I get bored. If I could last for 4+ straight then I'd be able to roll through the rest.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is more of a few episodes every once in a while type series rather than a marathon it all in one go since it's so episodic. The later season are a bit easier to run through since there are some longer arcs, but overall I don't think I could watch more than 5 episodes a day. Especially not multiple days in a row. 

Just enjoy the ride. It starts a bit slow, but each episode is better than the last... and there are almost 300 episodes at this point. 


>> ARTICLE
There's no way I could marathon it haha. It just doesn't grasp my interest in a few episodes so it makes it difficult to come back to later on.
>> ARTICLE
that is actually very understandable. but its that episodic nature that lets casual viewers enjoy random episodes without knowing any background at all
>> ARTICLE
I have quite a few...

* Death Note: I am just never in the mood for it, I do plan on seeing it (Maybe make it my 100th anime?), but I keep hearing praise then how badly it ended or something like that.
* Tatami Galaxy (On Hold): The animation is damn impressive, but that fast talking...
* GTO: Just really haven't gotten around to it yet
* Legend of the Galactic Heroes: A lot of episodes...but if I'm doing Kenshin right now I'll get to it at some point 
* Hunter x Hunter: Same as LotGH
* Paranoia Agent: The opening honestly scares of it...but I need to get to it at some point. 
>> ARTICLE
The movie ending for Death Note was a lot better, but if you don't want to see the whole thing just for the ending, you can read the last 2-3 chapters of the manga after the anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you're judging The Tatami Galaxy by it's first episode, it definitely gets easier.
>> ARTICLE
Paranoia Agent is mandatory!!!! Total mind boggling adventure
>> ARTICLE
Death notes ending isn't bad its like 8/10 the rest of the show is 10/10
>> ARTICLE
Mello=1,25/10 in his best scenes
>> ARTICLE
Upvoted for speaking the truth
>> ARTICLE
I personally thought the later Death Note episodes weren't that bad, and I thought it had a really good ending, so don't let others scare you away from it.

But yeah, the Paranoia Agent OP is creepy as hell.
>> ARTICLE
Fate. Trying to finish the VNs, but I realize at the rate I'm reading, it'll take months
>> ARTICLE
Me as well. Still has the Fate route on hiatus because the sex scene was so offputting.
>> ARTICLE
It's sort of hot in it's own right but jesus christ is it so overbearing. Excessively long, too. I don't want magical dolphins or anything but this isn't all that great either.
>> ARTICLE
Just lock yourself in a room and spend the next 72 hours to read all 3 routes. >:D
>> ARTICLE
I've been on the Fate route since last October... I understand a bit of the struggle haha
>> ARTICLE
Fate is the first route right? If it is then that's the one I completed around the time you started it. Have not begun any other routes since then. I'll get there someday. VN's can be exhausting to read.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the first one. I find it exhausting and some scenes really weirded me out. Not to mention playing a decision making thing as a guy just takes me out of it kinda 
>> ARTICLE
I usually take long breaks in between routes in a specific VN. I'll play the Fate route in F/SN then I'll play a route in Grisaia no Kajitsu, then Majikoi, then Sengoku Rance, then back to F/SN. There is enough in all of these series to last me quite a while. It also keeps me from being weighed down by the sheer amount of content each of these VN's have to offer.
>> ARTICLE
Good man, Fate takes a while to read for everyone (took me like 3 months) but UBW and HF are a LOT better (finished both in under a week).
>> ARTICLE
Nana, Shigatsu, White Album 2, FLCL, Chihayafuru, LoGH....someone tell me which to watch next.
>> ARTICLE
Not White Album 2. Save yourself.
>> ARTICLE
Why? I loved White Album 2!
>> ARTICLE
I didn't enjoy having my beating heart ripped out, but to each their own
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, each to their own. Just wondering. I love drama myself, so having my heart ripped out while still alive and being gutted is fun for me. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it was one of my top 3 of the year it came out
>> ARTICLE
> Shigatsu

Gets my vote!
>> ARTICLE
Why should I watch it over the others?
>> ARTICLE
Only seen WA2 from that list and it's better then that ;p

If you like watching and discussing then I think /r/anime is having a watch thread for Chihayafuru starting tomorrow!
>> ARTICLE
Just watched the first episode. Nice animation, and having played an instrument in the past I can definitely get the mentality of Kousei and the connection he can kind of sense with Kaori, that of one musician to another. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a great watch, I know I really enjoyed the ride!
>> ARTICLE
>rollercoaster

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
If you want to cry, White Album 2
>> ARTICLE
FLCL. Six episodes of pure perfection and insanity. Approach with an open mind.
>> ARTICLE
Nana. It is rom/dram done how every single show should be. It is mature, deals with adults (not the bs highschool drama popular now, real fucking problems people have in relationships). I have several romances rated a 9 or a 10, and Nana stands in a tier above them. 
>> ARTICLE
About to go to sleep, but watching this in the morning. 
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru! My favorite of the bunch. 
>> ARTICLE
Just my timing! I'll check it out.

Wait, wait, wait..today is the rewatch for chihayafuru starting, so watch it with us please :D I will be a first-timer aswell.
>> ARTICLE
How would you know if it's the best anime if you haven't seen it yet?

oh well, mine would be Urusei Yatsura and Amagami SS. Haven't watched Urusei Yatsura because I'm waiting till the summer, and Amagami because the first episode made me cringe.
>> ARTICLE
> Amagami 

Honestly, you're not missing much. Only the Class Rep's and the swimmer's arc are worth watching. The rest are either mediocre or bad. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked 3 of the arcs in Amagami but the rest were torture to get through and even the ones I liked were not enough to make up for the bad ones
>> ARTICLE
> but the rest were torture

[What?](http://i.imgur.com/Tn6T1Hf.png)

At least your tag for the show is accurate :p

I fucking love Ayatsuji not even kidding. 

I just bumped it up to 7. I actually really like the show, it's just that Rihoko and Sae are definitely not my cup of tea
>> ARTICLE
>  it's just that Rihoko and Sae are definitely not my cup of tea

Yeah we just finished season 1 in our watch group (about to start season 2 tomorrow^^hinthint) and those 2 were usually on the bottom of people's lists

:D

I'll start watching season 2 tomorrow as well then :3

We're over at /r/watchinganime if you want to post your thoughts or anything! We'd love to have you :D

Either widely seen as good or one that you know you'll probably enjoy :p

Like I'm pretty sure Clannad/AS is amazing but I've yet to watch it because of those eyes^^^^^AndSadness
>> ARTICLE
That's what I thought. I'll edit in what mine are.
>> ARTICLE
> Amagami SS

I don't want to say bad things about it, especially on Aitalian's thread, but I really don't think it's going to be your type of show...There's definite good to great moments in it, but then there's some tropes (accidental boob grope, accidental perv, fanservice), 3/6 main arcs are actually pretty well done while the others are boring or *not so good*, and the stories/arcs themselves aren't anything new. But I still find them enjoyable as it doesn't drag them through a whole 12-26 episode series but instead only does it for 4 per character, so a lot more tolerable, especially compared to Sakurasou; and it's probably more of a feel good anime than something to think deep about. I guess consider it, but I'm honestly thinking you would not like it in the end.

Edit: **Before you downvote me:** I am not saying this is a bad series, but based on what Ernie's taste is and what I've observed, I honestly don't think he would like it. I have done the same for Trigun for other users... and I love Trigun to death, but when I can tell when it's probably not for them, I will not recommend it and tell them to not see it as much as it pains me.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even realize I was in her thread o.o and from what you say you're probably right, I won't enjoy it. I'll stick to Urusei Yatsura then, that's gonna take me a while anyway.
>> ARTICLE
> but then there's some tropes

A lot of them.

> But I still find them **enjoyable** as it doesn't drag them through a whole 12-26 episode series but instead only does it for 4 per character

One of the reasons it's my favourite

> probably more of a feel good anime than something to think deep about

Best feel good romance! But yeah I don't think its ernie's kind of anime at all...so rather not see him just bash on it haha so if he never watches it I'll be ok :p

Happy to hear you're liking it for what it is pittman :)
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka, really want to watch it, just haven't found the time/been in the right mood to watch it.

You shouldn't rush Hyouka and you should be in a very calm mood. Hyouka is a very mellow show.

Yeah don't rush it. Conserve your energy.

Hey, at least you have an interest/are curious about it.

Hunter x Hunter because it's so long, I plan on getting around to it this summer though.

Also The Tatami Galaxy, Aria and Mushishi. I don't really have reasons for not getting around to those yet.
>> ARTICLE
Aria is my favorite anime of all time. The series just does everything right. If you really enjoy the slice of life genre, then this is a must for you!! Even if you don't, this series is just so damn heart-warming! 
>> ARTICLE
Watch an episode of Mushishi a day; it's something to be savored. It's also the one I enjoyed the most out of everything you mentioned. You should definitely start it.

lol. I watched the first 45 episodes of hunter x hunter in one day. Don't worry you'll get through them quick.

Waiting until I hit a dry spell to watch Legend of the Galactic Heroes, because that 110 episode count is a little intimidating.

Galactic Heroes, because I only have the first 11 episodes and I'm pretty sure I'll want to watch as much as possible.

Mawaru Penguindrum, because this shit is heavy.  On episode 6, kinda dreading how shit will go down.  
>> ARTICLE
> Mawaru Penguindrum, because this shit is heavy. On episode 6, kinda dreading how shit will go down.

Ehhh really? This was on my PTW and was gonna start it kinda soon but not in the mood for anything heavy :/
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty heavy content. It takes a lot of reading into to fully understand the plot and what the story is trying to say. Overall you will probably need to watch it twice to be able to pick up all the little things you will miss the first go around. At least, that was the case for me.  
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the heads up! Better to know that going in!
>> ARTICLE
Mawaru Penguindrum is not only a heavy show, it's also heavy *to understand* show. You need special mood to complete this anime, but man, you will be rewarded at the end.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I've only heard good things. I'll have to attack when I'm able to put my full focus on it!
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it needs as much of that specific *mood* as serial experiments lain, except it's twice the number of episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion.

Everyone says it's god like and has some deep meanings but, I've been spoiled with quality animation and the .gifs of NGE (not that movie one that's been remade) I have seen have always been ehhhhhhh. I only really watch older anime if it has sentimental value. 
>> ARTICLE
when it comes to NGE, it's about the journey. it's worth the watch, especially if you binge it (episode 1-24, End of Evangelion, 25&26).
>> ARTICLE
5 Centimeters per Second. I know how beautiful and good it is but real life memories are painful enough. I don't want to feel and cry again.
>> ARTICLE
I get that...I've been avoiding quite a few anime because I don't want the tears to start flowing...
>> ARTICLE
Good choice then, it hits really hard if you share the pain.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Gintama would be right up my alley... but I just haven't gotten around to it yet. The number of episodes is slightly intimidating, but I did just start HxH so I'm sure I'll get over that someday.

Spaceship Yamato 2199. I honestly can't wait to start this.

Try picking up the manga instead. The pacing is 100x better (supposedly). 
>> ARTICLE
I might, I need to find a good place to read it first tho. I can't afford to omnibus volumes atm.
>> ARTICLE
we already know you have shit taste though
>> ARTICLE
vry tru
>> ARTICLE
I'm reading the manga instead. I don't get how this could make 74 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
The pacing is very slow
>> ARTICLE
That 74 episodes and some of the tags are scaring me away ha
>> ARTICLE
Seriously watch a couple episodes, you will hooked on that shit like hard drugs
>> ARTICLE
If you look at my [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/AmethystItalian) and tell me it fits with my tastes then I might consider it. Those tags do not look too friendly!
>> ARTICLE
i think you have the wrong idea of monster.......                 
You have definitely watched more bloody gory series                
Monster is a mystery drama, not a gore fest                 
There is some people getting killed, some blood, some violence but by judging your mal its nothing you cant handle.         
The shock of some of the twists will make you go "whaaaaT" though      
       
Seriously its not a blood bath like say mirrai nikki or psycho pass      
mystery drama at its core and the best at it   
>> ARTICLE
Well then it's made it's way onto my PTW list. I am sometimes in the mood for a good mystery so thanks for clearing that up for me!
>> ARTICLE
The Tatami Galaxy.
>> ARTICLE
If only the dialogue were a little slower I might actually be able to read it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat for this one
>> ARTICLE
Honestly the middle parts can get a little repetitive, but the second to last episode is really amazing. I didn't like the actual ending much tho.
>> ARTICLE
>repetitive

The hyped ones on my Plan-to-Watch:  

12 Kingdoms  
Black Lagoon  
Captain Harlock  
Casshern Sins  
Cowboy Bebop  
East of Eden  
Eureka Seven  
Fullmetal Panic  
Ghost in the Shell  
Haibane Renmei  
Higurashi  
Infinite Ryvius  
JoJo  
Kyousou Giga  
Monster  
Nichibros  
Psycho-Pass  
Seirei no Moribito  
Trigun  
>> ARTICLE
Watch the 90's anime after one another, it's more fulfilling that way.
>> ARTICLE
> Black lagoon, **MONSTER**, trigun, maybe harlock              
           
you better hurry up
>> ARTICLE
I'm planning on it. Aside from the 16 currently-airing shows I'm watching (and 4 already-finished), I'm working on watching the ones I've already downloaded before I move to other ones (especially since my 2TB are full) - and Monster is something I already have.
>> ARTICLE
also which harlock do you mean?          
I saw the CGI movie and it was pretty awesome, is there a anime im missing?
>> ARTICLE
I saw the CGI movie and liked it as well. The original Harlock anime from 1978 that I was planning on watching is [this](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1000/Uchuu_Kaizoku_Captain_Harlock), since I liked Space Battleship Yamato 2199 (a remake of the original Space Battleship Yamato, by the same creator as the various Harlock incarnations).
>> ARTICLE
I sorta have a 'plan to watch soon' list for my plan to watch list o_o;

* Oregairu
* Ping Pong
* Shinsekai yori
* Chihayafuru
* AnoHana
* Code Geass
* Bakuman
* Welcome to the NHK
* Noragami
* Spice and Wolf
* Psycho-Pass

No good reason for putting any of them off, apart from Oregairu which I'm  waiting on for the second season to finish airing.
Edit: spelling
>> ARTICLE
I'd say start with Code Geass. Watch the first 4 episodes tho. Dont make the mistake of watching the first 3 then deciding whether to continue or not. Decide after 4 since that episode should hook u to the show if u aren't already. I got hooked by the end of episode 1 lol
>> ARTICLE
Can fulky reccomend NHK, especially if you are a bit of a loner/introvert/NEET yourself.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the last seven episodes of Ping Pong in a row yesterday. It's brilliant. My twelfth 10/10. It's only eleven episodes as well. 

Welcome to the NHK is also brilliant. it's comedy as well as its' exploration of humans and depression are great. I also gave that  a 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
* Welcome to the NHK
* Noragami
* Spice and Wolf
* Oregairu

I understand that for Oregairu, the wait every week is painful. Even though I know what is coming. All the other ones are amazing, Noragami's MC are interesting, Spice and Wolf is just awesome. Welcome to the NHK made me cringe so much but I loved it. Also the second season of Noragami is coming out in the fall.
>> ARTICLE
God damn I am jealous of you. I really enjoyed watching so many of the shows on your list. Code Geass is probably the easiest one to get into, though IMO the best on that list that I've personally watched (Psycho-Pass, Spice and Wolf, Noragami[in progress], CG, Shinsekai, Oregairu) is Shinsekai Yori.

>> ARTICLE
I'd say ShinSekai Yori, it was a really good show.

Also Pingpong/NHK , I havent watched them myself but a lot of people praise those shows.
>> ARTICLE
Spice and wolf has a special place in my heart.
>> ARTICLE
I started that show as a filler show in between my simulcast, not thinking much of it.  But God did I fall in love with Spice and Wolf.  I feel into a deep dark depression when it ended.
>> ARTICLE
I'm deliberately putting off watching the last ep of s2 simply because I refuse to "be done" with it.
>> ARTICLE
It didn't end yet, theres going to be a season 3... Someday... 
>> ARTICLE
Second Season of Spice and Wolf, mainly because I know there isn't a third season and I want a false sense that it isn't over :(
>> ARTICLE
You could read the books. They're all finished in Japanese, and by the time you get to the end the last ones should be translated.
>> ARTICLE
Legend of the galactic heroes. I've been too busy watching other, bad anime.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently Steins Gate is like the epitome of anime, but the main character's laughter pisses me off to much to watch it. Also Cowboy Bebop, just haven't gotten interested.
>> ARTICLE
The Steins; Gate dub is actually pretty good, so if your only reason is the MC laughter, the dub should more than suffice.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass. I just haven't felt like devoting my time to 50 episodes, but I need to.
>> ARTICLE
For me it's the episode count and how much it gets hyped up. I'll just be let down if I watch it.  
>> ARTICLE
Episode count is huge for me.  I am often dissuaded from starting some big name shows because of a high episode count.  It is what delayed me watching FMA:B for a while. 
>> ARTICLE
With FMA:B, I started on Thursday, and I watched to episode 50 last night.
>> ARTICLE
The episode count for Code Geass doesn't matter much because you'll end up watching the whole thing in 2 days anyways
>> ARTICLE
I know right, the 50 CG episodes feel like 20...
>> ARTICLE
Felt like 100 to me, but I realllllyyyy didn't like the 2nd season (except for the glorious ending)
>> ARTICLE
Clannad. Gotta read the VN first. Hopefully I'll get before the year is over by sekaiproject
>> ARTICLE
I also have Baccano on my PTW list. I think I like to have a what seems like it should be an excellent show on my PTW list just so I have it if I ever run out of other shows to watch. I know it's unrealistic but it's like a safety net. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow I think I'm almost the same way haha, don't like being in that habit though! I should watch what ever is good sooner then later before risking getting spoiled!
>> ARTICLE
Beck. It for a truly rainy day.I have long since exhausted the items I was truly interested in, in my PTW list. Now it is just sequels, recommendations from others new stuff i am unsure about or things that appear mildly interesting. I kept Beck as something I can always look forward to. 
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate, because I am finishing up the VN before I watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
attack on titan. everyone is constantly praising this anime and it's all over the place, but i've yet to start watching it. i'm constantly distracted by other things. whether it be binge watching a live action series, playing the one of many video games i've got, watching movies, or simply watching other anime shows. i've got it open in one of my tabs so i'll probably start watching it within the next week or so. 
>> ARTICLE
>AmethystItalian

uh, uh Amagami SS! wait shit i watched that uh, uh Plus!!!

yea that'll do.
>> ARTICLE
Haha better watch it one day if you're too busy for the watch group this time around! :p
>> ARTICLE
I apparently have a lot of "the best anime" on my PTW because I added a good bunch of my list because I saw enough people saying that it was "the best anime" either of the season or year or in general.

I haven't watched them because my PTW is ~100 series long and that takes awhile to get through.

----
PS. Baccano! dub, no question.
>> ARTICLE
Steins gate seems to be really good need to start on that
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero for obvious reason, but the biggest one would be Kara no Kyoukai, I am waiting for a place to see it in high definition, that anime deserves it.

Download Kara no Kyoukai?

Crappy internet, also I don't know which site to trust, I don't have an anti-virus.

Thanks, i will save your comment for future reference

What obvious reasons? I don't see any.
>> ARTICLE
S1 still airing, supposedly I'm supposed to watch it and the upcoming movie first, and then F/Z

Edit: Honestly I can't wait to watch it, please tell me I can watch it already.
>> ARTICLE
He's waiting for FSN to finish airing.
>> ARTICLE
Oh you are supposed to watch it after the FS/N series? I didn't even know lol. I guess most people didn't do that.
>> ARTICLE
They both spoil each other and F/Z explained things better for me, being a complete rookie.
>> ARTICLE
Not really, but everyone here says so even though I disagree.
>> ARTICLE
Some people, myself included, like the sequel to be completed so you can just watch all of them without waiting for new episodes to come out.
>> ARTICLE
I can't imagine many anime-only viewers would be able to understand scenes like Illya's flashback without background information from Zero.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Fate/Zero or Fate/Stay Night yet because EVERYONE says to play the visual novel first and then watch it to get a better experience and understanding of it. I want to play it, but I have no idea how or where to get it :/
>> ARTICLE
Hi, if you want to play the FS/N Visual Novel go to /r/fatestaynight > Useful Links (You'll see this along the top row)> VN Installation Guide. 
>> ARTICLE
what sound does a japanese cat make?
>> ARTICLE
I have way too many. 

Eureka Seven, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Aria, Baccano!, Cardcaptor Sakura, Cowboy Bebop, Gankutsuou, Katanagatari and Planetes just to name a few. 

I'll get to them eventually... but having a job > not having a job. 
>> ARTICLE
Whats so special about Cardcaptor Sakura?
>> ARTICLE
I'm a big fan of the directors work (Chihayafuru and currently airing Ore Monogatari) and I actually un-ironically like CLAMP.  I've heard nothing but good things about the series from a variety of people. As long as you are not entirely opposed to magical girls doing magical things, its supposedly an amazing series through and through. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm planning on getting an Aria rewatch started in August so if you want to join in on that if you want to. 

Otherwise I really recommend watching 1-2 episode a day, especially if it's a crappy one. 
>> ARTICLE
Is it sad that I haven't seen any of those that you've listed...

> but having a job > not having a job

Can confirm haha gd luck :p

We all have way too many man

True.

Not /u/thatanimesnob. He's seen it all, baby.

Steins;Gate 

FMA:B

Ghost in the Shell

Anything by Studio Gibli 

Code Geass

Hunter x Hunter

and so many more I haven't watched yet. I'll get to them! Just give me a year or something. 

>> ARTICLE
You have watched studio ghibli stuff, wtf? 
>> ARTICLE
Clannad. It's KyoAni and many regard it as one of their best works. As for why I didn't start it yet. I dunno.

Garden of Words. It's more difficult to fire yourself to watch an entire movie. 

Yuru Yuri. It's by freaking Doga Kobo, so it will be at the very least hilarious. Probably will start it soon. 
>> ARTICLE
True but Garden of Words is only about 45 minutes long.


>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate 

I don't have a good answer for why.  I guess I've just heard how good it is and right now I'm looking to get surprised by other shows rather than get what I'm expecting.  I'm planning on watching in sometime in June though. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't go in with high expectations, everyone hypes it up way too much.
>> ARTICLE
You know, now that you mention it, maybe the reason I haven't started it yet is because I'm not hyped *enough*.  It is supposed to be some great show so I feel the need to be excited about the show before I watch it. 

I'll probably start it next week sometime.  
>> ARTICLE
Just watched it not too long ago. It lived up to the hype for me.
>> ARTICLE
The VN (available with official english translation) >> the anime IMO, as the anime loses quite a bit of the world-building, Okabe's inner monologue, and also changes a few scenes (for the worse IMO). I also liked the artstyle of the VN more, but I guess that is just preference.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure? It surely lives up to the hype for me. There's a reason why it's a generally well regarded show to most people.
>> ARTICLE
It's better not to watch anything with high expectations.
>> ARTICLE
Probably Tatami Galaxy. I haven't gotten to it because of limited time and watching other good anime first. I should be getting to this within a week or two.

The other answer would be LotGH, because of it's length.
>> ARTICLE
* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
* Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

I don't feel like watching them.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass, FMA:B, Gurren Lagann, Gintama, Fate, Steins;Gate, Bleach

Don't really have time to start and don't have much inspiration. I'm about 150~ episodes into bleach but it gets boring sometimes. 
>> ARTICLE
Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.

Simply put, I'm afraid it won't live up to the hype, and I want to make sure I really want to watch it before I start it.

Also OP, watch Baccano dubbed. It's set in 1930s North America. Why would you watch that subbed?
>> ARTICLE
According to MAL, it's Gintama.

I like the clips I've seen, so I'm sure I'd like it. There are just so many shorter shows that I'm sure I would enjoy just as much, if not more.
>> ARTICLE
Its great to watch 2 episodes every now and then its relaxing till it gets to the best part.
>> ARTICLE
Probably Stein;s Gate and One Piece. One Piece is too long and the premise of Stein;s Gate sounds boring tbh.
>> ARTICLE
Dude. Watch Steins; Gate. It is my favourite anime. It doesn't live up to the hype for everyone, but even it it doesn't rank in your personal top 5, people still tend to think it was a very good anime.
>> ARTICLE
Death Note and Gurren Lagann due to spoilers. Legend of the Galactic Heroes because it's too damn long.
>> ARTICLE
> Gurren Lagann due to spoilers

Yeah I put it off for that reason also. Still enjoying my watch of it now!
>> ARTICLE
I went in completely blind. Can't think of an anime I've watched that has made me as emotional as Gurren Lagann did. I envy you for getting to watch it for your first time. Enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
I wanted to watch Legend of Galactic Heroes but never did because of the 110 episodes. But today I finally started it. I hope it's as good as people say.
>> ARTICLE
Mahou Shoujo MadokaMagica 

I really don't like the way the art style looks (dumbest complaint ever). I'm sure I'll still watch it eventually. 
>> ARTICLE
> I really don't like the way the art style looks (dumbest complaint ever).

I'd be lying to say that hasn't kept me away from watching an anime either (and also look at all the "Eyes" complaints for Clannad), it took me a while to finally get to Revolutionary Girl Utena because of that. But for the most part it's very enjoyable to see a new style done once in a while getting used to it, seeing the same clean animation while good looking does get kind of boring, and there's times when it needs to be mixed up.
>> ARTICLE
if you just want one? Evangelion definitely.  why? broke as fuck and cant find it legally streaming anywhere. as for any others? 
,Madoka Magica 
,Samurai Shamploo 
,Baccano
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass. I know all about the storyline, characters, etc and so I'm trying to avoid the heartache. I don't need another thing to be depressed about.
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty tame compared to a lot of things. If you've seen Death Note then Code Geass has a lot of similarities, but isn't even half as heavy. Plus it has mecha.
>> ARTICLE
it's not really depressing. 
>> ARTICLE
I know that ppl die that I could potentially get attached to, hence my hesitation. 
>> ARTICLE
for a long time it was "Gurren Lagann", but i'm watching it now, so the title goes now to the "Fate/" series, and i havn't watched it yet because...no real reason, but it's next.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, let's see. There are a number of "Best ever" shows I haven't seen, such as FMA:B, Hunter x Hunter, LotGH, Tatami Galaxy, Katanagatari, Aria, Mushishi, Utena, Haibane Renmei, Gintama and Kaiji, and I haven't heard any convincing reason why I should watch one particular show before the others.
>> ARTICLE
NGE and Tatami Galaxy, since I couldn't find a non-torrent download option for them. I hate watching anime online and would like to archive them as many as possible :P
>> ARTICLE
FMA because... Idk I'll go do it now 
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood<3 
>> ARTICLE
Legend of Galactic Heroes and Monogatari series. Too busy.
>> ARTICLE
Texholyze, Haibane renmei, ergo proxy and serial experiments lain.

psychological shit is my jam, and despite knowing almost nothing about all of these shows, I can just tell I will love them all. 
>> ARTICLE
* **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann**, because I'm saving it for when I need a boost after a particularly mediocre run of anime.
* **Clannad**, because I can't justify sitting through an entire apparently subpar season just to get to the good stuff. At least while I have other series to watch.
* **Shirobako**, for no real reason. I'll get around to it sooner or later.
>> ARTICLE
Trigun

I tried to start watching it dub, didn't really click with me. Tried watching it sub, still didn't really get into it but from what I hear it is good...
>> ARTICLE
Gintama and HxH for their length.

Most anime from sci-fi, mecha, horror or psychological...because.... I don't enjoy these genre as much as the others.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man i've got so many. Anime like Gintama, Cowboy bebop, Evangelion, Gundam, Black lagoon, Trigger, Monster, Code Geass and so many more. I just can't organize my time since now i have a job and have to attend univercity. If only i started watching anime when i was much younger.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi! Im in the period where I want to watch something, but nothing consumes me.
>> ARTICLE
Full metal alchemist. I really badly want to watch it but I've already been told everything that happens in it. I want to watch AoT and Tokyo ghoul too since everyone I know talks about them but I just feel like they will just be let downs to all the hype around them.
>> ARTICLE
Full metal alchemist brotherhood because the voice actors changed for the English dub
>> ARTICLE
Clannad.  
  
Angel Beats absolutely destroyed me, and I don't think I'm ready for what Clannad might do to me from what I've heard from people. It might not be as bad since I know it's going to run me over with the feels train. I actually did not expect it out of Angel Beats. Saw it and thought it looked interesting and boy was I in tears by the end of it.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari Series, Gintama, Your lie in April, Guild crown, TGGL

I'm watching UBW and enjoying it.

Have not seen any prior Fate series or VN at all. I have a feeling someone is going to tell me I'm doing it wrong hah
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B No time 
>> ARTICLE
I heard Akira and Ghost in the Shell is amazing, but the drawing looks old IMO so my brain is telling me that it's boring.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad because you guys say after story is that much better and I'm worried that I can't make it if the first season is shit. 
>> ARTICLE
The first season isn't bad at all, it just doesn't really stack up to the second season (and the constant "Eyes" comments).  It's like having to eat a salad before the main course, the salad can be enjoyable but it isn't going to be anywhere as good when you get the main course which is absolutely delightful...sorry...have food in my mind for some reason. The first season overall can be boring at times, but it's overall enjoyable and I think it pays off very much so in after story.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad. I can't handle the character designs.
>> ARTICLE
I hear Code Geiss is really good, but don't have the time right now.

Gintama, Evangelion, Bleach and Fate are the big ones I'm missing but also FLCL, Cowboy Bebob, Galactic Heros and Mushishi

Nichijou... College man

Code Geass. I gave up watching it cus I started watching it when I was new to anime and couldn't keep up with the subtitles 
>> ARTICLE
God, there's just so many. I didn't really watch anime or read manga outside of a handful of really popular things (FMA, Naruto, Bleach, etc) up until about a year and a half ago. Since then I've slowly been catching up on things, but there's just so much I haven't seen. A friend of mine gave me a list about 100 series long, and I've barely scratched the surface of it.

The main problem is that I just haven't had time. All my free time for the last year has gone into studying and more studying, so it's hard enough just to find the time to watch a handful of new releases to whichever current series I'm on. 
>> ARTICLE
I have two, Tokyo Ghoul cause everyone raves about it but I couldn't care less about a boy who has to eat people.

Elfein Leid, I have no reason why I haven't watched it I just usually get distracted by something else to watch, also cousin love is a little weird to me.

Inuyasha, K-On!, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Clannad for me. Most of them are classics that are fairly lengthy and take a while to get into. 
>> ARTICLE
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood

Hunter x Hunter.

Too many episodes prevent me from watching any anime. 

I also avoid anime that might give me a very depressing feeling at the end of it like Tasogare Otome x Amnesia or Little Busters.

NGE ... i simply hate mechas. Was a pain in the ass to ignore all those mechs in Code Geass already.

I have so many anime to watch.

If we go by MAL rankings, the best anime I haven't seen is Hunter x Hunter (2011), closely followed by Legend of the Galactic Heroes.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama,
Hunter x Hunter,
Baccano (I loved Durarara so I plan on picking this up VERY soon),
FLCL.

Even though I've sat through every single Bleach episode they've made, I can't bring myself to sit down to watch Gintama or Hunter x Hunter in their entirety. 
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul because I'm afraid Hulu will censor gore if there is any.

Mawaru Penguindrum. I tried watching a few episodes and realized I probably have to devote a lot of attention to it to fully understand it. So I'm holding off until I have more free time.

Darker Than Black - I just don't know who bloody has it now. I'm on Netflix and Funimation. As far as I know, Netflix USED TO have it. It's been a while since I checked. If it's on Funi, then I'll watch it there.


Texhnolyze - I actually started it on Youtube, and decided I needed to wait til I'm not watching 7 other things so it would have my full attention.


Galactic Heroes - it's bloody long

Mushishi - usually, I'd have just jumped on the current season, but apparently even though it's episodic it's not the best thing to do. It's a lot to catch up with. I'll most likely get to it when there's a long lull between the announcement of the next installment.

Code Geass R2 - I finished the first season, and then Spring began and I was watching more shows than i thought. Probably finish it in Summer, only watching two shows that season.

>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann my uninterest in the mecha genre gets me every time although I liked it til episode 9 just no motivation to finish

It starts picking up and moves along pretty quickly. I'd give it the watch it deserves.

I was in the same boat as you. 2 a day will get you through it!

Clannad series... The Hype Train not only wrecked but blocked the tunnel so I'll probably never watch it.

Space Brothers-I know if I watch I'll probably fall in love with it. Simply finding time to properly get into is the issue.

Probably Darker Than Black, Neon Genesis Evangelion, or One Piece. Don't know why, I think it's just because I'm caught up in the currently airing shows.
>> ARTICLE
Ghost in the Shell.  Seen a few episode and liked what I saw but never found the time to watch it yet.

/u/AmethystItalian for Baccano! I would recommend trying the dub out first because you get to hear the accents. If you don't like it then the sub is great too.

^(edit: seems like you've gotten a lot of this sort of comment already. Well, there's my two cents anyway, for whatever it's worth.)
>> ARTICLE
Everyone is telling me that :p

I'm just stubborn haha haven't watched a dub series in ages. When I do get to Baccano! it will be in dub first though, thanks :)

I don't remember the last dub I watched either. But ugh. Those accents. So sexy.

Gurren Lagann and Trigun. Gotta start them soon.

Cowboy Bebop. Still haven't found a time to sit down and marathon watch it.

I've heard everyone tell me to watch Tokyo Ghoul and SAO, so I guess those. Gurren Lagann is another one. Dunno why I haven't gotten around to watching them, besides the scary amount of hate for SAO s2. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch the first 14 episodes of SAO, they are not bad. I do NOT recommend you to watch the rest of SAO S1, but you might still do it for completion sake or to understand the hate SAO receives.

Yeah. I'll probably try to watch all of it just to see what the major disappointment was. Should be horrible!

It's *fairly* horrible

you should probably skip the anime and just head straight to the manga for TG

Inc comments: 

"Tokyo Ghoul is bad, and second half of SAO was pretty terrible"

I actually don't see why everyone hates SAO. Sure, it has its flaws, but it's pretty entertaining - especially if you can get into the mindset of the characters.

Tokyo Ghoul Root A has the absolute lowest score on my MAL.

Gurren is one of my top 5. :)
>> ARTICLE
I'm more taken back by the hate for Tokyo Ghoul. I heard that it was pretty good or at least okay. 
>> ARTICLE
Once you read the source material you'll understand how much they slaughtered the story/cast.

Oh. Tokyo Ghoul was honestly not that bad (Root A is the second season), but I detested the lack of character development and abrupt fighting sequences.

Gurren Lagann is something you dedicate your whole day to. Just experience all those emotions continuously.

I've wanted to dedicate a weekend to watching Gurren Lagann, I've been horribly busy though.

This was me but the current watch group here finally got me to take the plunge, enjoying it so far!

I probably sound like a broken record, but don't watch Tokyo Ghoul, read it. It's a much more enjoyable experience and you won't have some of the stuff spoiled for you like I did when I read it after I finished the anime.

Clannad/Clannad AS


Trying to take a break from the sad anime's and wanting to explore other genres. 
>> ARTICLE
try Bakuman, it's my #1 feel good anime.

Couldn't get through Clannad. Don't know why, I didn't even really get to the sad parts. Guess the fact that I was starting to like the characters and I knew shit was going to go bad pushed me away. 
>> ARTICLE
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood

First reason is its very long, and the second is that I watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist back in the fall so I decided to wait till the summer to watch it, so I can have forgotten enough of the plot.

Space Dandy

I don't really know I've kind of just been waiting for a time when it feels right. Might watch it during finals week to keep myself from going insane.
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood's plot takes a sharp fork away from the plot of the original early on (after about 12/64 eps). There's really no need to let your memory of the first one fade first in order to enjoy the remake more.
>> ARTICLE
Brotherhood was damn good. Sticks to the manga much better than its predecessor.  It might be long but it never really gets monotonous, at least it didn't for me. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think it was too long. In comparison to most anime anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
Well obviously I need to base this on what others think.  Here's some heavy hitters I haven't seen yet.

Code Geass  
Angel Beats  
Toradora  
Clannad  
Cowboy Bebop  
Baccano!  
Jojo  
Serial Experiments Lain  
FLCL  
The Tatami Galaxy  
Welcome to the NHK  
Monster

...and on and on, no one can reasonably watch everything.


>> ARTICLE
> Angel Beats


I highly recommend you try it out when you get the chance! It's a very beautiful and touching story that'll get you hooked with the humor and make you stay for the backstories :) I will warn you though, if you don't like humor to be mixed in then it may not be for you. Also be aware that if you can't connect with any of the characters, you will have a hard time feeling anything with the 13 released episodes. In other words, you'll most likely either hate it or love it, it's all about how well you connect! :D
>> ARTICLE
> Monster

you better hurry up
>> ARTICLE
FMA: Brotherhood.

I hear so many good things about it from friends and it has relatively high review scores but can't come to terms to watching it. 
>> ARTICLE
There might be too many to list...

**Gintama** because it's long; I would have to wait 20-40 episodes before it gets good; and them I might dislike it; and since I don't find clips that sometimes land on the sub all that funny, I'm not going to risk it

**Clannad** - I tried it and managed to get through first 12 episodes. It was somewhat interesting, but god it was so slow; And those eyes O.O

**JoJo** - I don't like the artstyle nor the characters (Seen ep1)

**Chihayafuru** - Tried. Turns out sport anime are not for me even in card game form.

**FLCL** - Having seen NGE, I know very well to stay far away from anything tagged *Dementia*

**Hunter x Hunter** - Cause it's long and looks awful.

**Monster** - Tried. Didn't find it particularly interesting. I'm sorry :(

**Cowboy Bebop**, **Tatami Galaxy** - I don't even know why. 
>> ARTICLE
Clannad or the second season After Story?

The first season I can understand because it does get a little tiresome with the side character arcs, but I can assure you that the wait is DEFINITELY worth it. After Story also has a couple side character arcs for the first ten episodes or so, but then turns you for a full on feels trip.

Hunter x Hunter may turn you off at first with its childish artwork, but believe me, it turns into something so much greater and is VERY MUCH worth the 148 episode investment. The action is top-notch, the animation is stellar coming from Madhouse, and it has one of my favorite shounen arcs of all time.

Give both a shot :)
>> ARTICLE
I watcher half of Clannad (not After Story). I just don't feel like finishing it. 

And HxH is just not happening. I really really dislike the artstyle. And it's long running shounen. I complained about FMA:B being a bit too long and I fucking loved that show. 150 eps is out of the question. And with very young protagonist - another thing I can't stand.
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, how did you like the Clannad character designs but don't like HxH?

Also Jojos animation gets better later on, and the first part is only 9 episodes. Part 2 and 3 are better.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't. Well, I didn't mind them **as** much.
>> ARTICLE
For the newer ones: Etotama


But I have around 200 anime on my to-watch list currently and I keep adding more. So I don't know how long it will take.

Those [annoying fucking kids](http://i.imgur.com/t9xfT.jpg) from Eureka Seven - never before have I wanted children to be horridly killed as I wanted those kids killed.

Never dropped it, but started skipping their scenes.
>> ARTICLE
They really were a trio of little shits right up until the last 10 episodes.  That said, I really want them to show up in AO as major players, or even just a small cameo. It'd be great to see how Renton and Eureka's influence has shaped their growth as characters.
>> ARTICLE
Watch Elfen Lied. That'll show you some fucked up kids that you will want to kill.

[And for people that don't remember.](/s "Yes, I mean the fucking kids that fucking killed the dog. OH MAN BUTCHER THEM!")
>> ARTICLE
I've seen it, and that wasn't a big deal for me at all, they deserved it and got it (in the same scene). 

The Eureka Seven kids are not mean, or nasty - just highly whiny and annoying and take up WAY too much screen time (like a good 25% of a lot of episodes).
>> ARTICLE
[Yeah...](/s "Couldn't wait for those episodes being stranded on the beach to finish up and move on...")

But seriously besides the kids it was an amazing show.
>> ARTICLE
They were awful. I hated that they became such important characters.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. Eureka Seven is one of my favorite anime, but those children needed to die a horrific death to give me some closure. 
>> ARTICLE
Fuko almost made me drop Clannad. I'm really unsure why as there have been much more annoying characters who haven't bothered me as much. I stuck it through until her arc was over and I enjoyed the rest of the series which, by the end, became my favorite anime. Over time, she grew on me and I was able to enjoy her route when I eventually played the visual novel.
>> ARTICLE
Thank god! When rewatching Clannad, i now skip her arc entirely, because i find her abhorrent.

Love everything else in the show.
>> ARTICLE
Fuko *did* make me drop Clannad.  Dropped it on episode 4 when I looked at an episode list and I realized I had to deal with *5* more episodes of Fuko.  If/when I pick up Clannad again, I'll probably just read a summary of what happened and skip that arc altogether.  I know the gist of her character and what happens to her anyway.
>> ARTICLE
I actually dropped Clannad by episode 4 a couple years back, came back to it and suffered through all of Fuko and came out loving the rest of Clannad.

Until I played the VN and did Fuko's route (which I was dreading) I found her to be a little more likable than the anime version, but still equally annoying.
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree with you.

Found Fuuko annoying in the anime, played the VN and accidentally ended up doing her route first because she was actually funny and much less annoying.
>> ARTICLE
I loved Fuuko, hers was honestly my favorite arc.

In After Story, [Spoilers for After Story](/s "When Tomoya meets her again, and does the whole "Head pat" thing with her, I was so happy")
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one here that likes Fuko...?
>> ARTICLE
Outside of reddit, she is one of the most beloved characters. 
>> ARTICLE
[I heard you might like stars.](http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs1/3325832_o.gif)
>> ARTICLE
I liked fuko, probably more than Kotomi. 

Still, i teared up like a little girl at one point in every arc.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, I liked Fuko.  She was exactly what she was supposed to be:  a childish kid sister with an innocent and pure concern for her older sister.  She acted like a child because that is exactly what her character needs to be.  I found it endearing, but kids have their annoying side too, and I guess they annoy some people more than others.  Shoot, I teared up at the end of her arch.
>> ARTICLE
Nope. Fuko's arc was the only part that I cried to for some reason...
>> ARTICLE
I kinda felt that way with Usopp in One Piece. He almost pushed me over the edge. He has grown on me though. Mainly after Enies Lobby.
>> ARTICLE
Usopp in the beginning seems so fucking useless until the Luffy v Usopp fight then he becomes pretty awesome at times.
>> ARTICLE
Basically he started turned awesome for me after Sogeking. Once I saw that for the first time, I almost died of laughter.
>> ARTICLE
It was some much needed character development.
>> ARTICLE
I also feel that he has grown with the other characters and realizes he's not comparable to the top three strength wise.
>> ARTICLE
Siesta from Zero No Tsukaima.

Every time she tried to steal Saito I wanted to turn off my computer and walk away.
>> ARTICLE
But she was necessary to push the relationship between him and Louise. Yeah it is annoying but i knew that most times somehow Saito and Louise would progress when i see that happening in an episode.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely loved her during the first season and then she decides to help that bitch Louise with Saito so she can beat him more. I think I hate him even more than Louise because he somehow gets all the girls even though he is dumb as fuck, the only reason he is considered alpha is because of the sword. He makes a promise with one girl, the next second you know, he's somehow groping another girl's chest. What. The. Fuck?!
>> ARTICLE
I think Saito going after more than one girl given the situation is more realistic then in anime where the male lead avoids situations like that. It makes Saito more relate-able as a guy, in stead of me sitting behind my computer screen yelling "KISS HER GOD DAMNIT!".
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, kiss Louise, get into a misunderstanding while grabing some random girl's breasts, get beaten. Repeat. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same way, but I had those same urges whenever I saw Louise injure Saito.
>> ARTICLE
I think "whiney" characters often do this to people. Ganta from Deadman Wonderland and Yukiteru from Mirai Nikki caused a lot of rage for a lot of the people in the society I watch anime with. Not me, but I can see their point.
>> ARTICLE
I actually liked Ganta. I felt his portrayal of emotions given the situation he was in was refreshingly realistic, especially given his age and all the things he was wrongly accused for. I almost felt sorry for him.
>> ARTICLE
Have you tried reading the manga? He completely fucks everything up again with his crying right after the anime ends.
>> ARTICLE
There's also Shuu from Guilty Crown and Shinji from Evangelion, the former being probably the biggest offender I've ever seen.

For posterity, I'd like to note that I'm okay with whiny characters (at least, I don't find them significantly worse than other types of characters, all else equal).
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
> I'm not going to go into a huge Eva debate, but Shinji being "whiny" is part of what made the story seem more realistic to me.

i know that people say this alot, and its probably true, but honestly Shinjis whining and Asukas PMS almost made me drop NGE, which already bored me out my fucking mind, but i finished it just to be able to say i have watched it in discussion.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped NGE after 3 episodes of non-stop Shinji bitching. 1.0 was way better, it cut put half his whining while still being realistic.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, im definitely interested in Rebuild, but i have such a giant to-watch i probably won't get to it for a while.

\**Runs into battle and almost dies*\*
>> ARTICLE
A character that *almost* made me drop an anime was actually Yui from K-on. Now before you get started on me, I had no idea what I was getting into when I watched K-on, as I was looking for a nice music based anime after I just finished Beck.

I couldn't believe just how ridiculously airheaded this girl was! 

But for some reason I couldn't stop watching and by the end of the second season I almost loved her at times! But I loved all the other girls more and for a longer duration.
>> ARTICLE
I had the same thing. I dropped K-On the first time I watched it after the first episode. That first scene with Yui stumbling out of bed and falling over as she walks just made me think it was an otaku pandering thing where girls who are literally retarded are supposed to be cute and whatever. Second time I watched it I stuck around and eventually ended up loving Yui, but her first appearance gave me a really bad impression of what the whole show was about. Based on how I felt the first time I tried to watch it I can understand why people misunderstand it and hate it.
>> ARTICLE
No description i can give will accurately describe the loathing i have for this show. Its not something i can see myself watching again.

The characters play a large part of it, but i have to say the lack of any sort of interesting plot is the biggest contender. 
>> ARTICLE
Spot on! Almost exactly what I felt! Glad I stuck it out though.
>> ARTICLE
I've witnessed this first hand. My bodybuilder brother saw me watching K-On, stuck around for a minute, and then announced, "don't you find it weird that you're watching a show about little girls? That's pretty gay."
>> ARTICLE
Your response should have been: "Oh, so you prefer to watch boys? Not that there's anything wrong with that."
>> ARTICLE
I own him in verbal jousts on a regular basis, and I often make fun of his bodybuilding videos by making caveman sounds and such, so he already knows.
>> ARTICLE
Jumping from Beck to K-ON is like night and day.
>> ARTICLE
Tell me about it.

This was in my very new to rediscovering watching anime phase. I just googled something like "anime about music" or something and went with it. I was like... what the hell is this... is there a plot?!
>> ARTICLE
I went in by assuming it was like Lucky Star but with a plot. That assumption was mildly accurate IMO.
>> ARTICLE
While pretty inaccurate, I'd say it was closer to the mark than my assumption!
>> ARTICLE
Taiga in Toradora, almost. 

But i keep seing recommendations on Reddit to watch the show, so i'm assuming she gets better.
>> ARTICLE
I like the show and I ended up liking the character a lot, but I came to the conclusion pretty early on that I wouldn't even be able to stand her if she was a real person I knew. 
>> ARTICLE
I tried to like the show, I really did - even breaking my 3ep/drop rule (I went to 5) but Taiga was just way too over the top. I can only take so much awkward tsundere.
>> ARTICLE
The ending of that pissed me off. 
>> ARTICLE
Indeed. Man, I wish either of the two other girls won. Or if they made some one shot specials where they won or something. Guess I need to find the visual novel...
>> ARTICLE
she really doesn't.

i mean, she deals with some issues, but her personality doesn't change for the better until, like...the very end.

folks really like tsunderes though, so she continues to be popular.
>> ARTICLE
>but her personality doesn't change for the better until, like...the very end.

Well, I'm definitely not watching it now. I thought maybe, MAYBE she has some development so I can start watching it because I was avoiding it because Rie. Lovable comedy, character development my ass. I'll stick to my 2DEEP4U series.
>> ARTICLE
no dont quit, its one of the best shows Ive seen. Just stay for the humor, you get used to her.
>> ARTICLE
I can't. I literally hate her voice. I haven't even started it and I am repulsed already. For example, in ZnT I was waiting for four seasons for a change that I might start to like her voice, but no. Quite the contrary, I despise her voice even more. I don't know what brings this in me.
>> ARTICLE
are you watching the dub?

Nope, Japanese with subs. You should be aware by now that I'm talking about Kugimiya Rie.

I just find it amazing that its the same voice actress who plays them all.

Jacuzzi is arguably the most badass character in Baccano. Just sayin.

Sayaka almost made me drop Madoka. I wouldn't say she killed the show for me though, since I didn't really like anything else about it anyway.

Almost dropped Code Geass because of Nina. Table-kun deserved none of that.

Nina's blatant racism and overall psychosis is the worst part of geass.

Followed by Rolo, the character they could have done without.

Table-kun haha You just made my day.

Fuko from Clannad almost made me drop it. 

The main character in Eureka 7 made me drop it, which is odd because I usually don't have a problem with "whiny" characters and welcome them. There was just something about him that I couldn't stand. 

I almost dropped Casshern Sins because of Ringo.

Also, Jacuzzi wasn't that whiny. His character was a refreshing change from a cast of psychos and badasses in my opinion.  

>> ARTICLE
Psychos happen to be my favourite type of character. So I really enjoyed all of the those characters.
>> ARTICLE
suffer through fuko, the rest of the show is worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I did. I said almost. After Story is one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Eureka 7 and initially hated Renton, but got over it when those 3 kids appeared. He was glorious by comparison - I was often muting the volume just to get through those scenes. I watched it dubbed, so the crying was extra whiny.
>> ARTICLE
It's actually a bit hard to think of any. Generally, if I don't like a show there's more than one character that I hate.

* Inami from Working!! - Abusive and uninteresting. She stole the spotlight from the better characters and then fumbled with it awkwardly.

* The main character from Kampfer. I think the show could have been nearly 30% better if the MC didn't have the typical harem lead personality.

* Haruhi from Haruhi. She was really abusive. The supporting cast in the show were great, but when you have a primary character who threatens to frame people for sexual harassment to get free shit (while herself sexually harassing a fellow club member), there's not that much they can do.
>> ARTICLE
>Haruhi from Haruhi. She was really abusive. The supporting cast in the show were great [...]

I actually see Kyon as a main character, pretty much at the same level as Haruhi. He's also my favorite character (Crispin Freeman as his voice actor helps a lot).

You could say he's the Watson of the show.
>> ARTICLE
I don't disagree with you. By "supporting cast", I was referring to the other SOS members. I didn't have any problems with Kyon--in fact, he was the easiest to empathize with.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite moment in both the show and the novels was when Kyon almost punched the shit out of Haruhi. 

>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi

Actually I found her sexual harassment to be one of her less annoying qualities. It gave me a couple laughs if nothing else. What I couldn't get over was the fact that her stupid mouth never shut up and 99.9% of the things spewing from it were pointless and moronic.

I actually loved the concept of the show, and the rest of the cast was good, if a little stereotypical. If haruhi had been just a little bit less... well, less of an idiot. It would have been a very enjoyable show.

Case in point: [The baseball episode](/s "The alien girl hacks the bat to hit nothing but home runs, even when held stationary in a bunt position.") Haruhi never questions this, despite supposedly being incredibly intelligent.
>> ARTICLE
>Haruhi never questions this, despite supposedly being incredibly intelligent.

that's because she's used to unconsciously making the universe bend to her whims. If she didn't have hax-super-powers I would agree.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with Inami. I liked Taneshima a lot better. :( 
>> ARTICLE
Haruhi is on my list of "Fictional Characters I Want to Hit in the Face With a Cricket Bat."

Don't worry, there are doujins that do pretty much that.

Im gonna write one of these...

Thanks for the inspiration.
>> ARTICLE
Haruhi was incredibly hard to like, she just came over as self absorbed and selfish. kyon was the star of that show  and the main reason i watched it.
>> ARTICLE
**Eventually** she grows out of it, and she's less present in the later material. She barely shows up at all in the later books, since Kyon is always hanging out with Yuki or Mikuru [Novel 9-11 spoilers](/s "or Sasaki and her posse") dealing with their respective issues. I can't even remember a single thing she did in book 7.

I dropped Soul Eater because of Black Star. Man that kid is annoying....
>> ARTICLE
Aw, I never hated him, but he still grew on me quite a bit as the show went on.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I tried really hard to just ignore him, especially since I really liked Maka, Soul, even Black Star's own weapon. But I still ended up dropping the series after the halfway mark. I just couldn't do it.
>> ARTICLE
Wow that is weird, he is actually my favorite character from that series. I got the same Kamina vibe from him. He's cocky, he's loud, he's obnoxious at times, but goddamn it I can't not love him.
>> ARTICLE
Ya-hoo.....
>> ARTICLE
YOUR OBVIOUSLY NOT BIG ENOUGH TO BE AROUND HIM! No, but seriously, before even reading your comment I thought the exact same thing. He's like Naruto (which is why I won't watch Naruto) but 10x worse. I came really close to dropping that series because of him, glad I finished it though.
>> ARTICLE
Naruto is a lot more mature and tolerable in shippuuden in my opinion if you would give that a look :)

He matures a lot around halfway through
>> ARTICLE
Dropped beelzebub because of beelzebub after 2 episodes; regret not dropping elfen lied cause of every single character.
>> ARTICLE
;_; But Beelzebub is supposed to be a whiny, he's a baby. I haven't really finished the anime (I read the manga mostly), but I can vouch it gets better. The main thing you gotta remember about this anime/manga is that it sets itself apart by being random at surprising times.
>> ARTICLE
Kirino from Ore no Imouto. She is unbearable. 
>> ARTICLE
She's meh on my part, I don't hate her all that much, but definitely would rather him end up with Kuroneko. 
>> ARTICLE
Really?  I thought she made for a decent allegory of an obnoxious adolescent sibling.  Minus the siscon, eroge obsession, and ridiculous social/academic aptitude, my sister's more or less the spitting image. At least, so far as the minor acts of violence, passive aggressiveness, and general snarkiness are concerned.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's because I'm the youngest, and wasn't anything like this, that I couldn't stand her.
>> ARTICLE
No way man, 

Imouto has to be the cute, passive, obedient, waking you up in the morning, cook breakfast/lunch/dinner for you, saying oniichaan~ all the time, wanting to marry you since as a kid, type of person.

Anything else is just annoying and should be hated.
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree, oreimo actually captures that style of sibling dynamics entirely accurately (I would know, I have a minorly violent, passive aggressive, sarcastic imouto too)

Currently watching Wandering Son, which has the same mangaka. The MC (or at least (s)he(?) seems to be marketed as the MC) is somehow the most boring character, while everyone else in the ensemble cast is incredibly interesting. It's moved Aoi Hana way up on in my backlog, though it's disappointing to hear that she's failed to make an MC interesting in that one

Hagu from Honey and Clover.  The anime was going fine, until they introduce Hagu.  She looks like she's maybe 10, and seems to act around that age.  Two other characters fall in love with her at first sight.  So the show in episode 1 immediately introduced a love triangle I found extremely creepy, and I just wasn't interested in the show anymore.

I loved Excel Saga, but I almost couldn't stand Excel.  Her voice and talking ninety miles an hour were almost too much...

Mayuri in Stein's Gate.  She just bugged me.  She saved herself with the ultra cutesy Tuturru noise
>> ARTICLE
That noise nearly made me drop the show... Glad I didn't though, because the last half of the series is pretty damn good. 
>> ARTICLE
And the first half was the (in my opinion, no sarcasm) completely necessary setup for the rest.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely do agree with you. Once you complete the show you realize just how crucial those initial, kinda goofy episodes were. But when you're first seeing them, unknowing as to what happens later, they just come across as too silly. At least, they did for me at the time. 

I think the old saying "It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt" really fits Steins;Gate.

Good quote. They really were **waaaaaay** too careless with using time travel. (And they were showing it to pretty much everyone!!)


Some spoilers: I love how the show is so *symmetrical*, too. I mean, the main twist happens in Episode 12, which is the middle of the show. The first half is where "things happen" and the second half is where "things that happened get explained and also undone". And the last episode is extremely similar as the first episode, just from a different point of view.
>> ARTICLE
I never noticed how symmetrical the show was until now and damn! You're right about that. That's really awesome, actually.

The best part of the show for me was [](/s "how wonderfully depressing undoing all the changes was. Those changes that the characters made were MAJOR changes in their lives that ultimately made them way happier than they were before. I really felt bad for the characters when they made their decision to undo something so dear to them, essentially for someone else's sake. Really quite interesting, serious and mature.")

If you're still going don't quit. Baccano! is amazing, it's worth it. That said Jaccuzi is honestly the character I hate most, right beside Ganta from Deadman Wonderland. I can't stand whiny characters that take a half a season to realize they need to man the fuck up.

Good thing he's not the main character, so by the time you see him again he already manned up.

Is there even a main character? I mean, Firo is main character...ish.

No, in the original books the main character is Actually some random Japanese guy that like 200 year old Firo is telling the story to in modern New York in the Restaurant that got shot up.(IIRC).

He's only in the first book, so he doesn't really count either. No main character.

Only bits and pieces of some of them, but Children of Bottle, which isn't covered in the anime, is done and it's pretty good.

Hm, I see everything except for 4 of the volumes completely translated by someone or the other on Baka tsuki.

13/17 of the novels is pretty amazing, can't wait to dig into them.

Ririchiyo from Inu x Boku SS, not because I dislike her in any way. In fact it is exactly the opposite. As many of you have no reason to know, I have an extreme leg fetish, and this show hit every single thing I love about legs and legwear with a perfect shot, it makes it insanely hard to watch without getting uh, too distracted, I'm trying to effort through it right now at the moment.

3 minutes and 28 seconds in for the last 10 minutes. Goddddd.

It's even worse because I've never had this issue with an ecchi anime. What the hell.

Well the reason I stopped watching bleach simply because I couldn't stand the character of Rangiku. She just seemed like a less air-headed version of Orihime.

Wait wait wait, THAT'S the reason you dropped Bleach?  Not the filler seasons, or the huge number of characters that don't do anything, or the air-headed and useless Orihime, or the stagnant character and repetitive fights, but Rangiku?  A semi-prominent character who actually does stuff?

Haruko Haruhara from FLCL. Honestly, I watched the show twice now and I've dropped it due to that character. Something about her that just irks me.  
I've been resigned to the fact that I'm part of the "hate it" group and I'll never like nor finish watching FLCL.

I finished it because it was only 6 eps, by my heart wasn't in it, and I only understood half of it.

Lawrence Craft. My apologies to all Spice and Wolf fans here, but he's such a shallow doormat.

im only 8 episodes into season 1, but i quite like Lawrence, he just came off as a generic, but still likeable guy.

Generic means he actually acted like a normal person, in which case the male leads in an anime are usually nowhere close to acting normal. 

I personally loved the down to earth feeling that most of the characters gave off. And Horo's dere moments are too good.

I dropped Chrono Crusade because of Rossete (i think thats her name anyway) because she would just shout,all the fuggin time for any reason. I nearly dropped NGE (series) as soon as Asuka spoke because of that awfull german/american accent going on.

Not exactly the same, but I am currently watching Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, and I was so close to dropping [when](/s "Kamina died")  But, I am continuing on and am glad I am.
>> ARTICLE
That moment was both a huge relief and horrible curse for me. I hated Kamina, so getting him out of the way was a big relief, but it brought out super emo Simon, who is 10x as annoying as normal Simon. 

To be fair though, i hated almost everyone in that show.

That is sort of what I ment. Although I didn't hate Kamina, Simon's emo phase was killing me.

It's never happened to me yet. I don't like to let one possibly annoying stop me from finishing an anime. 

Also, once I've started an anime series I honestly *have* to finish it. It's not an OCD thing, and I might not come back to it for a while if I stop mid series, but I will finish it. 

Maybe it's because I don't take it all that seriously. I've not yet seen an anime where I couldn't find at least find one thing to keep me going through to the end. Just not my style to quit.

The main girl lead and main guy character in Tenjou Tenge.

Souichiro Nagi i just really hated. I dunno if it was his look or how he just acts like a complete dick 100% of the time but i really think he should of been the side-character, with Masataka Takayanagi being the lead.

As for the lass, Aya Natsume, shes paper-thin in personalilty (at least for the first 5 or so episodes i watched) where she fell madly in love with the main character because he accidentally saw her naked or something in the first episode -_-

The cast of Angel Beats really soured me for whatever reason.  I couldn't call out any specific characters since it's been awhile since I watched it, but the ensemble that the SSS composed just rubbed me the wrong way.  Their personalities, insofar as the 2nd episode (never made it any further) made for a jarring contrast given the rather bleak setting they inhabited.
>> ARTICLE
If you had actually finished the show, you would have realized that their personalities actually fit in perfectly with the setting they inhabited. [Background spoils](/s "The whole world was created as a place where these kids could live try and regain their lost youth. The world wouldn't be doing a very good job of that if these kids stayed down and depressed the entire time and they would never leave if that was the case. Also, most of these kids have been here much longer than Otonashi and have had time to accept their position, why would they keep staying sulky and depressed the entire time?") 

So yes, I stand by my point that the characters staying true to themselves fits perfectly into the setting. I really recommend you give the show another go taking this into consideration if you decide to read the spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
Lambo from Katekyo Hitman Reborn almost made me drop it as i found him unbearable to watch
>> ARTICLE
I don't see how a character can make you want to drop a show, personally. 

In Black Butler (Kuroshitsuji) I didn't really like Lizzy. But, I knew that Ciel cared for her a lot, and eventually got over my small amount of hate for her, and now kinda enjoy her annoying-cheerfulness.

In Inuyasha, Kagome was kinda a bitch. But I didn't drop the series, nor did I want to because of her. I lost my hate for her, and now really don't mind her. 
Well, that's just me, I won't dislike you if you hate any of those characters, or any characters in general.

Shiro Emiya, Fate/Stay Night.  He pretty much ruined the whole series for me. "Dude, just STFU and let Saber kick ass!"


I thought Unlimited Blade Works would be better because it focused on Archer but......NO, GODDAMN, IT'S STILL ALL ABOUT SHIRO AGAIN!


Fate/Zero is so much better. 
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Accel World because of how ridiculously beta the main character was. I initially thought that he was a side character and mascot of the series because of how ridiculous he looked. 

I understand that all characters start off as weak, but this guy was just so pathetic that I couldn't stand watching him and imagine watching a full season of this guy. When he started to cry that someone beat his video game high score, I deleted the episode and never looked back again. I thought Simon (Gurren Lagaan) was bad in the beginning, but this guy took shit to another level.

I don't care how awesome he becomes later on. I absolutely refused myself from taking a liking to someone like him, especially when people tell me that he doesn't even change his appearance like a lot of initially-beta characters do later on in the series. 

Edit: lol @ downvotes for sharing my opinion. hurr durr downvote this guy cuz he hates my favorite fatboy crybaby.

He's more tolerable if you put yourself in the mindset that the MC is Bizzaro Cartman.  Makes the show far more watchable!

That's cool. You just prefer the Japanese version. People shouldn't have to explain WHY they prefer the dub or sub of a show. I prefer the dub. I just do :)

It's probably because I've seen the dub first, but Miria's voice is grating on my ears in Japanese. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, whatever you see first is what becomes headcanon. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it also feels more natural since it's set in America. 
>> ARTICLE
That's my main reason. We've got guys from british, american, italian, irish,.. descent, but in the japanese version you won't hear any of that. That's why i made  it my point to watch anime set in England/Usa in dub, since it just makes more sense that way, but so far baccano has been the only one.
>> ARTICLE
I dont think that english based accents are an important part of what makes this show great. Voice acting talent is far more important than the accent of the actor, and the japanese voice actors are by far superior.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, come now. "By far superior"? It's totally fine to prefer the Japanese version, but if the actors were so much better, more fans of the show would watch it in Japanese, right? 
>> ARTICLE
They do, you are in a minority, which isn't a bad thing, just a fact. More people watch subs and dubs, that is a fact. 
>> ARTICLE
Give me the statistics on that. I'd love to see you pull fake Baccano! numbers out of your ass, because any time people discuss Baccano! (even on chansites, the most "neutral" anti-dub places on the internet) they ALWAYS agree that Baccano had an amazing dub.

Don't mix the fact that more subs are available than dubs (which is because subbing is far easier, it's basically making a dub script than quitting before even finding the VAs) with the argument of which is better. YOU are in the minority, most people watch anime RAW, without subtitles, the way it was made and supposed to be watched. English weeaboo don't outnumber the amount of people watching anime in Japanese, don't forget that.
>> ARTICLE
You do realise that RAWs and Subs are both in Japanese right? Therefore your last comment makes absolutely no sense, because you just proved that people who watch anime in japanese are the majority. 

Some of the voice actors of the Baccano Dub are fantastic, but the difference is consistency. Watching it in japanese I know all the voice actors are phenomenal while in the dub I know only some of them will be.
>> ARTICLE
WRONG. RAWS are DUBBED in Japanese, with no subs at all, because you are supposed to understand what the characters say without reading it. The vast majority of people watch anime DUBBED, because anyone Japanese is watching a dub and not a sub. Subs are a crutch invented to let people understand something they aren't supposed to. You still haven't provided your statistics on how "more people watch subs, that is a fact", which I'd love you to prove since nobody has ever been able to prove it before.

You're clearly just a delusional weeaboo if you think "all the voice actors are phenomenal", since you don't understand the language or you wouldn't need subs. There are just as many terrible Japanese seiyuu, you just can't HEAR that they suck. Someone who doesn't know English most likely wouldn't be able to tell this voice actor is doing a terrible job:

That is true, Baccano can be considered an exception. However, it's still an anime after all, so it will never sound bad in japanese.

Plenty of Japanese anime sounds like shit, Japanese Goku sounds nothing like the character should, even if there were 10 voice actors in the world you could get a better fit than what Japan did. 

A lot of people can't tell how shitty it sounds because they don't know the language and can't tell how terrible the voice actors are. For example, someone who doesn't know English most likely wouldn't be able to tell this voice actor is doing a terrible job:

I couldn't agree with you more. Sure, some American VAs are trash, but there are plenty of not so great Japanese VAs, which is why the same VAs show up in the more popular shows.

This absolutely deserves more attention. What Aniplex is doing is by any standard underhanded; Funimation marketed, dubbed, and distributed every single one of these Aniplex titles that Aniplex is forcing to go out of print. In fact, much of Aniplex's presence in the North American market could be considered negligible if it weren't for Funimaton's efforts in backing hit titles like Baccano!, FMA:Brotherhood and Darker Than Black. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly Aniplex could've become a thing on it's own as it is owned by Sony. If Sony ever decided to lift a pinky and take anime distribution seriously in the West I bet they'd be just as big as they are now. Then the fact that all A-1 pictures shows automatically go to Aniplex (also a Sony company) they have a very sweet spot to be sitting in along with whatever other shows they produce in Japan. 
>> ARTICLE
Could someone ELI5 the effects of this? Why this is big news / what will change? I'm not sure I understand
>> ARTICLE
This means that Funimation no longer has the rights to release the series on DVD (they never had Blu-ray rights) or stream it.  Instead the rights are going to Aniplex who are notorious for charging high prices for their releases.
>> ARTICLE
Ah ok, so basically if you haven't bought the DVDs already, the prices are about to go way up?
>> ARTICLE
Most likely. The already existing Funimation release will likely get more expensive since there will be no chance for a restock and Aniplex (if they bother to do anything at all) will put it in a fancy box with some extra pieces of paper and at least quadruple the price. 
>> ARTICLE
I do not understand how they think this is a good idea.  Is anyone even buying those higher priced ones?
>> ARTICLE
I honestly don't know. Though, if you look at their new [Durarara!! volumes](http://www.rightstufanime.com/Durarara-x-2-BD-Volume-1) (which are currently selling at **$80** a piece for **6** episodes), then going down to the reviews shows that half of the people writing are talking about how crazy expensive they are. They're aren't even any reviews on volumes past the first one. Trying to own the last season of Durarara!! was pretty crazy too (I think it was fluctuating somewhere around $200 for a 24 episode series for a while; I got the region free European release for 70 and that wa a steal), but, at the rate it's currently going at $80 a volume, you'll have to pay **$480** for the entirety of Durarara!!X2 (which is only **36** epsiodes).
>> ARTICLE
Aniplex has shown time and time again that they have no interest in older titles from their catalog, so expect them to not even release any of their shows that are reverting back to them.

Soooo buy now or resort to piracy. Got it.

Y'argh 
>> ARTICLE
I don't really know the details of this case, am i wrong in understanding that Aniplex gave Funimation a temporary license to create/distribute certain animes? If that is the case, why do you assume it was an unfair deal? Funimation knew what they were signing up for, i'm sure they both benefited from the deal. Since the licensing is over it makes sense for Aniplex to make new business decisions that benefit them.

I can only imagine it's a matter of time before Aniplex takes back both Fullmetal Alchemist series too.

Good thing I already own Baccano!, DTB, and FMA:B on DVD. This is one of the the reasons I like having bought a physical copy of the some of the shows I really enjoy (besides showing support with my wallet). 

I've had people say "why buy them when you can watch them on Netflix whenever you want?" 
>> ARTICLE
That's going to be the big tipping point with this, because you know Funimation will fight tooth and nail to keep FMA. (Maybe Black Butler too, I think that's a big seller for them)?


FMA (2003) right now is so cheap on blu ray for the whole set, and Brotherhood isn't much more for its two halves. Its such a gateway series, there are new fans discovering it all the time, and it would be pretty sad to see it fall under AoA's prices for anyone who wants to own it.
>> ARTICLE
> (Maybe Black Butler too, I think that's a big seller for them)?

You're right on that note. At the most recent cons I've been to, there's still a noticeable amount of merch and cosplayers for that series. I'm sure some of the fans wouldn't be too fond of paying Aniplex-US prices for the still-unannounced Book of Circus & Book of Murder BDs/DVDs.

Not sure about Book of Murder, though.
>> ARTICLE
>  Funimation will fight tooth and nail to keep FMA

Aniplex simply won't come to the table so there's no chance of a license renewal. The only thing Funimation can do is flood the market with as many cheap releases as they can so Aniplex can't do anything worthwhile with the show.
>> ARTICLE
First Darker Than Black and now this? I mean I figure it wont affect the Australian licences of these shows, but this is still a really crappy move by Aniplex.
>> ARTICLE
What does Aniplex have to do with it? They already released it on blu-ray and let it go out of print. The article doesn't say they took the licence away so they can release it themselves.
>> ARTICLE
Just because the article doesn't say it doesn't mean it's not true. [There was another article discussing this issue at length that attributes Aniplex to what's happening.](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2016-01-25/.97940)

And considering that two titles produced by Aniplex are not being renewed by Funimation despite their popularity so close together is really suspicious.

>> ARTICLE
Oh boy. Oh dear. 

If by some miracle Baccano! gets a remake/second season and a dub, will Aniplex come back to Funimation? Because I honestly can't picture anyone besides the original dub VAs as the characters. 
>> ARTICLE
God i hope so. The English vas is what made Baccano come to life for me.
>> ARTICLE
On a related note: I'm guessing that Aniplex-US's acquiring of anime rights from other US companies might be the reason we still haven't seen the newest Black Butler season/OVAs get dubbed by Funi yet. 

Besides that, Funi may also lose the rights to: Birdy the Mighty Decode, FMA, Guilty Crown, Sekirei and Shiki - if this trend continues. And according to this MAL post, [there are plenty more licenses (active and expired) to watch out for from other NA distributors](http://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=781052).

You can still find it on [Rightstuf](http://www.rightstufanime.com/search?keywords=darker%20than%20black) and elsewhere for the time being, but they'll certainly run out of stock soon. 
>> ARTICLE
>You can still find it on Rightstuf and elsewhere for the time being

Yeah, I think I read that Funimation has 6 months to sell off whatever remaining stock they have after the license expires. So new discs should still be out there (and I'm not sure if Funi is selling them on their site), but just look around a bit, before it's too late.

I was eventually going to get around to it because I've heard so much good about it. This expiry just forced my hand is all. And it also convinced me to just properly purge stuff in my currently watching list to my on-hold list if I haven't touched an episode in a few months and it's a show that's not currently airing.

Wow I literally just got my 2011 Aniplex Bluray set in the mail off of EBay earlier today and while I hope Aniplex gives it a full-on all the bells and whistles type release this time around(assuming that's what's happening) I'm not looking forward to having to pay Aniplex prices.

I don't believe so as Funimation is a North American company and Aniplex is (as far as I know) only has an American subsidiary.

How is Baccano! "underwatched"?

In terms of popularity, it is at #55 on MAL. 




>> ARTICLE
Seriously. It's like the third thing people watch after they decide they want to get more into anime. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah sorry I got the wrong impression there
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I can answer this without being biased, since I unabashedly love Baccano! (favorite anime) and have read all the light novels and am at the forefront of the crowd saying it deserves a reboot/second season. 

That being said, I'm open to questions if you have them.  
>> ARTICLE
upvoted
>> ARTICLE
I went into Baccano with such high expectations from this sub...they were met and more for me :p

Crazy cast of colourful characters that were just fun. Not to mention the shipping and intensity were just great!
>> ARTICLE
>It is good but it isn't great. I feel like it could've been better with more episodes. 

>we didn't get enough development or background

That's actually the same criticism that most people take against it, myself included.


>> ARTICLE
I loved the non-linearity of the storytelling. As far as storytelling went, it was very effective, and one of the better anime as far as that goes.

The main issue most people seem to have with it is the characters, and I can agree to an extent that I liked all of them, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when you like all the characters, perhaps they're a bit too similar. Another argument is that there are too many characters. I think this is a bad argument, because almost all of the characters play a role in the story. A good example of too many characters being negative is in TTGL where there are literal red shirts with no personality. The characters in Baccano all had personality, even if their progression wasn't noticeable.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's very overrated. Personally, I have it as a 4/10 on MAL.

There were too many characters, almost all of whom got little-to-no character development. In my opinion, constantly jumping around in time did way more to obfuscate the story than to serve in telling it more effectively. Especially with all of the random plot elements that are constantly being thrown into the mix as the anime goes on, it feels like it's supposed to be building towards a brilliantly crafted ending which pulls everything together, but it absolutely doesn't.

Finally, every single piece of gangster-related media I've watched has been better than Baccano. If you're going to make a piece of fiction based on gangsters, you have a lot to live up to...The Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, The Departed, Pulp Fiction, etc. 

I know people love to dig into this anime, and maybe the light novel it's based on deserves that kind of attention, but I don't think what's on screen is worthy of all of the rave reviews it gets.
>> ARTICLE
>feels like it's supposed to be building towards a brilliantly crafted ending which pulls everything together, but it absolutely doesn't.

I'm comparing it to Durarara since I watched it first and its similar, what Durarara has and Baccano doesn't particularly have is conclusion where everyone connects to each other
>> ARTICLE
they're the same universe ([](/s "two of the baccano characters show up in DRRR, Mikado's password is baccano")) which is why they seem similar to you, the difference being that Baccano had 1 arc done in 1 cour an drrr's in its 5th atm. 
>> ARTICLE
Simply a problem of having something fully adapted vs not.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't get talked enough about in the mainstream to be overrated. Things like FMA:B and Death Note are far more overrated. You can say you were let down, but to admit it's underwatched but still overrated in the same sentence doesn't make any sense.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed it but felt Durarara! Did the style better and was overall just more enjoyable. 
>> ARTICLE
Baccano and Durarara are interchangeable for the most part. You've seen one, you've halfway seen the other.
>> ARTICLE
I felt like there were too many characters that didn't really serve a purpose. Dallas/Eve Genoard, the newspaper guys, and even Firo did pretty much nothing to advance the plot.
>> ARTICLE
>  even Firo did pretty much nothing to advance the plot.

[Well](/s "until he go to shine in the end and not to mention be a total cool guy extraordinaire plus getting a homunculus to fall in love with him ;)")

He was definitely cool. But cool =/= important.
>> ARTICLE
I listed 2 other things other than cool that he did :p

Also hard to be too important when you're not on the train! 

>> ARTICLE
That's kind of my point. All of the plot was on the train, effectively making everybody not on it pointless.
>> ARTICLE
I'd agree to less important but pointless? Idk if I feel the same way.
>> ARTICLE
You're right. Pointless is probably too strong a word. I just get irritated when side characters are billed as main characters. Makes me feel like they should have been way more involved than they were.
>> ARTICLE
Well that'll happen when you have over 10 main characters without actually having a main character  :p
>> ARTICLE
_Maybe I shouldn't try to finish Durarara, then._
>> ARTICLE
After YZQ it may be for the best haha I feel that they're similar in ways!
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure that had there been sequels firo would have played a bigger part, also it's Dallas's constant fucking up that starts most of the mess the cast is in.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I figured. I just chalked it up to "they were probably more important later on." Still bugged me.
>> ARTICLE
Firo is the everyman self-insert character for viewers. Like the little girl says in the first episode, he's "main character-ish". Firo is intended to be a little bland; his purpose in the show isn't to drive the plot, but to be a more or less normal, decent guy around whom insane things are happening. His presence keeps the story grounded and provides a perspective with which viewers can identify.
>> ARTICLE
But he wasn't even around that much. He actually had the least amount of screen time out of all of the other "main characters."

And they never even explained who that little girl was.
>> ARTICLE
She's an assistant/ward of the newspaper's Vice President. The two of them aren't directly relevant to the story. They're the ones telling it.
>> ARTICLE
This may not be an answer you are looking for but if you rate it as say a 7 and its average rating is higher than that, then, yes it is over-rated. But for someone who rates it as a 10 but the average rating is lower, then they would say it is under-rated.  It's average rating is an accurate average rating for what all the people who rate it as.  Even if you aren't using any kind of MAL statistic, the general premise stays the same, if you didn't like it that much compared to most other people, they you would think its over-rated. Conversely, if someone thinks its a masterpiece, but people generally think its just very good, then they would say people under-rate it.
>> ARTICLE
The characters were the weakest part of the show for me. I personally don't like it anywhere near as much as other people :p
>> ARTICLE
I honestly dropped it at 2 1/2 episodes in. Couldn't get into it at all.
>> ARTICLE
The dub is great and if you really want an easier way to piece together the story, I would say dub. The accents are pretty spot on and it's filled with really great performances. However, the voices in the sub are also magnificent. It's mostly personal preference.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I always thought the general consensus was to watch the dub.  That's what I heard when I watched it.  Anyways the dub was excellently done.  It's set it in the west so English voices also makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
Subs for some, miniature American flags for others.

I always pick sub, but I did like Maria's sub, so my suggestion is if you've started it subbed already, just try watching the next episode dubbed and choose which you want.

I think on this board, everything except Black Lagoon is pretty much sub consensus (I prefer the sub even then though...)
>> ARTICLE
Nice Simpsons reference! 
>> ARTICLE
Subs, mainly because of Isaac and Miria. It's just not the same dubbed.

EDIT: Just saw that you don't like Miria's voice. I actually felt the same way at first, but their shenanigans later on made me completely forget about that. The VAs for those two have really amazing synergy.

Up to you though, the dub is good too.
>> ARTICLE
Miria and Isaac are just hilarious in Japanese!

>Ne, ne, Isaacu.

>Nandai, Miria?

>SUGOI, ISAACU!
>> ARTICLE
easily the best couple.
>> ARTICLE
I would say dub here. The setting is late 1920s early 1930s Chicago and New York. Part of it is that the characters speaking in English makes more sense, but on top of that, each character is given an accent of sorts to make the voices sound more authentic (despite the accents being totally fake). In my opinion, the dub adds to the overall fun of the show, but that is subjective and really depends what your preference is.
>> ARTICLE
I'm usually hardcore sub (baccano is just as good in my opinion) but I think the 20s NY and Chicago accents in the dub (as cheesy as it is) really do add a lot to the overall setting. 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Baccano the other day - brilliant anime btw - and I watched the sub. I can't say I had any problems with the voices personally, but yes, high-pitched, screaming Japanese women can be a bit troublesome. I didn't have a problem with Miria though. If you really can't stand her then I would try the dub, because she's a regular character.

I have only seen the dub, so I can't compare, but the dub was excellent. And I mostly watch subs.

I loved the dub.

The Dub for Baccano is great

England = DBZ

Old as fuck, has many plot holes, past its prime, yet still manages to stay relevant

You can also categorize DBZ as Australian since most of the show takes place in [craggy, desert like areas with rocky, green peppered throughout.](https://www.scottleggo.com/skin/frontend/default/scottleggoimages/images/fashion/b4.jpg)

I think DBZ is to over the top for Britain.

no, I suspect that most of British humour just goes whoosh over your head.

But then again I like romcoms so.... I agree with your point, but not your justification.
>> ARTICLE
Justification for British humor being self depricating (not all of it just a lot): I'm British and have seen a lot of comedians live, we insult our best mates and ourselves in regular conversation and laugh about it, and I was watching The last leg just before writing this. When u watch a show like blackadder or the office the MCS are always getting taken down a peg and are rarely successful. Stephen Fry and Ricky Gervais have pretty much said the same thing in interviews in the USWhen asked about British humor

In the Netherlands, people consider their country to be small, often adding "for such a small country" to their praises when the Netherlands achieves something. However, the Dutch have actually had a fair amount of influence on history, from writing [a declaration of independence] that possibly inspired that of America, to having been a powerful trade nation with colonies in Indonesia and America. They even survived World War I by staying neutral, thus relying on wit instead of strength.

Detective Conan is such an underappreciated anime. Any ideas why that's the case? I can only come up with the bad English dub and the horrible change of names...
>> ARTICLE
The reason I don't appreciate it is because it is ridiculously long with very little plot developement. Sure, the random mysteries are fun, but after 700 chapters or so I realized that I was just wasting my time on a story that wouldn't finish. 
It's only my opinion of course, but without main plot development I think there's a limit to how long a series can run. For me, DC crossed it.
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree, the lack of a central plot makes it a tough one to watch every single episode of, but the random mysteries are fun and I enjoy going back to it every once in a while. For me its about an anime that hasn't really changed much since my childhood, which you can take to be a good or bad thing haha.

definitely one of the best examples of the dub fitting the show better because of it's setting . 
>> ARTICLE
The dub definitely gives more of the 1930s feel than the sub. Even though the voice actors in the sub did a great job, the dub has something that the sub doesnt.
>> ARTICLE
I have no doubt that the seiyuu cast was great , that said though there's something to be said about american gangsters sounding like american gangsters .
>> ARTICLE
That's probably true but I just can't get used to dubs no matter how good they are. I tried watching the Cowboy Bebop dub because everyone said it was better than the sub but I couldn't get used to it at all.
>> ARTICLE
I've personally watched both the sub and dub. The sub did very well with its voice acting, but I really do prefer the sub due to the accents and the feel of it. I totally understand where you're coming from though and the sub doesn't take much from the experience. I suggest that you try watching the first 2 or 3 episodes of the sub to get a feel for it and if it ain't your cup of tea switch to the sub.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely agree. I haven't watched the sub, so I can't directly compare, but with the dub you get this extra level of authenticity with all of the 1930s mid-Atlantic accents that really enhance the narrative.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, same. It's one of the first shows I recommend to anyone.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano! is one of my beginner anime recommendations to adults as well. It doesn't suffer from many of the bad tropes that outsiders think of when they hear anime (forced cuteness, loli, stiff animation, etc.) and the dub is fantastic. Whenever someone asks for a great dub, Baccano! is my go-to recommendation. Having all the regional dialects adds a lot to the world building and atmosphere of the narrative that you just don't get in the original, even with the Japanese cast being great.


Baccano!'s only major flaw is the overly erratic nature of the narrative structure. Not only does it have several plotlines following a large cast of characters, it also keeps jump around in time. They could have made the transitions smoother and clearer. That said, I still loved Baccano! To anyone interested in watching this anime, make sure to watch the 3 OVAs, as they conclude a few of the threads.


I wrote a [full review on my site here.](http://nefariousreviews.com/2015/01/05/baccano-anime-review/)
>> ARTICLE
Indeed, the nonlinear plotline with three different plots and timelines does act like a double edged sword through out the whole show, but I think that, even with some of the confusion, it was able to wrap the story lines all together quite nicely
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it did resolve them well. But there are points in the middle where it doesn't make sense until a few episodes later.
>> ARTICLE
IMO; I'm not an anime Noobie or anything and it's tough to get into Baccano! It's so chaotic. I watched 3-4 episodes with some friends and it was tough. For someone who is new to anime, this would be absolutely brutal.
>> ARTICLE
It is very chaotic. Definitely not for everyone, especially for those who enjoy a linear storyline instead of a nonlinear one. Have you watched Durarara! and the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya? 
>> ARTICLE
I have not watched Durarara! but have watched MoHS and DoHS. Show was entertaining, movie was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Both Drrr! And MoHS have some unique ways of story telling in that both jump around in timelines and Drrr! has different storylines that connect similar to the way Baccano! does. I'm surprised that you didn't find Haruhi chaotic and difficult to watch like Baccano! (depending on the way you watched DoHS of course)
>> ARTICLE
I watched MoHS in actual chronological order. I watched it maybe a year and a half ago and the torrent I found had it episodes in chronological order.
>> ARTICLE
And after you've finished Baccano! watch Durarara!! and then X2 the fun never ends!
>> ARTICLE
Wow great job! Great first post, it was a good read.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamit, I was *just* about to copy/paste my huge block of text into a [WT!] on Baccano. I'm glad this is well-written though, nicely done!

Also, I think it looks nicer in the title if you just keep it as "What First? Baccano!" Without the colon in between. :P
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I'm glad that you liked it. I feel bad now since you took the time to do that :(
I'm interested in what you thought of the show, also thanks for the advice. It does look better without the colon inbetween
>> ARTICLE
Well, without breaking into a long-ass post, it was downright amazing and one of the best anime yet created. Seriously underrated and *really* deserving of a Season 2.
>> ARTICLE
I heard about Baccano when I was getting back into anime. Before then I barely watched any, but I wanted to get back into the hobby. Baccano was ranked 52 on MAL so I thought it was going to be amazing. 52 out of thousands of shows.

Then I saw it and thought it was **garbage**. 

Now, I tried really, really hard to like it. It's a 13 episode show. That's nearly 5 hours of investment. I was just bored the whole time. The characters were one-dimensional, the story was nonsense and had no goal. This is the Netflix description:

>Blending sci-fi and pulp fiction to create an entertaining saga unlike any other, this action-packed anime series revolves around the exploits of a group of immortal 18th-century alchemists currently living as Prohibition-era gangsters.

That description is so much better than the actual show. I've watched a lot more shows since then and I still think it's a bad. 


>> ARTICLE
You probably watched the dub.  IMO, the sub is better.  Not all stories have goals.  Descriptions can be misleading and wrong.  You probably hated Napoleon Dynamite too, didn't you.
>> ARTICLE
The dub is more sincere since it's going for this authentic, Prohibition era America.

A story without a clear goal is uninteresting unless you've got some amazing characters to keep me invested. Except, Baccano didn't have that. It spread its character development thin so the cast was incredibly one-dimensional and irritating.

Yo, Napoleon Dynamite was great. It was a down to earth story about nothing. It didn't have the ambition of Baccano. Ambition means higher expecations.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think voice acting completely makes the show garbage (unless it's something like Ghost Stories). It just makes a better viewing experience. If course this is an my opinion 
>> ARTICLE

UTS videos are always quality. Definitely deserves more eyes on his work.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic video, it definitely mirrors my own thoughts! As a fan of Tarantino's early work and a lover of cinema in general, I absolutely adore Baccano! It's pretty much everything I want from an anime, over-the-top action, a diverse and eclectic cast and a reasonably simple story that presents itself in an interesting way. It takes inspiration from quite a bit of Western film (in addition to Tarantino and Guy Ritchie's work it also feels very reminiscent of The Untouchables) while also taking the time to challenge anime viewers on their expectations on how a story should be told. Also agree you MUST watch this show in English to fully appreciate the tone and setting of Baccano!
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad he made a comment about the Tarantino reference - while its a great way to interest people in the series, I don't think its a particularly apt descriptor.

Also hyped for the LN's this month!
>> ARTICLE
I recall I tried to get into Baccano back when I was in highschool but I sadly just didn't really like the first episode much. But despite being initially uninterested in it due to not liking Baccano, I grew to fucking LOVE Durarara!! when I watched it on Netflix. I guess it's because that show did a better job pulling me into the world with Masaomi introducing his friend Mikado to the Japan district of Ikebukuro as it made me want to know more about Shizuo, Celty, and JYB's initially mysterious character Izaya. I guess I found that more gripping than that guy and little girl talking about what is main character material. Nonetheless, considering how much I loved Durarara!! to the point that it's one of my favorite anime, I'm more than willing to give Baccano a second chance, likely when it shows up on Netflix or even Toonami.

That's an android, or cyborg (never sure of what's the difference).

A robot should look, and act, like Speedwagon. *Speedwabot*?
>> ARTICLE
Android: humanoid robot meant to look, act, and have abilities similar to those of a real flesh-and-blood human. Androids are typically used in fiction to do the jobs that are either too dangerous for humans or jobs that humans wouldn't want because they are too menial (like a janitor or mechanic)

Cyborg: human that has had mechanical or computerized augmentations installed in place of or in addition to their organic limbs. These augmentations are usually explained as prosthetics. The major difference between mechanical prosthetics and a cyborg is the including of some sort of cybernetic or computerized component. Edward Elric (Fullmetal Alchemist) is not a cyborg, while Batou (Ghost in the Shell) is.

>> ARTICLE
BACCANO!!
>> ARTICLE
yup just finished the first episode. I'm moving towards the second, confusing as fuck but I like the voices and people all say really good things about it.
>> ARTICLE
You'll be confused until the end of the 3rd episode, everything begins coming together.

Baccano's english dub works so well because of the setting, Prohibitionist America. This was a time of massive immigration to the US. The Irish, Italians and many Europeans made their way to the US at this time. It is very difficult to pick up on accents in Japanese. The english dub just makes sense. 
>> ARTICLE
This is what I have been told (in regards to why the dub is so damn good) and really for all the confusing time line thing I really want to see this show to the end. At least so I can have a moment when everything clicks into place and I understand. I expect that it will be satisfying.
>> ARTICLE
It will all come together. Don't worry. My friend gave up on it and I can't seem to convince him to keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
The confusing nonlinear narrative was overshadowed by my desire to see what Issac and Miria will do next.  I couldn't get enough of those two.
>> ARTICLE
Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, for Funimation's extremely creative and filthy adaptation of the dialogue.

Darker than Black was a very decent dub as well. I prefer characters like Gai and November 11 to have distinctive accents.
>> ARTICLE
I watched psg subed, but stockers voice actor is one of my absolute favorites so i am going to watch in english. I hope its as crude as the sub.  Im a bit fearful however.. and DtB was pretty good. I need to finish that show. But i have to look up chronilogical order. (Is it season 1, ova, season 2?   Even though ova released later?)
>> ARTICLE
Panty & Stocking is amazing dubebd. I suggest watching it in Japanese first though because it makes it funnier when there's jokes in English where there were none in Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
>Jamie Marchi's extremely creative and filthy adaptation of the dialogue.

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. PSG was actually made even funnier by the dub IMO. Definitely one that needs to be watched in English. 
>> ARTICLE
I would put forth the theory that panty and stocking is actually an american show that was dubbed into japanese, then the original english was destroyed. 
>> ARTICLE
It all depends on personal taste. The only shows I can think of that are straight up better in english are Cowboy Bebop and Baccano. There are plenty of other great dubs, but it's all preference.

That said, Trigun, Samurai Champloo, Steins;Gate, and many other anime have great dubs that are just as enjoyable as the subs.
>> ARTICLE
This.  Its all how you preceive it.  I watched HSoTD subbed and dubbed. It was more believeable dialogue in the sub.  Idk, some things are so corny dubbed it seems, like it gets lost in translation
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if I'm weird but I really like the english dub to Fullmetal Alchemist and FMA:Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
FMAB has the best dubs imo.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the dub of FMA:Brotherhood.

My personal stance is to watch the anime in the language of it's setting. Amestris is an English-speaking country (as evident by their documents) so I watched it in English, along with Baccano!! which took place in America.

Also, it gives me an excuse to watch it again in Japanese!
>> ARTICLE
I too, am more comfortable seeing predominantly anglophone caucasian characters speaking English than Japanese. I guess it's probably 50/50 for me in terms of anime situated in a Japanese speaking environment. Of course the Japanese actors probably nail it better than English ones, but unless the dubs have really irksome voices, I'd rather not spend a disproportionate amount of time and attention reading text at the bottom of the screen when I could just sit back and enjoy the actual artwork more. 
>> ARTICLE
That is true. It really is a different experience, watching and reading or simply watching in your native language. What I do (since I'm studying Japanese) is I read the subtitle really quickly and pay close attention to the words they say to try and make connections between words I recognize, words I don't, meaning, sentence structure etc. and I pay attention to the artwork as well.
>> ARTICLE
I think I probably picked up a few phrases in Japanese where even though I don't know exactly what they mean, I dont need to see the subtitles because they are so commonly said. 
>> ARTICLE
Nope not weird at all I've heard the dub and it's very good. But I read the manga and I think I should give myself sometime before I go to the anime.
>> ARTICLE
You're kidding right? 

The dub was excellent so liking it isn't weird at all.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know - I saw a clip of Mustang in the FMA:B dub and didn't feel like watching any more. Everybody else seemed fine, though, particularly King Bradley.
>> ARTICLE
I saw literally no problems with his voice, and this was after I've already seen the sub. 
>> ARTICLE
Mustang's dub voice had a "tough guy" gruffness that sounded affected to me. The clip I saw was [FMA:B 19](/s "Mustang burning Lust"), which was pretty much perfect with the Japanese voices.
>> ARTICLE
lol fma and dbz are the only animes i think were good dubbed
>> ARTICLE
Surprised to see GitS:SAC not mentioned yet.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, for some reason I can't really get into the sub, though I use subs for every other show I've seen. I wonder why that is.
>> ARTICLE
Another show on my list, I've already seen the first movie. I watched it dubbed and subbed (I really loved it). Are the voice actors the same for the show?
>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf and Eden of the East both have excellent English dubs, I recommend both of them.
>> ARTICLE
I Agree, I actually liked Holo's english voice (braces for hate) better than her japanese one. Overall I just thought Brina Palincia's voice did a lot more to bring out Holo's smart ass "I'm better than you" attitude.
>> ARTICLE
Its a witty, powerful, amd playful voice all in one.  Here voice was perfect for the character personality
>> ARTICLE
Yeah holos English voice fit her personality a lot better 
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat. I felt her Japanese voice, while good, felt too typical 'moe' while her english voice brought out her attitude strongly.

ahhh its about racing? I don't know. But I'll look at a trailer and see if I think it's interesting. Thanks.

Okay the animation looks great but really there's a dog in a car. That shit looks crazy. I'm gonna have to give it a shot now. You've convinced me to put it on my list.

I bought it for ten bucks when it first came out. It's one of those movies you just NEED to own.

Hellsing Ultimate has a very good English dub. I don't know if I'd recommend it over the Japanese dub, but either way works.

Only through episode 8. I don't think 9 or 10 have officially been picked up.

I didn't mind watching Durarara and Eden of the East in dubs.
>> ARTICLE
Durarara may have had some great voice actors for shizuo, izaya, etc etc but I remember thinking one more second of mikado's voice and I'm going to kill myself.
>> ARTICLE
His voice reminded me of the american Shinji.

I liked Suzumiya Haruhi dubbed, it made Kyon's voice and narration so much more realistic. 

SHOOT ME, OKAY? 
>> ARTICLE
I loooved Kyon's english dub voice.
>> ARTICLE
Hands down, Baccano! The way they incorporate the accents into the characters in with the setting just fits. 

Also, I prefer Spice and Wolf in English over Japanese, but that's just me. FMA:B also has a really good dub, but I wouldn't say that I like it more than the sub. I think I like them both the same.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people have recommended Spice and Wolf. I feel like I have to at least give it a chance now. Thanks for your help.
>> ARTICLE
Also if you like it, the entire series on blu-ray is on sale on amazon for $40! (I have this faint hope that if they sell enough they might make a third season.)
>> ARTICLE
Well I'll check out some episodes in the next few days. If I really like it then I might as well buy it, but I have watch it first.
>> ARTICLE
You should! It's really different but really good.
>> ARTICLE
As a huge supporter of dubs, I'd say most anime are worth seeing in English. Most of the time they're at least on par with the original voice track, especially in recent years.

Then there are a few that really blew me away:

- FLCL: Said to have one of the best dubs ever, and for good reason. They manage to retain most of the jokes, and the VAs are pitch perfect. Honestly, it almost sounds like the seiyuus if they had spoken English!

- Paranoia Agent: Like FLCL, all of the voices just seemed to click. If I didn't know better, I'd have thought it was developed State-side. It's just that natural-sounding.

- Code Geass: The sub had some seiyuu greats, sure, but the English cast gave a spectacular performance. They did a great job maintaining the hamminess, namely in Lelouch and Jeremiah. (Johnny Yong Bosch and Crispin Freeman are two of my favourite VAs because of this show.) In a really talkative show, I think not having to pause to read long explanations is a good thing :)

Just about the only dub that sort of disappointed me was Clannad's, mostly for who they cast as Sunohara and a lack of emotion in some parts. Which is funny, because the same cast worked wonders for the Angel Beats dub.
>> ARTICLE
Hm well Code Geass is already on my list of what to watch. I do plan on watching the dub (most people seem to think it was good). I've already watched Clannad and the After story subbed. You are the first person to recommend Paranoia Agent in English or FLCL (at all really). I think I'll watch one episode of Paranoia Agent in Japanese and the other in English, because of how critically acclaimed Paranoia Agent is I really want to enjoy it. lol as far as FLCL goes I don't know people have said a lot about FLCL and it seems like a complete mind fuck. But I will check it out, Thanks for the help.

No problem. I didn't include these cause they're usually frowned upon for being "mainstream" and whatnot but [Naruto,](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20/Naruto) [One Piece (Funimation)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21/One_Piece), and [Bleach](http://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach) were quite enjoyable. Some voices aren't up to par like Asuma (Naurto), Franky (One Piece), and Aokiji (One Piece) but they don't detract the series in any way.
>> ARTICLE
I really do adore One Piece but I cannot deal with the dub even the funimation dub. I understand and accept that it is far better than the 4Kids dub, but compared to the Japanese voice cast they fall short. I really did like the Bleach anime but like most people I couldn't continue because of the fillers, so I have gone back to the manga. And well Naruto is good but I've never really been able to get in to this show, no matter how much my brother insists that it is the greatest thing ever, so I've been avoiding naruto (though I do think the manga is far greater than the show).
>> ARTICLE
I actually just started reading the manga and it has way more gore than the anime. It's a shame they toned it down. It could've been like a Black Lagoon with heads being decapitated and such.
>> ARTICLE
lol which one are you talking about? One Piece, Bleach, or Naruto because I think we can safely say that for the each one the Manga does have more gore. 
>> ARTICLE
Naruto. Haven't read any other manga.
>> ARTICLE
Ah well it's been a while since I've picked up the Naruto manga but I definitely enjoyed it. 
>> ARTICLE
I would also recommend Full metal panic and RahXephon.

Oh my god. Beck in japanese!

What's it sound like? I didn't watch it subbed.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass. Fits the setting perfectly, and Johnny Young Bosch does a damn good performance. I actually prefer him to the Japanese VA.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! I have Code Geass on my plan to watch list on MAL. I won't be getting to it yet because there's so much hype behind the show and I really want to like it. I think I'm gonna wait until I'm in the right mood to watch this.

El Hazard. It's pretty much the only anime with a dub that has better voice acting than the original.

Ghost Stories was rewritten as a comedy for the dub and turned out much better than the shitty original.

That's your own opinion. Some people may find dubbed anime superior to subbed.
>> ARTICLE
Tolerance. It's a wonderful thing. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh I already watched the entire series subbed. I I finished it far to recently to give it another look right now. Besides I disliked Kurisu or Makise or whatever the hell her name was. She irked me.
>> ARTICLE
you disliked kuristina? How?
>> ARTICLE
I don't really know what it is about her, I just had this instant dislike. I mean I spent the majority of the time she was on screen wishing that she would die, or zapped, or abducted never to be seen from again. I liked the show and I loved the other characters but SHE just made me cringe. Although I accept that others like/love her character, she didn't do it for me.
>> ARTICLE
She died in the first episode.

There. Now you can enjoy the show knowing that your wish has been granted.
>> ARTICLE
I totally respect your opinion, but you are the first person I have ever seen that didnt like her. I guess that statistically she would have to be hated by someone, but wow.

What does [this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bf0aYBk0OQ) sound like in the Eng dub?

Oh god. I've been holding off on Steins;Gate in the hopes I could get the VN working some day, but I think this clip has finally broken my will.

The dub is excellent but it's not as good as the Japanese. Miyano's Okabe is probably the best voice acting I've ever heard.
>> ARTICLE
>it's not as good as the Japanese.

I don't know man. Tatum is awesome but not quite on Miyano's outrageous level, I must admit; but I can't help but enjoy the dub more. Cherami Leigh made me like Suzuha much more, Trina Nishimura did a fantastic job as Kurisu, and the chick who played Mayuri did great (This scene is awesome http://youtu.be/_mslZSL9Z84) 
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats, Cowboy Bebop, Black Lagoon, and Desert Punk all have great English dubs.
>> ARTICLE
I saw Desert Punk on netflix a while ago but couldn't get past the first episode. it was really hard for me to care at all about the show, but I had heard really good things about it. I left that one disappointed. Do you think is it worth giving another try? And if I do give it one more go how many episodes should I give it before I consider dropping it?
>> ARTICLE
Desert Punk really picks up during the second half of the series. Trust me, Rain Spider makes the series worth it.
>> ARTICLE
These are good (along with my experience of both):

* Spice and Wolf (full in dub, a few episodes in sub)

* Code Geass (full in dub, R1 in sub)

* Death Note (full in dub, very little sub)

* Steins;Gate (full in dub and sub)

Although I don't know that I'd *definitely* recommend them in English dub. They all have some plusses and minuses. I would say that you aren't missing much, if anything at all, by watching them in English.

Now, the Steins;Gate dub is pretty good, but frankly the original was better. The English VAs *were* good, don't get me wrong, but the original VAs were *perfect*. IMO, a couple of the main characters just couldn't be matched. So you'll get a good performance with the dub, and a great one with sub. The flip side is that the show is kind of complicated and had a lot of stuff that you need to remember and some important information in one-off remarks or hidden inside complicated/dramatic phrasology. I watched the sub first and found myself constantly backing up to re-hear what was said. The dub was definitely a smoother ride than the sub. I could definitely recommend the dub for this show, but it depends on exactly what your experience and priorities are before I would do so.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Death Note years ago and I don't know if it's worth picking up, what's your opinion?. Code Geass is on my plan to watch list, but Spice and Wolf? i think I've seen fan art work and some stills from the show and it didn't really catch my attention. How long is it? Did you think it was worth the time you put into it?
>> ARTICLE
It depends on what you're looking for.

Death Note is completely a logical reasoning show. The genius is in watching two people, putting yourself into the show, and watching how they are *practically* going at it mentally. If you aren't interested in watching two people think, the show is probably only moderately entertaining. There's also a side story of watching a well-meaning young man spiral downwards, so there's a moral/sad-drama tone too.

Spice and Wolf is kind of interesting. The two biggest draws (for me) were the "quipy" dialog (watching Holo's attitude combine with Lawrence's semi-indifference amused me) and the business strategy. The latter point is similar to Death Note: You watch as someone analyzes a situation and tries to think through it from a business strategy standpoint, watch things go right and wrong, and watch other people try to out-smart him. If you like getting into the head of someone who's rationally reasoning through something and understanding exactly what they're doing, why they're doing it, and their contingency plans, both are good shows. If you don't, neither is likely to interest you much.

Spice and Wolf was worth the time I put into it. It's two standard half-length seasons and a couple OVAs, but I'm pretty sure you can quit after Season 1 and still feel like you finished a story arc. I *will* admit it was a little slow at times, but overall it was a good show.

Code Geass has some of that type of thinking too. You see into the strategic mindset of a lot of people. But there are too many stratigic Deus Ex Machine to list it as being as strategy-oriented as the previous two. I liked it and it's one of my favorite shows, but you can kind of gloss over the "if I do X he'll know Y and then realize I know Z" type inner monologues and still enjoy the show. You can't with the first two.

That's just my opinion on them, though. :-)
>> ARTICLE
I see, well you have kind of sold me on picking up Death Note again. I think I'll put Spice and Wolf on my list, but watch after I've gone through the shows that I really want to watch. Of Course Code Geass is already there with all the hype it seems like I would have to be insane to not watch it. Thank you for the added detail.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like a plan. Feel free to complain later if you think I mislead you. :-)

You'll be the first to know if I'm dissatisfied. Thanks again.

takes a while to get used to though. Jun is just too good at playing lelouch that J.Y.B had some pretty big shoes to fill. it's a good dub though.

Highschool of the Dead has an awesome dub. (HotD)

yeah I gave up on high school of the dead. I got to episode 3 and I couldn't go any further. The fan service was kind of distracting, and I'm fairly chill when it comes to things like this. I can deal with the overly cute, and the ridiculous bust sizes but high school of the dead took fan service to place not even I could go. But thanks for the help.

Well honestly it's probably never really gonna be a priority. I really hate dropping shows, particularly ones with a good sized fan base because I know quite a few people see something good in that show. And I'm always willing to take someones advice on picking a show back up, I mean was encouraged to pick up Death Note again. The thing is when talking about a show to its fans a little bit of their enthusiasm can make the show really stand out, but when its time to pick the show up it can seem a little lackluster.
>> ARTICLE
I for one, love fanservice, and I thought HotD was over the top. So you're not alone for feeling that way

I like the Ghost in the Shell SAC dub. Outside of that dbz bebop....the usual answers.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the dub for Read or Die -The TV-, but I've never seen it in Japanese so can't really compare them. As with everything (Japanese dubs included) there are some weaker performances, but I can't fault the main cast, especially once they've settled into the role a couple of episodes in.
>> ARTICLE
Is Read or Die the tv show different than the movie? I saw the movie ages ago and liked it (lady who turns paper into weapons I think), but than I saw the cover for the tv show and it had different characters. Am I thinking of the same thing or am I completely off?
>> ARTICLE
Think of the OVAs you watched and the first half the TV series as the prequels for the second half the TV series. The storylines converge.

It has a couple of connections to the OVA (and takes place after it), but it mostly follows an entirely different set of characters.

You should, if you watch it , watch Golden Boy with English dub ... the male english voice actor for the main character sounds WAAAAAY more passionate than the japanese one ... the drawback being that all the females sounds kinda lifeless in comparison but it balances out just fine :)

[C] control - and

Shuffle! for a harem romantic comedy (gets NSFW around 18 episodes in)

K-ON! and Lucky star have good dubs for moeblobs (k-on!'s music is still in Japanese)

One Piece (funimation dub, for that is the **ONLY** dub)

and The Sci fi trilogy (Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate, and hopefully Robotics;Notes when it's done being dubbed)


>> ARTICLE
I really liked Code Geass in English Dubbed. Though some people hate it.
>> ARTICLE
A bit late, but I'm going to mention a few that I didn't see here yet.

Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman - I consider the dub much, much funnier. They really did a great job taking an amusing script and making it absolutely hilarious.

Tenchi Muyo - Some people don't like the dub, but I love it much more than the original. 
>> ARTICLE
My friend swears by the dub of Ergo Proxy. I've only seen the first two episodes but it's really good. Good show of emotion for a dub.
>> ARTICLE
Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood), Gurren Lagann, that's all I can think of, I prefer mine in Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano, Cromartie High and Cowboy Bebop
>> ARTICLE
xxxHolic (not remotely NSFW btw) is an amazing anime with great Enlgish dubs. The women who voices one of the main women is as perfect a cast as I have ever heard.

Akira is good dubbed. It's a movie though

I really like the Haruhi dub, it's like an all-star cast.

NGE, never heard the japanese for years after it was eng dub on tv.

I watched Black Lagoon in jap, the engrish was awesome. When my bro watched the dub, i was tearing my hair out slowly. I could not stand the voices.

Baccano..... that is it for me. Even Cowboy Bebop, Black Lagoon, Samuria Champloo and other popular dubs, I think are much better in Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
Other than Cowboy Bebop, Yu Yu Hakusho. Every other dub I've heard has been poor at best.
>> ARTICLE
See I would have to agree with you, but I've watched the first season of Saiyuki and a couple episodes of Baccano. Really changed my attitude, now I don't completely ignore a dub. I have to give it a try, but I thought I should consult a group of people who have probably seen a lot more anime than me. At least shows of the last few years.

>> ARTICLE
I understand but when I was building a list of shows to watch on MAL it became obvious that certain shows (according to many fans) were meant to be watched in English. I've been watching anime on and off for over a decade now and I've almost always watched the sub, but popular opinion convinced me to watch Baccano in English and it is fantastic. So I thought I should open my mind to the possibility that not all dubs are as bad as the 4Kids dub of One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
i didn't mean to say that dubs are bad. sure dubs can be great. my point was just, that through translation things get lost. so if you could understand it in original, watch it in original. but i suppose most of us can't understand anime in japanese, so subs and dubs are neccessary.

i'm not that good in writing what i mean, i hope it gets conveyed better now?

Oh no I understand exactly where you are coming from. It's why I've always preferred subbed and only dealt with dubs when I had no choice (watching Yu Gi Oh as a teenager). But certain shows have shown me that I may be missing out on a great experience which is why I'm asking this question. And really thank you for your reply.
>> ARTICLE
seems like i have the same attitude as your past self \^^

what is it then that makes that experience great, if i may ask? i'm interested in what i may miss. or should i just watch it myself to understand? truth be told, i don't want to waste time by watching something for an experience i dont want :D
>> ARTICLE
Well I guess you should try it when it comes to shows set in the West: America, Canada, Britain etc. When a show gets dubbed into English they add all the colloquialisms and pop culture references that make more sense for us as viewers in English speaking countries, and for the settings/characters. Obviously if it's an anime about a samurai or a ninja (or a pirate with a straw hat!!) I would recommend the original Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
thanks \^^

i don't really watch shows which are set in the west, though... 

\\\_()_/
>> ARTICLE
lol I also have examples disproving the theory I put out. Pet shop of Horrors the dub made me want to kill my self. At the time I had no way of getting the sub so I just read the manga. Show set in New York City, dub was crap. Some people may disagree but something about that dub made me violent. So clearly I know nothing and you should really keep going as you have. If you ever feel like giving the dub of an anime a try just come back to this thread and look at all the suggestions.
>> ARTICLE
At least with subs you don't get english voice actors stumbling over japanese names.

As for OP's question: any scene with [engrish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN9GiMFWKPE) should be watched in english (similar with [jerman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kod3dXK3tW4)).

[Pokmon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Srh6pyyFs)

Pokemon ranks in the top tier of horrible dubs. Especially the newer seasons. The Japanese Va's are great IMO
>> ARTICLE
That's the joke.
>> ARTICLE
Really? Are you referring to the current seasons or the first few seasons? I'm afraid to go back to the first couple of seasons because I loved Pokemon. I think it was great but I'm not sure if it was actually good or if I'm being wistful.
>> ARTICLE
I went back to watch the first couple seasons and the show is really developed for kids and it's pretty obvious because of the dialogue. It was good nostalgia, definitely. But... it isn't something you should do if you won't enjoy the kids show feel of it. 
>> ARTICLE
I would recommend to watch everything in Japanese. 

Stop being such a lazy/dumb/ignorant idiot.
>> ARTICLE
Well you seem angry. I was asking to which show to watch in English because there seemed to be shows (like Baccano) where watching the dub made the experience better. Because of accents and pop culture references. 
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass for me; I don't usually watch anything over but I've re watched the entire series three times now.
>> ARTICLE
I'm at 3 full rewatches with a few times the last 2 to 3 episodes of season 2.
>> ARTICLE
I'm at like 7 right now...
>> ARTICLE
Same here. I think it's just one of those shows where you almost get an even greater appreciation the more you watch it; the subtle hints about [R2 Spoilers](/s "Zero Requiem") early on, the minor character development that doesn't get explicitly pointed out, and of course, all the times you try lip reading to find out C.C's real name... 
>> ARTICLE
Does the lip reading ever work? I mean wouldn't you have to lip read Japanese? 
>> ARTICLE
Since anime doesn't even animate mouth flaps other than opening and closing, nope.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched Code Geass at least twice, but mostly I rewatch some of my favorite scenes - the first episodes of both seasons and the ending make me watch it over and over...
>> ARTICLE
Most likely Dragon Ball Z. I watched it several times in French, German and Arabic as a kid and was hyped for the battles every time.

I've also watched One Piece a lot but only the first 150-200 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
The [arabic opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hTYxOmRhKA) is amazing. However the french one...
>> ARTICLE
Definitly FLCL. Better everytime I see it!
>> ARTICLE
About 7 times for me already.
>> ARTICLE
I have a hard time rewatching shows but this one Is too good not to. Only show I've ever rewatched actually. Helps that it only takes a couple hours.
>> ARTICLE
My opinion of it doubled easily on my second watch. We'll see if it keeps going like that!
>> ARTICLE
The first time I saw it, I was like: this is stupid. I don't understand anything. 4/10. A month later I had moved it up to a 7/10. Then I watched it again. This is awsome! 8/10. Then I watched it with a buddy and moved it to a 9. Now it's in my top five and I am buying a chainsaw rickenbach as soon as I can convince the props guy to build me one!
>> ARTICLE
Sounds right. There's so much to see in it.
>> ARTICLE
NGE... Should be around the 20 mark. Stopped counting.


^()^()^()^()^()^(Once I got the DVD box years back, I didn't stop re-watching.)

Mine too, but I've only seen it 4(?) times.

Holy sh#t dude.

I've rewatched the last fight of Gurren Lagann at least 10 times.

Other than that I don't usually rewatch anything.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean. For me, it's from that 11 minute mark of the last episode, when the music hits. I've watched that amazing sequence so many times. SO GOOD.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, that series.  So many amazing scenes.

King Kittan tops the list for me.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't get into to.. :( I don't know why. I've never liked mecha anime, so maybe that's a factor. I might give it another try in the future though.
>> ARTICLE
seriously try to make it through the first half. just to say you did. 
>> ARTICLE
for that show you have to not really think about anything and just go along with it,if you put it under a microscope ur gonna have a bad time,but if you dont,oh man.
>> ARTICLE
Give it another try if you can- if the mecha don't do it for you, the characters are well worth the time.
>> ARTICLE
Its so so so good. I hope you like it.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't rewatched any anime yet bcuz of my huge PTW list, but here are a few that are my top priority to rewatch.


- Golden Time
- Oregairu
- HS DxD 
- B Gata H Kei (maybe)
- WA 2
- Nagi Asu
- Nisekoi
>> ARTICLE
I just rewatched Oregairu and WA2 this month. 

Oregairu is super easy to rewatch since it's so well executed throughout that I forgot a lot of the little enjoyable details surrounding the major plot points. Even in episode 1, Yukino already says something profound: "People who don't apply even minimal effort have no right to envy those with talent. unsuccessful people are unsuccessful because they can't imagine the effort successful people have invested." This anime is gold!

White album 2 has an insane amount of foreshadowing and [spoiler](/s "you get to catch just how aware and manipulative Setsuna is the 2nd time around. (borrowing from another WA2 post, foreshadowing moments:) http://i.imgur.com/MsdE8ce.png http://i.imgur.com/VB5JxY6.png http://i.imgur.com/GRX3hLZ.png. Other awesome moments are the stills when Setsuna first goes to the karaoke room, and her reactions when she's asked to sing Todokanai koi (so heartwrenching). ")

I haven't seen the rest on your list. Knowing my love for WA2 and Oregairu, which would you reccomend I watch? Nagi Asu, Nisekoi, or Golden Time? Which particularly has a great ost? WA2 was just amazing
>> ARTICLE
In order of priorty, I would say Golden Time, Nagi Asu, and then Nisekoi. Also FYI, Golden Time seems to get quite a bit of flack on /r/anime, but ignore it. It is only due to ghost banri which is necessary to develop the plot, and was an aspect which, IMO, made the anime better.
>> ARTICLE
on episode 3 of golden time now.[s](/s "Poor linda... also... ghost banri? Did you just tell me he dies?... hahaha. This is also the 2nd Yandere I've taken notice of... I just finished future dairies last week and was wondering when I'd see one again.
edit: I love this pacing! ok just hit the ghost part... Oh no... It's happy and only episode 8... I see death flags everywhere.")
>> ARTICLE
Counter Spoilers are awesome
>> ARTICLE
sorry sorry spoiler tagged
>> ARTICLE
no no, your view of the show is wrong iirc ^^, I counter spoilered HxH the other day thinking that the Chimera arc was one thing but it was actually another.
>> ARTICLE
Oh haha! I see what you mean now by counter spoiler after figuring why he's a ghost.
>> ARTICLE
Nice, are you enjoying it so far? :)
>> ARTICLE
I marathoned the complete series last night. I loved the character interactions, animation, and OST fit nicely. I definitely enjoyed the series all the way through because of this, but [like you mentioned,](/s "I did have mixed feelings with the ghost like you might expect. For a show with great romance interactions and well grounded slice of life elements, I thought it was out of place randomly taking over his body, I think I would have preferred it if he gained his memories and feelings for Linda back and had to struggle with those emotions, so it would feel very human. Instead, the ghost completely taking over made him two separate characters and took responsibility off the other version of him plus made it hard to relate. It did make for interesting plot points though and I see what you mean by it being necessary to progress the plot. Overall I loved the show. Thanks for the rec. Onto Nisekoi tonight!")
>> ARTICLE
Glad you enjoyed it. Nisekoi is a fun watch but it's not nearly as serious as Golden Time. Nisekoi does have the fact that all the girls are extremely likeable. My favorite is probably Onodera.
>> ARTICLE
I could use a lighter romance. Golden Time had me on the edge of my seat at times and put a strain on my heart.
>> ARTICLE
In that case I wouldn't recommend watching Nagi Asu anytime soon. The feel train will hit you and just kinda linger for a good part of the series.
>> ARTICLE
I forgot I had My little monster and Tatami Galexy in my queue to watch.

I think my plan this weekend will be My little monster --> Tatami Galexy --> Nisekoi --> Nagi Asu
>> ARTICLE
Oni ChiChi franchise for me, was just about to go watch it again as well.
>> ARTICLE
How often? every night? Or are you the type of guy that likes to wait a couple of days before going again for maximum pleasure?

[Best Answer](#mandom)

Probably Cowboy Bebop, but TTGL is up there too.
>> ARTICLE
Ghost in the Shell: SAC

I can't get enough of cyberpunk. 
>> ARTICLE
Likewise, I'm not even sure how much I've rewatched it since I got the first season on dvd.
>> ARTICLE
Bakemonogatari twice, four other shows once.

Otherwise I don't rewatch shows. I sometimes get urges to do so though, but the "watching" list is always too big to have time for it.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad. Because I have extra tissue boxes I need to use. 
>> ARTICLE
Afterstory though... it hurts just thinking about it.
>> ARTICLE
Every time I see someone with a baby I tear up. That show has destroyed me.
>> ARTICLE
NGE and EoE twice so far. Planning on rewatching them many times in the future though.
>> ARTICLE
If movies count then Spirited Away, if they dont count then Fate/Zero.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann, purely from how many times I introduced it to my friends.
>> ARTICLE
Probably Eureka Seven and FMA:B.
>> ARTICLE
Ouran High School Host Club. Sometimes I need background noise when I'm depressed and doing things so I put it on for a good chuckle.
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B at almost 7 times (I'm at Baschool right now), followed by Death Note, Toradora, and Madoka Magika all at 3 each.
>> ARTICLE
I have watched Madoka Magica, Durarara!, and Black Lagoon 3 or 4 times each. The first two to pick up on stuff I missed and Black Lagoon for an adrenaline pickup/just to turn my brain off.
>> ARTICLE
Probably Serial Experiments Lain. Then again, it's kinda necessary to watch it at least a couple times in order to really get it. 
>> ARTICLE
Ranma 1/2... at least 10 times in its entirety. To include movies and OAVs. Plus the Manga, and a bunch of hentai. 
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats! Re-watched it about 5 times already. Planning a 6th one when the OVA comes out. Second would have to be Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo at 3 times.
>> ARTICLE
Kill La Kill. My hype train does not stop.
>> ARTICLE
TTGL, I can confidently say I've watched it at least 30 times.
>> ARTICLE
I got some catching up to do.
>> ARTICLE
It would have to be Shingeki no Kyojin for me. The OST and dramatic scenes always find a place in my heart. 

Gintama is on my list too, since most of these are episodic. Plus, I don't think anyone can get tired of Gin-chan's antics.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen Gundam 0080 eight times, I think, and Giant Robo seven. The long anime (like, more than 26 episodes) that I've seen the most times is Turn A Gundam, at three.
>> ARTICLE
Toradora and Cowboy Bebop (4 times each)
>> ARTICLE
Mostly with rewatches I just watch an arc or two when I'm in the mood.  For instance I've seen festival arc from Hyouka 5 times I think, but most of the standalone episodes I've never rewatched.

My most rewatched full series would be NGE at 3 (and working on number 4).
>> ARTICLE
Chitanda getting distracted over and over in the first episode of the festival arc is the funniest and most adorable thing in the world
>> ARTICLE
Rurouni Kenshin and Yu Yu Hakusho. I collected the DVDs back in the day and watched them all many times with friends.
>> ARTICLE
Sailor Moon

Cowboy Bebop

Outlaw Star

Yu Yu Hakusho

Black Butler

I have seasonal depression and I end up watching these shows constantly during the winter and early spring because they make me happy. Sailor Moon the most, for sure.
>> ARTICLE
You remind me of Toonami.
>> ARTICLE
Only in the winter.
>> ARTICLE
[Aiura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17082/Aiura)

It centers me. 
>> ARTICLE
Gunbuster and Diebuster. This series is the only anime I've watched more than once.
>> ARTICLE
I think that I've seen Mushishi, Moribito, Black Lagoon, and Samurai Champloo three times each. And YYH about 2.5 times. There are plenty that I've seen twice. Haruhi, Kino's Journey, Cowboy Bebop, Ouran, GITS, Welcome to the NHK, Baccano, and I can go on. I'm planning to rewatch LOGH and Monster sometime this year. 

 If enough time has passed, and I like the series I'll rewatch it. Or sometimes I will rewatch something if I have company.
>> ARTICLE
holy fook I was literally thinking trust and betrayal when I read the title. Serious production values on that one. I think a major factor in re-watchability is length and something that makes you want to watch other than story driven elements. Like comedy or maybe character interactions. There are probably other factors i haven't thought of tho.. 


My most re-watched series is probably akagi but i tend to skip the final act due to length.
>> ARTICLE
Mostly comedic anime like nichjou/nichibro for the sake of feeling good after work, or some ol' shonen epic moment that i used to watch back in the day.
>> ARTICLE
I go back and watch certain episodes of Hunter X Hunter 2011, and have probably rewatched the series in total around 3ish times.

Girls und Panzer, Madoka Magica, So Ro No Wo To and NGNL I rewatched once. 

Besides those I don't really rewatch stuff often.
>> ARTICLE
Tied between Kuroko's Basketball and TTGL at 4 times each. Second place goes to Trigun at 3 viewings. Love me some Kuroko.
>> ARTICLE
LOL same here, Kuroko full thing 3 times and the second season a couple more times added on.

My favorite anime pretty much ever.
>> ARTICLE
I just can't get other people to watch it T_T
>> ARTICLE
There's so many episodes yet I can never stop watching it. 
>> ARTICLE
Although I will pretty often rewatch scenes from specific episodes of a series, I almost never rewatch the entirety of the series. Exceptions include:

Sword Art Online - 3 times (have seen gleam eyes and General Eugene fights over 15 times each)

Hataraku Maou Sama - 2 times

I've watched over 110 different series not including sequels and those two are the only ones that I have rewatched. Maybe someday I might rewatch Mahouka Koukou.
>> ARTICLE
I don't have a lot of time, so I don't often re-watch stuff. 
So it's kind of a big deal that I've found time to re-watch Code Geass and Eureka 7 like once a year. 
>> ARTICLE
I've rewatched yu yu hakusho 12 times over. Chris sabats masterful voice acting for Kuwabara and justin cooks Yusuke never get old to me. Also, even if i know what's gonna happen, the plot twists always hit me hard.

Steins;Gate and Nodame Cantabile (all 3 seasons). Both are  annual rewatchs for me since I discovered them about 3 years ago. Both are short enough that rewatching them doesn't take up a lot of time, though I enjoy them for different reasons. 

A lot of people say Steins;Gate's first half is slow but I really enjoyed the way they built up suspense. That, and to me, it's time traveling done right, up there with Back to the Future and to a certain extent Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. 

Nodame Cantabile is a great relaxing music anime. Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto 2 has been my favorite piece of music before I watched Nodame Cantabile, and I absolutely loved the way they handled it in Nodame. 

Edit: I have a feeling Barakamon and Cross Game will make themselves on that list soon. I loved both anime, again, for different reasons. 
>> ARTICLE
SAO S1
>> ARTICLE
I actually very rarely rewatch anime, this might be the full list if I'm not forgetting any.

1. Mawaru Penguindrum - 4 times
2. Zero no Tsukaima - 3 times
3. Spice & Wolf - 2 times
4. Neon Genesis Evangelion, Steins;Gate - 1 time

>> ARTICLE
Why did you rewatch Zero no Tsukaima 3 times when you rated it very poorly?
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoy it for some reason, but it's still one the most cliched and repetitive shows I have ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
You rate completely different from me then. I don't give a shit if the anime is so cliche it could be considered a Disney movie. If I enjoyed it and loved the characters, it's getting a high score. Fuck Objectivity!!!^^plz ^^don't ^^hurt ^^me
>> ARTICLE
Nothing to worry about, who the hell am I to tell people how to rate their anime :p

I try to be objective when scoring to make them more useful to others as I can always remember how I personally felt about a show.
>> ARTICLE
I personally think rating subjectively would be more helpful, since it's always recommended to find reviewers who have similar tastes to you and to just look at what they liked

If your scores don't actually match what you enjoyed, then I can't easily use your scores because I have no idea if we like the same stuff
>> ARTICLE
I have had a similar mindset before, but eventually I always got to a point where our tastes would just not match anymore.

On the other hand, I have never been disappointed watching a show where I liked the premise and was critically acclaimed.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I kind of feel conflicted about rating anime. I want to rate anime objectively, I did in the beginning at least, but finally caved in and decided that I'd rather rate anime based on my enjoyment so that others can see what I really liked. If only there were two separate scores: one for enjoyment and one for rating objectively.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to think that rating based on objective artistic merit and enjoyment are linked. Enjoyment doesn't have to mean "made me happy." It can also mean "made me think," "made me sad," "made me awestruck," etc.

I'm trying to think of things I didn't enjoy but felt they had artistic merit. Maybe I just enjoy artsy stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Could be pretty convenient, would also avoid a lot of misunderstandings.

I would love that feature on MAL, I think HB has it though. I've considered moving to it, but I finally have a CSS I like on my MAL lol.

Probably Death Note and Digimon Adventure. Digimon from just watching it a shitton as a kid and Death Note because I try and get everyone I can to watch it and usually watch it with them

Probably Chobits or Love Hina.

Summer Wars and Howl's Moving Castle. I also watch episodes of Bakemonogatari in the background while I do other things.

FLCL and Lucky Star. FLCL because of it's length and Lucky Star because I like to play it in the background while i study.

Code geass and death note.

I Have always been a huge fan on the plot and twists that Code Geass had I watch it over and over.

I've watched Spirited Away too many times to remember... even watched it raw once.

I watch Lucky Star primarily for Tsukasa. Not enough love for her compared to Kagami and Konata.
>> ARTICLE
Shes so cute, i love all of them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I've actually watched a series more than twice...but the ones I have watched twice are Higurashi, Samurai Flamenco, and Durarara.

The first two because I was showing them to people, and then Durarara because I forgot what happened and wanted a reminder before the second season started.
>> ARTICLE
for some reason my most rewatched anime is Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei...well i guess that tells what type of taste i have.

That's a toss up between flcl and S-Cry-Ed. I really like both. 
>> ARTICLE
Idk about the whole series, but I watched an episode of Haruhi 8 times, i swear i chose the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
High school of the dead and soul eater are my two most watched. There the first two I made it all the way through and it started my hunger for more. 
>> ARTICLE
TTGL, easily. I've watched the last fight too many fucking times, and probably the entire series through 5 times or so.

I do try and revisit shows though after a while that I really enjoyed. 

edit: Also DBZ as a kid
>> ARTICLE
Bakemonogatari is fun to come back to. One of those shows with tons of little things you pick up on when watching multiple times.
>> ARTICLE
Probably a close one between Clannad and Toradora. Toradora because I was really depressed at the time and it was a very happy, idealistic show. Clannad I do an Annual re-watch of just to see if I can "win" I'm currently 0-6*

^(*Instead of the annual rewatch one year I played the game instead)

Cowboy Bebop, Scrapped Princess, Heroic Age (I know it isn't the best, but it hits my sci-fi nerves), Crest/Banner of the Stars, Eureka Seven.

Muthafuckin' FLCL.

I must have rewatched HxH 99 at least once a year until 2011 came out.

Death Note, Samurai Champloo, FMA Brotherhood. I've also watched the first 50 episodes of Inuyasha like 83528 times. 
>> ARTICLE
Scryed! Everytime this question gets asked I will always have the same answer. I'm probably up to 6 or 7 times now.

Full Metal Panic series
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop and the original Full Metal Alchemist. I watched those every week from like 2003-2012 on Adult Swim. Then Death Note once it started airing on AS.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen FMA:B either 3 or 4 times.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass, watched it twice. But I only got into anime last summer. There's still so much I need to watch. Just finished Devil is a Part Timer, gonna watch Spice and Wolf next. I wonder if Devil will get a second season though
>> ARTICLE
I rewatch almost every anime I like. That said, I probably watched Full Metal Panic Fumofu about 10 times and still laugh like a Madman every time. At least Amagi Brilliant Park recaptured that feeling in a few Episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Initial D. 4 times. Almost all in the span of 2 months. There's something about going back and watching the first episode that makes you watch it again.
>> ARTICLE
Naruto, 3 times, before I started to think it wasn't that good. Now I realize how many anime I could have watched instead...

After that, Slam Dunk, Rurouni Kenshin, Dragon Ball Z, and Gundam Wing are tied at 1 time.

I haven't really rewatched any more anime.

Oregairu is pretty easy to re-watch over and over again. Also I have been watching the Monogatari series all over again because Gahara-sama is best girl.

FLCL.

Since it's nice and short I try to watch it all in one sitting once every couple of years or so.
>> ARTICLE
fate zero (so many good scenes) i've rewatched it like 3 times

and sword of the stranger (not sure if it counts tbh) but i've rewatched it like 8 times and i highly recommend it because not many people seem to have seen it

FLCL, but that's because it's so... short? And I get a craving to watch it every other year.

Behind FLCL is Higurashi and Kanon 2006. Both series I have seen 4, maybe 5 times each.
>> ARTICLE
Full Metal Panic probably. I think it is about 7 times now. Spice and Wolf is next with about 5. InuYasha is after than with 3 since I used to watch it on Adult Swim all the time before I bought the DVD sets.
>> ARTICLE
Spirited Away about 20-30 times because it was the only VHS tape I had and Australia TV at that time wasn't quite great...

Even used "Spirited away" as my related text in my HSC english exam for belonging.  A little context on HSC is a like an university admission exam that you take in your final years of high school.

Movies would be Ghost in the Shell and Ninja Scroll, the tapes wore out on those two, bought Ninja Scroll on DVD and GitS I have the 25th Anniversary bluray .

Series would be Berserk, friend had them on tape and I picked it up on DVD a few years after.

Ouran High School Host Club but not like the entire series again. I normally just watch my favorite episodes when I'm feeling down and need a laugh.

Monogatari series and Kill la Kill.

Beyond that I tend to just go find a light novel translation.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte and Tokyo Ghoul. Besides there being some intelligent creatures who are against humans living in secret among them, that's where the similarities end. And while TG season 1 was good, I don't think I need to comment on Root A. Meanwhile, loved Parasyte, besides the last few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
why not the last episodes.. it was all fantastic imo
>> ARTICLE
The fight scenes are really similar and the main protagonists both have to go through a similar acceptance of their new situation over the course of the story. They're not as similar as some people make them out to be, but I think you're underselling it now.
>> ARTICLE
I don't get why they're lumped together either, one is a complete, faithful adaptation with great animation. While the other is a butchered, watered down mess that too many people like
>> ARTICLE
The people who like TG are the ones who like the manga, which is by far the best manga i have read personally. But yeah, anime sucks
>> ARTICLE
I'd say the opposite.  The people who *hate* TG are the ones who've read the manga.  The anime is only terrible if you're comparing it to the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I can agree with that when it comes to the first season. But even wothout te manga prior knowledge the second season is full of inconsistencies, poor animation, huge plot holes, etc. 
>> ARTICLE
As someone who didn't read the manga, the second season was just okay - average, maybe mediocre, not the awful abomination people make it out to be.  It had its good parts and its flaws.

There was some mediocre animation, some dropped threads, some great music, (a beautiful keyboard), but I didn't see any "giant plot holes".
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, it's one of my favorite manga
>> ARTICLE
People talk shit about the TG anime all the time, but I have to say that the first season on its own is actively good. In fact, I will even say that the first season of Tokyo Ghoul is *better* than the respective content in the manga. I think the [TG S1](/s "Rize/transformation sequence in particular was done much better in the anime,") for example.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree that the [](/s "Rize/transformation sequence was done better in the anime. The manga makes it a point that Rize only shows up because he is so mentally broken at that point that he starts hallucinating. Even figment Rize says that she is nothing but an illusion warped by Kaneki's twisted and broken mind. The anime externalizes Rize in a way because they have her be much more present and plays a bigger role which is to the shows determent. It lessens the impact of Rize showing up during Kaneki's torture scene when you see her talking up to Kaneki when he was about to eat Hide.")
>> ARTICLE
The anime got me into the manga. I loved it, the forst season was quite good. But still cut out a bunch of character development 
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree. I had tried reading the manga, and I wasn't too into it and dropped it like 20 chapters in. Then I watched the anime and it was good enough to convince me to read the manga again.
>> ARTICLE
I half agree with you. i liked S1 of TG as well but the part i didnt like was how they cut out so much content. 
This can be excused a bit though because of episode and time constraints placed on the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Because they were airing almost the same time. 
>> ARTICLE
The biggest is Hyouka and Oregairu. I still haven't watched season 2 of Oregairu.

Also, besides the author, Katanagatari and the Monogatari Series are nothing alike.

And honestly it happens with entire genres in general. I'm not much of a fan of comedy, but I'm big on drama. Most people will just call both a romance, but the difference between RomCom and drama romance is night and day to me. Same for slice of life. Cute girls doing cute things or comedy-driven slice of lifes are so far away from something like Planetes or Hanasaku Iroha.
>> ARTICLE
People lump Hyouka and Oregairu together?
>> ARTICLE
more like they lump Oreki and 8man
>> ARTICLE
Ah, that makes more sense. They are very similar in a lot of ways.
>> ARTICLE
>Also, besides the author, Katanagatari and the Monogatari Series are nothing alike.

Well they ate both 10's


>> ARTICLE
> Katanagatari and the Monogatari Series are nothing alike.

they are dialogue centric, the action scenes are short and intense
>> ARTICLE
> Katanagatari and the Monogatari Series are nothing alike.

I think both are shows which have a heavy amount of dialogue and both have tendencies to indulge in itself. 
>> ARTICLE
it insists upon itself
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what's the big deal with Monster Musume and Monster. They are nothing alike.
>> ARTICLE
They both saved anime
>> ARTICLE
I actually loved Baccano, but am pretty ambivalent about DRRR. DRRR seemed to lack an "endgame" so to speak, stuff and stories and plot-twists kept happening for no reason. I know that that's part of the charm, but eh
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same way. To be honest though, I feel it's because I watched Baccano dubbed but DRRR subbed.
>> ARTICLE
I hold Baccano! In extremely high regards. It's the anime that really fully converted me into an anime fan. It doesn't quite make my top 10, but I'll always have the outmost respect for it. 
>> ARTICLE
Same here. Loved Baccano, but barely got through the first season of DRRR (after dropping it once). 

Characters in Baccano all had some role during the events of the show. The entire time. In DRRR, there are always characters that just act as bystanders. I suppose that's kinda the point, but it just bloats the show with too much informations (characters) to process at once. And as far as I can tell, there isn't really any overarching story  (at least in the first season). It doesn't come to a closure, where everything suddenly makes sense, like Baccano did.
>> ARTICLE
What a lot of people do not realize is that the Baccano anime only covered the first three novels out of 21. It really only covered the introductory story arc and the number of characters and plots and such increase as it goes along. The OVAs did cover a bit of random stuff from the other volumes, but not much.

Season one of Durarara covered the first three out of 13 novels as well. Supposedly X2 is supposed to cover the remaining ten novels. So the pacing for Durarara is really fast; which is why they've been shooting out all these plot points, side stories, and twists real quick-like.

If Baccano got another season in a similar fashion, you'd get similar complaints.

The reason Durarara has received this massive anime treatment is because a new novel series Durarara SH started last year. Apparently SH is the same setting, but one and a half years after the events of the first series.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano is pretty great. The high pace, the romance and just the solid story. The only thing I want from Baccano is more and Drr provides that with an even bigger cast. Also hard not to be excited with this next season as there is a kind of "endgame".
>> ARTICLE
DRRR is just too confusing tbh... I like it but I don't even know anyone in the group chat, and I don't know half of the characters
>> ARTICLE
I don't think DRRR is confusing but its first season was too slow and focused on each "group" of characters for too long so half of the first season just shows the characters for you without anything really happening. I think that a 12 episode season would've been much better.
>> ARTICLE
Copying my reply from above, but I feel the same. DRRR was really good in the first season, but the second season has practically doubled the amount of characters and tripled the amount of plot points. It's harder to keep track of what's going on, but even worse is that it means that the characters I want to see get less screen time.
I don't care about that actress lady who shows up in two episodes and then rarely shows up again, I don't want to spend 5 minutes of a 20-minute episode with that random Russian who used to be Varona's partner, and I don't want to listen to mobster guy #5 who shows up once every 5 episodes talk about plot points I can't remember anymore. I want more Celty, Shizou, Anri, Izaya, Masaomi, etc.
>> ARTICLE
This is why even though I **loved** the first cour of Durarara x2, I'm waiting for the series to finish airing so I can rewatch what I've seen then complete it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm doing this as well. It was difficult enough for me to keep track of the characters in the first season when I watched it all within a week. Watching the second season while it airs (aka waiting a week between episodes) with more than double the characters and even weirder stuff going on is impossible for me.
>> ARTICLE
The reasons you don't like DRRR are why I love DRRR. I love super complicated shows with a bajillion characters all interacting in a really intricate way.
>> ARTICLE
I love the moments in DRRR when a bunch of plot threads come together in a beautiful plot-bow, I just wish it was easier to keep track of it all!
>> ARTICLE
Simply for the sake of other perspectives, I am the exact opposite. Baccano took me a second try to watch because it is confusing as balls. Meanwhile DRRR carefully clued me in on where I was in a timeline in the few cases it jumped backward. And all but 3 characters had a purpose.  I forgot most of Baccano's cast. 

Figuring out the chat room was fun, and pretty easy after a few episodes. Idk, I watched dub, maybe sub is harder. I'd say the were multiple arcs in DRRR, but maybe one Midgame event in Baccano. 

I loved Baccano for the tight story and atmosphere but had absolutely no satisfaction from an ending. Very little... Actually changed from point a to point b [spoiler] (/s "which I suppose is the point with immortals") 
>> ARTICLE
Interestingly I have the exact opposite reaction, I love DRRR but I don't care much for Baccano because I found it too confusing. Maybe I was just distracted when I was watching Baccano or something, but I had no idea what was going on for 90% of my time watching it. Afterwards I had to look up articles online to understand what the plot was. Meria and Isaac were the only part of the show I can say I actually enjoyed, which is a shame because people have such good things to say about the show.
>> ARTICLE
If you don't require the "loved one, hated the other" format:

*Toradora* and *Golden Time*: 

Same author, same or similar genre - but completely different themes.

While I love *Toradora*, I still somewhat enjoyed *Golden Time* - but they are nothing alike.

Also fuck Ghost Banri.
>> ARTICLE
God bless. Glad to know it's not only me who fucking despises that son of a whore.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck Ghost Banri is obligatory anytime Golden Time is mentioned.
>> ARTICLE
can you explain what that is. If I was going to watch golden time I probably would have by now so don't care about spoils
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily : "2D-kun best anime bro"

People always lump Sword Art Online and Log Horizon together. Beside the MMO setting, the two shows are nothing alike. I know this is corrected a lot by people, but it is still often put together. I'd say something more similar to SAO would be DanMachi. Those two would be a safer comparison IMO.
>> ARTICLE
And here I'm the only one comparing Sword Art to .hack//SIGN and finding it wanting.
>> ARTICLE
THANK YOU. I feel OLD every time I see someone bring up SAO and LH and not a god damn soul mentions the brilliant .hack series.
>> ARTICLE
Danmachi feels at least a little different because Bell is frequently thrashed.
>> ARTICLE
SAO captured the trapped in a game theme well, then fell short. log horizon did political intrigue, extreme conditions, and expensive landscapes well, while danmachi gave a good story to a game-like fantasy setting, seemingly meant to be a real world, not a game. 

Edit: they all have a plus at one point or another, but they all fall short of an immersive experience imo.
>> ARTICLE
You can still compare them in terms of how well it utilizes the mmo settings along with other shows that have a trapped in a video game concept like Overlord and NGNL
>> ARTICLE
> I know this is corrected a lot by people, but it is still often put together

Probably due to the fact that there are only 3 or 4 popular anime with an MMO setting and each of them quite different of each other.
>> ARTICLE
AnoHana and Clannad are completely different shows. The way they deal with tear-jerking is very different, and they focus on different things. Clannad is about family and relationships, while AnoHana is about dealing with grief.
>> ARTICLE
Loved Baccano, Isacc and Miria made the show a joy to watch. With DRRR there were just too many characters and I don't think they were given enough screentime. Plus by the second season I couldn't understand what was going on anymore, it just became a massive clusterfuck.

 Celty was cool though.


>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat. DRRR was really good in the first season, but the second season has practically doubled the amount of characters and tripled the amount of plot points. It's harder to keep track of what's going on, but even worse is that it means that the characters I want to see get less screen time.

>> ARTICLE
I agree I've just felt like the last two have been kinda a let down and the creators bit off more than they could chew, do you know if the light novels have all these characters?
>> ARTICLE
from what I've heard I believe they do, though I haven't read the LNs personally
>> ARTICLE
I want more Masaomi too. ;_; Where the hell is he? Why is he never around?
>> ARTICLE
He was my favorite one of the kid trio for sure!
>> ARTICLE
Other way around. Loved DRRR didn't really enjoy Baccano. Found Isacc and Miria more annoying than funny.
>> ARTICLE
Loved Gunbuster but I think Diebuster was boring, annoying and a cash in. It has a cool OP though.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the same until I rewatched Diebuster (original ratings were 9 for Gunbuster and 6 for Diebuster), and now I'm wondering why I thought that in the first place. I'm not sure which one I prefer now, but Diebuster certainly has more passion and care in a lot of scenes than many anime have cumulatively.
>> ARTICLE
I like to see it as taking the series in a completely new, yet familiar, path. Diebuster almost like the reverse side of the coin to Gunbuster. I liked what they did with it, and if they did make a sequel that was closer to Gunbuster I feel that would be somewhat disingenuous. At least they did something different. 

If Gunbuster was proto-Evangelion, then Diebuster was proto-TTGL
>> ARTICLE
The "nichijous". 

They're both sketch-based SoL comedies. There's still a pretty big difference between them.  
I *loved* nichibros, while I found nichijou to be alright. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved both (although I liked Nichijou a bit more), but I agree that they are completely different styles of comedy despite similar setups.
>> ARTICLE
K-On and Sora no Woto. 

Both are great IMO, but they have different strengths. K-On is enjoyable, pure slice of life with some end-of-season feels. Overall, it's a happy, joking, cute sort of show (still need to finish S2).

Sora no Woto uses the same style, and starts off as an SoL...I'd say those are the only shared traits. Both shows are moe, yes, but damn, does SnW take things in a much darker direction. Even as a slice of life, it goes beyond ["cute girls doing cute things"](http://i.imgur.com/gkEdXr8.gif)

I won't say that the show approaches the tone of something like Psycho-Pass or other Urobutcher stuff - there's almost always a bittersweet tinge - but it is *not* the happy SoL that it is so often unfairly compared to. 

To be fair, most people who have seen the two agree with me. It's more of just a popular opinion held by those who haven't seen Sora no Woto, since K-On is pretty much ubiquitous and "wow it's a moe girl playing trumpet, this is totally K-On in the military"
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't help that Sora no Woto aired very soon after (the season after?) K-ON!, and the art style is quite similar. They're *very* different shows but a lot of people went in expection "K-ON! ripoff" for these reasons.
>> ARTICLE
A Certain Scientific Railgun and A Certain Magical Index. I had a blast and really enjoyed watching Railgun, and it never felt it dragged and the action was fun and exciting and Misaka came off as a well-written, strong yet vulnerable character.   
  
Index bored me for stretches of its run, and it felt like the world was more interesting than the actual people in it.   
>> ARTICLE
Index gets better around the second rewatch and with a good watch order I think, but it definitely doesn't stand out as well. First watch, especially, Index suffers compared to Railgun and Railgun does a lot of good foreshadowing and stuff which makes it even better on the first rewatch in comparison to Index : /
>> ARTICLE
I agree i found most of the magic side arcs to be really boring in comparison with science side
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree. Misaka was a much more interesting main character than Touma ever was. 
>> ARTICLE
For me it wasn't that Touma wasn't interesting, I actually like him, its more of so far in my watch through of Railgun, which I haven't finished yet, there is no Index. I swear that character ruined Index for me and she's the title character.
>> ARTICLE
Funny enough, out of all the things I don't like about A Certain Magical Index...Index herself is not one of them. 

>> ARTICLE
For me, Index had some interesting characters like Tsuchimikado, Last Order and we got to see more of Accelerator. I wish they explored more of the backbone characters (like Aleister Crowley or Laura Stuart).

I watched Index after Railgun and it was nice that it expanded the world that I knew but after episode 9 it seemed like things started happening for no reason because there was too much focus on Touma fights and little to no focus on the decisions that made each conflict happen.

I think that one of the reasons I stayed through the entirety of index was because I wanted to see more Misaka appearences
>> ARTICLE
You would be getting a lot more of that should they ever make season three. Seriously, I have never seen a studio stop adapting a series at such a crucial point outside of Gangsta.
>> ARTICLE
My friend, you should (not) watch Sakurako-san, Eyeshield 21, Shaman King, or heck, a lot of shows. It's a shame how many of them just throw in the towel right as its about to get real
>> ARTICLE
But muh publisher sales...
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly why! They leave it at a cliffhanger so that people want more so they shell out for source material and then the anime in the hopes it gets more of an adaptation...
  
Have you watched Shirobako?
>> ARTICLE
No, and now I'm scared to.
>> ARTICLE
It's really good! Gives a nice look at what the anime industry is like, and it has one of the most fulfilling endings I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
:D
>> ARTICLE
Also, and I know this is important for you, I don't think there's going to be a dub for it, just fyi :(
>> ARTICLE
I always found science arcs interesting and magic arcs really dry. In general, I prefer sci-fi to fantasy since I think they're less likely to pull deus ex machina, but Raildex is such soft sci-fi that I don't think that applies here, I just found that the science side characters were much more intriguing than the magic side
>> ARTICLE
Personally I felt like Railgun(esp S1) was the one that dragged on.  I thought that the filler arcs in particular were boring and predictable. I enjoyed Index because of its fast pace and that it focused on both aspects of the world, science and magic, instead of just science. I enjoyed both though.
>> ARTICLE
SAO and Log Horizon...completely different in their story.
>> ARTICLE
They both had a shitty second season 
>> ARTICLE
I thought SAO's second season as a whole was much better than its first season. Meanwhile LH's second season was disappointing in comparison to its great first season.
>> ARTICLE
I cant agree with that. I just did not enjoy thr second season.  The pace was very slow.  And although the mystery was tough it was rather obvious that it would be some no name from sao.  Just didnt get sucked in like the beginning of the fiest season 
>> ARTICLE
Mother's Rosario was actually pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
>completely different in their story

And quality
>> ARTICLE
Log Horizon presents game mechanics as a more prevalent point of interest throughout the anime. It highlights confinements around what is possible within the world of Elder Tale and was information heavy in terms of lore and how it concerns the stuck players. Log Horizon was interesting in the way that they introduced unknown mechanics as a result of the integration of the two worlds and as a result influence player decisions. An example of this would be the disabled teleporters between safe zones - which was factored into Shirou's planning in terms of resources required.  
&nbsp;

SAO was more about every 14-year-olds wet dream of a video game with strong adventure and action elements. SAO was more focused on a visually appealing output while being simply understandable to the viewers in terms of game mechanics. The interesting thing about SAO was the death status, it was a spice added to the story and let us as viewers empathize with the characters a little more.  
&nbsp;

I am not delivering any verdict on which is better and to each their own. Both of these animes are different in focus and delivery, and should not be lumped together as your "trapped in video game" genre. What I can say though, is that Log Horizon's season 2 is less appealing than the first.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely season 2 was not as good as the first I feel. They reused the song for the opening from season 1, like what. I guess they had a decrease in budget or something, but I really feel like that was a weird decision. 
>> ARTICLE
>but I really feel like that was a weird decision.

Shows which would ditch an OP that good are the real oddballs!
>> ARTICLE
Season 2 was done by a different studio, specifically the studio was DEEN, they have been known to cut a lot of corners and at times screw a story. I'm sad at what became of Log Horizon 2 because I loved season 1. I liked season 2 but there was one specific arc that needed to be cut way shorter and the entire quality of the show was a lot lower.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone over at /r/LogHorizon was hyped that they were using the same theme song... I sing it every time I hear it.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I guess it was just me that didn't like the song that much after hearing it for 2 seasons. I was fine with it season 1, but I was just disappointed I didn't get to hear something new. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe. It seems like I just liked it more and more every time I heard it.
>> ARTICLE
I loved Kill la Kill, but I hated Gurren Lagann. I don't know why I hated it, but it felt like the guys who were making it were just all pouring testosterone into one room.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that they poured their testosterone into the show is what makes the TTGL so over the top and amazing. The main reason I like TTGL is they took a few themes and repeated them constantly and basically hammered in the message of the show. KLK takes a shitload of themes and just touches on many of them, but really only goes in depth on one or two, if at all.
>> ARTICLE
Besides you can't beat the comedy, and the straight up darkness of the show. It's like Over the top mechs fun, with Dark underlying tones. 
>> ARTICLE
EDIT: you really seem to hate the show.

I prefer KLK to TTGL, but don't hate TTGL.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the same way.  I guess I'm just not that big on Mecha anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann just wasn't that fun for me, idk what it was 
>> ARTICLE
Opposite here, and yes, why the hell does everyone compare them? Yes they both have 'energy' what the hell that even means.
>> ARTICLE
I have the same opinion as well. It all came down to the characters at the end where I didn't really like Kamina and Simon but loved Ryuuko and Mako.
>> ARTICLE
Opposite for me (though I don't hate KlK, I do think it is vastly inferior).
>> ARTICLE
I really like Kill La Kill but it's definitely a cut or 2 bellow TTGL. TTGL is actually on my top 10 all time.
>> ARTICLE
Opposite for me. Ttgl always felt over the top, but it worked significantly better than klk imo. Ttgl also had more music that I liked. People always talk about "before my body is dry" but I never thought it could be even compared to sonairo days, libera me from hell, and viral's theme. Different strokes.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass and Death note. I don't see these two being mencioned together a lot in here, but some years ago when I started watching anime, I got used to see a lot of comparisons and discussions to see which was better, if lelouch was smarter then kira and etc. 
To me it was never really the same level, I think the plot of Code Geass developed so much better as the show went on and DN was the complete opposite, started with a really good idea, but was really poorly executed from the middle to the ending.

>> ARTICLE
Its two protagonists taking ng on the world through their contrived keikakus, and I think that makes them similar enough to lump them together, despite the differing tones.
>> ARTICLE
Really?  I kind of found it the other way round.

I mean, I liked how Death Note kept the stakes interesting for a long time, even though it kind of petered off near the end.

But for me, Code Geass was a pretty shitty show from beginning to end.  The characters seemed incredibly unintelligent, their motivations were 2-dimensional, the entire setting seemed to be trying to cram as many popular anime cliches into one show as possible - and unlike shows like Kill la Kill or FLCL, it didn't have enough self-awareness about that to make it funny.

I'm not saying your view is wrong, I just find it interesting that we both agree that the shows are different, but like the opposites of the whole.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you. To me, DN, despite not being completely consistent in quality, was entertaining, intelligent, and totally gripping. CG tried to be all of these things but totally failed in my eyes. The use of cliches didn't bother me so much - when I watched the show I was new to anime so I didn't really notice them. What did bother me was the complete lack of tension in the plot, the flat characters, and the fact that the intelligence of the characters was told to us, but never shown. The first rule of good writing is 'show, don't tell' - the failure on this front made the whole thing seem incredibly amateur to me.
>> ARTICLE
I understand what you said about characters and clichs, Code Geass was one of the first animes I watched and I think that might be the case for a lot of people giving the high level of recommendation even now after so many years. Maybe for that reason some things that would seem boring and nothing new to somebody who had already seen a greater number of shows, seemed different and interesting.

As for DN, maybe my view of the first half is affected by the ending but to me it left a feeling that [Death Note](/s "the writer had the idea of how kira could defeat L in the middle of the manga's serialization and couldn't bring himself to make up excuses to keep him alive. I respect that a lot but the follow up to that decision ruined the show to me.")
>> ARTICLE
Fans who lump Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero & UBW, Prisma Ilya and Carnival Phantasm together as the Nasuverse are in for quite a treat if they think the last two aren't as good of shows.

They're a different experience almost for each shown but I think all are good in their own right.  Would be nice if they made a Tsukihime anime that measures up to the rest of the Nasuverse.
>> ARTICLE
Illya 2wei herz is pretty shit though

and prism illya actually only starts getting really good at the end of 2wei/start of 3rei

carnival phantasm is legit one of the best things to come out of nasuverse, gets even better after reading tsukihime

I agree w/ Illya 2wei herz, the other 2 I think are awesome.  Just a different experience...I absolutely died laughing and loved Carnival Phatasm.
>> ARTICLE
Carnival Phantasm is hilarious 
>> ARTICLE
In all honesty I like Prisma Illya just as much as, if not more than, UBW/Zero. Heaven's Feel may turn out to be the best, at least until Prisma Illya 3rei gets animated.
>> ARTICLE
Prisma Illya for me has just been a long string of disappointment since the Saber fight in s1. I am hopeful for 3rei but at this point I don't think it will ever recapture that feeling.
>> ARTICLE
I'm prepared for whatever happens next.

I'm wholeheartedly enjoying Gintama's humour, well rounded characters, and episodic nature and mix of serious arcs.

I see people recommend Gintama to those who enjoyed OPM. Though I'd say for the most part, they aren't alike at all. Sure, they both have a seemingly lazy MC with and a plethora of side characters. They're a far cry from each other though, and I sincerely believe Gintama to be much better between the two.

~ From someone who gave in to the (well deserved) hype a few months ago and started watching Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
I love OPM, and I've tried Gintama at least three times, and I cannot keep interested past episode 5-6. The characters seem fun, but it looked mostly like a sitcom/skit humor instead of any actual story. Does it get better to where even if you weren't into it At all in the beginning, it's still great?
>> ARTICLE
Every once in a while Gintama will give you a fantastic story. But yeah, like you said, a lot of it is sitcom humor. I stopped watching after 50ish episodes. One day I'll pick it up again but a lot of the episodes were duds (for me). 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like maybe others have told you this, but if you stopped watching around 50 you actually just missed the best part about Gintama - the overarching, serious storyline that will continue to develop every once in a while for the next 240+ episodes.

Humor is no doubt the essential core of Gintama (And I love all those moments, too), but the reveal of the backstory/ongoing conflict-centric plot also becomes a huge component in why it's such a highly-respected series.
>> ARTICLE
No I don't think anyone has told me that. I should probably watch Gintama rather than doing another HxH re-watch. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess it's not for everyone, and it is mostly episodic as I say. However, it seems to be like you're going into it a little wrong - thought I'm certainly not saying there's some objective way to do it. It's not a series where you think, "Right, time to watch Gintama", and then put all other series aside as you watch it, and due to it's episodic nature, it really doesn't matter if you forget bits - no need to 'restart' it. For me it's just a show I watch a couple at a time when I'm between series or want a break from something else. It may look like some 'daunting task' and you have to really 'get into it', but it's all just super casual watching - I guess rather like a sitcom or some such, but there is more to be got from it than that, too. That's my take, anyway. Take it or leave it I guess, at the end of the day you should watch what you enjoy, however 5-6 episodes might isn't a lot to judge it on, and it does arguably get better.
>> ARTICLE
The overarching Gintama storyline starts revealing itself about episode 58 or so, and though mostly serious, those arcs (Sprinkled throughout the rest of the 240+ episodes) often incorporate humor as well. The sitcom-esque episodes in between actually serve as the perfect method for you to become very attached to all the characters, because most of them get incredible emotional development/coverage during the serious arcs.
>> ARTICLE
True, while OPM and Gintama are somewhat similar, having a quite OP MC and lots of humor...the stupidity in Gintama is on a whole new level compared to OPM-
>> ARTICLE
One of the reasons I haven't tried Gintama is because people spam comment faces which makes me think that the humor is 90% located on the faces that the characters make when reacting to things, which isn't the kind of humor that I like
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily, in fact there are a lot of jokes where you don't even see the characters reacting, but hear their voice turning aggressive in a typical tsukkomi routine. There's of course funny faces out there but they are not the main source of comedy, they are just there and sometimes are more inspired than others.
>> ARTICLE
When there are several hundred episodes to a comedy anime, you are bound to get some good faces.

Dead Leaves and FLCL/TTGL/KLK/PSWG.

 I love FLCL, Gurrenn Lagann, Kill la Kill and Panty and Stocking, but I didn't enjoy Dead leaves at all. I found it really uninteresting and couldn't get drawn into it. It didn't have the charm that those other four shows do. I really like/love everything I've seen from Imaishi except for Dead Leaves.
>> ARTICLE
> I love FLCL, Gurrenn Lagann, Kill la Kill and Panty and Stocking

For some reason i'm getting an impression that you're a fan of GAINAX.
>> ARTICLE
Wandering Son and Blue Flowers. Blue Flowers went absolutely nowhere and just felt like an ad for the source material, compared to Wandering Son which told a solid story with character development and a conclusive arc.
>> ARTICLE
"They *feel* similar" is the usual reason I see those two mentioned together. I wouldn't know since I haven't seen Aoi Hana yet
>> ARTICLE
They are very similar. Same manga writer, both slices of life dealing with LGBT issues, and similar art. I don't blame people for comparing them, but the difference in quality is substantial. I think Blue Flowers would've been better with Mari Okada doing the series composition.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think this exactly answers the OP's question but it's a similar train of thought.

I love KLK and just like TTGL. It's not bad but it's not perfect, which is probably not a popular opinion but whatever, it's also not the point. I feel like TTGL constantly gets compared to KLK and I get it, but I really think the comparison should be with FLCL. The two just have way more in common from structure, to themes, to characters and plot. I get the comparison to KLK, visually and villain-structurally but it just makes more sense to compare it to FLCL in my head.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's fair to do both. In my head KLK and TTGL are like sister/brother companion pieces in a lot of ways. I never cared for FLCL but I see what you are saying. I also agree that KLK>TTGL, which does seem to be unpopular around here. I think a lot of it is which one was watched first. I saw KLK first and watched TTGL because of it.
>> ARTICLE
FMA and HxH. HxH has nothing on FMA.
>> ARTICLE
Who puts these 2 shows together? They're totally different anime
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen HxH, but FMA (both 2003 and Brohood) tackled some really deep issues in very mature ways. The lessons you learn from them are pretty important.
>> ARTICLE
This totally hit me hard when I showed FMA:B to my little brother. The show deals with death, losing loved ones, scars and grief in a really *real* way.

HxH didn't do the same thing, in my opinion. It's more mystical and fantasy oriented rather than emotionally deep. It's the biggest difference between the two and the reason why I don't like HxH.
>> ARTICLE
Another huge thing that FMA:B tackled really well was sacrifice. It was really intuitive. Also helps when the principle of alchemy and equivalent exchange is based off of historical theories. I think any other show will deal with sacrifice in an obvious and straightforward way, but FMA really does it in a different way which was of benefit to the series.
>> ARTICLE
Judging from your anime list, you haven't seen all of HxH yet. If emotional depth is what you are looking for, I highly recommend picking it up again as the Chimera Ant Arc tackles some pretty heavy issues.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter tackles a load of stuff in the Chimera Ant Arc and I would argue Gon and Killua have a relationship which is better written than any in FMA.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, calling either not emotionally deep is kind of asinine IMO. When both hit their stride, they'll hit you hard.
>> ARTICLE
HxH deals with different philosophical and moral issues, but they're definitely there and present. Family isn't nearly as important, but friendship kind of replaces that specifically. 
>> ARTICLE
Ooh I strongly disagree. I would almost go the opposite. FMAB is a good anime, but I found Ed to be one of if not the weakest character in the series which is kind of awful for a protag. Gon isn't the best character in anime by any means but he's all kinds of loveable. The fights and mechanics are some of the most interesting in anime in hxh as well. Granted, mustang is still all kinds of amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Ed and Alphonse( Alphonse less so) were what let FMAB down for me; the main characters were the weakest and almost felt like comic relief characters thrust to the fore in what is otherwise a fantastic, interesting and diverse world with some great characters that aren't nearly prominent enough. Ed in particular made certain episodes a chore to get through, but the plot and world are so good that I have to objectively rate it high and admit I did get enjoyment out of the series nonetheless.
>> ARTICLE
It's kind of telling that towards the end of Brotherhood Ed is overshadowed by basically every other character. It becomes more about Mustang and the rest of the supporting cast than about the Elric brothers.
>> ARTICLE
HxH has an amazing antagonist in Meruem, none of the villains in FMA:B come close. The fights in FMA:B were all very well choreographed, but the fights in HxH make much better use of the atmosphere and stakes involved.

I wouldn't say HxH is better than FMA, but saying it has nothing on FMA is a huge exaggeration.

Meruem starts of a monster and ruthless conqueror, killing anyone who stands in his way and looking down on pretty much the whole world. As the arc progresses, [Spoilers](/s "he slowly comes to terms with his human nature, acknowledging the loyalty of his royal guards and even giving in to the most human emotion, love"). It's an absolutely great transformation and it's amazing to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but I think there's more to characters than development alone. Yes he does develop a lot, but I never found his growth very interesting. Even in his own show, I thought Chrollo was a better villain.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Meruem was incredibly compelling because of how he's fleshed out in every stage of his character development. In his monster stage, we get a good idea of what kind of person he is right from his birth. We also get a lot of insights into his way of thinking in [](/s "his conquest of that North Korea-esque country. I think it was called NGL? He compares humans to livestock whose only purpose is to satisfy the needs of the superior species, Chimera Ants. Even his gungi games with Komugi tell us about his way of thinking and his morals. The scene where he rips of his hand after losing to Komugi was an especially great moment in his characterization.")

In the stages where begins to accept humanity too the aspects of his character are fleshed out as they develop. His conversations with Netero as well as how he approaches the gungi games show how his way of thinking has shifted. His [](/s "confusion over his feelings for Komugi are also conveyed really well").

I don't think anyone who has watched HxH forgets Meruem's final moments of characterization that drive home not only how far his development has come but also the point of the whole Chimera ant as a whole. Meruem's the complete package when it comes to a character, from surface level characterization to fleshing out to development. And not only is the amount of development he goes through amazing, but it's also great how believably it's done through the course of the CA arc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I agree he does get a lot of meaningful development unlike some characters (looking at you, Mirai Nikki). In a way it's fascinating, but I didn't find him engaging the way I did with my favorite villains. I know he did evoke quite the emotional response from a lot of the fanbase, but he never really did it for me. I dunno why, just found him somewhat bland, despite his development.
>> ARTICLE
If Meruem isn't amazing then I don't know what kind of standard you have for villains.

His character design ruins everything.

Black Lagoon, Phantom, and Jormungand get grouped together a lot. Black Lagoon stands head, shoulders, knees, and toes above the other two. Phantom takes itself way too seriously and doesn't have any charm. Jormungand tried to be Black Lagoon 2.0 without understanding what made Black Lagoon a good show.
>> ARTICLE
>maybe you're big fan of Durarara but don't see the fuss about Baccano!

Actually exactly this :p

Baccano was okay, but the characters bored me (they were shallow) and as such I cared less for everything else it had going for it. Funnily enough with that being said, Isaac and Miria were definitely the highlight of the show for me~
>> ARTICLE
I'm the opposite, actually. I love Baccano's breakneck pace and non-linear structure, but Durarara's pace is absolutely *glacial*, especially in the second season. I still haven't watched the second cours of x2 tbh because I just can't bring myself to care. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't actually watched the sequels yet so I didn't include them in my thought process :p

I liked Durarara's pacing after the first 5 episodes or so (which are slow). They build up tension slowly with multiple factions and perspectives and I really enjoyed it :)
>> ARTICLE
Ghost in the Shell is mentioned alongside Psycho-Pass too much. GitS is true sci-fi with deep philosophical undertones, PP is this abomination of the police/detective genre on a backdrop of sci-fi with ham fisted allusions to literature in an attempt to appear intelligent.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I prefer Psycho Pass over Ghost in the Shell but I can kinda agree with this.
>> ARTICLE
Psycho-Pass is GitS-lite
>> ARTICLE
I think it's pretty safe to say that Ghost in the Shell is better written than Psycho Pass is, but to say that Psycho Pass is an abomination is a little much. 

Personally I don't get why the two are compared so much anyway, the only similarity they both have is cyberpunk. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually watching Psycho-Pass right now and I find the GitS comparisons mostly unwarranted. They're honestly not that similar at all. The biggest similarities to me seem to be the aesthetics of the show, which are reminiscent of Innocence. Not to mention both happen to throw around literary quotes like candy lel. 

They touch upon cyberization in PP but it's pretty brief, while it's such an integral component of GitS. Really from what I've seen so far PP is mostly about morality, thematically it shares much more in common with Madoka and Fate/Zero which is no surprise.
>> ARTICLE
I see a lot of people describe Guilty Crown as a poor man's Code Geass.  Personally I don't find them to be all that similar, and I also thought Guilty Crown was fantastic whereas Code Geass was pretty mediocre.

Oh and I also fall into every single category mentioned here:

Hyouka and Oregairu.

MCs are different from one another.
One is lazy and dissociated from others voluntarily.
The other secretly wants companionship yet hides behind the pretense of being a loner/low self-esteem involuntarily due to past negative experiences
>> ARTICLE
From the description I have a hard time who is who

> secretly wants companionship 

Both want that. One wants genuine relationshiops, one wants a 'rose colored life' that entails having friends

> past negative experiences

That might be 8man, but then again, I don't recall it being entirely sure what made Oreki that way, it might have been something in his past.

Both of them voluntarily chose to be that way, but have different events that led to them decide to adopt that personality. 
>> ARTICLE
Oreki is roped into the story of Hyouka due to Chitanda's Antics.  His character initially was satisfied with an alienated lifestyle.

Hachiman on the other hand is not. He secretly wants to have relationships but deems himself unworthy. It is through being forced to participate in the Community Service activity that he begins to build healthy relationships with other people.


One was active, one was passive
>> ARTICLE
> Oreki 

Even without Chitanda's intervention, Oreki was interested in the 'rose colored life' due to his discussions with Satoshi, constantly discussing the idea of it. Chitanda was not his sole influence.

And [Hyouka](/s "As taken from a story of Satoshi, Oreki was a different person in his earlier years, meaning something triggered him to change. ")

> he deems himself unworthy

He deems everyone unworthy, because he sees people as fake.

> he yearns for companionship

In the end, so did Oreki came to that conclusion. It's just that Hachiman starts early in the show with him having that yearning, Oreki gains it near the end. 

Of course there are lots of differences, but I can't agree that there are no similarities. 

> one was active one was passive

If left alone and not forced into the club, 8man would have been passive, because he wouldn't intervene into anything out of his own interest. Just like Oreki.
>> ARTICLE
I don't believe Hotarou was yearning for the rose-coloured life. I don't think he even believed in it as a reality. For me, the significant factor is Chitanda and the attraction he felt towards her made him choose activity over passivity. In contrast, Hachiman is a bundle of anxiety and paranoia who believes that everyone else hates him and as a defence mechanism he visualises them all as horrible people.  
The similarities are in the arrogance each one has in believing that they understand the feelings of others and that they're intellectually superior. 
>> ARTICLE
>From the description I have a hard time who is who

I would never describe Oreki as "secretly wants companionship yet hides behind the pretense of being a loner/low self-esteem involuntarily due to past negative experiences".

One is actually likeable.

I dont do it, but some people are comparing LoGH with Code Geass and I prefer LoGH by a landslide.

Also, Mindgame hast this reputation to be a shorter version of The Tatami Galaxy, but I honestly think the TTG is miles above Mindgame.

Wait, are there people who have seen both and think Code Geass is anywhere near LoGH's quality?

Berserk and Claymore. Berserk is genius and Claymore is one-dimensional and obnoxious by comparison.
>> ARTICLE
Love Major but Ace No Diamond is a chore to get through. Terrible pacing.

"Liked" Sword Art Online but Log Horizon is eh. Especially S2.

Liked Outbreak Company, but Dog Days is not as enjoyable.


>> ARTICLE
In case you watched Log Horizon weekly, try marathoning it. I found that I lost interest in Season 2 because it moved extremely slowly. I would forget what happened in the previous episode constantly so I ended up losing track of what was happening and dropped it. Watching episodes back to back though changed my mind completely. After rewatching both seasons, I found that I like season 2 as much as if not more than season 1.

It's entirely likely that this simply isn't your cup of tea and that's fine, but if this might be the case for you I would highly recommend giving it another shot.
>> ARTICLE
That one arc in season 2 is really bothering me. Like I really couldn't care less about the side group. The first season peaked my interest with economics and politics with the mmo setting. I feel like it lost that in the second season. To be fair I haven't completely finished it yet. It's been a long time since I've watched it but that's what I remember. 
>> ARTICLE
That was my reaction too when I was watching it weekly. I got extremely annoyed with the kids arc since I wanted it to get back to the main story since I watched it over the course of a month. Way too long for that kind of arc.

It was a lot less irritating when rewatched the entire arc in a couple of hours where it became a lot more obvious what they were trying to do, and in my opinion they did it spectacularly.

Arcs in season 1 focus on specific events to show how the world works. Arcs in season 2 focus on a specific characters and highlight their development, the events happening being secondary to that.

If you marathoned it and still feel the same way, then that's a different story.

EDIT:grammar
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I was marathoning log horizon as a whole until that arc hit. It really killed my motivation to watch tbh. 
>> ARTICLE
That's a shame. In any case I just wanted to leave my comment as a PSA to whoever dropped it for similar reasons to mine.
>> ARTICLE
> "Liked" Sword Art Online but Log Horizon is eh. Especially S2.

I really like SAO, so I watched LH. I *really* tried to like it, but I just found it boring. It just couldn't hold my attention. 

>> ARTICLE
I guess Log Horizon really cativates people interested in politics, economics and are familiar with end game MMO's.

SAO is just generic, so anyone can like.


>> ARTICLE
Perhaps. I can only speak for myself, of course, so perhaps it just isn't my thing, but I played Ultima, Everquest, and have had an active WoW subscription since 2004 (Vanilla) where I have run every endgame Raid thus far, and I still couldn't get into it. I just found it boring.  
>> ARTICLE
Yup, i meant the combination of the 3. And you may even be interested in those things, but would not like to see them in an anime.
>> ARTICLE
So if I don't like Outbreak Company I should stay away from Dog Days. Got it. 
>> ARTICLE
Depends on why you don't like Outbreak Company. If it's because of the "transported to a fantasy world" theme, then yeah. 
>> ARTICLE
Ace No Diamond tends to strecth the matches out way too long, sometimes at 3-4 episodes for one match. It doesn't help that baseball is boring in real life let alone slowed down even more,
>> ARTICLE
Madoka Magica and YuYuYu.

People always seem to recommend YuYuYu for people who liked Madoka, but to me it just seemed like a super generic shounen with boring characters that don't really go anywhere and a terrible plot. They aren't even very similar. 
>> ARTICLE
I often see Gintama and Nozaki-kun lumped together as the "greatest comedy anime of all time" but while I absolutely love Gintama, I could not bear through Nozaki-kun. It's boring, slow, and the characters are all basically the same person affected by different amounts of crack. 

The few giggles it got out of me from the six episodes I watched were all jokes that had been done before, but it wasn't anywhere near enough to keep me watching.

I personally believe that *Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun* is the worst comedy anime I've ever seen and that Gintama, though not my *absolute* favorite, doesn't deserve to be lumped together with it. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved Death Note - but I absolutely hated Code Geass.

I have no idea why, but from the get-go Code Geass just struck me as being an incredibly stupid show.  Something about its art or sound or plot points just rubbed me the wrong way, I guess - but at any rate, I hate Code Geass even though I love Death Note.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Code Geass just tried to do to many things at once and didn't do anything well.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen Haruhi Suzumiya lumped with Toradora before, and while both have great artwork and animation behind them, the concept involved with the former make the show seem all the more enticing than the latter. Given the kind of show Haruhi is, there are many possibilities in the kinds of directions the narrative should go in, while Toradora is really all about its characters, so the show is entirely dependent on them in terms where each episode should go next. That I think restricts Toradora in its creativity more than it does with Haruhi. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious where you've seen these two lumped together, since, as you've mentioned, the concepts of each show are so radically different that it boggles my mind that someone would pair them up like that.
>> ARTICLE
The similarities are mainly based on how the two leads in each show are a fiery, tsundere-type character and a borderline-apathetic character almost acting as her sidekick. There's also the fact that both shows came out within 2 years of each other, leading many to believe that Toradora took a few hints from Haruhi in how to style and execute the show. 

Characters from both shows often appear in crossover fanart together, which has been going on for the last 6 years, especially on sites like [pixiv](http://www.pixiv.net/search.php?s_mode=s_tag&word=%20!&abt=x) (link NSFW).

Ryuuji is like the embodiment of empathy, going above and beyond the call of duty to help anyone he can. I will admit however, he  doesn't start as the sort of guy to deal with Taiga's insane plans.

I have no clue about Kyon.

Haruhi is on my list, don't worry.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I meant by my description of Ryuuji (it's been a while since I've seen Toradora!, while I've been steadily going through the Haruhi light novels). He's really a gentle soul, but he can only withstand so much of Taiga's craziness in a single day. The same goes for Kyon.

Naruto and Fairy Tail. 

Naruto can get serious at times, has an unpredictable plot, has many emotional moments, and has some really good fights. Fairy Tail is boring, not serious ever, super predictable, friendship trumps all etc.

Sukitte Ii na yo and My Little Monster.

While I did enjoy both Sukitte Ii na yo does so much better. The main couple, the drama and the romance were all pretty great in Sukitte!

I actually found Sukkite pretty boring, compared to the other Shojos/Romances I've seen. 

At least Tonari triggers a reaction (and interest) via the male MC that does stupid shit [Tonari](/s "like accidentally hitting her"), or being overall a mess of a person. 

Plus, Tonari has way more comedy than Sukkite. 
>> ARTICLE
Notice how I put a bunch of stuff and left out comedy ;)

Tonari is a lot funnier. The MC isn't really appealing though he does create laughs. He's less bland than Sukitte's but I also did not like him at a lot of times.

Sukitte has more progression and interesting drama for me. The couple gets together early and Mei is an amazing character!

> get together early

Well, if that's your thing... Sure. 

> more drama

That's true. Though it most got to do with the MC (Mei) being way too troublesome (complicated).

**Clannad and Angel beats.**

Clannad certainly isn't without flaws, but it managed to get me all mistyeyed when it needed to, the characters were all very fun and each got their fair share of screentime so the viewer could come to care about them and whatever troubles they were having.

Angel Beats on the other hand is a mess. The characters are very one dimensional and flat, their character tropes really were the extend of the personality they had. The rushed pacing didn't help either, so whenever the series did try to focus and develop the characters it would just seem jarring and forced. Personally I have no idea how any one got sad over the events of angel beats, unless if you're the sort who gets sad when you listen to sad music that is.

Oh, and Angel beats had the most boring MC Jun Maeda has ever written too. But at least Angel beats isn't half the trainwreck that Charlotte is, so it has that going for it.

EDIT: Decided to write about another thing.

**Psycho-Pass and Psycho-Pass 2**

The dip in quality from S1 to S2 was insane. The animation quality was much stiffer, S2 introduced a cast of new characters who did either absolutely nothing or very little and the overall story could easily happen without them even existing. The main villain in season 2 is so one note that I'm lead to believe that the new writer simply came up with the "W/C?"gimmick and felt as if his job was done. Makishima isn't exactly the most perfectly written villain, but he's a million times more interesting than Kirito was.

Oh, and do I even have to mention [this guy](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/274800.jpg)? His writing and motivations was so insanely hamfisted I don't even know where to begin. I'll just say that [](/s "the very moment I saw him appear I knew he'd turn out to be another antagonist to Akane since... well just fucking look at him. His eyes started glowing red in one scene for fucks sake.")

Psycho Pass 2 seems like it was written by a guy who thought that people only enjoyed Psycho Pass for the gore and violence, and tried extremely hard to out Urobutcher Gen Urobuchi himself only for his attempts of being SHOCKING to come off as extremely juvenile. The only positive I can think of S2 is that it was really neat seeing Akane being this independent badass, and [this fucking boat](https://i.imgur.com/RN111rl.jpg).

Evangelion and Gunbuster 

both gainax both mecha,  one pretentious and depressive the other is a love letter to the genre, and a great deconstruction of some genres, and a reconstruction of the super robot tropes.
wrapped up in amazing hard sci fi.

Given that i havent seen much mecha but if Gunbuster is a "love letter to the genre" then most mech should be awfull, the only redeeming qualities of that show where the "time sci fi" and the OST.

well yeah :-P  but  i've heard those two bundled together and it hurts me,  now  i dislike  both eva and Raxephon, so at least i'm consistent.

I rather enjoyed all the VA's in Bebop and their voices fit well with what was going on and did not feel out of place, that's makes a good dub for me.

Yeah it was enjoyable. And extremely proficient. But it completely fucked up intention in many lines

Just out of curiosity, what does it change about his character?

Changes his arrogance

Interesting. I'll try the sub next rewatch. I loved Steve Blum's performance for my first watch years ago.

Yeah. He's great at delivering lines. But it's incorrectly directed the dub 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't it just a different take on the character?

Two people can have different opinions on how to read a script, doesn't have to make one inferior to the other.

Did I state it was inferior. It's just worse because it incorrectly conveys the character's meaning

Lmao, you're an idiot.

How is his interpretation wrong? I think with the vague description I could find on Spike's character you could defend a lot of interpretations.

I can't find a source that says that Blums Spike is wrong, but I would love to see one, but might be because such sources are in Japanese.

[Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate)
>> ARTICLE
Haruhi dub was a mixed bag. Crispin Freeman as Kyon was godlike, Haruhi was abrasive, annoying, and sounded like a middle aged woman, Mikuru was cringe inducing (as is typically for when English voice actors attempt kawaii), while Koizumi and Nagato were OK. Compare to the Japanese cast, which waa top notch across the board, but Kyon's Japanese VA couldn't match Crispin Freeman's godliness.

When watching season 1, I couldn't decide whether I wanted the across the board quality the sub offered or the dub with a godly Kyon but occasional moments of cringe. When watching season 2 the decision was made for me because elitist fansub and encoding groups made a blu ray copy of season 2 and Disappearance with the dub more or less impossible to find (Elysium actually had a copy with the dub at one point, then they removed it and uploaded a "fixed" version without the "terrible" dub).
>> ARTICLE
>  

I have to agree with you on Haruhi and Mikuru, but I found the japaneses voices to be quite similar.
No doubt Crispin Freeman carried the show, that's why I watched the dub. I just didn't want to read all his monologues.

Dragonball Z
>> ARTICLE
Kai? Because the original dub is pretty bad.
>> ARTICLE
The original Funimation dub of DBZ is the greatest thing to ever happen to the Dragonball series apart from its conception
>> ARTICLE
At the start of the dub they didn't really have any acting experience, they replaced the score, changed characters' names, changed/censored the scripts and changed a lot of the MC's personality. By the criteria people are using to judge modern dubs, it's pretty bad.
>> ARTICLE
Also for some reason they changed voice actors at random points in the series (atleast in canada). I remember at one point while watching Dragonball Z, the voice of goku just COMPLETELY changed (i think it was the snakeway arc?) and he went from sounding like a big kid at heart so some surfer douchebag lol... but then it changed back a while later. Not sure why it was so bizarre.

Anyways obviously I was referring to the Funimation dub/voice actors. I just felt like they did a better job of making the tense scenes more dramatic; the original just comes off as too campy, throughout the entire series. Also gokus voice drove me nuts, still does; If Funimation did a dub of Dragonball Super, with the same people that did Dragonball Z I would watch that over the sub in a heartbeat.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill. It's probably one of the only animes that sound better dubbed.

I wish Netflix UK had the dub available, I was looking forward to it for the upcoming rewatch. Does the US have it?

I'm not sure, I don't use Netlflix for anime :/

Nope, still sub-only, though I guess you could always take to the high seas if you really needed to.
>> ARTICLE
Aye aye
>> ARTICLE
I only watched the first three episodes dubbed, but I couldn't stand Senketsu's voice actor. It didn't sound right to me and I'm not even a subs person.
>> ARTICLE
I think that was sort of their intention when casting him. As the series goes along, he develops more of a personality, becoming a real character and not just a video game tutorial, which makes sense considering what he is.
>> ARTICLE
God really? Maybe I need to give it another try but I watched a bit and ryokos voice was driving me crazy. I love her, senketsu and nonons voices so much in Japanese though 
>> ARTICLE
Well, I thought it sounded more natural. The anime's artstyle reminded me of Egoraptor, and that's probably why I thought it sounded better dub.
>> ARTICLE
Even if you don't like the other voices, stay for Takarada
It's absolutely amazing 
>> ARTICLE
Nonons voice <33 she is my fav character!
>> ARTICLE
me too, her voice is perfect in japanese im scared to watch any other way haha
>> ARTICLE
honestly, its indescribably adorable
>> ARTICLE
I thought the dub did a great job finding similar sounding actors for Ryuko, Mako Nonon, Satsuki who kept the spirit of the characters well & were likeable.

Dub's script was the best part of KLK dub though, [some scenes were made so much funnier with the lines.](http://marshmallowgoop.tumblr.com/post/105779879057/a-few-reasons-the-kill-la-kill-english-dub-is)

/r/anime hates her, but she's really well-liked elsewhere on the Internet, particularly /a/. /a/ is like a 50/50 split between Kirinofags and people who aren't Kirinofags (that usually band together out of mutual hatred for Kirino and her fans).

> Although, why does the fanart have so much touchy/feely art of siblings? O_O

They aren't siblings. It's a fanart of Chitanda x Oreki's daughter and Mayaka x Satoshi's son. I like to think they are childhood friends because of their parents. My head canon for that fanart is actually much more extensive than for Hyouka itself... FeelsBadMan

Nope, Kouko is my waifu. I've said it before, but I enjoyed her character so much because I could relate to nearly everything about her, because my wife is EXACTLY like her. I mean, nearly in every way. 

It is a bit interesting, because outside of /r/anime there is a prevailing negative opinion towards Kouko and in favor of Linda.

Index
>> ARTICLE
........why?
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even know that Index wasn't well-liked until I got back here after watching the show. This sub is so weird about tsundere that hit the MC. Apparently it's okay when Chitoge Kirisaki kicks Raku's shit in for misbehaving, but when Index (or Taiga or Kirino, for that matter) does it, it's over the line.
>> ARTICLE
It's also okay for Biribiri to send attacks that would kill most people at the MC
>> ARTICLE
"No, dude, you don't get it. Touma can easily shake off Misaka's attacks, unlike with Index where her bites cause such crippling injuries that he ends up in the hospital every time she so much as nicks him." (Okay, he does, but that's for other reasons.)

Also, Kamachi said in an interview that out of all the characters in the series, Index is the one he would like to marry over all others. So that's something.

She's one of the primaries, it happens.  She becomes pretty badass later in the series, but still... I don't really see it either.  My favorite character from the entire series was Chouji because I identified with him being the guy with amazing potential that no one else seems to recognize.

That was very well done, and I hope to see more. That said, I feel like the Durarara!! OP is still decently good (probably about 8.5). It definitely comes off as much worse when compared to the Baccano! OP, which is sorta unfair as the Baccano! OP is probably the best OP ever (a solid 10). Just a quibble.
>> ARTICLE
I think Durarara!! skates by on having a very, very good song to work with, but it feels to me like a missed opportunity. If Brain's Base hadn't tried to ape Baccano! I think they could have done something really special with Celty rolling through ikebukuro block by block, passing each main character in turn. It's a pretty steady song, so I feel like it demands a contiguous line of action from beginning to end. 

At some point when I have WAY more time on my hands I may try to cut together a better version of the Durarara!! OP using footage from the show, but that's a project for another day.
>> ARTICLE
I know your comment is a month old but I also want to say that I would love to see a recut of Durarara!! OP as well! The song is amazing and I completely agree that it seems like a lost opportunity to do a beautiful style similar to Baccano! without trying to parrot it completely.
>> ARTICLE
I'd watch it. If you remember this convo when/if you make one, tag me.
>> ARTICLE
Please do! I'd love to see your version of a Durarara!! OP now that I know how much information can be conveyed in one. I never really thought about them before, just enjoyed the music and (what I thought was) mindless animation in time with the music. I'll pay more attention to them from now on.
>> ARTICLE
In this thread, OP comments about 2 OPs and request that other users make comments about whether OP's OPs comments are cool or not.
>> ARTICLE
I liked how you slowed down the frames of the OPs as you talked about them, but then when you would say something like "that cut wasn't well timed with the music" we couldn't see that, because the music had kept playing while the visuals had slowed down. 

I'm not sure how you could fix that, just a thing I noticed. Great video though!
>> ARTICLE
Well he just makes you want to watch the OPs again.
>> ARTICLE
Initially I had the audio from the clips play directly as I slowed it down, but it sounded terrible and choppy, so I decided to just let the songs keep running while I was speaking (which also covers a lot of small problems with my recording.)  Take it as a cop out, if you will, but I figured people would be willing to watch the OPs for themselves if they wanted to see exactly what I mean about any specific bit of timing.
>> ARTICLE
preemptive response to some feedback: I know my mic sucks, like, real bad. Soon as is feasible I'm planning to pick up a shure condenser mic.

Holy crap this is awesome, I saw the foreshadowing of "sleeping with the fishes" right after I watched the whole thing, but I never noticed the depth connections and framing. Too bad I can't use this as a related text for my English exams.
Audio was not optimal but I could understand you, maybe subtitles could be a quickfix until you decide to get a new mic.
>> ARTICLE
OP whats your top 10 ops?
>> ARTICLE
I'll do you one better. Or ten better. I'm planning to do a top 20 OPs of all time list at some point. Here's where it currently stands:

1.	Bleach  Asterisk (Orange Range)
2.	Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood  Again (Yui)
3.	Baccano!  Guns & Roses (Paradise Lunch)
4.	Paranoia Agent  Dream Island Obsessional Park (Susumu Hirasawa)
5.	Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou  Itsuka no, Ikutsuka no Kimi to no Sekai (fhna)
6.	Attack on Titan  Guren no Yumiya (Linked Horizon)
7.	Evangelion - Cruel Angels Thesis (Yoko Takahashi)
8.	Cowboy Bebop  Tank! (The Seatbelts)
9.	The World God Only Knows  The World God Only Knows (Elisa)
10.	Samurai Champloo  Battlecry (Nujabes)
11.	Trigun   H.T. (Tsuneo Imahori) 
12.	Jojos Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders  Stand Proud (Jin Hashimoto)
13.	Log Horizon  Database (Man with a Mission Ft. Takuma)
14.	Mirai Nikki Kuso Mesorogiwi (Yousei Teikoku)
15.	Dragon Ball Z  Cha-La Head-Cha-La (Hironobu Kageyama)
16.	Anohana - Aoi Shiori (Galileo Galilei)
17.	Sakamichi no Apollon  Sakamichi no Melody (YUKI)
18.	Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water  Blue Water (Miho Morikawa)
19.	Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo -  We Were Lovers (Jean Jaques Burnel)
20.	Space Brothers  Small World (Fujifabric)

Ranked based on how imaginative the visuals are, how well the music syncs up with them, how good the music is, how well they work as standalone music videos, how well they work as credits sequences, how well they suit their respective shows in terms of tone, and how much I personally like them.

Also I LOVE the Princess Jellyfish OP, so that could end up in there somewhere. Not sure what I'd cut though.
>> ARTICLE
Based on your taste, I recommend the Arakawa Under the Bridge and Welcome to the NHK's OPs (unless you're already familiar with them). Great taste though.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much any OP or [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IcFDwygw-o) involving Yakushimaru Etsuko is [inherently amazing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQtLfdryRlc)
>> ARTICLE
Both of those are on my runner up list, which is almost 20 items long itself. You've got pretty great taste yourself.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely a list I'm gonna revisit once school finishes. Im wondering why ( and a bit disappointed) you picked asterisk as number one the visuals are great but I rly dont like the song. What do you think about [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZlWSXx1l0c) and the first shipuuden op.

Any favorite end themes?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, Shin Sekai Yori's ED is great as well. So great that as soon as I remembered it I felt compelled to drop by and add this as a separate comment.
>> ARTICLE
[this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIoah1E5o4o) I sorta like the choppy song but its just a static image
>> ARTICLE
This is the actual ed https://vimeo.com/58154589
>> ARTICLE
Much better, 
>> ARTICLE
Top EDs aren't in any particular order, but off the top of my head, twenty I really love are:

Eden of the East - Futuristic Imagination (School Food Punishment)

Anohana - Secret Base (10 Years After Ver.) (Ai Kayano, Haruka Tomatsu, Saori Hayama)

Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou - My Sweet Shelter (Kana Hanazawa, Rina Sato, Hisako Kanemoto)

Spice and Wolf - The Wolf Whistling Song (Rocky Chack)

Punchline - Honey Honey Honey (Ayumikurikamaki)

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure - Roundabout (Yes) AND Walk like an Egyptian (The Bengals) (it's basically impossible to choose.)

Irresponsible Captain Tylor - Downtown Dance (Imai Chihiro)

Parasyte: The Maxim - It's the Right Time (Daichi Miura)

Now and Then, Here and There - Ko Mamori Uta (Yasuhara Reiko)

Mahoromatic - Mahoro de Mambo (Triomatic)

FLCL - Ride on Shooting Star (The Pillows)

Durarara!! - Trust Me (Yuya Matsushita) (Durarara beats Baccano by a wiiiiide margin here)

Princess Jellyfish - Realize You are Beautiful (Sambomaster)

Desert Punk - How to Draw A Sunabouzu (can't find the artist)

FMA Brotherhood - Uso (SID)

Magi The Labyrinth of Magic - Yubi Bouenkyou (Nogizaka46)

Welcome to the NHK! - Odoru Akachan Ningen (Kenji Ohtsuki & Fumihiko Kitsu)

Silver Spoon - Hello Especially (Sukima Switch)

Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo - You Won't See Me Coming (Jean-Jaques Burnel)

It would take me a while to properly curate the list if I ever did a top ED breakdown, and a lot of this would probably be supplanted by great stuff I'm not remembering right now.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for this. I'm more into endings myself. They tend to be more creative and I dont care if they relate to the story as much. FLCL (I just formally finished the series) and Anohana were the only ones I'd seen on this list and are some of my favorite anime songs. 
>> ARTICLE
How do you fare the Encouragement of Climbs' OPs?
>> ARTICLE
They're very cute, and I like the animation style they use in the second one a lot. Not my favorites by any stretch, but definitely well made.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter X Hunter has a pretty amazing collection of OPs. They definitely capture the spirit of adventure that runs through the show. That one in particular feels like a throwback to anime themes of old. As for Naruto, while I'm not personally a fan of the series, It does some pretty great things with its OPs (especially the one you mentioned. That's up there with fighting dreamers) and I think at some point it'll rate at least one episode of What's in an OP? Shippuden in particular has some absolutely incredible animation.

With that said, I feel like most Shounen OPs borrow a lot of ideas from shows that have come before - Specifically stuff like Saint Seiya, Fist of the North Star, Yu Yu Hakusho, and, of course, Dragon Ball. A lot of the same shots and concepts are recycled again and again in present-day shounen, albeit with hip hop and heavier rock tracks in place of the rock ballads that typically accompanied 80s/early 90s "fight of the week" shows. 

In my opinion, Dragon Ball Z marks the pinnacle of that style of OP (IE with lots of characters running intercut with  fights and explosions, and a final shot of the main cast posing together), which is why it takes a slot on the list over Naruto and Hunter X Hunter. Were I to put another one in, it would probably be [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l9V2ejc6OY), since, that's where I see a lot of the other common tropes culminating (like characters posing against abstract backgrounds, cut together with editing techniques taken from contemporary music videos). Not to discount what those shows do with their OPs - they're legitimately great - it's just they build on stuff that's come before, and it takes something really inventive and inspired to overcome those influences.

And that, in a roundabout way, explains the position of Asterisk. Its shots and editing choices are spectacularly original and clearly come from a strong creative vision. It has some of the same elements as other shounen anime - collages of characters gliding across abstract backgrounds and a shot with all of the characters posing together - but instead of building around those, it front-loads them in the first 15 seconds to acquaint you with the characters quickly and spends the rest of its running time playing around with really fun ideas. And, for what it's worth, even the more cliched material is pretty exceptional, using stark, bright, and bold color palettes for both clothing and backgrounds where most other shows use grains, gradients, or even color filters. It's confident enough in its imagery and composition to keep the visuals simple.  The last shot is an interesting take on the standard character portrait as well - the main characters are all there posing, but it's framed like a segmented album cover, rather than a group photo.

Asterisk has two motifs running throughout: film and pop art (and specifically how they intersect with street culture). The less abstract shots have certain affectations like blurred "fast forward" lines, motion blur, or even paint getting on the "lens" to make it seem as though they're actually being filmed, and a number of the edits in the middle (where the shots keep sliding upward) resemble film that's shifted out of alignment with a projector. The bold color choices of the more abstract shots borrow a lot from pop art, and a few shots even use screen tones. The constant presence of graffiti plays into that as well.

On top of that the editing is spectacular. Every moving object on screen syncs up with the rhythm, beat, or lyrics of the song in some way. Some of it's really inventive, like when the camera pans up over Ichijo's head and Rukia appears as soon as the singer gets to the second stanza, or when Kon gets stepped on and he screams in guitar feedback. I'm most impressed by how they managed to synchronize a slow, methodical sword fight perfectly with a relatively fast bit of rap. I'm amazed at how tight and precise every frame of it is.

But what really puts it ahead of the pack for me is how it uses its credits. In most OPs the credits are an afterthought at best - often they get in the way - but Asterisk makes fun use of pretty much every single one with word art and kinetic typography. I mean, they find a lot of fun ways just to spell "BLEACH," but credits show up as graffiti on walls, or inside boxes next to characters, or in the blank space between "film cels." even the more standard credits play into shot composition instead of just being layered overtop of an image in the least obtrusive spot possible. It's one of the few OPs out there that's not better creditless, which means on the merits of an opening credit sequence it must be superior.

It's not as laden with symbolism or meaning as, say, the OPs for FMA Brotherhood and Baccano!, but in terms of pure craftsmanship there are few that can match it, and the way it works with its credits gives it an edge over those that can.

Shit, I think I just wrote an episode by accident...

I do have some favourite EDs, but I'm going to separate that post from this for the sake of clarity.
>> ARTICLE
Sry for this late reply....(got finals)

Alright, I see your reasoning for that. As far as creativity, visuals and innovation it is great. I just never felt it represented the series well: someone wouldnt be able to see that and think "thats what bleach is about". There were little bits of symbolism and references (byakuya looking opposite the others, Ichigo and Rukia not seeing eye to eye, that part with Ichigo spinning) but we see the characters go from snowboarding gear to street wear then graffiti and sword fights. If someone wasnt in it for the visuals or drawn into them, theyd just be confused. It somewhat meshes with the first season but doesnt say much about the series as a whole which is what I like with an OP for that kind of series
>> ARTICLE
See, it represents what bleach was about in season 1 very well - hip teenagers withw counterculture edge fighting ghosts - and it doesn't include any of the nonsense from later seasons. I guess it's a matter of preference, but for me it encapsulates the only part of bleach that I liked.
>> ARTICLE
This is a very impressive list I like your taste!

My only question is why did you pick the 3rd op for jojo bizarre adventure over the other 3? Not that im really complaining cause there all good ops (personally my favorite is the first) im just curious why you picked that specific one.

Just looked up the Princess jellyfish op and I gotta say I loved it
>> ARTICLE
Jojo is probably the hardest slot on that list, and honestly, I've waffled between all three a lot. Sono Chi No Sadame is a great, old-school sort of japanese song, and the first part with the comic panels is one of my favourite bits out of any OP - as is the final breakdown with the panels of Jojo and Dio. BUT I like the transition from Jonathan to Jotaro in stand proud even more, I love how they echo back to it toward the end, and the timing of Star Platinum's punching flurry to the rapid drum beat is so damn perfect at the end. Plus, I'm a sucker for OPs that tell a story, and Stand Proud is particularly effective at conveying the epic road trip of Stardust Crusaders in a very short time frame. It also syncs with the music better, and on a personal level I prefer the heavier rock of Stand Proud. 
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic video but I feel like mystery is the whole point of Durarara so a non-telling opening isn't that surprising and more so fitting
>> ARTICLE
Mystery is a factor, sure, but that's true of baccano as well, and you only really understand all the clues in the OP after you've seen the series. There are also plenty of great mystery-driven shows like Eden of the East, Paranoia Agent, and Zankyou no Terror that fill their OPs with character details or - more often - symbolism. There isn't really anything to the Durarara!! OP underneath the surface details.

But that aside, there are other problems with the way they chose to present it. Baccano's OP is very carefully tuned to the content and tone of the show, and the way it's edited only really works with swing music. I think Durarara would have been better served by something more original.
>> ARTICLE
could you please upload to a alternative source? its not viewable in my country
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Dybex issued an automatic copyright claim on part of the Durarara OP through a bot and blocked it in most french-speaking countries (except, thankfully, canada) As well as the Netherlands and Switzerland. I'm looking into fair use exceptions to see if I can dispute it, but for now I recommend using Hola unblocker or a similar VPN service to get around the block.
>> ARTICLE
I tried using us and UK on hola unblocker, For some reason it didnt work though :/
>> ARTICLE
that is really weird. Any suggestions for a site to mirror it on?
>> ARTICLE
dailymotion or vimeo would work :)
>> ARTICLE
I've contested the copyright claim, so you should be able to view it for now. With luck it will stay up.
>> ARTICLE
now I can finally try the video :)
Edit: watched the video, made a comment on youtube, I am really looking forward to see your channel grow!
>> ARTICLE
I thoroughly enjoyed the video. You would get a cookie.
>> ARTICLE
Looking over the top 10 openings, my only suggestion would be - stretch. Include some older shows from the 80's and 90's too (beyond Nadia and Cowboy Bebop). Perhaps you could do an episode on localization comparing and contrasting something like Macross versus Robotech or Gatchaman versus Battle of the Planets. Or examine the evolution of a series and it's opening - like Green Jacket Lupin vs Red Jacket Lupin vs Pink Jacket Lupin vs Blue Jacket Lupin.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely want to look at a lot of older stuff - particularly to track the evolution of trends in OP direction. The localization comparison is also a really good idea - I could touch on yu yu hakusho, irresponsible captain tylor, and a bunch of other OPs that I love. Also might be a good place to squeeze in Ring a Bell from Tales of Vesperia...

As for my toplist, I would like to mix in more 80s/90s stuff, but as it stands it's sort of representative of my experience with the medium. I'm only 22, so a lot of the classics are still on my backlog, and with so may great shows coming out on crunchyroll year after year it's hard to keep up. Used to be I got by on DVDs purchased from Rightstuf and Sakura Media, but these days I've got something new to watch every day of the week. Trust me, I am trying to expand my knowledge of older stuff - I'm about to start a watch of Red Photon Zillion. Also, Lupin is VERY high on my to-do list. Love the movies I've seen so far.

Edit: I do wanna say, a lot of time I could have spent on older shows was devoted to the entirety of Ranma, so I don't always spend my time efficiently.

> I'm only 22, 

Oh you kids today with your streaming and your Hour After Broadcast simulcasts! Bah! In my day, if I wanted anime - I had to buy a 60 dollar VHS based solely on the cover art alone! With only two episodes each! 

:)

> I'm about to start a watch of Red Photon Zillion.

Holy crap - I haven't thought about Zillion since 1993 or so when I got it on close out laserdisc! I had no idea it had made the transition to DVD (or streaming). Wonder if it's as goofy awesome as it was back then.

> Also, Lupin is VERY high on my to-do list. Love the movies I've seen so far.

To be fair, as with any franchise that's been running for 40+ years, you'll have high points and low points. But I'm sure you'll enjoy the hell out of it.
>> ARTICLE
I thought this was very well done and well argued. Though I do definitely agree that the Baccano OP is the better one from a visual and filmatic point of view, I must admit that I like Uragiri as a song more than I do Guns and Roses. I may or may not have been singing along very loudly at the start of every episode.... 
>> ARTICLE
I burst out singing it multiple times over the course of editing this video, actually. I really love Uragiri no Yuyake, which is why I wish they could have put it to better use.
>> ARTICLE
Loved it and would love to see more. I like how well you break down each small section. Were you planning on sticking with OP's or expanding to other parts?
>> ARTICLE
The advantage of OPs is that they're bite sized, and it's a niche no one else is covering. I will probably branch out into fight scenes and EDS (though there's not as much to talk about in those, generally) but when it comes to whole anime I don't think I could ever do anything quite as in-depth as this - especially not in addition to the video game content I've got planned. I do want to do a breakdown at the end of every season though, just to go over all the stuff I watched. It will be a lot lighter, but I hope it keeps you guys entertained regardless.
>> ARTICLE
Wow for some reason I never connected that they were stealing chocolate.
>> ARTICLE
It's one of those OPs that flies by at a mile a minute, so I hardly blame you. I mean, call what is obviously a mailbox a vending machine TWICE in my video, and I was staring at those things for hours.
>> ARTICLE
wow this seriously is way too deep just like the video said in the description. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey, just wanted to drop by and say that this is fantastic. I certainly hope that you do more.
>> ARTICLE
Glad you liked it! I've actually got another one in the pipe for Thursday.
>> ARTICLE
I like your attention to detail OP! The writing and delivery's pretty solid too, along with the production quality. I loved some of the timing you used on the audio/video sequences!

The only thing that hurt your video, and I know you've acknowledged this, are the vocals. Perhaps re-doing this with the better quality mic would yield a wider response and achieve a larger audience. It's a shame to see good content potentially dismissed because of such a silly, albeit relevant, detail. Either way, I look forward to more :)
>> ARTICLE
Nicely done! I almost clicked out due to the audio quality (I've found that low-quality mics and poor narration tend to go hand in hand), but you're a perfectly fine speaker and the video was edited in a simplistic yet fitting way. I like your word choice and you spend an ordinate amount of time breaking each part down in a clear fashion (I haven't seen Baccano, but I understood what you meant completely.) 

Keep up the good work.

off-topic but don't live with female roommates, ever. That shit can ruin your life
>> ARTICLE
I lived with female roommates for 2 years in college. Definitely wasn't always easy, but my life is definitely not ruined.
>> ARTICLE
What's so bad about it? 
>> ARTICLE
Just don't fuck any of them and don't let them get any pets
>> ARTICLE
I mean it's fine as long as they take care of the pet right? They won't suddenly make you clean after it or walk it? 
>> ARTICLE
In my situation, my roommate wanted a pet and we reluctantly agreed as long as long as it was house trained. We were concerned over getting our security deposit back as we lived in a relatively new apartment, but she was a kind girl, so why not. Well she decided to get a dog that was anything but emotionally sound or house trained. It didn't like anyone but her and would defacate very often all over the place. Her inability and lack of will to resolve the situation created a *lot* of stress in what had been a good relationship.

Now I know this is completely anecdotal and that plenty of people live with girls and it works out fine, but I would recommend caution in situations like this because if someone gets a pet and that pet is detrimental to the wellbeing of the house at large, you are pretty much stuck with it once they quickly become attached to the pet. Then it immediately becomes an us vs. you mentality, which is very poisonous to relationships.

On the other hand, banging your roommates is a whole other story that I'll let you figure out for yourself.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, fair enough. I can see how it'd go wrong, but didn't think having opposite gender roommates in of itself was an issue. I wasn't home all that often during college so I didn't run into too many issues.

I like L, but I don't think I'd actually want to live with him:

* He can be...unnerving to guests. (Sometimes intentionally, but just as often, unintentionally.) Pretty soon, people would stop coming over.

* He'll eat all my snacks without asking. (And he won't gain so much as an ounce! Meanwhile, I so much as *look* at the things L eats, and I gain 5 lbs.)

* He's up all night on the computer. Which may be a problem depending on the size of the living space. 

* He's quite the hedonist, so he'd hog the TV or something like that. Or he'd be forever complaining that he's bored when there just aren't enough interesting cases to solve. 

* According to the L-File 15: One Day mini-manga, he goes to the bathroom with the door open. Oh, and he bathes in a washing machine! 

* Although he certainly has the money to pay for his share of rent and bills, L has no sense of time; he'll get so wrapped up in solving a case (or whatever) that he'll forget that it's due. 

* L doesn't seem like the type to help out with chores. And he may just do things the "wrong" way on purpose (for example, loading the dishwasher) just so he's never asked to do chores again and can go back to eating cakes and dicking around on the computer. 

* This one doesn't bother *me personally*, but it may bother other people I live with, or people that visit: L's habit of walking around barefoot and putting feet on the furniture. 

* If he wants information, he's not above using torture, or installing cameras *everywhere*, or handcuffing himself to you.

Geez...I *almost* feel bad for Light during the Yotsuba arc. Almost.

First, get an embedded controller like an arduino. Now get a bunch of IO expanders and ADCs to connect to it (or another arduino or two), because the built-in ones won't be enough. These will let you control the voltage of a few dozen wires pretty much freely.

Now take those two hard drives, tear off the controller board, and hook their head servo up to your ADCs. You can now drive a voltage through the head servo to move the head, and by vibrating it rapidly you can make sound. For the floppy drives, the floppy connector lets you control the motor pretty much directly by sending pulses down it, so hook those up to your IO expanders and start vibrating them as well.

Now you just need to take your desired music, turn it into some MIDI, and write a program for your arduino to toggle all those outputs at frequencies corresponding to the MIDI notes.
>> ARTICLE
I guess he uses some sort of software which allows him to freely control the movements and beeping of the drives, then assigns each sound to an appropriate note/tone and uses sound recognition or something to recreate the song with the closest assigned sounds.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure the program let's him play the midi files on the drives. That's preeety much it.

If this doesn't get renewed it would be another huge hit to anime as a whole. People who are more than average interested in anime can always use other services to watch the shows they like.

Question: Why does everyone hate on Naruto?
>> ARTICLE
Not sure. Ive seen many shallow arguments towards shitty writing, but Bleach or One Piece dont get nearly as much hate as Naruto and in my opinion, those are all on the same tier of shitty writing.
>> ARTICLE
Any show that gets serialized is shitty writing. People need to face that. The writer(s) have/has to quit caring about any end goal and just keep on adding rising and falling action without any climax.
>> ARTICLE
So you're saying it's written poorly? I admit there are some things that had me mad..like stupid naruto proclaiming that he has to rescue sasuke..like relax he hates you! lol
>> ARTICLE
Well, to be fair not entirely. Ive seen all three of the shows ive mentioned but if im going to be honest, I havent seen all of them. Bleach is the most infuriating out of the three. Naruto isnt so bad as ive said, to earn more hate than the other two and I think One Piece has fans that aggressively leap to defend it because its been running for so long. Maybe though, I just dont get it. I dont get these long series that never offer any closure, or at least take a few years to do so. I just dont dig that style, but im not saying no one ever could.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. You prefer anime series that are a little shorter with closure over the longer running ones such as Bleach and Naruto. I won't lie though I enjoyed Bleach a lot and when it ended the way it did..I almost felt like a part of me was missing lol..like what the hell am I going to do now? I hated this ending..etc.

It's uhhhhh... not over...

naruto blew it with extremely long bad filler for a year straight.

I think its the quality of the filler being the main problem.

>> ARTICLE
Right. But who cares? If you like a show, why does more content make it bad? Does having to wait for mainline story ruin it for you that bad? Personally when I like a show, I enjoy filler. Its an enjoyable change of pace from the main story and it expands on side characters.

I agree, and if people hate fillers, then they can just skip them. It's not like they are being forced to watch every single episode.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently no one else agrees with you on here besides me. Naruto was the first anime that I watched, and because of it I have been watching many other anime shows ever since.
>> ARTICLE
I won't lie..I hated a lot of the fillers..but many anime shows have fillers no? Naruto fillers were pretty annoying though.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece has some of the most brilliant writing available in shonen manga and anime. 
>> ARTICLE
~~No.~~

I lied, perhaps you're right. But could you link some of these moments? 
>> ARTICLE
Nami's arc. 
>> ARTICLE
Could you be a little more specific? What was amazing about it? Be sure to wrap it around spoiler tags.
>> ARTICLE
I tried explaining it but the best I could up with were the words "raw emotion". Here's a [link](http://www.mangareader.net/103-2142-1/one-piece/chapter-69.html) to the manga part of it instead. I think it gets the idea across pretty well even if you haven't read the rest of the manga and have no idea what's going on. 
>> ARTICLE
Why don't you just start at the beginning and work your way up. Her arc is around the 100 chapter mark I think. ( I don't know how to work spoilers or else I'd do it that way).

Also, the Whitebeard War Saga might be the best I've read from a Shonen Title in a very long time. Man tears, man tears.

R.I.F. Hiken R.I.F.
>> ARTICLE
I dont really want to commit to reading the manga because I've already seen a few arcs of the anime and didnt think it was very impressive. You dont have to if you dont want to, but for future reference instructions on how to use spoiler tags are on the sidebar of the subreddit!
>> ARTICLE
Nico Robin's back story stands out. 
>> ARTICLE
My (minor) dislike of Naruto actually stems mostly from Sakura, in addition to most of her characterization being focused on other people and having very little actual development herself(though there was some if I recall, I stopped watching pretty much once Sasuke left with Oorochi) but also the fact that as a main character, she didn't get any cool shit. There are minor characters that are so much cooler than her it isn't even funny. They develop cool abilities and grow and become better. Sakura gets......... nothing. And that pissed me off seeing as how she is one of the main characters, the original group. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't take it personally, it was just a bit of a tease.
>> ARTICLE
I also would like to understand the mass disliking. I don't like naruto but i don't like 99% of anime either so my personal feelings about it don't count. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it has to do with growing up and being ashamed of the crap you used to like.

Either that, or what I like to call "shounen syndrom", where every shonen manga (and consequently, the anime) that runs for a long time stops making sense at some point.

Or both.
>> ARTICLE
It's the fanbase. Ever been to a big anime convention?

They're the type of people you want to strangle.

And of course, they're the vocal minority.

The series is actually not bad. It's been quite good these past few years.
>> ARTICLE
Its the generic overly obsessive Naruto fan that scares even us. It gives anime as a whole a bad name and for that reason many of us dislike the show as a result though it really didn't do anything to deserve it. (Well I personally dislike shows that just never end because haha revenue but thats the main reason for most)
>> ARTICLE
Personally? I've got no problem with the show/manga itself. It's not my cup of tea, but I don't hate on the thing itself.

I hate Naruto's fanbase. It's petty, but there it is. I was in late middle school/early high school during the height of it's popularity, so I got to listen to a lot of teenage fangirling.
>> ARTICLE
It's stuff like this that makes me happy I only know like three other people that likes anime.
>> ARTICLE
I used to see this kid walking around in a black trench coat abpnd a Naruto headband in 85 degree tropical heat. I wasn't sure if I should laugh at him or respect his devotion...I swung more toward laughter.
>> ARTICLE
A kid used to do that at my school, too. He also got suspended for trying to make a real death note...
>> ARTICLE
I think Naruto himself killed the show for me.  To be fair, the premise of the show isn't bad, and I've been rolling around the idea of watching Shippuden (sp?) because I heard Naruto calms the eff down and acts more mature.  And actually wears darker clothes.
To me, Naruto is the antithesis of a ninja, and shallow as it may be, I just couldn't get used to a show starring a ninja running around in a traffic-cone orange jumpsuit yelling 'BELIEVE IT!!' all the time.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of wild anime, but considering its subject matter, I think Naruto is a little *too* wild.
>> ARTICLE
Well when I say Naruto I mean the series as a whole. Shippuden is actually so much better, more mature, darker too.
>> ARTICLE
The reason you hate the show is the English dub of the anime. In the manga he says dattebayo after nearly everything to end his statements. This doesn't translate well to English because unlike Japanese, English does not have words to end a thought with. In English this would be much more like having a lisp or having an unusual pronunciation of a certain sound, not the ear grating BELIEVE IT thrown on to EVERYTHING. Further Naruto right around episode 200 is completely filler since it was catching up with the manga so fast.

Shippuden is a break from this and actually follows the manga and from what I remember is pretty good. There is still some filler, but so long as you just skip those episodes it is a decent show.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a fan of the show. Shippuden is faaaaaar better than regular imo. He does act much more mature, as do the rest of the characters, which makes sense since they're in their late teens.  Give it a shot.
>> ARTICLE
It gets way better after shipuuden.

>To me, Naruto is the antithesis of a ninja, and shallow as it may be, I just couldn't get used to a show starring a ninja running around in a traffic-cone orange jumpsuit

That's kind of intentional. It would be a far less entertaining show if he was actually GOOD at the thing that is his dream.
>> ARTICLE
There's being bad at you job and there's being so terrible you need to find another line of work.
>> ARTICLE
That's the point. He was a pathetic piece of shit at first who couldn't even do a basic jutsu. Then he became a really powerful ninja because he didn't give up and he had friends supporting him.
>> ARTICLE
I was pretty upset when they lost the TTGL dubbed. It was a good series to play in the background while I did misc stuff. 

It was nice not having the simple interface vs the clicking around required for many streaming sites/hulu.
>> ARTICLE
GitS is still available on my netflix, multiple movies and series. What area are you in.. Maybe it's regional? Maybe mine will be gone soon O_O
>> ARTICLE
Are they saved to your que?  I had Perfect Blue in mine for months after it was pulled and I could still watch it too.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like that's a glitch in the Netflix system. Better not delete it from your queue. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah, they actually have a relatively large selection, this probably is about 1/4th of their total library of decent shows though
>> ARTICLE
Not nearly as large as they had at the first of the year, when there were a couple hundred different selections.  Just added it up, and now it's down to 69 multi-episode series and 11 movies.  
  
Meanwhile, Hulu and Crunchyroll have been seriously beefing up their selections.  Plus Manga Entertainment and Funimation have added their own streaming channels in the past year as well (the former free, the latter subscription-based).  So through my Roku box there's plenty of other alternatives.
>> ARTICLE
There's a reason why Hulu and CrunchyRoll have more. Hulu and CrunchyRoll don't have to wait till an anime has been translated and put onto DVDs Netflix does.
>> ARTICLE
any links for  the manga  and funamtion stuff?
>> ARTICLE
The funimation one offers a lot without sub as well. For example, fma: brotherhood is no subscription subs and subscription dubs.
>> ARTICLE
hulu is really awesome even without a plus account the only problem they have is they don't always license every season of a show or in some cases not even the whole first season, they did this with rosario plus vampire and it pissed me off because i really want to watch it   
>> ARTICLE
I used too feel that Hulu did a good job...... but I'm a little disappointed with it atm. Ads for paying subscribers.... kinda kills it for me.
>> ARTICLE
I really HATE hulu... they have a million ads, if I wanted ads I would just watch stuff on TV. The really annoying part is that my fiancee has a hulu plus account and it still plays ads....... you pay for it and it plays ads? what the shit?
>> ARTICLE
Just like cable really.
>> ARTICLE
Unless you really love panties, the show isn't worth it. The manga's better at handling the darker action portions IMHO.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I even *like* panties, but I can barely tolerate the show. The characters are so shallow and *average* I could die.
>> ARTICLE
I got three episodes into the anime and dropped it.  Something convinced me to try the manga and I read it all (first series) within a week.  The animation felt awkward and things just didn't feel right.  Maybe it's just me that disliked it for those reasons?
>> ARTICLE
That fight sequence only took 36 seconds. Wooooo
>> ARTICLE
The Netflix selection is what pulled me into anime, sad to see it go.
Especially Eden of the East, that was a surprise good anime. Something that ALL my old roommates and myself enjoyed, not just one of us.
>> ARTICLE
shuffle was my first anime ever and now netflix remove it this makes me sad face 
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann has been removed from all methods of legal streaming (Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube) as well as the American iTunes for about a month now. No explanation.
>> ARTICLE
Bandai North America shut down, right? That's probably why.
>> ARTICLE
That explains so much.
>> ARTICLE
I bet Bandai let the rights to it lapse.
>> ARTICLE
Why would they pull it from iTunes where you have to pay? 

Did they also pull the DVD sets too? 
>> ARTICLE
I don't use it my self but Ive heard crunchyroll is pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
Totally worth it. I've had an account since 2007, when they had no paid account. The selection has exploded over the past 5 years. Premium is only 6.95 a month.
>> ARTICLE
Netflix needs to seriously step its game up in the coming future.  It's all well and good to have a reasonable selection as it does now, but new titles are rarely posted and seasons aren't always completed.  I swear half my sub money is going to an intern whose only job is to find new cover images for the same series that have been available for the last three years.
If Netflix keeps axing its lineup and not adding much of anything, I'm going elsewhere.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, how much do some of these series cost Netflix in terms of licensing?
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, Netflix shot itself in the foot when they decided tv shows are more important than movies.
>> ARTICLE
That might be your opinion, but the market as a whole has shown it is *much* more interested in TV than it is in movies.
>> ARTICLE
But, looking at this objectively, people who now use Netflix for movies don't have a good selection due to money being funneled into licensing for tv shows. I think a partnership (not a merger or buyout, we need them to keep each other in check) and refocusing Hulu on tv content (the movies suck, why try) and Netflix back to movies, will be beneficial to not just the customers (better overall content, without risk of overlap), but also the companies (guaranteed consumer base, won't step on each other's toes). Just my $0.02.
>> ARTICLE
This is why I like owning my anime.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. It's not like someone can walk into your room and go "The license for these anime have expired. I'm afraid I'll have to take these from you."
>> ARTICLE
Well I can only hope that they pick a new line up soon. Also would you mind posting a link to the source?
>> ARTICLE
[Link to source](http://instantwatcher.com/titles/expiring), although I first noticed when I was going through my "recently watched" queue on my Roku box and noticed "Expiring on XXX" on the lower-righthand-corner of several shows earlier today.
>> ARTICLE
Well for whatever reason the dates don't appear on Xbox, iPad, or computer when I go on Netflix but I don't doubt it. Truly upsetting and I hope they are just dropping it so they can get newer shows or more popular ones, but we will find out soon enough I suppose
>> ARTICLE
they might re-new it. I remember watching Doctor Who and netflix saying that it was going to be gone at the beggining of November. But Doctor Who is still on netflix to this day and it never was dropped.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, Doctor Who was gone for a little while, but then they brought it back, and with a newer series.
>> ARTICLE
Well that sucks guys I already lack these on Canada Netflix.
>> ARTICLE
And that's why I got Cruncyroll 
>> ARTICLE
There is no way I'm finishing Initial D in time.

>> ARTICLE
" This channel is not available in your country. "

Great, just great.
>> ARTICLE
Even better, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
remember to upvote comments that provide useful accurate information!
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I wish Canadian Netflix had this kind of selection.
>> ARTICLE
Appreciate the heads-up.

Guess I should get around to knocking out some of those titles this weekend.

What's good and bad about this for me:

On one hand, I'll have a stronger excuse to pick up titles that I enjoyed via Netflix, on DVD/Blu-Ray.

Then again, now I need to divvy up my monthly "Hobby" budget towards this purchases. And I thought the only anime I was going to buy towards the end of the year would be "Garden of Sinners."
>> ARTICLE
If you do get "Garden of Sinners", spring for the blu rays~
>> ARTICLE
As amazing as it is, the bluray set is ridiculously overpriced.
>> ARTICLE
Don't pull my leg man...They're re-releasing the Blu-ray? Aniplex has a love/hate relationship with me. The titles they bring are top notch and are must haves for my collection but the prices destroy my wallet. Sure it's not the prices you pay in Japan but damn it's high for the average American Anime consumer.

EDIT: If you have any proof that they're re-releasing the Blu-rays, please let me know so I can cancel my preorder!
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen news of a re-release on DVD. The only Blu-ray I know of remains the limited release JP box set which is going for close to/around a thousand atm.
>> ARTICLE
But Brotherhood was never finished on there!! D:
>> ARTICLE
there are other sites. Need one? 
>> ARTICLE
Yes. But I very much like the dubbed. . .
>> ARTICLE
The entire series is on Funimation's website
>> ARTICLE
Wtf why get rid of anime
>> ARTICLE
License deal ends, there is still the possibility they will renew the contract as far as I know, but the contract they signed before stated they have the right to stream the shows until this date, and at that date they no longer have the rights to do so, so a new contract will need to be made or the old one will have to be renewed for them to continue to be able to legally stream the show.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks i hope they renew
>> ARTICLE
As I've been reading the comments, I've noticed a lot of hate going to Netflix for dropping or not renewing the licenses for these shows. What many of you are missing is that many of the publishers, namely FUNimation, either have their own streaming option or are developing one. For an outlet like Netflix to license the streaming of a series they have to get a contract with the publisher, so its on both parties if a series disappears and not just Netflix. FUNimation has really been pushing their own streaming service with much their content and simulcast shows available for free with ads or with subscription.
>> ARTICLE
Damn. I was hoping to watch Trigun on Netflix some time. Of course I don't even have time for it now.

Sheesh. Guess I'm going back to torrents.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure why Netflix waits until after the licenses expire to seek permissions again. The same thing happened to Stargate SG-1, and I was halfway through the series when they dropped it goddamnit!

But it looks like Mushi-shi is unaffected, and that's the only one I'm watching now. Still, boo at Netflix.
>> ARTICLE
I def got the vibe from comic con that funimation was gonna break ties with netflix to promote their own subscription app. 
>> ARTICLE
Funimation is worth paying for a sub account, although I would keep Netflix, can't get enough of Psych and they do still have some decent movies for streaming. (Just watched Thankskilling last night)
>> ARTICLE
This is why I'm not even mad I got rid of Netflix when the prices jumped and flixter happened.The really bad thing is if they had stayed with there prices for an entire year I would have gladly paid the price of 2 subscriptions but they revamped in Dec then again in Sept now I have hulu+ and crunchyroll to keep me busy.I think I read somewhere that the HBO shows are leaving Netflix too
>> ARTICLE
This is a perfect example of why piracy exists, its because of stuff like this. Stop doing this and piracy might go away.
>> ARTICLE
It won't go away, ever. But I do agree make it easy enough and people will happily pay. I know that is the reason I have Netflix in the first place, it was getting really expensive buying dvd's and going to the movies just to find I wasted my money. Netflix is easy to deal with, I don't have to find places to store all the damn movies I want to watch, and it's cheap.
>> ARTICLE
How much anime is on Amazon Prime Video? They're toying with the idea of a $7 a month subscription like Netflix. I found sticking to one service and one alone is going to limit your choices.

I wanted to watch The Avengers. It was only available on Vudu not Netflix.
>> ARTICLE
I sometimes wonder if I've fallen into a time machine when people complain about the cost of Netflix streaming. A month's subscription is about the same as it used to cost to rent a couple DVD's. And not only did my local stores not carry hardly any anime series, what they had was often enough missing volumes. Netflix was great doing just DVD's by mail, and they're even better now with streaming IMO.

And yeah piracy isn't going away, but when they make it so easy to browse and instantly watch shit, the convenience factor can overwhelm folks like me. An $8 convenience charge that actually goes (in some way) to support the content producers is fine by me. Plus, the bandwidth usage pisses Comcast off, and that is fucking priceless.
>> ARTICLE
But but but...I just discovered Morbito....and I really like it...
>> ARTICLE
I've got the Moribito 8-dvd thingy. Want to maybe trade anime?
>> ARTICLE
My collection was stolen :(.  Thanks for the offer though :D!  I'll try to wrap it all up this weekend
>> ARTICLE
Watch it ASAP. I enjoyed that series, too. One of the only series with a female lead that isn't whored up.
>> ARTICLE
She is, however, a certified badass. I mean, she murders someone *with a rock*.
>> ARTICLE
She was badass, but it was a series that dragged a bit at the end.
>> ARTICLE
OMG yes.  Okay, seriously that is so dang true.  She's an actual woman who is a hero and not some doofy slut with gigantic knockers. It's incredibly refreshing.  Would love to see more series like that...
>> ARTICLE
WTF we need to do something about this or I'm taking my busniess to HULU
>> ARTICLE
you should try hulu out already they have all kinds of free stuff on there 
>> ARTICLE
It's not like you *have* to choose one or the other.  You're allowed to watch both, as well as all the other multiple streaming services out there that carry anime (free or otherwise).
>> ARTICLE
I'm paying for Hulu and netflix but then again I share my accounts with my family.
>> ARTICLE
I'm looking at my queue and while I do see the expiration notice on Sengoku Basara, Black Butler and Eden of the East, I don't see a notice on Ah! My Goddess or D Gray Man.  You sure about those last two?  I've been planning to check out D Gray Man after I finish a couple of other things.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like they're getting rid of the second seasons of each, if I read the info correctly.  [Link here](http://instantwatcher.com/titles/expiring) for all the exhaustive details.
>> ARTICLE
Meh. For a while it was really good, but with the overall lack of good content and the removing of the xbox party feature, i might consider not renewing. Once i finish the 6th season of psych of course. 
>> ARTICLE
Woah woah woah ain't no one taking my initial d

>> ARTICLE
all the ones I would have watched are on that list, to bad netflix Canada didnt have any of those to begin with. there is like 15 titles and only a couple are good.
>> ARTICLE
Are all of these good? I've only watched Ah! My Goddess, Corpse Princess, and Fullmeal Alchemist: Brotherhood.

>> ARTICLE
Of the ones I've seen from this list, I would particularly recommend:

* Baccano

* Eden of the East

* Full Metal Panic

* Spice and Wolf
>> ARTICLE
Choose Eden of the East. It's pretty good and a shorter series so you could watch it in time.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I wish Crunchyroll had more titles. I used that stuff way back in middle school, and it was awesome.

I definitely respect the entire lets-not-be-pirates attitude they've taken, but it feels like they only have a few current series and a handful of older series available, even for people with paid subscriptions :(
>> ARTICLE
No Trigun or Shinchan!? D: Looks like I have to hole myself up for the week.
>> ARTICLE
I just went on a checked all of these, none of them have expiration dates. Either it was an oops or they renewed already.
>> ARTICLE
I remember a while back, they took a SHITTON of shows off, and then after a while in the desert they started adding shows they never had before. I'm really really REALLY hoping that's what they're gonna do this time.
>> ARTICLE
This is why I watch most, next to all, current Anime on Crunchyroll. The app alone sold the paid service to me.

Edit: accidently "to me".
>> ARTICLE
I used to watch my anime from Netflix, but now I prefer Crunchyroll, Funimation or even Hulu. They have a way better selection.

The only things I watch on Netflix anymore is How It's Made and The Walking Dead.

Also, anyone needing a trial for Crunchyroll Premium, I think I have a couple of Month trials.
>> ARTICLE
:O why AH! my goddess? and FMA? and Sekirei? Baccano?!
>> ARTICLE
that's damn near everything they have.

and they don't even have brotherhood in it's entirety.
>> ARTICLE
WHY DID THEY HAVE TO TAKE MY RUMBLE!!!
>> ARTICLE
As one of those obnoxious bastards who prefer to only watch it in Japango, I give this a hearty "meh."
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was so excited when I saw how much anime they had . . . and then realized it was all dubbed. So much disappointment. :(
>> ARTICLE
Didn't Bleach disappear a while back? I'm definitely making the switch to Hulu Plus...
>> ARTICLE
Crunchy roll has bleach also.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend Crunchyroll as well. With adblock, it's practically continuous. Hulu has better quality, though.
>> ARTICLE
Not if you have a crunchyroll subscription. Haven't regretted grabbing that discounted 12-month subscription at all though too bad it was all access, it's wasted on me because I could care less about their dramas. 
>> ARTICLE
With a subscription you can stream in 1080p if quality is important to you (and the buffering speed is pretty good too).
>> ARTICLE
Ah, if only my internet didn't suck.
>> ARTICLE
If only Hulu plus didn't have ads I would pay for it.  They still do right?

If you use xbox, there is a way to [skip them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMIdJyGvzp0).

I'm so proud I discovered this on my own.

I haven't watched any anime on Netflix because, as far as I know, they're all English dubbed. Is there a way to watch them subtitled?

I only checked the first four titles on the list to see if the language option was English dub-only, but isn't it possible these titles are going down so they can make them available in both English and Japanese?

Pretty sure Morbito has been gone for at least a few weeks.  I saw it on their anime selection and added it to my queue with the intent to watch it when I had some time off from work, but then it disappeared and I couldn't find it via search.  
>> ARTICLE
It's not, I just watched an episode last night!
>> ARTICLE
Well, that settles it.  Not going to renew after the free trial is up.
>> ARTICLE
If you're just in it for the anime, there really isn't a point to Netflix. The selection isn't that great and you can watch so many existing series on different websites.

I'm not talking about the ones we can't talk about, either. I'm talking about sites like Funimation's website. Also, these American companies had series up on youtube as well. So not only can you watch anime for free, but you can do so legally.
>> ARTICLE
Damn Netflix, so disappointing. Guess they don't care about the anime fans.
>> ARTICLE
This is why I actually still get DVDs/BDs from Netflix. I would love to do streaming instead, but their selection is terrible (I mostly watch movies though). 99% of the stuff in my DVD queue isn't available for streaming. Now that I know that their anime section isn't so hot anymore either.

Some of these I've watched and some I hope to watch. Luckily nothing I'm watching now is currently on this list.

Most likely netflix dropped those particular series because of licensing fees. If no one watches(or not many people), those fees stack up.

They better not take off Samurai Champloo
>> ARTICLE
:'(  How disapointing.  Why?  I'm seriously consider cancelling my subscription then.
>> ARTICLE
School Rumble's departure really depresses me. I've shown it to multiple firends through Netflix and it got them all into anime, and now it will be even harder for anyone to watch(let alone know of it's existence) School Rumble considering it doesn't seem all too popular, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking seriously?! The anime was pretty much the only reason I use Netflix, and now most of my Instant Queue is going to disappear before I can finish it... Fuck finals week and fuck Netflix... 
>> ARTICLE
I guess it's good I watched most of what I wanted on there the last few months. 

Hulu is annoying because adds. 

I frequent Crunchyroll, but they are still missing some stuff. Pretty solid library,  but yeah lacking some of the stuff Netflix/Hulu had.

I personally won't use Netflix again unless they bring it back.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure many of these will be re-licensed. Just because their license is coming to an end doesn't mean they'll be gone, it just means Netflix has the option to renew them. Netflix will most likely not renew shows based on a low watch-to-license-cost ratio, at least that's what would make the most sense (why pay for licenses to shows that people aren't watching unless they're stupidly cheap to license?). 

Hopefully this will actually open up possibilities for newer licenses to be acquired, although I wouldn't hold my breath. Most likely they'll spend a lot of the newly acquired license budget on *Big Summer Blockbuster 3* and *Michael Bay's Explosionfest 6*. -_-
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, there's no way I can finish any, and that sucks.
>> ARTICLE
Gah! I started corpse princess but put off finishing the series....for doctor who. Welp! Works slow might as well finish. 
>> ARTICLE
Ever since getting netflix their anime selection has been disappointing. What is sad because for this kind of streaming service it would benefit from a large selection since lot of people who would be streaming have a good chance of have been looking for good sources of anime. 

More and more netflix is becoming B C and D movies the kind that rip off of big name ones making low quality direct to dvd versions or out of date movies that are 40 50 60 years old. I have to wonder if someone was to eliminate all these type movies form their catalog how many would actually be left.
>> ARTICLE
I've talked to netflix about this issue before. If it says its expiring it just means all the paperwork for renewal hasn't gone through yet. 99% of the time they are renewed and the paperwork goes through so they are never pulled. 
>> ARTICLE
So I should get Hulu? :(
>> ARTICLE
If Netflix wants to get out of DVDs and become a streaming service, they're going to have to get their streaming catalog up to snuff.

isn't crunchyroll on PS3?

Fuck, I started EP1 of Moribito

Excuse me while i cry for you poor non UK/Australian anime memberships. I looks at this list and compare it to whats on the horrifically small selection we have in the UK. Well ain't that interesting, 5 of the titles here are on my Netflix. 5...
>> ARTICLE
seems like the general consensus is that Netflix is really dropping the ball here. It's still worth my money and I hope they can renew their licenses, but I remember how good it was back in 2008. They had a *lot* on there, including Disney shows like Kim Possible.

Netflix recently launched in Sweden, and I was rather disappointed that there wasn't any anime to be watched. :(
>> ARTICLE
Thankfully everything being removed I either don't care about or have already watched! Currently watching Samurai Champloo, so I'm happy
>> ARTICLE
So this doesn't apply to UK? Even if it did I wouldn't care, not much choice and what it does have isn't even HD :/
>> ARTICLE
My guess is their contract to use the titles is over and they don't want to renew it. Maybe they don't get enough traffic to warrant the renewal for the price they are asking.
>> ARTICLE
This is why I hate netflix. 
>> ARTICLE
"Spice and Wolf not available to watch instantly." WTF
>> ARTICLE
Half of those aren't even there anymore anyways. Not that i can find, anyways. But i literally just payed for my subscription so i can watch some anime. Fuck. This is stupid.
>> ARTICLE
Only Netflix and Crunchyroll works on my country. Both have subpar anime collection, and I'm paying both! I'm screwed, it seems.

Or I need to jump on a boat and start pillaging series at unnofficial outlets. It's surely cheaper. :/
>> ARTICLE
Guess it's time for Hulu Plus...
>> ARTICLE
Still pissed they got rid of gurren lagann...WHO IN THE HELL DO THEY THINK THEY ARE!!!

>> ARTICLE
I've noticed this on several of the series of been watching lately. Trying to power through Shin-Chan.. I need the laughs when I come home from work every day ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Netflix is like the only place where I watch Anime. And most of the ones listed, I've seen/watching... But I don't see Sgt. Frog... So I can still watch that.. But all the others will be gone... 
>> ARTICLE
If you don't watch it streamed from other anime site. I would suggest Hulu their selection is a lot better. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm on Crunchyroll. Fucking love it. Make the switch if you into it for the anime, Netflix was limited from the start as it is. 
>> ARTICLE
Netflix is not available in my country....so technically I got nothing to lose?
>> ARTICLE
I think they used to have Code Geass as well. Such a shame.
>> ARTICLE
ugh why the heck is sekirei going away faaaak.
>> ARTICLE
Well this is bullshit. The only other shows I watch on Netflix are Doctor Who and Star Trek.
>> ARTICLE
I would miss the slayers series most of all.

But outside of that. Normally watch Doctor Who, The IT Crowd or any random movie when in the mood for it 
>> ARTICLE
Based on what I've read, I wonder why people watch stuff there at all.
>> ARTICLE
You guys do no Funimation has there own subscription service for anime its like 8$ a month with unlimited anime available on the computer, tablets, Roku, n samsung hdtvs. I left netflix for that 
>> ARTICLE
Goddamnit, I wanted to work my way through all of Slayers! I haven't even finished the first season!
>> ARTICLE
The only two shows Im watching on netflix are Samurai Champloo and Needless, so it seems I'll be getting out of this alive...
>> ARTICLE
How am I gonna watch some of those now :(
>> ARTICLE
NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!
>> ARTICLE
Nooooooo... This ruins my life.
>> ARTICLE
Noooooo several of those were in my instant queue. :(
>> ARTICLE
Don't see X'amd on list, breathe a sigh of relief.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is an entire Selection I haven't seen or watched but was planning to, really hope they re-new it soon.


>> ARTICLE
They added Robotech though...
>> ARTICLE
To late. :(
I love FMA
>> ARTICLE
Birdy... :( I hardly knew ye.
>> ARTICLE
Was there ever an explanation given?
>> ARTICLE
We still have Black Butler. 
>> ARTICLE
their shows are so bad i don't even mind. the dubbing ruins the genre
>> ARTICLE
Moribito is the exception. I'm frankly surprised someone cleared it for dubbing.
>> ARTICLE
Why aren't there options for subs like the other Japanese movies on netflix?  Licensing?  
>> ARTICLE
It seems like ever 6-12 months we get a thread like this. Licenses tend to expire and within a week or two most of the titles are back on streaming. 
>> ARTICLE
And then it'll have Miyazaki movies and Higurashi?!

I've been waiting forever!
>> ARTICLE
is this an advertisement
>> ARTICLE
OH GOD WHAT WILL I DO WITHOUT SHITTY DUBS
>> ARTICLE
Not watch shitty subs.
>> ARTICLE
Netflix sucks...hard
>> ARTICLE
Fuck you Netflix. This is why I don't pay for your services. I just piggyback off my friends accounts.
>> ARTICLE
Does anybody know if Netflix is planning on ever getting some Funimation shows?
>> ARTICLE
There are some on there right now (though quite a few are being pulled soon). I'm not sure if it's available in countries other than the US, but Funimation's Youtube Channel has a good selection of series on there to watch free.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of that list (all of it?) is Funimation, and... well...

http://www.funimation.com/subscribe

$8/mo.  From their perspective, they're losing customers by offering shows through Netflix.
>> ARTICLE
Guess it's time to finish the two shows left on that list that I haven't watched.
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll will be coming to 360 for those of you that watch Netflix on your console so that should help get your fix. Plus its not a guarantee that they will be gone, many series and movies that I have noticed were going to expire get renewed. It depends on their contract with the publisher I guess.

>> ARTICLE
I can't wait for that!
>> ARTICLE
I was happy when CR came to the PS3. That gets more used than Netflix for anime.
>> ARTICLE
I don't have a ps3, so I'm looking forward to CR coming to Xbox. If it has smartglass support that will even be better!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, its sucks. I actually cancelled my Netflix account when, after doing the math, I figured out that every one of the shows Netflix has was on either Hulu or Crunchy. Now with this happening (and now that Funi is on Roku), I'll never go back to Netflix.
